So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training and help with supplies, but the whole thing just seemed incredibly unnecessary. I think you guys are right about the evacuation needs to be better organized than this mess we're dealing with today (with the exception being that the fire department is relatively small).
