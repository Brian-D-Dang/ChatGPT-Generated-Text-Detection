Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the only spaces that aren't full are those reserved or marked as something else, like a loading zone. What you're proposing is just more work and money to implement while doing nothing useful (to me anyway). Also if someone takes these spaces they will likely get ticketed so there goes their pride
