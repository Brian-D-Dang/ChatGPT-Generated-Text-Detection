First of all, I want to first express how happy I am with this subreddit. It has always been a hub for civilized discussion on complicated and difficult topics. I don't know if it's possible, but I would love it if the mods can start a subreddit called "Culture" or something like that so we can have a more civilized discussion in a different subreddit. I don't want to see a subreddit for that become as toxic as other subs have become. I also want to apologize for my ignorance. I never knew about the history of Black people in America and I feel ashamed for it. I've been doing my best to learn as much as I can. I understand that it's incredibly hard to change decades of historical damage. But I still believe that we should do our best to be more inclusive of everyone. I don't think that's too much to ask. We're all people. I don't want to see a world where people are hated for the color of their skin. I want to see a world where everyone is treated with respect. It's just a simple idea. I've been trying to be more open-minded. I know it's not going to be easy, but I feel like it's something we should all strive for. I just hope that this subreddit can be a place where people can talk about these issues without feeling like their being attacked. I really hope we can all have a more civilized discussion. Just a thought. I'm sure I'm not the only person who feels this way. EDIT: I know that some people might think that I'm a White supremacist or something, but I'm not. I'm just a guy who wants to see a more civilized world. I don't hate anyone because of their skin color or their religion. I'm just a guy who wants to see a more civilized world. MarcusWasWrong 2 points3 points4 points 4 years ago Thanks for the input, and I hope you continue to read and participate here. I've edited your post a little to remove some of the more inflammatory language, but I think that the heart of what you were trying to say is still there. Black people are not the only people to have been subjected to slavery and racial oppression. So are Jews, Arabs, indigenous peoples, and others, but I'm not sure we're at a point where we can make a general statement about how the world would be a better place if we could do this or that to them. mattspare 7 points8 points9 points 4 years ago I don't think that we're in a position to make general statements about the world. But I think that we can make some general statements about how people have been treated in the past. We've been oppressed throughout our history. I don't think that makes us "the oppressed" but it doesn't change the fact that it happened. If you want to try and make a general statement about the world, you should try making a general statement about humanity. Are we the ones who think that we should learn about our history? Or do we just want to bury our heads in the sand and pretend that nothing bad ever happened? I think that we're the ones who want to learn about our history. I've been reading up on Black history as well as reading about slavery and how it was bad for everyone who was involved. I'm not the kind of person who doesn't want to learn about history. I want to learn about it. But I think that we should be the ones who make the general statements. I don't think we should be saying "we're the ones who were oppressed" or "we're the ones who were forced to work." It should be "we were the ones who were oppressed." I think we should be the ones who make the general statements. The kind of world that I want to see is a world where everyone is treated with respect. I don't think it's asking too much. I don't think it's too much to ask for people to learn about each other's histories. I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm preaching. I just feel like we can do better. My deepest apologies if I upset anyone with my previous post. I do not want to offend anyone, or create any unnecessary drama. I was just trying to express how I felt about things. My goal was to try to change some people's perspectives. I just wanted to express
