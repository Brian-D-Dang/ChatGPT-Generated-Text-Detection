It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing I wonder if anyone has ever really thought through? Will governments allow this empire to be created without crushing it first? And what happens should we mount an insurrection against their rule in the name of liberty or freedom from tyranny (or something like that)? Will they simply crush us underfoot with tanks and bombs before trying to convert our entire world into a welfare state for its citizens? Or will those same leaders have no choice but abandon their Chineseness (and throw Americans under the bus) to survive themselves?
