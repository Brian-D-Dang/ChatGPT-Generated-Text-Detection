Edit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) This isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a little bit sadistic. Part of the joy is knowing that you will eat what they kill, even if its a sick old animal or someones pet with no use anymore. Its not like you are feeding the poor and starving people in need as there's plenty to go around for everyone.. Wouldn't have been caught otherwise....that stupid kid was probably looking down when he walked right into his path...he should've just kept walking instead of being so careless! He obviously didn't care enough to avoid him either way though since he ran him over!
