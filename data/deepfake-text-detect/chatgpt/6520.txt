The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. Sometimes you can feel a little schemy to get rid of your facial features, but that is not the only reason why it's not your fault. If you were born with asymmetrical facial features you might not be able to change those features easily.
