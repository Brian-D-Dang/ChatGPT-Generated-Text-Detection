I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for stealing 100 and being charged with armed robbery, they shouldn't be able maybe that's what I'm saying? Also there are many people locked up due mental health issues or addiction problems even though it wasn't something illegal like drugs but having an issue which causes you not normal behavior such as loud talking etc... also these same types programs could help them get treatment because some prisons don"T offer any type abuse counseling! Also we can give more funding towards drug rehab facilities since those seem harder too find than this program!!
