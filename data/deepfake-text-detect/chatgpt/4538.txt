To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For this reason alone it is acceptable to me. Some people might say why should they be able to marry their daddy or brother? What about the children of such marriages? The first argument is a bit obvious - if you want to get married then make sure your partner isn't someone's father or uncle! But what does that mean for the kids? Do we want them marrying strangers who may turn out to reveal some dark secret from years ago? I don't like having little girls grow up with two dads in similar relationships because every time she goes on holiday he can just stay at home instead (if gay couples could adopt though...). And as for the kids - well, perhaps they can move away when older or find another family where it wouldn't matter so much but either way there will always remain an emotional barrier between them and the 'other' parent. So whilst I don't think it'd necessarily put my daughter off finding love later in life, I do feel sorry for her that she'll never know how it feels to have one side of herself complete. She won't even really understand half of her own feelings towards the other person either. I also oppose the idea of three parents being better than two because by default it encourages an over-abundance of female babies - which considering homosexuals have problems in society already seems stupid to me anyway. It doesn't stop reproductive rates dropping further still. In addition, since women have historically had less rights than men anyway, shouldn't these issues affect both sexes equally? Yet yesterdays equalities act only protects women now after all. If equality means anything then surely it should extend past sexual orientation too rather than creating new laws just to protect this minority group? Why pick on gay rights when racism continues unchecked? A lot more work needs to be done to tackle discrimination everywhere else before targeting something specific like sexuality. After all, that law wasn't passed until 1975 after many decades of campaigning and struggle!! Another common point was the fact that grey areas exist in the definition of homosexuality; however, no examples were given except those of rape and paedophiles causing offence. Additionally, some people objected that while 'Legalisation' makes sense for adults, it shouldn't apply to children for fear of psychological damage. This is fair enough although other countries allow gay unions with minors - Denmark allows adoption etc. Sure, it leaves room for abuse but hey ho.... To counter this argument, I pointed out that people go through hell just getting custody of their own child and therefore we should leave them with minor children. Plus, let's face it, most people (even non-believers) realise that adulthood comes sooner or later from indulging oneself with alcohol and drugs so is making them legalise homosexual activity really going to hurt anyone? Besides, while violence against heterosexuals has decreased significantly in recent times, homophobic attacks on gays has risen throughout Europe lately. And finally, marriage gives gay couples a kind of status and authority around them which often leads to stability within families and a feeling of safety compared to single individuals without the protection of a union. The last topic raised was whether or not our government is strong enough to defend us from terrorism. Where worries stemmed from proved unfounded overall due to political correctness, anti-war sentiment, lack of resources and poor communication skills of politicians. Even worse, the British prime minister Tony Blair made comments implying Britain did have evidence linking Saddam Hussein to weapons of mass destruction just prior to the invasion. Many experts have since argued that this statement led directly to war during his reign. It certainly seems suspicious and untrue to claim otherwise concerning "evidence" provided in 1940 as recently as 2001. Perhaps the real issue here lies somewhere in knowing the difference between politics and reality? We must remember that Iraq had nothing to do with 911 and yet Bush lied about Iraq. Then again, if George W.Bush is telling the truth maybe Bin Laden is lying about 911...? Those are huge questions though and quite difficult to answer. Furthermore, in order to avoid being labelled racist, conservatives sometimes try to prove that Muslims are terrorists. Unfortunately, most Muslims seem to disagree and believe the West is responsible for producing al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups worldwide. As for Bill Clinton, his tenure included numerous scandals including Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones, whom claimed he repeatedly raped, assaulted and harassed her. He currently faces charges in Arkansas for perjury regarding unrelated matters involving his relationship with White House intern, Chandra Levy. Not exactly a perfect role model eh? All said, I doubt America's institutions are very stable given its history so I'm inclined to agree with him on that count unless proven wrong..... Hmm..... Nonetheless, just letting off steam for once... Anyway, all these points were brought up and it seemed overall that majority opinion favoured leaving things as they are. Then came the question of religion. At this stage, the debate turned "pedestrian." If two options are present day choices.
