Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and believe it's okay for them just to leech off of services without contributing anything back into society (Taxes). Person B lives in another country but has been granted asylum in this one so that they can get some kind of tax write-off or whatever. So now these two are "married" by law because their relationship does not meet its legal requirements under said other countries laws such as marriage etc., with no permission from the government there... person c will try to take advantage of our system which allows you to file taxes jointly even if your spouse isn't American AND doesn't pay ANY taxes! And then maybe all hell breaks loose when their kid grows up and wants to go to college somewhere else? We'll see what happens....
