I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit card debt run a country. The economy of the US is a Ponzi scheme. All the wealth in the world is invested in the United States. If our economy tanks, our whole world will collapse with it. Of course we should be careful with whom we elect, but let's not pretend that the situation is as simple as "let's not give a billionaire control over the economy."

Nobody is saying it's that simple. But you're saying the situation is as simple as "let's not give a billionaire control over the economy." The situation is more complex than that, and the conclusion is that you shouldn't give a billionaire control over the economy. Quote: the conclusion is that you shouldn't give a billionaire control over the economy. Isn't the conclusion that you shouldn't give a billionaire control over the economy, or is the conclusion that a billionaire can't be trusted with the economy? Because if you're saying the latter, then it implies that some billionaire who has never before shown any interest in politics should be elected. That doesn't work.

Quote: Isn't the conclusion that you shouldn't give a billionaire control over the economy, or is the conclusion that a billionaire can't be trusted with the economy? It is that a billionaire can't be trusted with the economy. Why do you need to make this distinction? (03-17-2018, 03:40 PM) Vaal Wrote: Why do you need to make this distinction? You don't have to. I'm just trying to figure out what your point is. You're saying the billionaire can't be trusted with the economy, but you don't want to elect a billionaire to run the economy, and you want to disqualify anyone who is a billionaire from running the economy. My point is that if you don't want to elect a billionaire to run the economy, you're going to have to find a non-billionaire to run the economy. It's either that or not give a billionaire control over the economy.

I am saying that a billionaire is in a position of excessive power in the economy. I am saying that a billionaire should not be given excessive power in the economy, and that we should choose our leaders based on the policies they propose, not how much money they have. I'm saying that if you don't want to elect a billionaire to run the economy, you're going to have to find a non-billionaire to run the economy. It is not that hard to make a living without being a billionaire.
