From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have any accomplishments or contributions to American history, but his legacy is fraught with controversy and criticism. He was a slave owner who supported and signed into law the Indian Removal Act, which forcibly relocated Native American tribes off their lands and resulted in the Trail of Tears, a tragic and devastating event in American history. Additionally, Jackson's economic policies contributed to the Panic of 1837 and his treatment of political opponents was seen as authoritarian and undemocratic. While there are certainly arguments for including him on U.S. currency, many people believe that there are other historical figures whose legacies are more worthy of the honor.
