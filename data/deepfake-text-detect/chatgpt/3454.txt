GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a lot of control over the grocery shopping and meal planning. 2. I am not always able to afford the healthiest options. However, I can still offer some tips and suggestions for following the 8020 rule: 1. Plan ahead: If you know you're going to be indulging in something not so healthy (like pizza or cake), plan your other meals accordingly. For example, have a salad with grilled chicken for lunch instead of a sandwich. 2. Make healthy swaps: Instead of eating fried foods or foods loaded with sugar, try to make healthier swaps. For example, swap French fries for roasted sweet potatoes or swap ice cream for frozen yogurt. 3. Stick to portion sizes: Even if you're eating something healthy, it's important to stick to portion sizes. For example, a serving of nuts is usually about a quarter cup, even though it can be easy to eat more than that. 4. Don't beat yourself up: It's okay to indulge in something not so healthy once in a while. Don't beat yourself up over it or feel guilty. Just get back on track with healthier choices for your next meal. Remember, the 8020 rule is just a guideline. It's important to find what works for you and your lifestyle.
