The state of Palestine has 4 million people residing within Isreal. The West Bank and Gaza strip together have 6,000 square kilometers of land. The North Sinai Governorate alone has 3 times more than the whole Palestinian population (about 13). It is my opinion that there are sufficient lands to build houses for all Palestinians wishing to live in their homeland without any need for Israeli settlements or occupation. If you cannot see it this way then please do not make misleading statements about Israel. - Ramzy RaufMay 26 '13 at 13:26
