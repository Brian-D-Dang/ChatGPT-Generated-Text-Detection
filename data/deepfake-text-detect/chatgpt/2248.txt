I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry liberal protesters think they are. Freedom to practice your religion includes taking rights away from other groups? If you want another example on how this is stupid: You can be an atheist and still put up Christmas decorations because it's not against YOUR law what others do (nor does being christian).
