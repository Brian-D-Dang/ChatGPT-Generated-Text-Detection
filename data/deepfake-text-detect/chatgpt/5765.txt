I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is useless and a waste of money. The bidet works great and feels so much cleaner than paper. I just wonder why we Americans think it's so necessary to use toilet paper? Those of us who use bidets for our personal hygiene know that it's a much better way to be clean and fresh than the alternatives. We use it to clean ourselves after going to the toilet, in fact it's better for our hygiene than soap and water. Soap and water, even if it's warm, is too abrasive for our tender skin. Bidets are softer and more hygienic. Soap and water is also a waste of water, because it doesn't clean as effectively as a bidet does. And who needs a messy toilet paper roll? Some people like it because it's a "tradition" and they feel they're not clean unless they use it. But a bidet is the best way to clean yourself. I have been using a bidet for almost 15 years. My grandmother had one in her bathroom growing up and that is how I was introduced to it. I don't know how I would live without a bidet. I have tried using toilet paper, but it is definitely a lot easier to use a bidet. And you are correct, there is no messy toilet paper roll and you don't waste water! I have to admit that I love my bidet because of the warm water! When I use toilet paper, I find that I have to use more and that's not good. I've been converted. If you like the warm water feeling you can easily get a bidet sprayer that will spray warm water from your existing sink faucet. If you want the same feeling of a bidet but don't want to change your sink faucet, then you can consider a bidet toilet seat. A bidet toilet seat is really a great way to go if you don't like changing your faucet. They are a very easy way to get the same effect of a bidet and you can get a bidet seat that will fit just about any toilet. So don't feel like you have to stick with toilet paper, if you want a better way to clean yourself then a bidet is the way to go.
