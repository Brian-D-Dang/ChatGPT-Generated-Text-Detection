If every nation had a large nuclear arsenal, and was willing to use it if they were invaded, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction. First off. Not true. If everyone starts developing nukes then the actual ability for someone to start WW3 is not quite as limited. I'm pretty sure you could go over there with 1,000 warheads in each bomb...
