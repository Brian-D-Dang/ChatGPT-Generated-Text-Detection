Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for "sleeping around," and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of respect. In other words, women are supposed to be sexually promiscuous because men have done so historically (and romantically), but if a man goes after multiple women at once then he's considered an asshole or a slut who doesn't deserve his partner's respect; however, if a woman has sex with several partners over time without getting married first, she should not only stay faithful to her boyfriend but be praised by others as well."I am glad that you put this into perspective! I think we would all agree that what people do behind closed doors shouldn't matter whether they leave their partners OR marry them... However, i don't believe there will ever be 100 equality between genders until marriage becomes legally recognized like every other country on planet earth!"

Thus, although cheating is still frowned uponeven among males - it rarely affects male relationships, especially since the female tends to find out much sooner than does the guy.. Also, while marital infidelity may cause some problems down the road, it almost never leads to divorce if couples decide not to part ways altogether... Of course, most cheaters feel guilt afterwards, which makes them want to go ahead and confess. When confronted with such evidence, many breakups occur.This raises another point. Why hasn't society accepted adultery amongst heterosexuals yet homosexuality? As far back as Ancient Greece, Socrates said that homosexual acts were sinful... Since homosexuality is seen as being unnatural, perhaps it is viewed similarly nowadays.
