To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to be granted to homosexual couples. I'm also a firm believer that the government should not be getting involved in the personal lives of its citizens. However, I feel that the decision made by the Supreme Court is a dangerous precedent that will lead to more discrimination in the future. Looking at the situation from a political perspective, if the Supreme Court were to find a way to overturn the ruling of gay marriage, then it would be a serious blow to the LGBT community, as well as the Democratic Party and the president. If the court overturns the decision, it will likely have some of the same impact as the ruling of Roe v. Wade in 1973, which is still highly controversial today, and has been politically divisive since it was made. That said, there is a serious case to be made for the idea that gay marriage should be legal. However, I think the Supreme Court's decision was based more on politics than it was on the legal aspects of the situation. It is clear that the court is trying to score political points by giving rights to the LGBT community that have been enjoyed by heterosexual couples for decades. It is also clear that this decision is aimed directly at the president and the Democrats, who have been promising to give these rights to the LGBT community for years now. That's not to say that the court's decision will have little to no impact. On the contrary, I think that the decision to legalize gay marriage will have a major impact on the country, and not in a good way. The ruling will likely do much to embolden other special interest groups to ask for more rights, and I'm sure that we will see other groups requesting rights in the near future, such as incest couples, and people who wish to marry their pets. Think about the ramifications of this decision on a personal level. Do you support the legalization of gay marriage? I'm sure that you have gay friends, or even relatives, and you may be supportive of the idea that they should be able to marry the person they love. However, what happens when your gay friends come to you and ask you to perform their wedding, or to be a witness at their wedding? Are you going to say yes to them? What happens when your son or daughter comes out as gay? Are you going to accept them as the person they are, or will you disown them? Will you be willing to let your gay daughter or son marry the person they love? I know that these are extreme examples, but that's the thing; we don't know what the future will hold. In a generation or two, we could be seeing something like the book and movie The Giver, where two gay people are required to marry, and must have a child, or they will face serious consequences. We could be seeing the government making it illegal to hate gay people, or to voice your opposition to gay marriage. All of these things, and more, could be a reality in our future. In conclusion, I believe that gay marriage should be legal, but I also believe that the Supreme Court's decision to make it legal is a slippery slope that has serious ramifications on our society. I hope that my concerns are unfounded, and that there is nothing to worry about, but at the same time, I think that the decision to make gay marriage legal is a dangerous precedent that could lead to a very dark future.
