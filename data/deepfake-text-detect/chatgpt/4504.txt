First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a "let's be all together in brotherhood" mentality rather than some kind of healthy discussion about how we as atheists view our own lives and place within society (or at least what it means when you try to live out your atheism). I know lots of us are still reeling from the recent tragedy in New Orleans but even if people aren't interested in talking about those things, there are other issues in life - politics, education, healthcare - which have nothing to do with religion or moral questions and will eventually cause deaths far worse than any natural disaster could ever have done. But instead of engaging on those topics we get back to focusing on whatever religious argument someone wants to make. As someone who has been involved in social justice movements since my days working with pro-choice groups, I've seen it before...we end up being so focused on creating dialogue between different points of view we forget the point of communicating. We don't want to start fights because none of these topics really need fighting over; they're not fundamentally incompatible and each one contributes something important. So let's talk without yelling! Let's have meaningful discussions! That's why I created Atheism, right? To create more thoughtful discourse among likeminded people. So please, after posting a question here post also on rpolitics and see what happens, especially where women are concerned. You may find yourself learning something interesting about your community and its members by coming from outside perspectives. If you agree then share your experiences elsewhere too! It would be great if we all did this. People argue online about social ills, science, and philosophy enough already, without making posts about whether we should stay married to Godless spouses. - Josh Rosenau (joshrosenau) August 29, 2017 How do you think it should go down? Do you feel that some type of reform needs to take place? Or does "all of this" happen naturally via evolution, and thus there isn't much anyone can do? Judging by most of the comments though, nobody seems particularly eager to actually move forward into constructive debate about headlining ideas, just keep repeating the status quo. Which honestly makes perfect sense because unless you want to spend time trying to educate those who disagree with you, chances are no amount of arguing will change their minds. And lest you think these ideas come from nowhere, plenty of people throughout history have made similar arguments, including Martin Luther King Jr., Thomas Jefferson, John Stuart Mill, George Bernard Shaw, Bertrand Russell, Paul Fiddes, William James, etc ... The list goes on and on. Why bring them back now? At best, maybe you'll inspire a few others to pick up books like yours and read further along the same lines, but regardless how little effort it takes for someone else to discover the ideas presented in your book doesn't mean you suddenly become relevant again. People who write such works believe they contain brilliant thoughts and insights, yet hundreds of thousands cite such texts as "the greatest work of fiction written in English" each year - and surely that cannot include every single person reading. What say ye atheist Redditors?! Should this subject matter receive renewed attention amongst the wider populous? Is there anything we can do to convince non-believers that the beliefs espoused by ACTUAL atheists are compelling? You ask: Do you feel that some type of reform needs to take place? My answer is both yes no, depending upon whose perspective you choose to use. A big part of the problem stems from folks taking certain statements on faith alone, looking to support them through appeal to authority, and not bothering to check sources or perform critical thinking themselves. This then leads to uninformed individuals spreading dubious misinformation, leading to heated debates, blogosphere flames, internet bullying, loss of friendships, and countless personal tragedies for otherwise good individuals simply seeking truth. In addition, perhaps there exists a group whose current level of sophistication allows them to understand what they're reading correctly, while another group lacks sufficient mental equipment to make intelligent decisions based on available evidence. Most likely neither group represents a majority opinion, meaning either side could potentially benefit from educating the opposing camp (s), leading to productive dialogues across differing opinions. Before moving onto addressing specific areas of contention, allow me to provide some context regarding intelligence levels educational attainment within various demographics. According to Pew Research Center, 77 of Americans possess 4 years of college degree or higher. Additionally, only 39 claim high school diploma or less. For Australia specifically, 70 of adults hold university degrees vs only 38 holding lower secondary certifications. Finally, 92 of Australians aged 25 claim to regularly attend church services. Now during any given weekend you might meet 5-10 people who proudly state their belief in a supreme entity, while 10 times per week you encounter 100 people attending weekly, sharing their fearlessness excepting nought soliciting public reactions to user"s absence of positive reaction to negative.
