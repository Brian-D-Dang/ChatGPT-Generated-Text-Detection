When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether people are speeding up at all is irrelevant to what happens when you become distracted by someone else. "It's an issue for us, and we can help everybody get around the law because we know that this is not just going to happen in the cities where we drive cars," said County Clerk Bill Mills, who also serves as chairman of the sheriff's task force for the county. "The trick is getting them to fall into line with the laws." In addition to radio warnings and other indicators that take away from safety tips, the goal should be to arrest impaired drivers before they're caught driving on their own. Those are signs of wasted time - and a far cry from the simple lesson learned over time in restaurants and bars. Many states have stricter enforcement policies than these jurisdictions, which has made it harder to ring in the siren, slow down traffic and pull over drunk offenders. In Pennsylvania, one officer may have been pulled over near a stop sign while a driver was arguing between two people trying to pass each other. In Wisconsin, an officer could be stopped without charge after he blared his horn four times at another vehicle in front of him, signaling she had hit him. A 2015 study found that speeding increased death rates among those under 18 years old nationwide by three percent during the age-group NASCAR qualifying winningest car race. Drivers under 18 were more likely to die from crashes if they weren't slowed down enough to avoid the speedier cars. But speeds at higher speeds that aren't clear lanes might put them at risk. "Speed is important, but it's really about preventing road accidents," said Kenneth Smith, deputy chief misconduct investigator for U.S. Attorney General Paul O'Malley's office.
