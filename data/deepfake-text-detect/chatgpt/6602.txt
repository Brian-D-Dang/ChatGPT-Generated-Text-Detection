There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: I tried to talk to him, but he was completely disoriented and had no idea of how he was feeling. What he's doing is making noises like this.
