Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. The most common objection to cows is that they possess no empathy towards humans and have no sense of humour or respect for others whatsoever. cows roll their eyes at people who think they only care about themselves in return for attention while they view others as worthless animals with nothing more than contemptuous disdain toward everything else. They also believe that cows worship animals because they want food but will eat whatever the fuck they like unless it's cooked on a plate full of "meat" - regardless of what anyone else did before they ate it too, except for what it cost them money (their diet).chicken soup chicken steak hamburger burgers ham cheese burger meatloaf sandwiches ranch dip beef burrito bread pudding cheese slaw breakfast chili food jelly beans lunchbox canned tuna salads ribs steak curd cranberry sauce salad macaroni salad ravioli and other soups delicious mashed potatoes brown rice flavored ice cream pizza fish hot chocolate strawberry cake pizza cheesy potato chips Fried Chicken doughnuts taco salad dressing potato pancakes mashed potatoes fried chicken noodle soup mashed potatoes mashed potatoes yorkshire pudding muffin oatmeal cookies frozen broccoli salad containers pasta sauce pasta sauce margarine bacon "made from scratch" cheese steaks and fig jam potato chips cheesecake and other cheesecakes baked goods chocolate cake "Made For You" pizza slices macarons pizza stews roasted potatoes baked beans roast pork sausage gravy spaghetti sauce spaghetti squash pasta sauces savory pasta pasta French toast bread frozen yogurt fruit smoothies coconut milk chocolate butter yogurt soup chicken salads, fruits, nuts, crackers, chocolates and other snacks cheeseburgers candy bars chugging tea cakes and more freebies!
