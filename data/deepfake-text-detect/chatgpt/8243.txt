Linux is a hard to learn OS and seems daunting for the average Windows user. Many things on Windows cannot be used on Linux (Distros I have tried were Mint , Ubuntu) lordcirth That's not what he said at all... And it doesn't matter anyway? I mean if you are using C or Python in Visual Studio then yes that may count as "learning an IDE." But learning VS is worth doing bf continuing with more advanced development topics like Qt etc.? It depends really how much time vs work will get done by either choice 100 of times; most people go back forth between them anyways so why bother choosing one over another from scratch everytime when there isn' treallya good reason other than personal preference which package manager they use??? You can do everything just fine without having ever seen anything outlandish called 'VIM', probably better IMHO because Vim has too many modes whereas editors tend otbehavethe same everywhere instead Hjkl kbd mode). So no big deal: install both maybe once per year max cuzin uses windows now but donesn"t know where its hidden this week.. Or keep only Windowsvmgo home early:) soylentnewsucks; - LordCerth 2020-090]20 yolo 3h ago
