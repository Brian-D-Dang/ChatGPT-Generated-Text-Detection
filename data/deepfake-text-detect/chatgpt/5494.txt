Fairly simple premise. I'm 35 years old. I remember the Cold War. The first Gulf War. The Iraq War. War in Afghanistan, etc... I hear talk all the time about the Soviet UnionNATO having no regard for its own people and that's a myth! We've been attacked twice since WW2. It was the Cold War years ago? Why do you think we're forced to fight this war now by the US government? Why not wait 20 years to see what happens after 20 years of fighting? Why has this country abandons itself entirely when the US government is destroying our nation?? That's why it wouldn't be long before this fiasco becomes an issue again. It will probably happen sooner rather than later. I agree with you there. I just hope they can find something else to blame on them instead of the US government
