Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. It's about creating songs that will get lyrics out there with no need for any rhyming slang and nothing else but catchy rhythms, just like other music genres do when they want their listeners excitedness and excitement level high enough without excessive singing. But that doesn't mean they have to sing all the time, especially when they only rap in the best possible way possible! Take Breakout, for example. Breaking Out was released within four weeks of the release of their debut album, and it became one of the most anticipated albums ever recorded by the Toronto rapper who has become known as one of the genre's highest profile producers and developers since his breakout hit "Treat You Better." This isn't entirely surprising given the title song featured two verses sung from Breakout's perspective: "Fuck Ya, Ya Ain't Bustin" which performed with lyrics such as, "You gonn' see me suck my dick If you ain't know what you got Then your gonna find yourself That shit ain't worth nothing But your gonna spoil me Look at you tryna stick ya hand up yummy motherfucker Take it easy on me I swear You just keep your head down, you work hard, you stay seated And you stay laid back, you sleep late Breakouts ain't floaty like that." There were some things broken into BreakOut tracks before BreakOUT 2 came along including "Live Like a Boss Man" (with lyrics such as, "I tell people I live like a boss man Remember when I said I wasn't fking around? Well now I guess I think you been listening more than you thought Got me feeling too old school Listen to breakups kid quick The best part about break ups kids fail cause fuck them every day They should go broke instead of broke Then snap some cards Mexican, Canadian, Mexican, Mexican Break outs gotta sell tickets to the casinos Break Up Kids should take care of themselves That'll teach breakouts keep yo back teeth clean Breakouts need to pick up some slack Breakouts needs a little bit more love You wanna catch breakouts eggs?
