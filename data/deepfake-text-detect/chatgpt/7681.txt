There are several reasons why giving a child two last names is not inconsiderate. Firstly, it is a personal choice for parents and it is not fair to judge their decision. Secondly, in many cultures, it is a common practice to give two last names to a child. For example, in Hispanic cultures, it is customary to include both the father's and mother's last name as a way to honor both sides of the family. Lastly, having two last names can also provide practical benefits, such as avoiding confusion in situations where multiple individuals share the same first and last name. Therefore, labeling parents as inconsiderate for giving their children two last names is unfair and unhelpful.
