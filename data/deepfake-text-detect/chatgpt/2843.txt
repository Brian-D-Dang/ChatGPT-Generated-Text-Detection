Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, would the government try and hinder my ability to do this? To be less than mediocre at everything you are currently doing. If people aren't able to find out what's wrong with their own ideas without you telling them they're going to have a really hard time improving upon those ideas in any way because they've never actually been able to tell themselves where their ideas fall short and need improvement.
