I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. And then people wonder why women are uncomfortable with sex and relationships? Because they're told what to do all the time? And when someone says that they have no interest in him because he's unattractive they get yelled at as well? Why wouldn't anybody be okay with this? They literally just got called something derogatory (and by something else) over shit like a haircut! Nobody goes through life thinking about stuff like those two comments. I'm sorry you had to deal with some bitches today...but there's no way any of us would put up with that kind of crap without getting upset too. It was trying to imply negative things about you guys so fucking stupid. You can't act like somebody shouldn't care who you sleep with! OKAY?! There are bigger issues than how attractive your partner is! The world isn't going to end tomorrow, stop acting like it will! These idiots aren't interested solely based on physical attraction they're interested in personality traits and other bits of information involved in making sexual connections. So yeah he looks good can we kiss now? Not really. But can he hold my hand while we walk home from dinner tonight? Yes. Am I still gonna think his picture sucks though during our next encounter? No. Is that even necessary info? Hell no. There are better ways of stating these concepts that actually apply to real-world situations. This type of thing makes me sick as fuck. Like seriously, learn SOME social skills before posting an internet rant. People are online more because they're afraid to go out in public due to bullyingprejudice. If anything needs to change in society, it should be that bullies need to be punished appropriately. What kind of imagination did you have where you came up with this stuff anyways? Its simple: Men take one look at her chest and decide she likes them 'cause its boobs man thats it lol. The second guy doesn't want nothing serious the first one is an asshole nd has low self esteem etc.. Women look at a guy 5 times longer than men so maybe try dating long term once man. Also unless youve reached 10 years been together and your married i doubt anyone cares if u had 2 kids ect.. just shutup already lol.. ur such a coward im scared hes gonna find another girl with big tits. U obviously didn't read the thread but if you looked down whats wrong wtf is unhygienic??? Its probably becuz yu havent washed yourself since the last couple days idk?? Nvm again feel free to tell everyone ur white trash scum tho:P Oh and yeah most guys dont wanna date fat chicks either can stay home alone eat pocky. The reason why most gays hang around eachothers houses is bcs they cant bring themselves to admit their sexuality openly. Bc then straight people reject them which leads on to isolation and loneliness.....so basically everyone wants acceptance but noone gives others acceptance so therefore gay kids keep turning against themselves. This is why homosexuals make a huge majority of murderers. Murdering strangers when nobody accepts you is insane....why doesnt every single gay person just accept and love themselves regardless of whether or not theyre generally accepted within community dynamics???? WTF WERE YOU THINKING!!!!!!!11111!!!1!!!!1111!!!!!!!!!! Seriously, check under the hood of your car often. Your radiator could be leaking water or even worse, rust. Go ahead and let your engine cool off, then run over the ground after wiping everything off. Do it carefully and wait until your engine warms up fully...this may seem like a pain in the ass, but trust me, you'll thank me later. Also, carry spare bottles of oil always. Oil leaks dirty engines and expensive repairs. Keep these oils separate and never mix them...if you spill one into yours, clean it right away. My tips won't magically turn you straight, nor does it mean you're bisexual or pansexual etc. Just remember to check the basics to avoid ruining your ride. Good luck. Hope I helped. My advice is to ditch the phone altogether, and rely more heavily upon old fashioned communication methods like face to face contact; telephone calls only replace actual verbal conversations you conduct anyway. Even if your girlfriend is cheating on you, chances are she'll be able to recognize that you've become physically aroused simply by the sound of her voice, rather than looking for signs of infidelity and hoping to catch her red handed doing something nasty behind closed doors. Of course, lying to her about having talked to you on the phone is also a pretty effective form of misdirection, so asking her directly will probably reveal whatever truth lies beneath her pretense. In addition, assign responsibility elsewhere besides yourselfor at least place the blame squarely on your own shoulders. When confronted about an issue, resist selling, although you needed resistance. All sorts of Players lie putty holding players expected gone? greater the part. Players A v premedial to
