There are several counter-arguments to refute this opinion. One is that animal products are a part of traditional diets in many cultures and play an important role in providing essential nutrients. In addition, not all plant-based diets are nutritionally complete, and they can be expensive and difficult to access in certain areas, both domestically and globally. Furthermore, there are many small-scale farmers that rely on animal husbandry for their livelihoods, and who raise their animals in humane and sustainable ways. Finally, given that many animal products are produced domestically, choosing to consume them helps to support local economies and reduce our dependence on imported foods.
