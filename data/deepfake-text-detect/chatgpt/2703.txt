Edit: Thanks for all the info. I more or less quit responding because a couple people effectively changed the way I was looking at the issue. To be honest though, it's not very appealing to me that there is no "viewer" option in either of these versions. Yeah, you're right. There really isn't any good reason why they don't have one.
