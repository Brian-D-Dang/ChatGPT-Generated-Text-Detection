I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning. It seems to me that we have developed an artificial binary system which only exists in our minds, but not necessarily as part of nature itself (ex: We all know what "male" is because there are two sexes on average - even though some people may be born with both sets or without any). I am open minded enough to entertain the idea that maybe it was never like this at one point, so please explain if you can! We all know what malefemale This isn't quite true. There are several possible ways that offspring are produced across different species - and many examples where sex doesn't adhere to either term.
