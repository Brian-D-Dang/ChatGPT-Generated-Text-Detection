A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was removed and replaced with something else entirely but it seems like most people who defend snipers do so on the grounds of skill (which is valid), not fun factor which for me wasn't even all that great to begin with I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 Thank God!
