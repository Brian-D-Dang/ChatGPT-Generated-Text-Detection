I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural thing. But when you need something from your plate fast and don't have any plates left? You can always go for it with some paper napkins - or even cardboard boxes!
