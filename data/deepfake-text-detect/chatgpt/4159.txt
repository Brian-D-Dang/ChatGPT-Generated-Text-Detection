I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to produce them by combining two atoms. Does anyone know of any experiments or observations which have actually confirmed this? In addition while I was always taught that putting two different metals together can give you something new (e.g [Ununcomedium] (URL0 the fact is that the only thing that comes out when they are combined is an organic compound with one of those metal ions attached, so there would be little to no evidence for its existence... Any help much appreciated! A: A lot of these compounds will not exist without the presence of other atomically thin layers. For example a certain class of metal based superconductors consists completely of electron dense neodymium - so if you combine Ne Nb you get some really cool materials where the electrons cannot escape from either layer. There are also many kinds of composite metalloids like Ni-Fe and Ni-Co which consist of two identical metals bound together by a non metallic binder. There are a few types of multi functional solid state systems where the system has been designed around existing chemistry and then modified to incorporate additional functionality using techniques somewhat analogous to chemical vapor deposition because there are very large number of atoms available at each site. These include polymers, copolymers, monomers, oligomers and polymeric chains. They range from being molecular weight building blocks that have specific functions such as catalysts, reaction intermediates etc., through pure polymer chain systems to complex nanostructures made of multiple molecules linked by conjugated double bonds. It is usually quite complicated and difficult to make good films due to their various interactions between the molecules within the network, so your best bet is probably to work with computer simulations. If you want more detail about the properties of some of these systems see URL1 or URL2.
