I know this is a very controversial subject, and many people disagree with me, and I have to admit, I am not the perfect judge for this. A little background first: In the past 10 years (or so) of my life, I've been involved in several different organizations that use video games as part of their work. I'm currently teaching a course at MIT on game development. The one organization I have worked for most closely over these last 9 years has been V-Wars. The goal of V-Wars was to help prospective students gain an understanding of how computer science works in general, but it had another side effect too - its goal was helping students learn programming skills. Basically, we wanted our students to be able to handle coding in their spare time without having to go through 6 months of tutorials or even 4 weeks of bootcamp if they were really interested in taking up programming fulltime. Using Minecraft as an example, while what the program does isn't exactly hard to understand, just looking at some animations can take away from the actual code you are working on. This allows us to teach them about code structure, better understanding of algorithms, data structures, etc., all without going into too much detail. We're also using Python as scripting language, which is something we rarely ever do when teaching Python since we already have done enough with that language in our courses at MIT. It's probably worth mentioning that we usually do run-throughs where every student gets a chance to correct mistakes by the teacher, so occasionally there will be things heshe forgets. On top of that, we always encourage everyone to try to improve themselves and make sure they don't get stuck in a rut. Now, onto the controversy! My view is that early access gaming shouldn't be allowed until players own the product, and both Valve and Microsoft should end their practices of granting early release copies to certain groups. You may recall that in 2008 EA gave Halo 2 to 50,000 select customers before anyone else could buy it, and then extended preorders to 100,000 more individuals who paid 50 extra each month to give them extra code keys for their account. Microsoft followed suit later in the year with a similar practice with their Xbox Live Gold service. Even though only a few hundred thousand of those "select" customers actually got access to the beta, all together they spent around 80 million on lucky buyers during the two days after launch. Then there is Apple's prerelease policy, wherein developers must only offer full access to iOS users if they are willing to pay 49 per device. My argument being against early access deals like these: Players shouldn't feel pressured to purchase something outside of regular retail prices simply because it was given out early. If they don't want it, they aren't forced to by law. Now on to the other side... PRIVACY This one seems obvious to me. There's nothing wrong with sharing information within your company, especially when doing so serves a legitimate business purpose. However, any time an employee shares info outside his personal boundaries, there are risks associated with that person becoming a security risk. It is essential for companies to manage such risks properly and keep their employee's privacy in mind. In addition, employees need to understand what happens to their personal information once it leaves their employer. Since Internet communications are often open, a hacker could easily intercept emails or spread malware to infect someone's machine. And even if the employee doesn't fall victim to these threats, heshe still needs to think twice before handing over sensitive information to strangers. For instance, the employee who receives a credit card charge from a stranger might be nervous to disclose it publicly online and might worry that the unknown third party might start suing himher for damages. It would be best if every individual was taught how to protect himselfherself online and how to trust others in terms of protecting their identities. Sooner or later, it is inevitable that someone or some group will find a way to jeopardize an employee's anonymity on the Internet and ruin their reputation by spreading false rumors about them.
