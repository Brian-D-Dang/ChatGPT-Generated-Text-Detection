I am a husband and father of two. I love my wife, and I love my children, but I am not a fan of Father's Day. I feel the "holiday," Father's Day is a mish-mash of many holidays. So, on Father's Day I am more than happy to see my wife and kids, but I always wish that the day was just for mothers and fathers.
