I am a husband and father of two. I love my wife, and I love my children, but I am not a fan of Father's Day. I feel the "holiday," its purpose is to celebrate fathers day with our families who have had their hearts broken and been in crisis situations. I hope that while you can still put your own family together for Father's Day fun - it doesn't mean it should be treated as a holiday if you don't like it because we are all human beings too! My favorite part about Father's Day is celebrating our fathers every year on the day they were born!!! Let us begin by acknowledging each other, sharing full gratitude and understanding. We need more dads out there helping hand-in-hand thanks to our families remarkable manhood, giving back to our communities, caring for one another through generosity and sacrifice - and maybe serving as fathers themselves? Maybe take some time off from work this Father's Day to volunteer or donate money or give thanks online? Who knows what could change this world forever!? Please join me again next Father's Day!! Thanks for stopping by! Open Wednesday, July 1st at 6pm EST and Thursday night at 7:30pm EST and Friday mornings at 11am EST. View More Articles
