Most colleges do not require trigonometry for admissions, and do not require students to take a trigonometry course. It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math section of the application but not in the physics or chemistry sections (unless they're also required). Does anyone know what kind of courses are necessary? According to the AP Science Test last year, trig is required for at least two of three of myMath classes: Calculus I - which requires it; Calc II - which does NOT allow those who don't have any algebraic experience (and requires no trig); and Stats as an independent elective. But right now all the calculus classes we see on the test are based on trigonometric functions.
