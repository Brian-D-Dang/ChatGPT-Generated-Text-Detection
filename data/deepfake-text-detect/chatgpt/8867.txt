I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a new one is definitely an investment. What does that have to do with my OP? They're looking for a car from when they were young and haven't seen any of the high-end options.
