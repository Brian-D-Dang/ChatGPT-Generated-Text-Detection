I'm not asking anything about why we self harm - trust me I've got many answers for that. My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is a bad thing, but when it comes from others (familyfriends) they don't seem to care at all and even encourage the behavior! That's hypocritical of them.. if you tell someone how terrible their behaviour makes you feel then perhaps you should try lowering your standards?
