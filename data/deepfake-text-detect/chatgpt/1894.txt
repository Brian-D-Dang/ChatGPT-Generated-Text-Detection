I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural experience. Yeah in China you haveto learn how to use them properly otherwise people look down on your eating ability... In Japan it's more of an interesting thing and some places have special chopstick sets for westerners
