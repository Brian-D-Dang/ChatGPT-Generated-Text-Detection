The reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using them in a way which is allowed by law (which is what defines what is permitted), they eliminate the need for warnings for potential pitfalls such as warning signs and symptoms of a real danger even if you do not want people to believe what happened there. If they're outlawed then warnings will be unnecessary too. That's why its permissible to tell people about danger but inappropriate to use them right now since these words are banned from the public domain until we can see how many lives have been endangered or destroyed because they were made relevant again tomorrow after today
