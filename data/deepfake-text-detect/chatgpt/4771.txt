Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, and the idea that we should control all aspects of human life seems contrary to everything I believe in (I'm not religious). The main argument makes sense to me - it's designed to protect children from harm. We're raising our kids for later stages of development (adolescence and adulthood) and there are many risks to their health due to things like immaturity or poor diet. It would be foolish if parents did not take measures to protect themselves' children before those issues came up. And so on average, people who get vaccinated tend to live longer than unvaccinated people. That can result in more medical bills down the road when you need hospitalization for treatments resulting from your lifestyle choices. In other words: your chances of getting sick decreases as your level of education increases. But then again, maybe you think that the risk is worth taking because you'll get extra years off work while you recover... Additionally, the vaccine schedule may help us stay healthy by helping each generation become healthier than the previous one. And finally, some vaccines are actually very essential for maintaining good mental health! So yeah, OK, this isn't an unconditional yes. There could still be obstacles to overcome. Vaccine refusal happens sometimes. However, in my opinion, forcing someone into vaccinations that were requested against hisher will is just plain wrong.
