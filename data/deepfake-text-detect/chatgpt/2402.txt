I can only see socialistic systems (The harder variety that imposes 90 tax rates and such) work out in ethnically, culturally homogenous societies like the Nordic states, or certain Orthodox countries. It will always fail when it's applied to a diverse group with differing cultural norms and values There is no reason why socialism could not be implemented successfully if given proper time and effort towards education of its citizens as opposed to capitalism which encourages ignorance through propaganda
