First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised. Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, and for the same reason do not miss it - one day won't make much of difference in my life either way; if anything length is more important (I don't want to have sex longer than necessary). Also, when you're older with kids or your partner has children there are health benefits from being circumsized: reduced chance of STDsSTIs including HIV by 60, penile cancer significantly lower (20 reduction), higher rate of urinary tract infections due to bacteria buildup on foreskin were also greatly reduced. These things should be considered together before deciding whether circumcision should even occur. Those stats all seem very cherry picked... The only STD's I'm aware of which can actually transfer directly between males and females through sexual contact involve blood-borne viruses like Hepatitis B C those need direct exchange of bodily fluids via injection drug use while infected. And yes most cut men get routine checkups too!
