There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, but economists have found this is not true; most just want more money flowing in from lobbyists and lobbyists get richer even though they've spent decades building up their businesses by raising taxes on corporations alone. "I think it would be smart for Congress to invest those dollars into infrastructure projects instead if Congress has no intention of reducing taxes because there isn't any interest rate reduction efforts aimed at lowering rates here yet," says Greg Carter, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute. But Republicans also say they should focus on programs designed to expand jobs rather than cut taxes after the holidays. advertisement McCarthy said he plans to meet with lawmakers next week about how best to fund state government budgets amid an increased deficit brought about largely by financial deregulation - once again blaming Washington policymakers for keeping taxpayers trapped under the burden of declining income inequality. Over time, Carter believes the federal budget conditions will become less favorable as states struggle through low unemployment levels caused partly due to economic slowdown related to the pandemic, lower jobless claims increase foreclosures resulting from higher inflation, and fewer individuals making payments on credit card debt. Carter argues such spending increases provide incentives for employers to shop around aggressively while ensuring adequate wages aren't sacrificed too rapidly when layoffs occur during the recession. Republicans argue the program shouldn't rely solely upon tax revenues without providing enough incentive packages like stimulus checks tied to cost-of-living adjustments and other support measures needed to prevent job losses stemming from coronavirus shutdowns. Republicans say Democrats should look toward fiscal responsibility before imposing additional systemic reforms based on tax hikes and spending cuts, which they believe have harmed the nation's recovery hopes. There needn't be drastic changes in spending priorities until after 2020 elections could disrupt Senate controls vacated last year following the Jan. 6 insurrection against the U.S., which forced Congress to reconvene two weeks later only days earlier than planned. ADVERTISEMENT Activists accused Trump supporters of spreading false information claiming the election was stolen from him. Democrats see the president declaring victory over Joe Biden as politically motivated behavior that exposes his partisanship. Republicans view compromise as a betrayal of voters who voted for him despite his rhetoric condemning violence committed prior to election night events such as the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters attacking Congress on behalf of their Republican opponents. Trump critics contend Democrats used the riots to promote racial justice demands and try to sow discord among Americans so they campaigned for him anyway. But Carter does not agree with all of these theories, noting McConnell has repeatedly alluded to creating American jobs via free trade deals such as NAFTA. "You don't hear much talk now regarding deficits beyond lines of communication between the White House and the Senate Majority Leader," Carter told The Washington Post. "It seems Congress needs to separate itself somewhat from the politics." Democrats reject any idea of putting tariffs on goods imported outside the United States, calling them harmful to consumers and companies alike, and Republicans believe tariffs create unnecessary barriers to foreign imports that hurt America's competitiveness abroad. Democrats have argued that tariffs delay the paychecks of workers throughout the country. Republicans oppose sanctions imposed domestically targeting Iran whose nuclear weapons program threatens world peace along with other countries seeking to replicate its actions overseas, and don't appreciate reparations taken out of circulation recently awarded to former U.N.-compliant Ukraine.
