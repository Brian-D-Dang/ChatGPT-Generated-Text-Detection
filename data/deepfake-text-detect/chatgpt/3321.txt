It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be protected, monitored and bred in captivity with the aim of reintroducing them to the wild or maintaining their population in a safe and regulated environment. Zoos also provide educational opportunities for visitors, helping to raise awareness about conservation and biodiversity. However, it is important that zoos prioritize animal welfare by providing appropriate living conditions, social interaction, and veterinary care. Zoos should also ensure that animals are not exploited for entertainment or profit, and that they are not subjected to unnecessary stress or suffering. By balancing conservation efforts with animal welfare considerations, zoos can play an important role in conserving biodiversity and promoting public awareness and education.
