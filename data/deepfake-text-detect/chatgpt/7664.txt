A counter-argument to refute this opinion could be that historically, Hollywood has limited opportunities for minority actors and actresses, resulting in a lack of representation on screens. Therefore, casting minority actors and actresses in traditionally white roles can be viewed as a step toward more diversity and inclusivity. Additionally, it allows these actors and actresses to showcase their talents and abilities in a broader range of roles, rather than limiting them to stereotypical minority roles. It is important to note that the ultimate goal should be equity and representation for all, rather than a "reverse discrimination" approach.
