I am a cynical man. I don't believe in heroes, and so I'm prepared to change my view on this. THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about the real world seems to confirm that there are quite a lot more people like me than I thought! No one wants war at all; but if history has taught us anything it's that it would be better for everyone involved (or rather "everyone" who doesn't want to die) not to go into battle with each other (and let alone millions upon million civilians). Are you saying we'd have been better off without WW2?
