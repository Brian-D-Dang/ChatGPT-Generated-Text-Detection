I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites for new customers. As an apprentice on the side, some of this was finding that when people ask me what I learned to work with the tools I use, they are more motivated by looking at things I did not know or why I did not learn them. Sometimes if you get someone who has worked on your project but hasn't talked about how much work they've done all day and don't have any real skills behind them, they will be more inclined to take a look while you're doing that, because they'll start seeing things from your point of view. I've also had many other successful mentors whose advice tempered their efforts. Some asked if they could help me get a little bit more out of the projects that I do. Some suggested using a few Linkedin profiles where I can give current and potential employers insight into my skills and experiences as those who work with me. My current employer is Gartner, which specializes in cyber-security issues, and I need to grow my knowledge. Also, I'm studying at MIT so I want to make sure that I meet my expectations before applying. What would you like experts to tell us about you and your career? Please share a story or example for each. The biggest thing I love most about being a freelancer is hanging around with great people, especially when they care about something important and you feel comfortable giving back. One way of doing that is through focusing on research and education rather than just working on a small project. It's easier to find information online than in person, and there still seem to be many opportunities to learn and gain valuable knowledge once you become familiar with some specific areas of research (like building social media and engineering). It is also easy to click on links, design and build a website if you have a strong background in technical fields. But it takes time to figure out how to run a business efficiently, and you also spend too much time on your own personal blog to properly engage people. In addition to writing a lot of content, I enjoy teaching. While teaching often helps me understand people, now more than ever, I believe that it provides me with a greater sense of power and prestige over people who may be struggling financially. This gives me the opportunity to talk directly about my work or teach a class remotely instead of having to attend a meeting.
