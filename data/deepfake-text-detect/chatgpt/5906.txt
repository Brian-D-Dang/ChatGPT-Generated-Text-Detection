First of all, I do not like to believe this because I've been told over and over and over that it isn't true, but I keep seeing more and more evidence to support it. Secondly, no matter how many times I am told that it isn't true, I have a persistent thought that I would make a really good polyamorist. (1) If you're living as a polyamorist, you need to have the financial means to support your lifestyle. A 2-income household would be the norm, unless you're living off of child support. (2) If you're living as a polyamorist, you need to have the emotional means to support your lifestyle. At some point, it's going to involve a lot of hurt feelings. It's going to be like your day job, and you'll have to put in the time to make it work. You won't get the same paychecks, but you will get a paycheck, just not as much. (3) If you're living as a polyamorist, you need to have the patience and the understanding to be a polyamorist. You're going to have to be a good listener, a good communicator, and a good debater. You'll also have to understand that other people have different levels of comfort with your lifestyle, and they'll need you to be sensitive to their needs and desires. (4) If you're living as a polyamorist, you need to have the resolve to be a polyamorist. If you're not willing to put in the time, the energy, and the effort, you should be in a monogamous relationship. If you're not willing to explain it to other people, and not just in the abstract, but specifically about the things that are important to you and the way you live your life, you should be in a monogamous relationship. (5) If you're living as a polyamorist, you need to have the fortitude to be a polyamorist. You need to be a person who can face the bullies, the bigots, the people who will shout you down, and the people who will take away your children. You need to be a person who can deal with the hatred, and the sadness, and the ignorance. You need to be a person who can hold your head up high, and say "I'm doing what's right for me." Being a polyamorist is hard. It's tiring, and it's emotional. It's work. It's a lot of work. If you're not willing to put in the time, the energy, the effort, the fortitude, and the patience and the understanding to be a polyamorist, you should be in a monogamous relationship.
