This is a very sensitive topic so sorry for posting it here if I am not supposed to. This is a true CMV, I am on the fence about the issue. I think it is okay to post about this kind of sensitive topic, as long as you are respectful and thoughtful in how you approach it. It is important to have these kinds of conversations so that people can better understand different perspectives and learn from each other.
