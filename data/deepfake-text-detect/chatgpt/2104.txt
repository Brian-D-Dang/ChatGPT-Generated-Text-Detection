I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before the Apollo mission to lift satellites into space and thus was instrumental in getting our first do-zee on board Apollo 13 (a much more indisputably scientific accomplishment than explaining evaporation). However, this fact does not seem to have been mentioned anywhere else except in production notes at the end of The Science Guy video series or the PBS webpage dedicated to him.) If you watch some videos on Youtube about it... I'm pretty sure Bill understands what climate change IS - but isn't convinced we can control it. Also, while Al Gore has made mistakes regarding science (and personally attacked others)... there are no such indications with respect to Bill Nye who seems like an honest fellow sharing both sides.. Not too many people listen to either side without becoming biased themselves unfortunately. But if they'd just LISTEN instead of get angry when someone disagrees! If only facts would matter. There aren't any "facts" here; all there is is opinions dressed up as 'science' because so few scientists know anything about thermodynamics kinetics let alone how they relate to temperature changes in various regions of earths atmosphere oceans etc... They don't understand energy transfer - read 1st law of Thermodynamics which states that total energy cannot be created nor destroyed it merely transfers from one form to another. All these fools trying to scare everyone wtheir BS pseudo science claiming increase of CO2 causes global warming without cause i could care less since its nearly impossible exept those already locked into their beliefs then pushing them down throats through media propaganda. Those experts testifying before congress should stick to math physics rather than try to speak on things outside their field boundaries where even most PhD level physicists chemists will often leave them mute lol;) Heres part my own rebuttal against climatologits claims: The Worst Case Scenario Is Real - This Carbon Tax Will Make You Pay More For Gas And Everything Elsehttp:ift.ttYFC0gzL How To Survive A Financial Crisis Like We Are Going Through TodayGiantQuarter " Blog Archive " End Of An Error By George Friedman Posted December 11th, 2013 at 08:40am Permalink Hello again readers, today marks the beginning of my last column for Stratfor.
