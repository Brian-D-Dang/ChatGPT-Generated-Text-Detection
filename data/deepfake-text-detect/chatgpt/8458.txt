I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends . The taste is invariably bitter, even when using fresh beans and a decent grinder at home; it seems that no matter what typebrand or roast level one uses...it's always there.....and sometimes too strong! So much so in factthat after trying various methods with different brewing techniques etc., some days are not complete without chocolate milk:)...which does tend on occasion help reduce bitterness....but certainly doesn't eliminate its presence completely from our lives!!:)
