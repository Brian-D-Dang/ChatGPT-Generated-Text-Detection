When the german leaders were put on trial after WWII, They claimed they were just following orders but it was decided that this was not good enough. Hitler could have said: "I am sorry I sent them to be shot" and he would still been found guilty of war crimes because his actions made a difference in what happened at these camps too bad for him so don't expect an apology from me either! If you are gay or lesbian then why should we lump all people who voted against equal rights with those hateful individuals?
