So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor culture. So are whites allowed to appropriate the things that black people have created? What do you think "blackface" is then lol
