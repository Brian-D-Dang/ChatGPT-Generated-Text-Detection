Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I understand what you are saying. However, it is often simpler and more practical to consider black and white as colors in a artistic and visual sense. In traditional color theory, black and white are referred to as "neutral colors" but they are still classified as colors. Ultimately, whether or not black and white are considered colors depends on the context and usage.
