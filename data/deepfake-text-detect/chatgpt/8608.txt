I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites for "new" jobs because we would be stuck with the old ones that were walking away from us. It has gotten progressively worse over time as my skills have evolved so much that I've realized there's not enough people like me out there who can handle the tasks of getting paid to work on something that is worth a lot more than we are making now. People seem mostly concerned about their own money, which seems kind of ironic considering you aren't letting them know what they're doing - you should probably pay them that extra 100hour if they want you to do it. You should definitely try to get some sort of incentive to make themselves even more productive (or maybe convince someone else) - but all your efforts are going towards something else. If this doesn't solve the problem, you might need to consider a different career path or perhaps take another step and find a new one. A simple change to an existing job will fix things very quickly, and I guarantee you that's what you'll end up asking yourself when starting a new one. And so let's hope you don't stop worrying about other people after you're done working here! In any case, thank you for taking the time to read this article.
