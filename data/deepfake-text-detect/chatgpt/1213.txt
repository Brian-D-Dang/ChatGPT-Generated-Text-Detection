I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info:) Now, while There is no doubt that it is a huge injustice for women to be paid lower than men in the sport of soccer, but is there any evidence that the women are actually playing better in the sport? Is there any evidence that women are playing worse than men in the sport? If so, how can we prove that the women are playing better? From the FIFA point of view, the answer is not obvious. WAGs' pay is lower than men's - they are paid less by FIFA. They also get less from sponsors. The U.S. has no real presence at the World Cup. So while the women are playing better in the sport, are we really paying them less? No. In fact, my guess is that the women are playing better because they are used to the pressure of being a part of the team, of being part of a winning environment and of having the support of their families. But why are we not making more money for women players? I ask this because the most successful women are not paid as much as their male counterparts. But remember, they are playing for a bigger prize. If you ever see a woman in a team, you are likely to see her playing well. Women
