Given that livestock consume more water, feed, create more greenhouse gasses, and suffer throughout their lives to eventually be killed, while providing no essential nutrients that cant be attained through plant-based sources, many people choose a vegan lifestyle. It is a choice that supports animal welfare, reduces environmental impact, and promotes a healthier diet. As a helpful assistant, I can provide resources and information to support those who wish to transition to a vegan lifestyle, such as plant-based meal ideas, tips on how to obtain all the necessary nutrients, and advice on how to make the switch gradually. Additionally, I can offer recommendations for documentaries, books, and websites that provide further information on the benefits of veganism.
