(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge any game developer. They are doing their job and make a living out of it. Now the problem with "game developers" is not just people who work for big companies, but also indie-devs as they have often more freedom than large "AAA" studios because they don't need to listen to corporate policies and can experiment freely without having much funding on hand. The main point being both sides - small devs and AAA - share similar problems. Some examples are below. The first one is how everyone hates last year's Hitman Absolution . If you haven't played this yet then do so right now before reading anything further. It was poorly developed due to lack of time by IO Interactive and bad decisions taken by them. But why would it anger the fans? Because every single person involved had no clue what he did. Game dev is hard enough when everything works well. When things go wrong, who's going blame anyone else but himself if he didn't check his code properly? No matter where you look at it, even after release, lots of issues were found in all levels except two ending ones and a few extra features added later. Maybe content wise, these games might be fun to play, however many bugs made sure nobody enjoyed playing it at all. Even worse thing is Square Enix decided to copy TLOU2 almost completely and put hitmen into it instead of creating something new. While TLOU wasn't perfect either, it took around 3 years from start till end, whereas HL1 came out just 2 months earlier. We should always compare different versions of Final Fantasy XIII or Dragon Age Origins rather than asking which version comes better since we won't know until they get released. Not only that but nearly everything about Valkyria Chronicles ended up copied in Revelations including combat style, UI layout etc. Even cut scenes looked very familiar despite never seeing them earlier. This is really unforgivable considering how long development went on. Another example is Fallout 3 (and its followups), even though it was an amazing story telling game, it suffered badly due to poor design choices concerning inventory management and weapons weighting system. Almost half a decade passed since then and Bethesda managed to create Fallout 4 totally revolutionizing the open world experience. Why wouldn't a company like them manage to keep tweaking it while making such dramatic changes? Well, they thought it would be easier to develop the sequel from scratch rather than remaking the entire game again. In addition to that, the original creator somehow ended up working for Bethesda themselves which isn't common practice at best. Since then, pretty much all of BioWare's titles followed suit with terrible story line written by someone else and very little interaction between missions each other (Mass Effect) or limited (Dragon Age series). Also, another key part of RPGs is character customization and personalization. Back in 2012, Mass Effect 2 received a lot of criticism due to characters being too generic with zero personality differences (except male Shepard looks slightly different). What happened to those complaints then? How come BioWare was able to fix it quickly with Andromeda? Unfortunately, most of the fixes didn't apply to older games immediately since EA owns rights over them. Another reason might possibly be budget cuts especially during recession times. These days publishers try making money off DLC as fast as possible at cost price. And Mass Effect franchise continued getting regular patches lagging behind Skyrim Same goes to Dragon Age: Inquisition which got delayed twice already and finally launched in 2014. All of this caused alot of troubles keeping players interested. Don't expect a franchise to get fixed unless budgets increase drastically for the sake of fixing its flaws. Modding community will likely help extend its life span anyway. Games nowadays are mostly done when finishing one iteration of a project, it certainly makes sense to take advantage of that kind of feature but there comes a point when quality needs to trump quantity. A final example is GTA 5 not receiving microtransactions however Rockstar approaching mining industry business model. No real surprise although some people said that may cause rifts within gaming communities which aren't true. So far nothing major seems to happen so hopefully Mr. Johnson saves us from future catastrophes like 2008 Flash crash fiasco where millions lost hundreds of thousands of dollars overnight and perhaps one day when it gets purchased, in the worst case scenario of buying an advanced bandage 'core competiton without paying for a dollar sign for staying behind
