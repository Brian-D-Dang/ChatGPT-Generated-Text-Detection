One counter-argument is that requiring a citizenship test to vote in the US would be a violation of the fundamental right to vote. The US Constitution guarantees that all citizens have the right to vote, and imposing additional requirements on that right would be discriminatory and could prevent eligible citizens from exercising their right to vote. Additionally, citizenship tests are not foolproof and reliable indicators of a person's eligibility to vote, and would lead to the disenfranchisement of eligible voters. Restricting voting rights in this way also goes against the principles of democracy and inclusivity. Rather than making it more difficult for citizens to vote, we should be working to make the voting process more accessible and inclusive to all eligible voters.
