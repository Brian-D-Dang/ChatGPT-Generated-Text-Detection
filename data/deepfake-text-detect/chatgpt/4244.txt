Sorry, this is mostly applicable to folks from the US, but feel free to weigh in no matter what. I'll bullet-point for my reasoning: More good folks are killed via drone strikes than you'd think, and they're carried out far more efficiently with drones than by other methods at present (gunfire, or lethal force). I'm not american so excuse me if i sound stupid but how do you know?
