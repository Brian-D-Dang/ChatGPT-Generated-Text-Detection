So, it's obvious to anyone who took a math class that the average number of sex partners between straight men and straight women must be the same. However, the median number of sex partners between straight men and straight women is 1.5. (source) Couple this with the fact that homosexuals have more partners on average than heterosexuals, and it's obvious that gays are somehow the "nature's error" side of the coin. But on the other hand, if the average number of partners for straight men and women is 1.5, then the median number of partners is 2.5. If the average number of partners is 1.5, then the median is 2.5 If the average number of partners is 2.5, then the median is 1.5 This just goes to show how stupid people are, and how they only know what they are told. Gays are a "median" phenomenon. So, gays are a median phenomenon. The most common phenomenon is the "average" phenomenon. Gays are the most common phenomenon, which is a median phenomenon. Therefore, gays are the most common median phenomenon. Posted by Robert Garmong at 11:35 PM Labels: gay rights, gays, homosexuality, lesbians, mathematics, median, sex, sexual partners
