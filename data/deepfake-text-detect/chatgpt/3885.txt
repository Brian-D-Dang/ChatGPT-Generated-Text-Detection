I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a new or used car at full price is often very expensive. Is there an economical way of getting used? Depends on the year and model (2012s13s are pretty cheap). There will be dealers who trade them for cash, some for trade-ins as well. You have to go to your local dealer though and ask if they'll do that. The problem with car shopping online nowadays is you never know what condition the vehicle has been in when its delivered, which can lead to buyer remorse later down the road.
