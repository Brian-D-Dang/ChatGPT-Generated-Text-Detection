Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than anyone else. It can also lead to a sense of superiority and even racism, as people tend to make assumptions about those who are different than them based on where they come from. Nationalism can also have political implications, as it can be used to manipulate populations into supporting certain ideals and policies. This is especially dangerous when it comes to authoritarian regimes, as nationalistic rhetoric can be used to justify oppressive measures.
