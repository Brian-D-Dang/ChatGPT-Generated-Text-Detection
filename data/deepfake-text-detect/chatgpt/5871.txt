I think its fair to say that most people dont give a single shit about morality unless they're driven by compassion"their conscience" or worried about being judged by others for not doing whats "right." However, it is the better angels of our nature that drive us to do the right thing and feel a sense of morality. It is a feeling of doing the right thing. This is what I mean by "moral" in the context of the thread. I dont mean morality in the sense of religion, I mean morality in the sense of doing the right thing. Moral is a social construct, even though it is not definable, it is still a social construct. The concept of morality is a social construct. It is derived from religion and society. It is not a social construct. Its origins are rooted in the belief that some people are inherently better than others. Morality is an emotional response, not a belief. You dont "inherently" know what is right and wrong. You are socialized into a culture and into religion which gives you a sense of what is right and wrong. I think its fair to say that most people dont give a single shit about morality unless they're driven by compassion"their conscience" or worried about being judged by others for not doing whats "right." That is anecdotal. It doesnt matter. However, it is the better angels of our nature that drive us to do the right thing and feel a sense of morality. It is a feeling of doing the right thing. You still have it backwards. Morality comes first, and is what drives us to do the right thing. Moral is a social construct No, it is not. This is where you are wrong. You dont "inherently" know what is right and wrong. You are socialized into a culture and into religion which gives you a sense of what is right and wrong. Yes, you are. That is how you are able to feel compassion. That is how you are able to feel empathy for other people. That is how you are able to understand what is right and wrong. You are able to do all of this because your socialization is telling you what is right and wrong. You cant do it any other way. You are not born with the ability to do any of this, you learn it from your culture and from your religion. This is where you are wrong. Morality comes first, and is what drives us to do the right thing. I dont think you understand the meaning of the word "moral." Moral is an emotional response, not a concept. You are not born with the ability to do any of this, you learn it from your culture and from your religion. Again, this is anecdotal and irrelevant. Moral is an emotional response, not a concept. This is where you are wrong. The word "moral" means more than that. The word "moral" is a concept that is built into our culture and into our religion. You cannot be moral without having a sense of what is right and wrong. You are not born with the ability to do any of this, you learn it from your culture and from your religion. Yes, you are. This is how you learn to be compassionate, this is how you learn to be empathetic, and this is how you learn to understand what is right and what is wrong. It is all a part of culture and religion. This is an anecdote. Anecdotal evidence is irrelevant to the discussion. Again, you are wrong. Morality is a social construct, not an emotional response. This is where you are wrong. The word "moral" means more than that. And I am right. Morality is an emotional response. A moral person is a person who feels empathy, compassion, and is able to understand what is right and what is wrong. This is the meaning of the word moral. Moral is not a social construct, that is a myth. Moral is an emotional response. The concept of moral is a social construct. But, you dont have to be religious to understand what is right and wrong. You can be atheist, or agnostic, and understand what is right and wrong. I am not wrong. Moral is an emotional response. The concept of moral is a social construct. I am right. Morality is not a social construct. Moral is not a social construct. It is not a social construct, you are wrong. Moral is an emotional response, not a concept. Again, this
