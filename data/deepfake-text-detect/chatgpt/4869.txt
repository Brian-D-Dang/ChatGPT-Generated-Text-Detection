Though my personal political views match those of Bernie Sanders much more than Hillary Clinton, I believe nominating Bernie could ultimately be very damaging for the progressive cause. My main concern is that he will not win and that a centrist like him would lead to further right-wing policies at all levels in Washington; this is after all what happened when Bill Clinton was elected President on two occasions. So here's why: Yes, we need someone who can beat Trump or Cruz, but it shouldn't just be "anybody." And even if you think any candidate with an R next to their name are going to do anything other than continue Obama's failed agenda and make things worse (please don't tell me they won't), then don't vote for them! What about third party candidates? Honestly, most Americans have never heard of Gary Johnson until now. If we nominate somebody without Blue America as part of our coalition, then we're choosing to elect another Donald J. Trump. This isn't good enough. We want people who actually fight back against Wall Street and Big Oil - not just get along with them by trying to work within the system. It doesn't matter how many debates or town halls we hold. The American People aren't stupid. They know these pro corporate Democrat politicians from New York City. With so many polls showing Bernie beating Trump handily, there should be no doubt among progressives that whoever wins this primary has been chosen because of their support from our movement. That's just common sense. So, before putting your finger into the dike and finding out too late which way water goes; let us try something new first. Let's play hardball instead of playing nice. Bernie supporters looking to unite around one candidate seems great and noble; however, uniting behind a politician and hisher position papers rather than volunteering time and talent makes less sense, especially given where the Democratic Party has gone since 2008. Yes, we've got some tough issues ahead and getting to yes may take longer than we'd hoped; nevertheless, we must start somewhere and taking an incremental approach - while dealing with actual problems like stagnant wages, student debt crisis, climate change, etc. - does little to draw attention away from the real issue: Wall street corruption and crony capitalism run amok. If Democrats truly cared about working class voters, they wouldn't wait over 15 years between presidential elections and require us to reelect old dinosaurs who favor big money donors. Are we really willing to allow yet another generation suffer economic hardship just because of nine men living on Park Avenue and others making hundreds of millions through insider stock trading schemes? Ugh!! There's nothing wrong with doing well once in awhile. But this kind of success almost always comes only when someone else fails. When we lose our homes and jobs, it's because someone took advantage of loopholes in regulation. Those bad guys made lots of money last year, and we need a president who'll close the loopholes so it doesn't happen again. When kids come home crying every night about how they can't afford college education or healthcare, it's usually due to skyrocketing tuition costs and greedy profiteers gouging consumers' wallets. Banksters caused both bubbles - what else can we expect? Similarly, whenever Congress acts quickly to bail out corporations failing under their own weight, it means they were pressured by campaign contributions. Lobbyists control everything, whether it's changing regulations to suit their needs or demanding massive tax breaks. Whoever gets chosen isn't going to suddenly turn into Theodore Roosevelt overnight; as much as I admire Senator Warren, she represents her state's interests. She supported TARP during its creation, supports continued military intervention abroad, favors business friendly trade agreements and wants to expand fracking. Unless she starts fighting back against such terrible policy decisions, why should anyone trust her willingness to reform the corrupt banking industry, break up major companies, shift priorities toward energy independence and end income inequality. In short, this nominee doesn't speak for most people; plus, with a Republican President, he'll likely go down as being responsible for all sorts of crazy ideas and backward thinking. You see, we live in a democracy. No matter how small a minority voice remains in politics, it eventually becomes loud enough to influence public opinion and push government policy backwards. As it happens today, liberals have a lot of power thanks to social media, open borders and mass immigration. Just look around the world and ask yourself why leftists are currently enjoying power across Europe. One reason might be because of excessive demographic growth fueled by liberal immigration laws. Countries like Germany and Sweden used to preach simple solutions to complex problems. Nowadays, mass migration - including illegal aliens - is destroying families, communities, economies and national sovereignty. Again, who benefits from creating chaos? Why, corporate executives, investors, lobbyists for multinational conglomerates and tech giants. Sure, America will still have its problems regardless of who wins the election. However, the next version of POTUS will face fewer hurdles attempting to pass meaningful legislation through congress unless the GOP regains majorities in both houses. By promoting high profile valueswe expect by example, get ready to test them out. But an F.DTF2 of 20, electing Majorcoverage to keep 2
