I'll try not to spoil anything here for people who haven't watched Game of Thrones, but this post is specifically about events in that show. So if you don't watch the series or have any questions let me know and I will do my best to help answer them! If you're a fan of GOT, check out rMyspace. You can find all sorts of other threads there.
