Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: 1) stambler gave a good answer, but his first sentence should be in quotes (and maybe reworded slightly), as that's simply an opinion of mine from my own experience revving old cars on low-octane fuel rather than something more definitive like "it will not hurt your engine." His second paragraph is spotless though - thankfully he let me know about Gumball 3000 so we could learn together:) 2nd delta for promoting increased literacy by allowing people another way they can make their point without caps lock... winner here would have been anyone else since stamboer beat them both up;) michaelbperry also provided some useful info via comments under other answerscomments which added clarity beyond just myself saying nope its fine:D
