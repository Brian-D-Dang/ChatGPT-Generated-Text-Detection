I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that they should have "done something to prevent it." Of course the first thing I think is "Well if you could tell me how exactly a person would avoid being raped tomorrow then we can start having this conversation.." But what usually happens instead are words like he she shouldn't wear such provocative clothes or maybe (as an example) not walk alone at night. Now again - these comments apply also when someone is mugged on the street but somehow those other crimes seem less important than some women supposedly wearing too little clothing. And even though security measures do exist which may help reduce crime, no one seems as interested in finding out why so many rapes happen despite said measures existing. There's always more money for law enforcement etc., never anything toward prevention education. The result? More women feel uncomfortable walking around outside while men don't bother doing things because apparently there isn't enough risk involved; so everyone loses except rapists who know their victim will be unable to defend herself without risking her own life... This was just meant as my opinion from personal experience! My father had taught us nothing really. He mostly ignored what happened after school until dinner time when he'd say stuff like 'if anyone ever tries to touch your butt uninvited kick them right between the legs' sure I wasn't going to forget THAT one!! Seriously his advice during arguments were rarely helpful beyond telling mum to shut up every single damn day.. At least once he told dad off, following him home crying saying HE WOULDN 'T LET ANYONE TOUCH HIM NO MATTER WHAT AND HE WAS GOING TO FIGHT BACK!!!! I was 12 years old. When I started dating boys (yes girls did back then) they used to ask me questions like "Do your parents beat you?" and similar stupid crap. What bothered most growing up was feeling isolated. Noone else seemed comfortable talking about sex either, especially not boys whose idea of foreplay consisted mainly of grabbing boobs whenever possible. Most adults didn't understand kids much better although our parents tried hard anyway. Much later as teenagers my friends and I discovered masturbation together. Boys couldn't come close to understanding each others experiences. Unfortunately internet communities haven't changed much since then. For decades now society has been taught only 2 modes of sexual interaction: Rape Approved (by husband). Yet surely consent must include communication?! I still find myself wondering sometimes where 99 of common knowledge regarding human sexuality came from!? How does one teach children that its okay to kiss strangers BUT NOT okay to penetrate them unless both parties agree?? Not sure anymore whether youth theatre plays contributed much...... Anyway thanks for reading haha x
