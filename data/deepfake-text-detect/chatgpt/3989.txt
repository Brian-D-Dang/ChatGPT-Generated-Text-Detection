Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as you can see from the article, there is evidence that can back up their claims: "One of our most recent research projects revealed that in Hungary approximately 400,000 people are involved in illegal activity, which corresponds roughly to the population of Chicago," says Dr. Peter Molnar, a Hungarian-born biologist who headed the study. It's true though; not everybody does any illegal activities (some even do them for fun).
