I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was literally shocked at the level of deception that is present in this story even though it's pretty well-known history now. It also made me extremely uncomfortable to see how desperately he wanted everyone to like him when clearly they didn't.
