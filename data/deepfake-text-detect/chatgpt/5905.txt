Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for women who objectify themselves. I'm not a fan of the idea. There are plenty of women who don't objectify themselves. (I'm one of them.) But I'm also a big fan of women who do. I mean, why can't I be a fan of those who do? I believe that women are beautiful and worthy of respect. I just don't believe that femininity is something to be ashamed of. I want the men to look at us, to see us, to notice us, to want us. I want the women to look at us, to see us, to notice us, to want us. I'm an adult woman, a daughter, a wife, and a mom. I'm a piano teacher, a stay at home mom, and a professional writer. I want to be beautiful, I want to be noticed, I want to be desired. But, I want to be me first and foremost. I think that most people understand what I mean, but I fear that there are some who will not. That's why I write. I want to be understood, I want to be heard. I want to be respected. My hope is that I can represent the femininity that I wish to represent. I hope I can do it without being criticized. If I can, I think it will help people to understand and to accept. If I can't, I hope I can help others to understand and accept anyway. Posted by Stephanie Cox at 9:45 PM Labels: feminism, women
