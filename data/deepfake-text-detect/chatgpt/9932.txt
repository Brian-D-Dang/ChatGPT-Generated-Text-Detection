I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to actually use these elements in practical scientific applications. This is true. Ununpentium and ununtrium are both synthetic elements that exist only under laboratory conditions. They have extremely short half-lives, meaning they decay quickly and are not available to be studied or used in any meaningful way. This also means that they're not stable enough to be used in practical scientific applications.
