This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... When this all began for me back in January 2014, I was a fairly moderate left leaning conservative woman. My wall-of-text right wing tirades were few and far between. However, a lot of shit hit close to home for me over time (including rape threats from men who also threatened real life violence against women) that caused me to reevaluate myself as an individual when it comes to issues like Gamergate or even just feminism itself. It's weird because most people would probably think my views have changed due to someone saying something about them they don't agree with, especially since one of my first posts was about how Anita Sarkeesian has been targeted by these jerks before she ever got started. But no...I'm still moving along down that road towards being more right wing than liberal. In fact I've already talked about this issue elsewhere on The Daily Shoah, which will get into why GamerGate is bad news for both sides of the political spectrum. So what am I talking about? Well Internet culture, video games specifically, and what it means online among those who are not used to being around each other outside their little cliques offline. And let's start with what happened recently: A teen boy allegedly told his mother he hated her after watching Supergirl - Star City Chronicles Season 3 Episode 13 "You're Dead"A lot of parents out there will recognize that episode title; it references the infamous Cosplay porn scandal, in addition to showing off Constantine channeling fellow CW super hero Green Arrow. For those unfamiliar with the story, Twilight actor Peter Facinelli, Jr., aka Jeffrey Dean Morgan, made 35 million dollars appearing as DC Comics character Constantine...a bit player role so small that many fans never knew him, even though he played comic book villains Batman Bane. As part of that gig, Morgan appeared nude on camera having sex with another man while dressed up as fantasy world version of a classic superhero.That night Jeffrey Dean Morgan tweeted himself claiming innocence, stating that the photos taken during filming had leaked in spite of his best efforts, and we should take things at face value without seeing any evidence contrary to his claims, including any proof of hacking etc. This led to Coulter posting the full transcript of Morgan's text message conversation with his ex wife, Yvonne Breiner. Shortly afterwards Morgan dropped dead of a heart attack. Apparently he felt guilty about doing such nasty stuff, but then again...it might actually help explain his sudden demise if the coroner finds out he died doing BDSM fetishes on film. Of course, just because Morgan dies now doesn't mean he couldn't have done it years ago without anyone noticing. After all, he had been hinting at his past for quite awhile prior to dying. If nothing else, it looks like he was finally starting to come clean, and instead paid dearly to cover it up. Then it came out that he apparently stole tens of thousands of dollars worth of money from Yvonne's bank account....which seems rather strange considering she didn't approve of his saucy activities. Either way it turns out Morgan lied; he obviously wasn't innocent, and whoever did leak the pics likely gave us access to the whole conversation via texts back in 2013. Why would someone do that unless they wanted everyone to hear it anyway (and clearly it was meant to be public)? What person in their right mind could possibly believe this story makes sense? I know I sure wouldn't be buying it, yet despite the massive pile of lies (the biggest one being his claim that the photos weren't stolen), plenty of people seemed ready to buy it, so much so that attorney Mark Geragos suddenly declared his client murdered, seeking justice for his death by accusing Myra Morgan of murder herself. He went further stating Morgan deserves sympathy, suggesting murderers feel remorseful for killing someone due to guilt alone. That argument leads nowhere, because regardless of intent, blackmailers can't make victims feel guilty or sorry for getting caught stealing someone's belongings. When confronted, Morgan said that no matter what Weeden outed him for..he loved her enough to keep her safe. "He [Weeden] would die before telling anybody anything," Morgan explained."The only reason she'd tell anyone is if somebody killed him. She loves him too much. There is absolutely no way this woman would betray him. Even if I told her that someone wants me dead, nobody knows that."Now granted...Morgan and his lawyer may well be lying through their teeth at times. They seem awfully eager to shift blame onto others or brush away very serious accusations, until they figure out the next tactic to counterattack. Yet either way, he made public remarks in which he claimed total innocence. Nowadays celebrities rarely say publicly they are going to commit suicide, even if they really are suicidal. You'd think Morgan would want to avoid making statements implying he might fallow our return to earth, pull our poor plan failproperly; all rightie osat right'os moved:earthy long lost: that
