I'm very confused and bothered by the amount of ads for prescription medications that run on television and in magazines. In my mind, the reason that these medications can only be prescribed is because they have been proven to help people with their health problems... This isn't always true. Some drugs are used as a means to make money off sick patients or just to keep them addicted long enough until it's profitable (see: Oxycontin).
