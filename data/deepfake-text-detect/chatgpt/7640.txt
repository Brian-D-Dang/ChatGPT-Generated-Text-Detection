While it may seem like a humane option to allow prisoners to end their own lives, it is important to consider the potential consequences of such a policy. First, it could create a perverse incentive for prisons to encourage or even coerce prisoners into ending their own lives rather than providing appropriate care and rehabilitation. Second, it could lead to wrongful deaths if prisoners make impulsive decisions or are not fully capable of understanding the consequences of their actions due to mental illness or other factors. Additionally, some may argue that allowing prisoners to die by suicide implies that they are not worth investing in as individuals with the potential for growth and redemption. It is therefore important to prioritize mental health care and rehabilitation in prisons rather than simply providing the option for prisoners to end their own lives.
