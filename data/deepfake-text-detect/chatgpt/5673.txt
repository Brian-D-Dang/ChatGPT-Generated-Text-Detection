First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces everyone to downvote everything that is not a good post. So the entire system is designed to overtly deny any and all posts that are not "good." The end result is a hivemind that is unable to accept any new idea, and generally ignores everything that does not fit within a very narrowly defined criteria. The only way to deal with this is to simply put up with it and be patient. Anything else is just useless. The only way to deal with this is to simply put up with it and be patient. Anything else is just useless. This is the same thing I say to get people to stop smoking pot. Just stop smoking pot and wait for the long term effects to kick in. I agree with you, but I don't have the patience to deal with it. As a result, I spend most of my time in the rcointalk subreddit. That's why I wanted to make this post. I don't think I would be a part of a hivemind. I just don't have the patience to deal with these people. It is so obnoxious. Why would it be obnoxious to point out that a new user has a banned account and should not be here? I have no idea why he's been banned. But I'm not going to call out all of the other comments because I don't want to appear petty and I don't have the patience to be in the midst of that hivemind. The comments I wrote were fair. I pointed out something he has done that has been against Reddit policy and asked him to look at it. I'm not calling him names. I think he's just a newbie and deserves a chance. Sorry to hear that. I think reddit has a very positive effect on the cryptocurrency community. Perhaps there is a way to make the cointalk sub even better. The comment section on cointalk is pretty good. A lot of people post there. I think it's the best place to get the latest news about coin X. There are so many news sites. It's hard to keep up with them all. But I do follow other places. Also, I think cryptocurrency is a very new thing. The internet wasn't around when most of the current rules and regulations were written. So I don't think the rules are so clear cut.
