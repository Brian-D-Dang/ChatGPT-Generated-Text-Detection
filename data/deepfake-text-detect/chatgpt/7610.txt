Counter-argument: While the concept of gun rights may not be literally derived from nature, it can be argued that the right to defend oneself and to own property is a universal natural right that is recognized and protected by many legal systems. This includes the right to possess the means of self-defense, which in modern times often includes firearms. Additionally, the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms, which is a product of a social contract between the government and citizens. Therefore, while the idea of gun rights may not be divinely ordained, it is grounded in natural rights and is a fundamental aspect of the social contract between citizens and the state.
