While it is true that controlling behavior is generally not considered healthy in relationships, expecting your partner to remain faithful is not inherently controlling. In fact, it is a common and reasonable expectation in most monogamous relationships. It is important for both partners to establish boundaries and expectations regarding fidelity, and if one partner is uncomfortable with the other having sex outside the relationship, it should be discussed and respected. Trust and mutual respect are key components of a healthy relationship, and setting boundaries based on these values is not necessarily controlling. However, it is important to examine the intent behind the request and ensure that it is not rooted in insecurity or lack of trust, which could lead to controlling behavior.
