Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that I have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. The way items work etc are so much more balanced between heroes it boggles my mind how LoL has managed to stay at such an unhealthy level of champions. Same here!:D lol was ok but.. its not even comparable with dota2
