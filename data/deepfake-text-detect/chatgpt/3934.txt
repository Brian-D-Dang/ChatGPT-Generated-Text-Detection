Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as possible. With this in mind, my question is: how can we encourage more people to make pension contribution? Would it be good if there are new rules that say pensions should be made before retirement age (e.g., we work until 60, pay our taxes till 65)? Eventually people will learn about inflation and saving for old age. If not now then when they realise what they're getting into, perhaps after retiring. The time might come to withdraw money from their accounts, but at least they'll know why it's necessary.
