Some Definitions Islamism - Political Movements that use Islam to justify either their end goals (ie. a religious state, or "caliphate or the means they use (ie. violence, terrorism). Islam is not a terrorist organization and never has been according to what I have read in recent years. In fact it was a major force behind the Arab Spring movements of 2011 which replaced dictatorships with democracies across North AfricaMiddle East!! So please be careful when using this word as it can be used very loosely!!! I am an ex-Muslim who converted from Christianity because my family decided to become Muslim but later on left due to their extreme views towards everything including music and movies and also how they treated women (who are viewed as second class citizens) and homosexuals etc... However i do see the point that extremist Muslims make many comments about Western countries such as America being corrupt or just plain evil so its not all one sided like there's good people out there too!
