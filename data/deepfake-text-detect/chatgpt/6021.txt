With the advent of self-driving vehicles, the unavoidable will become clear: people are terrible drivers, and operating your own car is unacceptably reckless if a better alternative exists. I see the addition of self-driving features as a natural evolution of what we already have. The next generation of cars will be capable of reducing accidents and fatalities, and it's about time we got rid of the scourge of distracted driving. Just consider: in 2016, there were 3,450 fatalities in the United States from distracted driving. Why continue to allow this to happen when technology is here to help? Even if you aren't on the fence, there are still a number of points to consider about what it would mean to have self-driving cars. What would they look like? What would they do? How will they be used? There's plenty to think about. To begin, I want to make it clear that I believe the possibility of self-driving cars is very real. I also believe that these features should be added to cars as soon as possible. As a proponent of this idea, I've spent a good amount of time thinking about what these cars would look like, how they would be used, and what kind of people would use them. Here are a few of my thoughts about what it would look like for us to drive cars with the ability to drive themselves. Probably the biggest question on most people's minds is what a self-driving car would look like. Would they look like a car at all? Would they be completely autonomous, even to the point of not being able to be driven? If these cars are going to exist, they're going to look like something. I believe that they'll look a lot like the Tesla Model S: sleek and smooth, with a minimalist design. They will be aerodynamic and efficient. The cars will be shaped to be as safe as possible. The problem with self-driving cars is that they're more akin to a computer than to a car. And people aren't used to seeing a computer as something that can be very stylish. At the same time, it's important that we remember that cars aren't just a way to get from place to place. They're also a status symbol. They're a way to show people what kind of person you are, how much money you have, and how much you care about the environment. I expect that these cars will look a lot like the Tesla Model S, but with a more minimalist, aerodynamic design. They'll be all electric, which will help minimize the impact of the car on the environment. They'll also be sleek and smooth, which will make them look like the cars that we're used to seeing, but also different. Because we've never seen these before, they'll look a bit strange at first. But we'll get used to them. And they'll be fun to drive. With a self-driving car, you won't need to own a car. We're used to thinking about owning a car as a way to get around. But if we're going to use self-driving cars, we're going to have to think about owning a car as a way to get from place to place. I think we're going to see a shift in the way that we think about owning a car. Instead of thinking of it as a way to get from place to place, we'll think of it as a way to get from work to home or vice versa. We'll be able to summon a self-driving car, and then take it wherever we need to go. If we're going to work, we'll summon a self-driving car to get us there. Once we're done with work, we'll summon a self-driving car to get us home. This will be done through a smartphone app. You'll be able to tell it where you need to go, and it'll get there. You'll be able to make your way to work, and then back home. You won't have to worry about driving yourself. This will be possible because you'll be able to share self-driving cars. If you want to go to work, you'll summon one, and then return it to where you got it from. That car will then be available for someone else to summon. There will be a number of cars, so you'll never be stranded. You'll be able
