First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" has. And secondly...it just sounds like code for giving women more government entitlements (like welfare or food stamps) paid maternity leave than men get in many places! Which makes me think: why do you want to be called an egalitee? Do tell..lol
