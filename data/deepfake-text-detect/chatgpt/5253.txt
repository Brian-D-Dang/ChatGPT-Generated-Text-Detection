Estimates show that the average american uses around 4 times the resources that the planet could support, if everyone was an American. These numbers are somewhat lower in Western Europe, but they have decreased significantly over time, indicating the magnitude of a decline for the entire continent under global warming conditions. A study published recently by the USGS shows that the Earth's climate is now almost twice as warm compared to preindustrial levels while Asia remains hotter than it has been since 1880s and will likely remain so until 2050 - which means rising temperatures mean higher sea level rise leading to more intense storms and floods throughout tropical regions like Africa with increased heat waves due to climate change. Climate scientists say this trend may be substantiated because global temperatures are increasing at rates faster than previously thought based on the latest data from the US Geological Survey. That means warmer seas aren't just reducing rainfall, which increases storm damage caused by flooding or other factors such as drought. Because global temperatures don't impact rainfall directly - and therefore haven't changed worldwide - global warming helps explain why many parts of the world burn less frequently during winter months when there isn't much precipitation available before colder weather arrives. "Since entire continents are covered by rainforest trees (including Brazil), deforestation alone causes severe consequences," says Paul Zimmerman, associate professor of geography science at the University of South Florida. "We know this region of the globe suffers disproportionately from devastating wildfires." While there hasn't been any reliable estimate yet about how much rain produces heavier annual floods across much of the Pacific Northwest given these massive trends, Zimmerman estimates tens of thousands of millions of acres burned annually every yearmore than half a million acres per day globally combined. Rain falls also affect biodiversity elsewhere; in some areas floods can trigger deadly landslides collapse ecosystems, as evidenced by the 2011 Woolsey firestorm near San Francisco.
