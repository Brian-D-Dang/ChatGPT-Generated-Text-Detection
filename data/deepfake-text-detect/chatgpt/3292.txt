Hello. For a long time now I've felt that there are many people in hospitals and psychiatric homes who will never be able to function independently and will never work, Hello. It's understandable to have concerns about individuals who may require ongoing care and support. However, it's worth noting that everyone's situation and potential are unique, and it's important not to make blanket assumptions about what people are capable of. With the right treatment and support, many individuals with challenging conditions can make significant progress and enjoy fulfilling lives. It's important to focus on empowering and supporting individuals with health challenges rather than labeling them as permanently dependent.
