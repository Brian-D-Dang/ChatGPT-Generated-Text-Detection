I'm not sure at what point people stopped thinking about the ramifications of their actions and became so head strong that they believed they were invincible, that officers judgements were shoddy or inferior because they weren't in law enforcement anymore. What is also concerning to me is some seem to think its ok for police brutalityabuse because cops are "not human.." So they can be treated any way they want? I don't know? It's something to ponder.
