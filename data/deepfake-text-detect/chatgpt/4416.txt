To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific or strong scientific evidence that eating meat is the healthiest choice for humans (though there are plenty of other reasons not to). I've never been able to wrap my head around how someone could enjoy torturing another living being for their own pleasure - but I'm sure it happens all the time, because if you think about it too much suffering becomes abstracted away from your experience of life as a whole: You just start thinking about it in isolation instead of focusing on what matters more, which is the happiness or joy you feel when you're interacting with something else alive. Everything from medical science to pop culture confirms this idea; people who watch horrific horror movies but don't get nightmares afterwards have learned, at some level, to "turn off" the part of our brains that registers pain and turns them into viewers rather than participants. And so they find themselves enjoying watching others suffer even though they'd be sickened by experiencing such things firsthand. It doesn't work like that with eating flesh. When you choose to devour a cow who had her entire existence spent separated from everything she loves, who was only allowed to live out half of her potential lifespan before being forced to die along with countless millions of other beings, this is your conscious decision every step of the way. The parts of you that care about injustice and cruelty aren't separate from the rest of your body: They share space inside you, and since you already love yourself, these feelings must be reflected somewhere deep within you where they contribute to letting go of any sense of separateness. These feelings make you happy, yes, but it isn't possible to make decisions based solely on one emotion inside us without affecting all emotions inside ourselves, because they're all linked together through neural pathways. So while you might derive positive emotional responses from consuming meat, ultimately those positive responses will be preceded by negative ones that require processing by the rational brain anyway. That means none of this changes anything for anyone involved in the process, including you. (In fact, it probably makes things worse.) There may be exceptions (like extremely wealthy individuals), but again, what you understand here should also apply across society as a whole except perhaps by small margins. If there were some sort of massive global catastrophe tomorrow that killed tens of billions of people and the survivors needed food, then cannibalism would become okay again. But that won't happen. In any case, by that point, you'll likely know better anyway. Why electrocute yourself forever?
