While it may seem like the portrayal of women in video games is harmless, research has shown that it can have negative effects on society. Studies have found that sexist depictions of women in video games contribute to the acceptance and perpetuation of gender-based violence and discrimination. Video games are a powerful form of media, and the way that women are portrayed in them can shape societal attitudes and beliefs about women. As such, it is important to promote positive and respectful depictions of women in video games in order to create a more equitable and just society for all.
