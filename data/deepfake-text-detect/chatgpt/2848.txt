Hello everyone, with all the media coverage lately regrading transgender individuals I find myself uneducated on the particular subject and would love to be enlightened on the topic. I support the idea of a third gender designation but why is it that only males can have male genitals while females are fine? Why does society not accept females being born with two sets of genitalia or even three if you know what im talking about? I have heard many arguments for this in my life time from an early age as well as now but no one has ever been able to explain it clearly enough for me so i will throw out some questions at ya'll today.. What's up with physiological differences between genders anyway? Is there any correlation between sex organs and brains and how they develop? Sorry for the weird question guys (not really haha) but thanks in advance! Edit: I am always open to discussion
