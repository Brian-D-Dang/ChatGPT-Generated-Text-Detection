Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of stuff about textual criticism which just isn't true. It's not that they're wrong in their general argumenttextual critics are useful for knowing how texts were originally written (which can be very important) but many details don't seem to hold up under close scrutiny. Most famously, as has been mentioned by others here, is the way most scholars believe Paul invented Greek words where he didn't have an equivalent, but this doesn't match any observation we now make about language or grammar. There was also something like a 100 rate of "conclusion jumping" in Biblical scholarship in the 70s and 80s, with people making claims based off one verse or passage without thinking through everything else surrounding it. The academic climate changed quickly though once more conservative scholars began taking over departments at major universities around the country again. Finally, while biblical studies might often be called "historical," much of what happens looks far too similar to modern politics than actual historical research to me: politicians spend years crafting legislation, working out logistics and getting compromise; historians do this between two sides who both claim to know all the facts and weigh them against each other; experts come up with proposals, lay out evidence for and against those proposals, propose compromises, etc. With these differences in mind, let me ask you guys questions related to the above-mentioned areas of contention: Have there been any examples where textual analysis showed that Christians had done pretty much exactly what's claimed? If so, would you consider that good evidence, bad evidence, or neither?
