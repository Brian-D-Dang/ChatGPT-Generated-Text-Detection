EDIT: a portion of replies I'm getting are focused on the defination of'libertarian' and the rainbow of american groups that claim it for their particular beliefs. If in doubt, replace'libertarian' with 'communism', as you're reading this article from iHeartMedia's Blog Wire. Yes they do. But right now libertarians aren't entirely free-marketeers, and there has been some discussion about banning fracking because it raises environmental concerns by increasing pollution levels which threaten public health.
