I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think scientists approach their experiments and observations in general; they are almost always done with a predetermined goal or end result (i.e., not just something arbitrarily in mind). But you're right about them being very methodical and careful when doing these sorts of things - experimenters may be interested in confirming its presence but often won't even bother unless there's actually evidence (such as seeing particles move away from an observer at high enough speeds, etc.). You can never have too many facts! Well, okay maybe only one fact per post;) And you could say: "The universal constant C is the speed of light!" which would technically mean 2 facts...but more fun only counts once!
