So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal , which includes the nuclear weapons that were mentioned in a previous post, how do you think they will proceed? You know that though your country has nukes, your enemies probably don't so what if one side launches all theirs before the other can respond. What would be the cost-benefit ratio for such an act? 2: How many countries currently possess such technology (other than USRussia)? And at least from 1980 onwards when there are numerous reports of China building missiles to reach anywhere on earth within hours it seems like every government should want them too! So why aren't any more developing these type devices? The internet could answer part of this but we haven't built anything close yet right? I'm curious as to whether or not anyone else shares this opinion. It appears that most people believe in deterrence because they don't understand it enough and assume that neither side wants war unless it's unavoidable but that doesn't make sense to me since wouldn't by definition both sides wish to avoid getting involved in a conflict even if only politically speaking? Any help appreciated thank you. If someone can also explain why the West hasn't developed advanced weaponry please include some links or articles etc:) thanks again. EDIT - To clarify a bit further. My question really pertains to the U.S., Russia and perhaps IranChina specifically rather than the situation between two nations who currently have no official military presence. A hypothetical example would be if North Korea attacked South Korea in the name of reunification without prior warning of course responses wouldn't necessarily be instant militarily but yeah thats basically where I am coming from haha sorry if its confusing. A: Nuclear Deterrence Works. Deterrence works exactly as intended. In order for a nation to launch against another starting world war over territorial disputes, requires agreement between the leaders of each belligerent state that they are willing to go to war because of territory held. That means that both parties are convinced that victory is possible. This makes those states very unlikely to attack until they feel forced into attacking first, and then once started, almost impossible to stop. As long as a third party exists that isn't concerned about loss of life, the deterrent effect remains high: Even if the losing side didn't care much for human life (as Russia historically did), the winning side must decide that the risk of dying is lower than having all their cities destroyed (and the civilian casualties incurred) by the enemy. Unless they're crazy, they won't launch early just to reduce casualties later on.
