This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use or condition of the property is, only that it's truly a free and clear title to which you have sole ownership (i.e. no liens). The reason why so many municipalities are using special assessments isn't because they don't know how to assess properly; rather, special assessment means there is nothing stopping them from charging whatever they wantwhich results in higher rates for everyone else. I'm sorry but this just doesn't work. There would still need to be some mechanism by which taxpayers could challenge these high tax bills - if someone was being charged excessive amounts simply due to ridiculous speculation then surely at least part way through the process people will find out their bill looks suspect? Why wouldn't we implement something similar where the taxpayer can call an appeals service when there seems to be a problem with the method used to calculate taxes etc...
