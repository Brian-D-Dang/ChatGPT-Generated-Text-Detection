Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the ones marked "Handicap" (or normally reserved for low-income people) are filled up, and therefore not available to me as a non-handicapped person. It makes no sense at all that these places would be used by disabilitiyes like ours if they didn't want them filled with disabled peoples cars. I am not asking you to write us off; we're citizens of this country too and deserve our rights as human beings just because someone else is inconvenienced by it.
