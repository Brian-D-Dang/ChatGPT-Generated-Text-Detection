I think English should not be the international language for these reasons: It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words here uBrotherChe makes a really good job in explaining this. Just listen and you will get all I'm going into details about pronunciation of names, verses and so on... Don't expect too much. My native language (norwegian) can understand me just fine even though I don't know norwegian practically at ALL! And from my experience with english-speaking people who are basically foreigners themselves but speak perfect german or french, it seems as if they struggle more when trying to learn another language than we do because there simply isn't any "native" way to learn their own language either.
