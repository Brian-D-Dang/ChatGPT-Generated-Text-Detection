To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, the argument that incestuous marriage is seen as immoral and should not be allowed because of this is invalid in the eyes of many people, as homosexuality was once viewed by many as immoral and is now accepted in much of society. Therefore, I would argue that just as society evolved to accept homosexuality, it can also evolve to accept incestuous relationships in certain cases. In other words, I believe that if two consenting adults are willing to enter into a committed relationship, then they should be allowed to do so regardless of whether or not the relationship is considered incestuous. The primary concern with incestuous marriage should not be morality but rather the potential health risks associated with such unions. Incestuous relationships can result in genetic disorders due to the increased chance of recessive genes being passed down from both partners. It is important to recognize that while these health risks may be greater than those associated with non-incestuous unions, they can still be managed with proper medical care. Finally, I would argue that any laws governing incestuous marriages should be crafted carefully to protect vulnerable individuals. For instance, there should be age restrictions to prevent minors from entering into such relationships, as well as criminal penalties for those who abuse the system. In conclusion, I believe that an argument could be made in favor of allowing incestuous marriage in certain circumstances, as long as proper precautions are taken to protect those involved.
