I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This doesn't seem like a relevant point, though; we're not talking about a national election or getting our guy into office here- it's just an online poll of people who want Bernie in this subreddit. It seems less important than you think because there will be plenty more polls taken between now and the convention.
