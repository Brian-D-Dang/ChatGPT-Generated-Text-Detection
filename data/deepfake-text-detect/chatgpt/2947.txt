Edit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) This isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a bit selfish, right? Hunting is an act of self defense and conservation in North America. In other parts of the world where humans are not the primary predator they do live off killing others, because that is just how things work out there possibly due to lack of proper law enforcement.
