Every election year this is one of the most popular complaints against candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. "So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so far has offered no concrete ideas," voters complain (and rightly). For many politicians that may be true - in fact it probably still holds for many incumbents who have never had a serious challenger before they won their first seat. But some people are better at explaining themselves than others; Biden shines here because as vice president his work on issues like healthcare reform was chronicled extensively by media outlets around America. He knows whereof he speaks. And yet even more important is that we know from experience which side he'll come down on when push comes to shove with Congress. In 2009-2010, despite holding just 51 seats in the Senate Democrats got 60 votes together supporting what became known as ObamaCare simply through Joe Manchin being willing to vote yes instead of 'no.' That gives me confidence today about how Biden will govern if elected. For those reasons I'm voting for him tomorrow.
