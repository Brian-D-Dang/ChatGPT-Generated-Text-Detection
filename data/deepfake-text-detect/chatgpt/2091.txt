Edit: Thanks for all the info. I more or less quit responding because a couple people effectively changed the way I was looking at the issue. To be honest though, it's hard to stop thinking about this stuff when you are in love with someone who is going through something like that and thinks everything will turn out fine anyway. If she wants me to stick around while she figures shit out then so do i but if things don't work out between us on her end It would probably put an even bigger strain than now on my own mental health If she wants me to stick around while she figures shit out then so do i but if things don't work out between us on her end It would probably put an even bigger strain than now on my own mental health I'd say thank god your not one of those guys that gets married without having considered these issues first... Because what makes sense from our perspective can make no sense whatsoever from hers..
