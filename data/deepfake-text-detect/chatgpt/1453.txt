So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal , that would mean that the US has been able to launch an unprecedented amount (or at least proportionate) of missiles into North Korea in just over two weeks. I don't believe for one second Trump or his administration are simply "stalling" missiles being fired. 2: If you look closely when it comes time to fire off these missiles there seems to be far more than usual. 3: We know China cannot do shit because if a missile falls short, then China will not even send help to retrieve said downed missile. 4: The Kim regime knows exactly how much firepower each missile carries so why wouldn't they try to retaliate against this? 5: Kim doesn't like losing face, which means he's going to keep launching until someone retaliates back whether its firing shells from ships, fighter jets etc... Or again civilians who could die horribly due to a nuclear strike on SeoulTokyo. 6: To put things into perspective.. Canada can hit us fairly well considering we've had enough experience since WWII, but any kind of attack on NK without coming out looking weak should get our asses kicked by our military friends. 7: You'd think after all these years we wouldn't need to rely heavily on other countries to defend us anymore; but let me tell you something - we still do! 8: And for those wondering what else beyond all this rhetoric between America NK, besides the obvious threats towards SK, Japan might have.. Well lets just say unless some miracle happens where a bomb hits them first.. we're donezo. 9: So yeah I'm calling BS and saying North Korea wants nothing to really happen apart from South Koreans finally waking up ans understanding the scale of threat this actually poses to them as opposed to trying to make "kimmy sun yung cry." 10-11: Just remember when talking about north koreans 'they' dont speak English nor does anyone else except maybe old people... Think Kim Jong Un speaks French.
