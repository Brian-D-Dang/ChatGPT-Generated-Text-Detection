Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between people. The problem with Socialism and communism was that these were state run systems, giving the government complete control of everything from how much gas you use to what your job will be.. This did not work well in practice as after a while it started to become corrupt (like all things) and those who ran them used the power they had for their own personal gain instead of doing whats best for society at large.
