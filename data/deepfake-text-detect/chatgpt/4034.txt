The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here] . Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do nothing and evil people to do everything, that takes religion. I think the headline in this piece misses a huge point: The fundamental nature of Christianity isn't about taking on the world but about taking care of the individual (as Christ did) - which makes "Jesus" and his followers anathema to rational atheists like me who hold a truly secular worldview, one where humans are free to pursue their own lives as they see fit. I don't fear death so much because there's no God at work to take it away; my fear stems from overpopulation, environmental destruction, wars, poverty, disease, natural disasters, etc., not some invisible force more powerful than anything we could possibly imagine.[1]. And if there was a god and he promised eternal life to mankind in exchange for our personal sacrifice to him, how could any atheist ever believe such a promise? Australia has considered banning eternal life for its citizens since 1977.[2] As it turns out, it's not nearly as simple as keeping your word, either. In fact, many people will never be able to live with themselves knowing what kind of a monster Jesus was. So it goes without saying that while having faith is important (and if you're reading this, then you probably already have) your religious beliefs should necessarily be aligned only with those of other believers - neither imposing them nor rejecting them. If we all tried to impose our views upon everyone else, we'd end up as screwed-up worms with no hope except for Christianity. This is also why Eastern religions often say that the key to peace lies within individuals' hearts rather than in any supernatural forces outside the mind. We need to find ways to understand each other better instead of simply trying to make ourselves into something new and hardheaded by placing our values onto others. It seems that most critics of secularism tend to fall into two camps: Those who believe that the best way forward will involve convincing enough religious people to change their minds, and those who don't want anyone replacing them. Many people are perfectly capable of finding their own solutions even when others try to force them into adopting theirs; just ask Bill Gates. I'm firmly the latter type myself, and partly the former too, although I remain convinced that America has become a very dangerous place to live in the last nine years thanks largely to the actions of unbelievers (who lack religion). Simply put, the current state of affairs calls for drastic measures to remove the threat of atheism from both sides of the aisle, whether believers or nonbelievers or whatever else we happen to call ourselves. It may even mean leading by example yourself. In all reality, it doesn't matter how many atheists I shake hands with today, it still affects my day tomorrow. There's always someone somewhere whose life I have impacted positively. Whether it's been through my donations to charity, through being a real friend, or through my time spent participating in civic groups or sports leagues, I know that every little bit counts. A lot of people wouldn't bother giving back to society if they didn't feel good about helping others, and this gives me pride too. Yes, it is true the radicalization of Islam under Islamic rule is a problem - but we must remember that all religions suffer the same fate. Too many people confuse Islam with extremism because extremist Muslims kill hundreds of innocent children among thousands of civilians daily using gas masks and AK47 assault rifles. They slaughter women for sport and rape amongst men. These acts are far worse than Christian militancy during World War II and are committed not by a minority but by a majority. America is not defined by the antics of Christians and many Americans consider themselves Christians. However, for many Americans believing in God helps ease their depression and anxiety. Millions of Americans attend church regularly, including 20 of African American adults according to polling from Pew Research Center. According to the National Institutes of Health, having regular contact with God and attending prayer services actually does improve mental health.[45] When mental illness is present in the community it creates social problems in addition to contributing to crime. For instance, African Americans tend to be significantly less likely than whites to report that friends and family members suffer from serious mental disorders like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Atheists are reinforcing prejudice against and societal discrimination of minorities both in the United States and abroad. Studies show that, contrary to popular belief, atheists engage in harmful behavior towards religious minorities worldwide.
