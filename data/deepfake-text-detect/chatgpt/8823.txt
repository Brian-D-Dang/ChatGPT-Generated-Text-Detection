Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in the world's most prestigious rankings. It is now well-known by all who are familiar with the United States to be an underprivileged country which has seen it being repeatedly ranked as the second worst nation on the planet for education and health. Now they've decided that the American Dream is to go back into the race where we came from, where every person can get a job or a start up business or even something like a successful career so this means a lot! And it promises to be a truly great time if people know why it exists here in America (and how you can help spread these dreams). Unfortunately, the US government hasn't invested much of our money into what my friends call "the dream" or some such thing called the "dream economy," though I could see myself in buying shares in companies like Facebook, Visa etc - or rather joining one of those groups instead. Maybe I'll become more comfortable about the prospect of losing everything if these same stocks don't make sense. Still, I want to support the Dream Economy and I hope I will join them someday even if it means investing a bit less dollars. I am also very interested in improving our relationship between ourselves and others through the Dream Economy because we're big believers in having fun together and sharing stories with each other. So far, with almost no changes, I have been able to enjoy traveling around the world and enjoying life and teaching new things. On another note, while I was attending the International Conference in Berlin last week, I spotted a page in German magazine that I thought would interest me: (Note that the title of the article is in English.) And I found out that it was written by a famous actress, Julia Roberts, who is currently living in Germany. Yesterday a friend asked me about my blog and I politely said yes but agreed not to answer her question immediately. She wanted to know if anyone else had read it, what you wrote or study about the world of blogging, besides myself. Her response was: Hi, good morning, I will look forward to reading your blog and thank you for going through some of my questions regarding blog writing and posting about blogging. The words "blogger" and "personally" may sound odd but when describing yourself personally, you use the word 'blogger' quite often in order to describe yourself. Therefore, you should not only take into account your own personal style and personality, but consider your comments and posts before continuing to write about anything else. You need to find ways to communicate your opinion in a way in which readers see it. In addition, you must figure out what makes you feel comfortable and confident and why; your intention isn't always clear on every step. However, you can always share and discuss your thoughts and ideas freely without any hindrance - do not shy away from expressing yourself openly in any way, but try to clear it up by talking about it. We think this is important to communicate your interest and interests with everyone and whatever level you choose to sit at. If you don't already know what you like, please explore some of my blogs. Thanks again! And for the love of God, welcome back! We were recently invited over to attend a conference on 'How to Write Your Own Blog'. This talk talks about creating a unique online community of bloggers that create apps that allow us to connect directly and interact directly with one another and then publish their content seamlessly on Android or iOS devices.
