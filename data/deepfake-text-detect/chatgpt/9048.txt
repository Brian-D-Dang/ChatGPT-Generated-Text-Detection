I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still find it extremely disappointing when people have to make this sort of petty attack on someone for not having a political view other than the opinions they disagree with. And yet I was part of the crowd and heard her shout "Again!"
