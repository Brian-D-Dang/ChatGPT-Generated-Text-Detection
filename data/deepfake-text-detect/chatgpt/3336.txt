I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends That's okay! Not everyone needs to like coffee. It's not only a matter of taste, but also related to individual metabolism and how one's brain responds to caffeine. It's important to remember that coffee isn't the only source of caffeine, and there are plenty of other beverages that can provide a boost of energy. Additionally, coffee isn't necessary for a healthy diet or lifestyle. So, don't feel pressured to like coffee just because your friends do. Enjoy what you like and what works for you.
