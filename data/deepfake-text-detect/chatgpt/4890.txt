Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that the type of people with poor crisis management aren't at risk for killing themselves; by "legitimacy" I'm talking about how valid their state feels in society. With a suicide epidemic like we're experiencing now, it seems highly likely that there are going be lots and lots of suicides over Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's Eve, etc., all across America, especially if Thanksgiving falls on Black Friday or something like that. First-world countries simply have more resources than third world ones do, so they can afford to take months off work to recover from even really crappy situations (and see my comment below). However, this means that they may also have many times as many suicidal individuals around who weren't able to get help before because of lack of accessresources. So, when you've got an influx of depressed folks unconstrained by time pressures and no access to support services, that spells trouble for everyone! Hope things improve soon...:) In other news: If your friend is feeling stressed out due to circumstance (s) beyond her control, shout it out loud so she knows someone else cares!! Also maybe go do some volunteering with high school students?? It doesn't cost anything except maybe self esteem but [hopefully] offers you a new perspective? Or just offer to watch TV with them while they paint their nails lol:D JonasLarson8 We're dealing with too much stress right now. My husband has been working 60 hours per week. We have 3 kids under 8 years old. He leaves tomorrow morning after another long day at his job where he spent half his shift trying to figure out why our car won't start. The starter will not engage, so apparently it needs to sit until the battery dies completely then it will try again. This sucks since it was only 50 miles away and we'd already driven down here to visit with family friends. Now, if only we had gas money.... Maybe next month it'll come together. Anyway, thanks to Jonhson917 for helping me think through what I wanted to write tonight..;)
