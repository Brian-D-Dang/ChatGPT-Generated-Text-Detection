For those who don't know, the trolley problem is this: You and another person are on a bridge which is over a trolley track. 5 people are tied to the tracks while you walk across. You try to avoid running into other pedestrians by walking as close as possible to where they stand. If that fails, hop off your feet onto one of the bridges (there's always someone there!), step away from the tracks for at least 10 feet then run back to where you started so all five will be behind you again but within spitting distance of each other instead of being directly in front of you with no way out because there are 5 people standing between you and them. This can only be done safely if you're not wearing shoes or socks. This also means that running down the side of a building for the same reason won't help much either.
