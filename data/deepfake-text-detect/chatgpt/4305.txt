Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor. However, this utopian society requires a lot of planning, effort and time to organize everything from the very beginning including politics (and government), which makes it a nightmare for people who get sucked into these plans without understanding why they are being planned or what their consequences will be if they go ahead with them. The plan that we see before us now seems almost too good to be true; today we have been relying on our natural resources for so long, and so many countries have exhausted themselves fighting wars over minerals. We live in such a huge, interconnected world now even when we think we are isolated. However, while we may not be able to leave all of our activity behind, we can choose how much to do. We don't need to be ignorant about what we're doing to our environment anymore because we have already left enough behind for others to take care of - unless you count the animals. They could still use some help cleaning things up though!
