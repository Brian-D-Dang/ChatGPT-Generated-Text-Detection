I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; supported unions against corporations with teeth far sharper than they needed to bite into our institutions like vampires in some cheap vampire novel that burns hotter as it goes along but can't be trusted because you don't know what's really under those sheets... The end result is simple: The GOP has never had an intellectual class just people who are basically ignorant idiots or opportunistic politicians looking out not only their own interests first - no one believes someone would actually vote on purely logical grounds once so completely indoctrinated by media propaganda -but also taking advantage when there was profit involved from short-term greediness even if social stability were threatened long term... which this current fiasco shows us clearly enough! It makes me sad every time i see another conservative using "liberal" pejoratively again after his party betrayed him yet more over these last decades - and we're getting closer now since most Americans seem desperate at all costs rather then having any real hope left about changing things without revolution though obviously he thinks paying them off will work where nothing else ever did before....or maybe neither side realizes how much damage could come forth should citizens' right rise up..?
