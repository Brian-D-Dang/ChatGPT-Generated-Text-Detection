Before I continue, I would like to start by saying that I am not a pedophile and that I am strongly against the sexual abuse of children. My view is based solely on my personal experiences with these people in this field - both as an employee (wherever possible) but also from being involved at different stages throughout their lives." In other words: he was only sexually attracted towards them because they were under 18? It implies so! He just couldn't help it... erm.. nope - sounds more lie than truthful statement about his real experience here (which could be quite relevant for whether or when should you trust him).
