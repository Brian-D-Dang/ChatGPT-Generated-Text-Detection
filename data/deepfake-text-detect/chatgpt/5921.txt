I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost a hoax. It's hard to tell if something like [ununpentium] exists, since the labs are having trouble getting enough of the nuclei to create the isotope to begin with. So I have to ask, do you guys think that a large chunk of chemistry is simply hoax? That the majority of chemistry is fake, and most of what we know is just a bunch of fabricated isotopes, just to keep the funding and careers going? The same thing happens in the field of physics. With a lot of things, it's very hard to prove if it's real or not. You can always argue "it's just a theory," but that is what science is: theories, models that have been proven and tested over and over and still have not been proven wrong. I think your main question should be "is science a hoax," and I say that it isn't. Science is a very big field of study that covers many topics. However, I wouldn't say that science is a hoax. Let's take the example of superconductivity. A lot of the theory behind superconductivity is based on the idea that electrons are moving together in pairs, and there isn't a lot of data to back that up. But that is a theory, and if the theory is sound, then it could be true. I don't know enough about the topic of superconductivity to say if it's a hoax or not, but I think that science is a bit more complex than you think. There are a lot of theories that have been proven wrong (the earth being flat, anyone?), but that doesn't mean that science is wrong. There are lots of things that we don't know yet. Science is always expanding, and there are a lot of unanswered questions. It's not a hoax, because if the data doesn't seem to fit the theory, then it's time to re-evaluate the theory. Wow, you're really new to science. I think you need to do a bit more research. You don't have to be a chemist to be a scientist. Re: chemistry is a hoax? I am no chemist but I have a degree in geology, and I do know enough about science to say that your question is ludicrous. There are some areas of science that are in their infancy, and are just now being discovered or better understood. I agree with deezee, though. I'm not a chemist either, but I am a geologist. And I know that chemistry is not a hoax, nor is any other science. Your post really made me laugh. I'm no chemist either, but I did work as a research assistant in a chemistry lab in college. Chemistry is not a hoax. I would say the same for physics. If you want to know why they are called the fundamental forces, look that up. I would like to see you do this. You seem to think that the periodic table was invented by chemists. In fact, it was discovered by chemists. It's a bunch of chemical symbols for the different elements. It tells you what the element is, how many protons it has, and what its atomic number is. For instance, the periodic table says that the atomic number of iodine is 53. That means that it has 53 protons in each atom of iodine. You're trying to say that the periodic table is fake, and that it was invented by chemists. It was discovered by chemists. It's a list of chemical elements. I'm no chemist, but I would say that you are not really a scientist, either.
