While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established individuals to be a healthy and positive approach. Showing respect to others can foster positive relationships and create an environment of trust and cooperation. It's also important to remember that respect should be given to all individuals, regardless of age or experience. True respect is earned through actions, behavior, and attitude, and it's important to consistently demonstrate these qualities to others.
