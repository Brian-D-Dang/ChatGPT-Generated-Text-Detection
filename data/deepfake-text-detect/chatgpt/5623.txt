The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to understand. One of the reasons the constitution needs to be changed is that it is obsolete and the US is not the same country that it was in 1789. Some amendments are in need of a major rewrite. The electoral college is not a popular election system, rather it is an indirect election system. It was created to protect the rights of the states by making sure the people of each state had a say in who was elected. However, it has never been used properly since the founding of the nation. The electoral college is the only element of government that the people of the US can not directly influence. That is why it should be completely removed from the constitution. The electoral college should be replaced with a direct election system. The electoral college is a relic of a time when the nation was still a collection of individual states. The United States is not the same country it was 200 years ago. America is now a world superpower with a global economy, and should be represented by a direct election system, which is the system used by other major nations. Are you proud of your ancestors?
