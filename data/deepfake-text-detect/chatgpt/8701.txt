With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more peace and justice in our society. It's not just about the police killing, but it is also about the way we have been treating our fellow Americans on both sides of the aisle for years now. We need to drop this mentality and do something about addiction and mental health issues. We need to stop giving lives to drug dealers or terrorists. If you're keeping your hands off babies like they are children then what kind of world does America live in? No one wants to see these horrific deaths from these criminals and they will always continue to use drugs to get their own ends. Just the other day I was walking by some homeless family and saw two people screaming at one another while screaming "I don't want political violence." I thought it was funny because when I was young my parents were cheering me on because they believed if you did nothing you could beat anyone up with guns and then if you got caught you would die. So we can go back to that when looking at it as an issue and saying the past 40 years has given us so many tragic events and I think maybe it makes sense. Maybe we shouldn't give out drugs like heroin when we're dealing with people who commit crimes all the time. So that's why the victims have called 911.
