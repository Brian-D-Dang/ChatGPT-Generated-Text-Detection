I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually either rich or really stupid (in my area at least). And if you're not in that group, then no matter how smart and talented you might be there's just nothing for you there So what do we do with all these "really clever" people? I mean look around: most of society has been educated through this system... What makes you think they would know better than those before them whose jobs were also done by someone else smarter than themselves..
