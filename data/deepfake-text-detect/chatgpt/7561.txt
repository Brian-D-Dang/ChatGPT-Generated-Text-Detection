While some individual members of any group may exhibit irrational beliefs or behaviors, it is unfair to make such a sweeping generalization about an entire group of people. Additionally, the historical context of Jewish identity in North America cannot be ignored. Jews have faced centuries of persecution and discrimination around the world, including in North America. Understanding the history of this group, including the Holocaust and the ongoing persistence of anti-Semitism, can help us gain insight into why some white North American Jews may feel a sense of persecution. It is important to approach these issues with empathy and sensitivity rather than immediately dismissing them as irrational.
