To my knowledge there are no peer reviewed sources that link GMOs to any negative health effects. There is as much reason to believe genes manipulated in a lab are safe, if not safer than the natural variety because they have been tested for years and subjected to millions of dollars worth of research! Edit: I see you reworded your question specifically asking about GMOs with Monsanto's Bt toxin inserted into them There is as much reason to believe genes manipulated in a lab are safe Then why do you still eat meat?
