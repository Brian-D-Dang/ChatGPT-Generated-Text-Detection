Hi, I'm new. So the greeks are complaining about the EU's imposed austerity measures, the terms of their countries increasing debt problems, even going as far as to boycott german y and cutting off ties with europe? Well whats wrong with Greece? thats what you should be worried about since they have nothing good enough for themselves anyway!? The Greeks dont give a fuck bout themselves, so why would they care where Italy goes? And that also happens because they literally just agreed to pay 500 billion in taxes but still cant afford it is ridiculous!!
