If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will continue to exist and wages won't increase, leaving only decent incomes for workers who have been squeezed by higher inflation expectations. But these changes aren't just about improving employment prospects; they actually lead to lower unemployment rates because fewer people working leads to more unemployed Americans but also increases wages that would otherwise go backwards if shortages existed instead. Like unemployment benefits program programs, those policies help ease the burden on employers while boosting wages across all income groups, including low-wage earners without government assistance and nonwhite households whose incomes fall short of what their beneficiaries need to earn enough money to meet basic needs such as food security. According to the Pew Research Center's Economic Research Institute survey released last week: "Economic inequality is a health issue," said Gretchen Rubin, professor emeritus at Princeton University's College of Social Work. "It doesn't matter whether you're white or black there'll always be some disincentive effect from having fewer resources." As inflation remains elevated even after years of declines amid recessions caused by mismanagement by monetary officials, wages could rise faster than inflation levels can support bottom lines. The rise in wages has happened despite rising stocks and real estate prices. And raising corporate taxes may hurt business sentiment among businesses already struggling with falling profits. The divide between companies and employees extends beyond issues like manufacturing costs due to lower productivity gains (which drive down payroll) toward other labor market issues affecting the American workforce: President Trump accused President Obama of providing too little support for poor families during his presidency when it comes to eliminating poverty. In 2011, Obama promised aid to working families through an initiative known as the Affordable Care Act. But the administration hasn't followed through since then. Trump took office promising to eliminate government subsidies enacted under President Obama, which contributed to a decline in job creators' fortunes over time. Over three decades, average weekly earnings have fallen nearly 10 percent annually compared to high single digits before the recession hit. Meanwhile, the cost of healthcare premiums skyrocketed dramatically following the healthcare overhaul passed late last year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Lowering taxes isn't exactly a new idea, although Trump frequently argues against them. Federal tax cuts helped boost revenues during the 2008 financial crisis in response to widespread unemployment problems triggered by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s collapse, causing the economy to crash again shortly afterward. But Republicans argue individual taxpayers should pay more so consumers don't suffer taxes paid elsewhere. With revenue forecasts still unclear regarding the federal budget deficit forecast this fiscal year, many economists expect Congress will pass legislation strengthening stimulus spending without spending cuts first. "There's nothing wrong with focusing on saving lives rather than worrying about cutting deficits," said Kevin Gerber, chief investment strategist at Providence Equity Partners LLC. Republicans insist Democrats shouldn't worry about spending unless they gain control of both chambers of Congress next year. While Trump's support for tax cuts spread quickly thanks largely to the GOP tax cut plan, Republican efforts might findered earlier this month when Biden signed executive orders imposing steep cuts to regulations intended to incentivize industries along a path toward economic recovery hoped for within months or quarters. Obama had planned to create an infrastructure branch of the Department of Homeland Security but withdrew the proposal days later citing uncertainty surrounding Trump's plans for such initiatives based on disagreement with some Democratic senators.
