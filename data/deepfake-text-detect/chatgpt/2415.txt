This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special treatment in many cases unfortunately... When you're trying your best and still failing because of external factors it really sucks when people dismiss those failures as just a matter of personal responsibility instead of addressing why they happened or how we can minimize them from happening again by making things better for everyone rather than worse.
