There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: I don't know if he was the only one who had the same problem. I've had a problem with a similar deaf kid, who used his phone all through the movie, making all sorts of sounds and stuff. I had to sit next to the aisle, so I could walk out if it got bad. I was so pissed that I had to sit next to the aisle, that I just left, went to the concession stand, bought my stuff, and left.

This has happened to me before. The movie was Akira, and I was so annoyed that I had to sit next to the aisle, that I left and went back home. I'm usually the one who would get up and move, but I was so annoyed that I stayed there the whole time.

I don't like sitting next to the aisle because I feel like I can't move around. I have sat next to a deaf person in a movie theater before, and they used a cell phone the whole time. The movie was Interstellar, and I was annoyed by the kid using the phone. I felt like I couldn't move because of how close I was sitting to the kid.

I've had a problem with this before, and I would definitely get up and move if it happened again.
