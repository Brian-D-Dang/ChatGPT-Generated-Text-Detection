In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing with them but was wondering what is actually wrong with this argument? I gather there are two main objections: firstly it seems like an arbitrary stopping point and secondly from a utilitarian perspective it doesn't seem right to discriminate against someone because they're different. If you were starting your own country and polygamy suddenly became legal would anyone object then? Wouldn't we eventually be able to draw up some kind of hierarchy (i.e. after all who decides whether something is "good" or "moral based on how many wiveshusbands one has at any particular time so that bigamy becomes as acceptable as monogamy? It just strikes me as strange that if it can happen for men why couldn't it happen again for women... This question looks familiar. Maybe Google cached my answer. Edit: it did occassionally cache old answers even when new ones had been posted since the issue arose. Old posts should note the fact that their content may have become inaccurate over time. G comments don't appear archived here either. - WillAug 11 '15 at 8:28
