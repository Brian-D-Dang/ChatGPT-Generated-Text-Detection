To pull an example of a single thread forum off the web: [here] . The only situation where single threads might be good is where a fixed group is involved, which I have previously described as "noise." You can see that there are many discussions going on in each group. But few topics will ever cross over from one discussion to another. In order for groups like these to work it would need some kind of classification system so people could know when they were reading one thread and not others (and vice-versa). That's what you get with RSS feeds such as the reddit feed[1]. I think this is probably more of a technology problem than anything else but its something I've thought about since my first email account years ago. It seems possible given today's tools we could do much better at organizing complex information into digestible chunks. Thoughts?:
