Hi Reddit. With all the news over the past couple weeks regarding Caitlyn Jenner's transition and coming out, I feel now is a good time to discuss gender's role in society today. This week marks my first day as an adult that i can legally change my sex legally so any thoughts or advice from you guys would be great! I think it depends on where you live if it's legal for you to do so? In many countries it definitely isn't unless you have been medically transitioning with hormones (or surgery) since age 1617
