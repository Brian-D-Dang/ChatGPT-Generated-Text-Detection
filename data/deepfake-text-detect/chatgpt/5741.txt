What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy are being threatened. I'm with Foucault on this. I'm not sure where you got that I am questioning whether the ideas of some particular theorist are true. I am questioning whether their ideas are useful, productive, and of practical use. In the case of Marcuse, I don't think they are. I have many critiques of Marcuse's work and its use in the academy. I don't think it's that useful to talk about "totalitarianism" in the academy today. I think we have bigger issues to worry about than that, and talking about "totalitarianism" doesn't get us very far. I think his work on technology is wonderful, and his account of the "Great Refusal" is one of the best descriptions of intellectual history I've ever read.

I've read about 100 pages of Marcuse, but only about 10 of that is about totalitarianism. He is most famous for the negative critique of technology, but is also a very important intellectual historian and his "Great Refusal" is one of the best descriptions of intellectual history I've ever read. Do you think we can do without a critique of totalitarianism and of how we are and will become more totalitarian? It seems to me that this is a crucial and urgent issue. I think totalitarianism is a central and necessary topic in the academy, but not as a reference to Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, and Maoist China. The term is far too useful to be left unexplored in discussing the American police state and the role of neoliberal capitalism. I'm not sure what you mean by saying that we can do without a critique of totalitarianism. I think you're conflating a critique of the Soviet Union with a critique of American imperialism. If you think that American imperialism is comparable to Soviet imperialism, I'd disagree. But if you think that the Soviet Union and American imperialism are fundamentally different, then I'd disagree. I think Marcuse is worth reading for his understanding of the Soviet Union, but I don't think he's worth reading for his understanding of American imperialism. I think it's important to distinguish the two, because if you don't distinguish the two, you risk not seeing what is similar and what is different about American imperialism and Soviet imperialism. I also think that the particular form that totalitarianism takes in the Soviet Union and the US is different, and so critiques of totalitarianism should be specific to each particular totalitarian regime. And I also think that talking about "totalitarianism" gets us nowhere, and if that's what you're saying, then I agree with you. I don't think it's particularly productive to talk about totalitarianism per se. But I do think that it's important to look at the particular forms that totalitarianism takes in the Soviet Union, the US, and China. The problem is that American capitalism is imperialism, and the political economy of the Soviet Union was very similar to that of the US in the 1930s (i.e., state capitalism). The Soviet Union was not communist, but was state capitalist. Also, the Soviet Union was extremely heterogeneous. The USSR was made up of 15 different nationalities and many different class and ethnic strata. So it's impossible to talk about "totalitarianism" as if it was a homogeneous system. The Soviet Union and the US were both capitalist economies, but the Soviet Union was also a state capitalist economy, while the US is not. In that sense, I think it's important to distinguish the two. There are many problems with the Soviet Union. But there are also many problems with American imperialism. I think the two should be distinguished, because if they are
