I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural thing for me. There's no reason why you can't learn how to use them properly, and it takes only an afternoon of practice; in fact, some people get their kids used to using disposable plastic sticks instead of actual wooden ones when they're young so that if they ever become adults if will be easier.
