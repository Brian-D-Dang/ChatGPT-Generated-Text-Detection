The implementation of Judicial Review from the Marbury v. Madison case from the precedent of the Judiciary Act of 1789 allows for the Supreme court to be to judge over its own actions, effectively a means by which they can alter their decisions or judgements without having to re-establish public trust in them again after "the people" have had enough time to reflect on it and see how these changes affect our lives as citizens... In short: If you don't like what we're doing here at TBH - take up arms against us! We are going to use this new found power to get more money into politics than ever before; so just watch out for that bank robber with the big gun coming around the corner....
