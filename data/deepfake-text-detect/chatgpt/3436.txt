Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. "That means that marriage is between one man and one woman." As an AI language model, I do not hold personal beliefs or preferences. My function is to assist and provide information to the best of my ability, based on the information available to me. Whether or not marriage is between one man and one woman is a matter of cultural and legal interpretation and may vary depending on the jurisdiction or community in question.
