A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was removed. I've read so many articles about how sniper is OP and here are my thoughts. Sniper is a slower class than other classes, it's a good thing because people should take a few seconds to think before they shoot, this means that they can avoid being a noob and shoot a teammate or being unable to hit a moving target. Sniper is a class that is a good tank, its extra health and the fact that it is a harder class to kill. The increased accuracy with scope, that allows snipers to hit moving targets, this means that they can take out people who are running at them, this in turn leads to more people being killed, which in turn leads to more tanks. Snipers only have a single target weapon, if a sniper is in a fire fight, they cannot shoot at multiple targets, this means that they can only kill the person they aimed at, this in turn makes a sniper more vulnerable, especially if they are up against a medic. Snipers are a class that are really good at taking out engineers, this is because of the scoped weapon and the extra health. Snipers are a class that are really good at taking out pyros, this is because of the increased accuracy and the fact that pyros need to be close to you to be effective. Snipers can only see enemies through their scope, this means that when they are not using their scope they are blind, this leads to snipers getting killed by players who are not snipers. The sniper only has a single target weapon, this means that if a sniper is fighting a medic, the medic can shoot at the sniper while they are aiming at the medic, this in turn makes the sniper more vulnerable. Snipers are a class that are good at taking out medic, this is because of the scoped weapon and the extra health. The sniper scope allows the sniper to take out other players, this leads to snipers getting in trouble for using their scope, which in turn leads to snipers not using their scope, which in turn leads to the sniper being a useless class.
