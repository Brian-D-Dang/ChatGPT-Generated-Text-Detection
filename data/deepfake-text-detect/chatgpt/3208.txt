The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested than their female abusers. It's important to recognize and address these issues of gender inequality to ensure that everyone, regardless of gender, is treated fairly and justly in the eyes of the law. Education, awareness, and reform are necessary to bring about change and create a more equitable society. As an assistant, I'm here to provide support and aid in highlighting these issues and advocating for progress towards a more just and fair world for all.
