While it may be true that there are instances of inconsistency and hypocrisy on Reddit and in society at large regarding religious and philosophical tolerance, it is unfair to make a blanket statement that discounts the positive steps and progress that have been made. For example, many subreddits and online communities have strict rules against hate speech and discrimination based on religion or philosophy. Additionally, there have been efforts to celebrate and educate about different belief systems through events like interfaith dialogues and diversity training in the workplace. Of course, there will always be individuals who hold biases and prejudices, but it is important to recognize the efforts being made towards greater understanding and acceptance. Instead of focusing solely on the negative aspects, we should work towards promoting open-mindedness and respectful discourse across all communities.
