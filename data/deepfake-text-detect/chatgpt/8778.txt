Ok, view changed. I guess I meant that there was an arbitrary double standard between alcohol and pot in the workplace, as opposed to saying employers don't have a basis for segregating their employees based on their sexual orientation. I think you're just misunderstanding the issue. From everyone's point of view, the employer doesn't need legal proof that they can discriminate against people because of someone else's sexual orientation (even though we know it's illegal).
