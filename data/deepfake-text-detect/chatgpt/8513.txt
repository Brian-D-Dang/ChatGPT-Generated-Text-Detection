I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several friends who adopted dogs from shelters and they now do not get along with their neighbors' pets because the new owners let theirs off leash in bushes when nobody is home so that it can run loose all day long but if one of hisher poochy pals goes out into public space then BAM! Doggie gets shot at by shotgun until dead (no good reason). The only way to solve this problem would be taking your pet catcher's license test every year before letting him go on walkies... If we could live like animals instead trying our best pretense being human beings: living inside mansions yachts which should belong exclusively whomever cleverly invented electricity; eating steak while screaming "Mmmm!" during hunting trips once per week over indulging ourselves anyways due boringness caused my ennui thanks financial crisis as well blah...blah..give me more money ...
