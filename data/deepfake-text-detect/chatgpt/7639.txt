One counter-argument to refute the opinion "Cereal first then milk" could be that pouring milk first could actually be more efficient and result in less milk being wasted. When cereal is poured into the bowl first, it can often create an uneven surface and cause some of the milk to spill over the edges when poured on top. However, by pouring the milk first, it allows for a level surface and better control over the amount of milk being added. As a result, less milk is likely to be wasted and the bowl will more easily accommodate the desired amount of cereal.
