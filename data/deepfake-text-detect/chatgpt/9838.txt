With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned as a place for people to share ideas and discuss topics, it was predominantly White males who did so. This created an environment where other voices weren't heard or taken seriously. With the recent changes, it is becoming more inclusive by allowing more diverse voices to be heard and discussed. This not only allows more ideas to be shared but also helps to create a more balanced and equitable platform. It is important that Reddit allows these voices to be heard, so that all opinions can be considered and accommodated, rather than just those of the majority. In this way, Reddit can become a place where everyone feels welcome and accepted.
