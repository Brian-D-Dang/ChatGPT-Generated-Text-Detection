EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People do not have pre-set, fixed "triggers" that cause them to break down in a state of panic when they hear a certain word or see a certain thing. (there is a good chance, however, that your brain will re-trigger memories of past traumas when a certain thing, sound, or smell is recognized, or something similar to that) They are also not a thing that make one person feel a certain way and another person feel nothing at all, or only a minor discomfort. No one can truly say, "this thing triggered me." What is more likely to happen is that something reminded someone of a past traumatic event, which is not the same thing. That being said, I'll still do my best to explain what I mean, and answer any questions. I wrote this post a few years back. It's been sitting in my drafts folder for that long and I think it's about time to dust it off and post it. (This is a repost from my old blog) Firstly, I'd like to address something that I think is very important: I have PTSD. I have suffered from it for many years now. I have been to a good therapist, and I am doing good things to work through my issues. I can tell you with confidence that I did not create my PTSD. I cannot say that I understand PTSD, because I have never been through an experience like a military soldier who has come back from war. But I can tell you what I do know. I know that traumatic events can lead to PTSD. I know that when people experience traumatic events they will often react in certain ways. They may be angry, or sad, or anxious. Sometimes the feelings are fleeting, and sometimes they are so intense that a person cannot even function. I know that I reacted in this way when I was raped. When I was raped, I felt that I needed to punish myself for not being good enough to keep myself safe. I tried to kill myself by overdosing on medication. I felt that I needed to punish myself by going into the hospital and having doctors and nurses all over me. I tried to escape, to run away and hide from myself. I tried to make it go away by ignoring it, pretending it wasn't happening. I tried to push it away by getting drunk. I tried to make it go away by trying to get rid of the "triggers" that I thought were making me feel so awful. I tried to make it go away by getting high. I know that when people are raped they often blame themselves. I know that they can feel that it is their fault that it happened. I know that they may feel ashamed. I know that they may feel like they are the only ones who have ever had this happen to them. I know that they may feel like no one will understand. I know that they may feel that they are bad people, or that they don't deserve better. I know that they may feel that they are somehow different. I know that it is possible to feel all of these things, and that it is possible to feel nothing at all. I know that a lot of people have been hurt, and that sometimes they hurt other people as a way of trying to make themselves feel better. I know that some people will hurt themselves by way of punishing themselves for the things that have happened to them. I know that some people will hurt themselves in a way that is not intended to make them feel better, and that there is no way to know if they are trying to hurt themselves in a way that will make them feel better, or if it is just a way of hurting themselves. I know that some people will hurt other people, and that those people may feel bad for what they have done. I know that some people will never feel bad for what they have done, and that they will not understand why anyone would ever feel sad about what they have done. I know that some people will hurt others in a way that is intended to hurt the person who hurt them, and that those people may be trying to make the person who hurt them feel bad. I know that some people will never understand what the person who hurt them may have been going through, and that those people may believe that their actions were justified. I know that some people will always be the "bad guy." I know that sometimes they may wish that they could just get rid of themselves, to be able to put themselves out of their own misery.
