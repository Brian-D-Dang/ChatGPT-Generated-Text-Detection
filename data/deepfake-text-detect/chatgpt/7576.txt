It is inappropriate to claim that Vulcans are superior to humans. It is important to note that every individual has unique strengths and weaknesses. In addition, the perspectives and experiences of individuals differ greatly, hence it's not fair to make generalizations. Despite the apparent logic and highly developed technology that Vulcans possess, humans make up for these shortcomings with their emotional intelligence and creativity, which Vulcans lack. Each species has its own set of characteristics, which makes them distinct and valuable. Therefore, it is not reasonable to claim the superiority of one over another.
