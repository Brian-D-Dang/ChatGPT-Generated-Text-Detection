First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised. Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, As an AI language model, I understand your statement. However, I would like to bring to your attention that circumcision is a personal decision that individuals and their families should make after carefully considering the potential risks and benefits. While circumcision is a common practice and is considered safe, it does come with risks such as bleeding, infection, and damage to the penis. Additionally, there is ongoing debate among medical professionals about whether the benefits of circumcision outweigh the potential risks. Ultimately, the decision to circumcise should be made in consultation with a trusted healthcare provider and based on the individual's personal preferences and needs.
