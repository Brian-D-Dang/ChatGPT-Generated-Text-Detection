This people are selling good feelings. Not really being able to talk to the dead or a magic pill to lose weight. They are like movies or video games. They take you into a world where there is no stress, but it can be too safe and not realistic enough." Some also say that such experiences may have been so powerful for some because of all they went through in life - from pain and trauma to the loss of loved ones - making them more likely than other people who might otherwise feel such an experience has less impact on their lives. On its website, The Society For Psychical Research says: "Psychic ability isn't just about knowing what someone's doing next or seeing something before anyone else does ... It could mean getting lucky with your future career choice (or lottery numbers), finding out why someone died, predicting when you're going to get married or having clairvoyant dreams which come true."
