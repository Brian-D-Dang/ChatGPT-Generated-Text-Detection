Generally speaking, you have two sides on the "Fat Debate": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, then they lose it all anyway) I personally don't care too much about either side. I'm an average size person who has no interest in being a supermodel or getting surgery to look more like one. And that's good! These movements are also great because there is actual research showing that fatties tend to be healthier than thin folksand of course just as likely to have eating disorders too! So it makes sense for them to advocate healthy living and nutritional self-care. However, despite the benefits, these movements still seem often dismissive and shaming towards others with larger bodiesweight issues (or perhaps even smaller ones). In fact, some parts of this whole Fat Acceptance stuff can feel very exclusionary because when so many fatties stand together, we make ourselves vulnerable to those who would criticize us instead of trying to love each other and support each other. Which is why I believe SO MUCH needs to change within our communities: from body image policing to loving all sizes and accepting ALL lifestyles. Because if anyone should know better how damaging such attitudes are, it should be those who've been through similar struggles...
