I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer need this kind of weapon? "So for me to go into an armed robbery with my friends at gunpoint is not very smart," he said. "It's like committing suicide if you think it through." A third friend who spoke on condition that his name should not be published because he fears arrest by the police after having spoken out against the gangsterism in Johannesburg told News24 there were many cases where they had seen innocent bystanders being shot dead as gangs fought over control of streets during robberies. He added: "We hear so much noise from law enforcement agencies saying we are doing our best but what do these guys want us to do?"
