Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and the accusation should be taken seriously; but for me it doesn't seem to go as far as you'd think - which makes sense because men are in fact more likely than women to commit sexual assault against each other (in many cases). This will sound odd coming from an adult woman who is only 18...but when my friends and family would say "you were raped" after finding out about some traumatic event involving another person they couldn't have been farther from the truth. The difference between getting punched by someone much bigger or shaking hands with them at work versus being forced to give up your body and feel violated for weeksmonths on end was night and day.
