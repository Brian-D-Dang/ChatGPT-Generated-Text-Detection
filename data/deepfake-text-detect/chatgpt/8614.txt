Redditors main real concerns about the website were monetization and the limiting of "free speech" in the rfatpeoplehate drama. Reddit has still brought many people on board independent of Huffman that would be less likely, but still they have a very vocal audience because of what they do. Yeah I noticed the arbitrary restriction on 'free speech' too.
