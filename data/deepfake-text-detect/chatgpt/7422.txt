While your suggestion of an Anon Section may sound appealing, it is important to remember that the ability to remain anonymous on the internet is crucial for ensuring freedom of speech and protecting people's privacy. Requiring users to disclose personal information in order to comment may dissuade individuals from expressing their opinions, particularly if their opinion goes against popular sentiment or may be seen as controversial. Additionally, requiring personal information could also lead to potential online harassment and doxing, where personal information is shared or published online without consent. In short, while transparency is important, anonymity online serves a vital function in protecting individuals' rights to free speech and privacy.
