While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established individuals to be an incredibly arrogant concept. It seems like a small step from there to justifying your treatment of others by their lack of experience or standing in society. I agree with this 100. You have no right whatsoever to people's respect just for being born at any particular time...that is why it is called respect: someone gives you something based on how well they think you deserve it.
