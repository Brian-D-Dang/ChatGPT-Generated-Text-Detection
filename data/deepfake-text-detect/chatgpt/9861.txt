IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say "preposterous" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more people? Using big words and complex sentences can be a good way to show off your vocabulary, but it can also make it difficult for readers to understand what you are trying to say. If you are writing for an audience with diverse levels of education or language understanding, using simpler words and phrases may be more beneficial. Additionally, if you're trying to communicate a concept in a way that is easy to grasp, using simpler language can help ensure that the message is understood.
