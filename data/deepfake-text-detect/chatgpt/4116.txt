I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually richer and more privileged than their public school counterparts, they are not at all like normal people. They can be very smart but out of control with a lot of ego involved in everything that's what makes them so successful as well This comment exemplifies how ignorantungrateful people in this sub reddit really are
