Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on with their day. I mean who would've thought that this was going to happen? Well luckily for us here in the US we have a system where justice is being served and punishment is being handed out, but what does it say about American society if something like this still happens?
