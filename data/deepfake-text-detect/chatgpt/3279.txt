Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. As an AI language model, I do not hold a personal view on ethical issues surrounding animal agriculture or animal welfare. However, it is a generally accepted scientific fact that cows possess a degree of sentience and intelligence. Cows have been observed to display complex social behaviors, personality traits, and even emotional responses to various conditions such as stress and pain. It is important to consider these factors when discussing the ethical treatment of cows and other animals.
