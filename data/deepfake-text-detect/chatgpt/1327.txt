Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my work colleagues are getting rid all meat and dairy products from their diet because they intend on going plant-based in the near future. I get that it's not really possible for me at this point, since those foods have been part of my life for so long (I'm 22) and there is no way to replace them with good alternatives within my budget or time frame. Now, should I care? Am I being selfish by continuing in my current lifestyle despite knowing the negative effects of animal agriculture? Should I go out if my way to purchase certain items simply so people don't think I eat animal products when i clearly am one now? Is there any benefit to cutting back on eating these animal products other than me thinking I somehow saved an animal's suffering through doing so? Thank you. My Answer: This may be hard for some non vegans - especially vegetariansvegans who were raised as such! But please know we would NEVER judge anyone for eating meat or any animals, including fish. We feel compassion toward ALL creatures regardless of species. A human being without flesh feels just like any other creature. It doesn't matter how much you love someone; your "love" towards something does NOT mean you need to force yourself on others. Humans evolved over millions of years to be able to live off plants alone as well as predators. If humans lived solely off plants instead of omnivores, our population wouldn't even make a dent into the natural world - let along destroying it completely. Some might say we shouldn't eat seafood either given its environmental impact. Animals kill eachother for food every single day...basically anywhere on earth...and yet most people still choose to consume it..including myself. Yet again, another reason why you mustn't compare yourself to others. You see, unless you will never ever take another breath, imagine living regardless whether we ate cows, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats etc., etc.....................there is nothing inherently wrong with us. Nature created us as intelligent beings capable of choosing well. And it was only ourselves who decided to abuse nature. The choice has ALWAYS been ours. Why then do we continue abusing ourselves and why drag innocent wild animals into the mix?? How dare you put words in my mouth! This article isn't aimed at restricting personal choices regarding healthy diets. Especially after reading Chiavari's reply above which basically said "don't worry, focus more on the positive impacts." Veganism is not about limiting dietary choices, nor denying reality. Our planet needs help and reducing emissions are important but the cause goes 2 ways here. First, stop consuming goods produced via factory farming where thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of animals suffer. Second, reduce consumption wherever possbile. Also keep in mind that while you may occasionally miss eating eggs or milk, or bacon and cheese, replacing them naturally with fruits veggies (especially raw ones), nuts, seeds, oils, legumes, tofu, grains cereals, tea coffee, hummus etc...can actually improve health (as opposed to fattening milkseggs). That means less animal products overall better nutrition happy body AND healthier environment.
