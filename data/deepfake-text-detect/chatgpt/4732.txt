Firstly, I'm using a throwaway because most people get really sensitive about this and my views are pretty much the antithesis of reddit (love Rand Paul, support Mens Rights, hate censorship) Anyway... I was reading through ratheism and saw something that made me go "huh?": then read more into it: guy is being reported as a victim in spite of the fact that he's clearly not one! He didn't even report the rape to police, but was instead picked up by an officer from a different jurisdiction, who took him home for questioning over two months later! And only ended up reporting his case after no charges were filed (!) against the rapist - then decided on his own on what evidence has been used to convict him!!! So basically, there was absolutely NO EVIDENCE at all to back up these claims. The guy has already spent half a year in prison now for things like streaming pornography with his friend while the girl watched AND TEXTING HIM "come here"!! Gee thanks for holding out justice dude!! And yet they still keep passing laws condemning other men and treating them as victims instead despite zero proof! It makes me want to vomit so hard sometimes just thinking how backwards our society can be: (Sorry if I got ranty, just had some strong feelings about this whole thing lol He did say 'yes' when she asked him to come inside her house, which isn't really criminal behaviour if you're talking about moving your penis inside someone else without their consent (even though it wasn't consensual). They are both adult adults and have agreed to do whatever sex acts they choose to each other; I don't think either party should feel compelled to stop any sexual activity once it starts happening. If anything, I see it more like a child getting raped than a man raping another man. There are plenty of accounts where women claim to have been forced or coerced into having intercourse during nonconsensual situations like those. This may sound incredibly strange to hear considering how common rape culture seems to be nowadays, but there are definitely cases where guys also end up admitting to feeling helpless or pressured against their will during intimate encounters (especially since most criminals wouldn't admit to such things). As far as the law goes, we live in a system based off of guilt by association. Here are 2 examples of how guilty by association works:1.) A woman gets drunk calls her boyfriend asking him to pick her up at a bar late one night. When he arrives to drive her home, she says she doesn't want to leave alone and asks him to take her virginity. It's illegal under Texas state law to force yourself onto an unwilling person simply because you believe they will accept it. How convenient is THAT?? ) In 2013, 23-year old Jeremy Meeks was arrested in Colorado for allegedly forcing himself upon three girls after picking them up, driving them around, buying drinks, dicking them down and making them stay the night. Police said he would drop them off early the next morning before disappearing forever leaving behind crumbs of bread hoping they could find their way home. All 3 admitted having sex with Meeks, but none of them wanted to press charges. Why!? Because he gave them cash, drove them around town, bought them alcohol fed them food throughout the entire ordeal. See how easy this sounds? Maybe it won't happen again, maybe it does...but regardless, why shouldn't he on principle face consequences for sexually assaulting young girls?! We treat everyone equally under the law regardless of gender difference now days BUT somehow a man is considered less culpable due to some antiquated idea about male sexuality. 2.) Consent can change from moment to moment depending on circumstances moods, meaning many kissing partners consider themselves "hooked" and willing to continue until one partner suddenly decides its time to call it quits. That same logic applies to casual sex, group sex etc as well. Basically, if you aren't actively trying to deceive others nor pressure anyone into doing anything they don't want to do, chances are you're technically fine. As long as neither parties seem like they're entirely sure the act is completely ok, my advice would be to assume good intentions unless told otherwise. Of course, many people unfortunately may encounter situations where they're put in harm's way simply BECAUSE of the lack of understanding between individuals involved. 3.)
