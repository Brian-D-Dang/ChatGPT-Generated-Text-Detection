I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually from affluent families who can afford to pay for expensive tuition fees, which automatically limits the diversity of students in the school. However, some parents may feel that private schools offer higher quality education, smaller class sizes, and more resources and opportunities for their children. It ultimately depends on individual preferences and priorities.
