This people are selling good feelings. Not really being able to talk to the dead or a magic pill to lose weight. They are like movies or video games. They are all part of the entertainment industry. If you want something real, go to your doctor. But people do not want to take responsibility for their health. Kandi's mom had a drug problem and she did not die of cancer. I don't think she is lying about it. She might be exaggerating but she is not lying. You're right. Those people are selling good feelings. That's why I said I don't like the whole psychic thing. It's just a marketing ploy. It's not real. I don't deny psychics exist or that they are not good at what they do, but I don't like the idea of them using people's misery and fear to make a living. It's not something I could do or see myself doing. I've heard some psychic claim they have the ability to talk to the dead, but I don't believe them either. If they could really talk to the dead, why don't they just tell us how to make them stop haunting us? And I don't think Kandi's mom died from cancer. It's a very common type of cancer. Cancer is not a death sentence anymore. If her mom was in denial, she would have gone to a hospital to be treated. You're right, she was not dying from cancer. She was probably an alcoholic and she died of alcohol poisoning. But I'm sure she was afraid of people finding out. She probably was feeling guilty about drinking and didn't want to admit it to anyone. It's not like psychics are only in it for the money. It's a calling. Kandi's mom was a psychic, she was just afraid to admit it because of her addiction. I read Kandi's mom's book. She sounded a bit crazy to me.
