I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing by purchasing the cheaper item, but the seller does make a little more money. This is a huge problem in the healthcare industry. If you walk into a pharmacy, you will find that drugs are sold at a huge markup. A 100 drug can cost anywhere from 10-500, with only a few dollars difference between the highest and lowest costing drug. This is where I think the problems begin. Someone, somewhere needs to be giving you good healthcare, and healthcare is incredibly expensive. A lot of people do not have a lot of money to spend on medication and healthcare, and I think that it is a bad thing for them to pay twice as much as someone else for the exact same thing. Price gouging is especially problematic in emergency situations. If the person who has the emergency only has a certain amount of money to spend on healthcare, they may have to spend the rest of their money on a cheaper drug that will still be effective. Then, if they continue to get sick, they may not be able to afford another medication, and they will be unable to afford the emergency care that they need. This is a huge problem, because the emergency could have been avoided if the person had the correct drugs in the first place. When I go to a pharmacy, I always look at the prices to make sure that I am getting a good deal. It's kind of like a game. I think that it's important to be a smart consumer, and know what you are paying for. I also think that pharmacies should try to keep their prices as low as possible so that everyone can afford healthcare. I think that the price gouging should be limited or eliminated altogether so that the consumers can feel like they are getting a fair price.
