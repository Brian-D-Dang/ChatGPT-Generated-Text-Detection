While it may be true that ISIS was partly a result of internal conflicts within the Islamic world, it is unfair to completely disregard the role played by external factors such as the US invasion and subsequent intervention in the region. The invasion triggered a power vacuum in the region which allowed extremist groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS to gain a foothold. Furthermore, the US has been heavily involved in Middle Eastern affairs for decades, leading to a widespread anti-American sentiment which fuels support for extremist groups. To simply lay the blame for ISIS on internal Islamic conflicts is to ignore the complex and interconnected nature of these issues. It is important to address the root causes of terrorism, and while internal conflicts within the Islamic world are undoubtedly a part of the problem, so too are the actions of outside actors like the US.
