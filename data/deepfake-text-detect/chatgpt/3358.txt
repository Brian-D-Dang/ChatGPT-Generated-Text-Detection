As long as I've been alive, I've always poured milk before cereal. I've done this because I am a textural eater and I hate soggy cereal. I believe that pouring milk before cereal can help prevent the cereal from becoming too soggy. However, some people argue that pouring cereal before milk allows for a better distribution and coating of milk on each piece of cereal. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference. If pouring milk before cereal helps you maintain the texture and crispiness of your cereal, then by all means continue to do so. However, if you're interested in trying a new approach, you could experiment with pouring cereal before milk and see if you prefer the result.
