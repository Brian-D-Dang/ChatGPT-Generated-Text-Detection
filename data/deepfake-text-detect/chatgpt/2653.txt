First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces you to wait 10 minutes between posts so as not to be at the top of every page at once This is very true for subs that have an extremely high population (or spamming). I've found there isn't much bullying here or hate speech and people seem to stay level headed through it all which brings great discussions
