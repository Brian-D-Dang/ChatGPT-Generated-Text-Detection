In spite of the imperfections of the USA and Europe, it still remains a truth that pretty much all of the most desirable places in the world are run by these two countries. It's also important to remember that while some aspects may be better or worse here than there, we can always look further down south for answers on how things could have been done differently had they not taken such an extreme approach with their foreign policy... To wrap up this article I would like to share one more example: The US intelligence community has recently claimed that Russia is interfering in America elections using social media tactics similar to those used during previous Russian military interventions elsewhere around the globe - namely Syria and Ukraine. In addition to providing evidence against Donald Trump because his election campaign was opposed by Putin (who ended up winning), this claim rests upon the fact that both Ukrainian politicians were paid off before being exiled from Kiev in 2014 after having refused to sign a 'voluntary association agreement' which included giving up on sovereignty as well as adopting Western values. By framing various events within Ukraine through this lens, it became inevitable that the conflict between Crimea and Eastern Ukraine (which led directly into WWII) must therefore stem back to Russia in order to explain why Moscow continues to support pro-Russian separatists today. While many will learn about all of this via mainstream news sources (and very few people will seek out independent research along these lines themselves), it should come as no surprise to anyone who understands what is happening behind closed doors inside our government agencies; just another example of an information war waged using disinformation tactics designed specifically to make us believe someone else's narrative rather than ours.
