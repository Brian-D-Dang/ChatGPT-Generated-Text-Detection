While it is true that such elements may not occur in nature or exist in stable forms for any significant length of time, it is important to consider the scientific value of creating and studying these elements. By synthesizing these elements in a lab, scientists are able to gain a better understanding of the fundamental properties of matter and explore the limits of the periodic table. Additionally, the creation of new elements has practical applications in various fields such as nuclear medicine and materials science. Therefore, it can be argued that while these lab-created elements may not fit neatly into the natural periodic table, they still have a valuable place in the scientific community.
