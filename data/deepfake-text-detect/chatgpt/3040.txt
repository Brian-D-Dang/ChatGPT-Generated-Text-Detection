GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job yet 2. My mom is the one who does all of this 3. She has been doing this since before I was born, so I'm just following in her footsteps 4. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO SO MUCH WORK AT A JOB YOU HATE JUST BECAUSE "I NEED THE MONEY" You are right that no one should work at something they hate... but there's also nothing wrong with working somewhere for money you need to survive because it means survival or an education opportunity your parents could not provide otherwise as well!
