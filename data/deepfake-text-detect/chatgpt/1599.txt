Firstly- I'm a Brit, so if I'm missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies! While having a conversation over the phone about a movie (the name of the film escapes me), my friend started to laugh and say it was 'hilarious' that Americans use English words like "what" in place of things like 'that'. I can't help but feel this is likely due to American movies. They're out there on TV and whatnot - even though they may be very obviously fakemade up, they seem to have caught on with otherwise sensible British people who for whatever reason are now forced into using them in everyday speech. Secondly, while not technically an error per se, what's wrong with saying it as "a bit"? In other countries its used as more than just a filler word; you wouldn't say something along the lines of: " Ah, I love this piece of music!" or if we were talking about food or drink:"I know mate, ain't she sweet?" (hmm... that one sounds less common outside England...) - When asked why their car needs regular servicing."We need oil changes every six months because we drive it like - well, Americans do..."Well actually yes most errors would apply equally anywhere else when used incorrectly..
