You may have seen news that BlackLivesMatter protesters interrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Seattle. I think this was wrong to do, because he has fought for civil rights since 1984 and for LGBTQ equality many times before. I am glad that the Sanders supporters are putting an end to that tradition on the streets of Seattle today at the White House. It is truly great to see this kind of activism getting criticized so forcefully. This might be an opportunity for the Bernie supporters to get rid of this hate group mentality that they want to destroy the movement that they believe that they should fight against. And it's great that Bernie supporters seem intent on making Seattle change their tune after the Sanders rally yesterday! But there will never be peace if we continue as usual with a hostile view towards Americans who choose not only to support a candidate but to disregard the laws that protect racial injustice by electing Democrats like Bernie Sanders. When we support peaceful demonstrations then we shouldn't expect our elected representatives to respect our right to peacefully protest. This isn't just a white supremacist issue; this is a racist one! Thomas Tormey is an activist from Washington state with a passion for justice vs discrimination issues including race relations. He speaks regularly about his experiences fighting racism online: uh-oh...it looks bad now?
