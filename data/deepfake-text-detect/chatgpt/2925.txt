I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost like having an element with all of its electrons removed. So if you had one of these elements, would you have to worry about them being radioactive? In short, yes. Ununseptium is a good example: It has seven protons (and 7 neutrons), which makes for a very unstable nucleus; even more so than lead-208.
