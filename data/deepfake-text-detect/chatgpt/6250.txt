While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept GMOs as it is. While I am not entirely against the idea of a GMO, I am fully a supporter of the National Organic Law. I am very much opposed to the more extreme version of the NRLA (National Organic Pollution Control Act) which allows farmers to choose their own crops and not the organic ones. I am very much opposed to the bill, which would prohibit farms from requiring regulation, which would make it illegal for farmers to produce their own crops. But I do think that if farmers were to "opt out" of the NRLA, this would not be a law, but a form of governmental regulation. In the USA, the law requires all farmers to be allowed to grow their own crops. I am not against the PEPA Act, but I am not against it. I have just read that the government has varying opinions on this. I am afraid that this will not change our national laws. I am also not opposed to the fact that farmers can choose not to grow their own crops. However, I do not think that is the case. I am against limiting GMOs to the agriculture sector, because I know that farmers don't live in rural areas and people do not grow their own crops.
