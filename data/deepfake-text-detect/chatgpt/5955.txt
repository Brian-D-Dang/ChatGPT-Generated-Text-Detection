Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. They don't care if people love them or hate them. They just eat and sleep and crap and walk around and that's it. And yet, their lives are constantly ruined by the people that we're so quick to love, because, well, they're people. Yesterday, a friend of mine sent me a link to this story about a cow that was brutally beaten by a group of cows. I'm not linking to it, because I don't want to give these assholes any more web traffic. But you can read the article yourself. I have no idea if this happened in Israel or in the USA, but I do know that it happened. And that's all I need to know. Cows don't do this to each other. If they did, they would all be dead. Cows don't get together and beat up their fellow cows. If they did, they would all be dead. Cows don't hate other cows. If they did, they would all be dead. Cows don't attack each other. If they did, they would all be dead. The reason cows are not dead is because humans protect them. If we didn't, they would all be dead. The reason cows aren't dead is because we treat them with respect. The reason cows are alive and well is because we, as a society, believe they deserve to be treated with respect. And the reason cows aren't dead is because they're not people. While this is happening in the news, we have "refugee" terrorists stabbing Israeli civilians, and people are outraged that Israeli police beat a terrorist. The media is not reporting on the cow story, and people are not outraged about the cow story. People have no idea it happened. And what happened to the cow was worse than being stabbed, and yet, nobody is outraged. It's about time people start treating animals with the respect they deserve. It's not only the cow. It's all animals. It's all humans. It's all life. And we need to start treating them all with respect. It's just not a nice world if you're not human. We are all in this together, no matter how we look. To be honest, I have no idea if this is true or not. I don't know if the US is the only country that donates money to the UNRWA. If it is true that the US is the only country that donates money to UNRWA, then I'm glad that my tax dollars are not being used to fund a terrorist organization. If it is not true that the US is the only country that donates money to UNRWA, then I'm ashamed that my tax dollars are being used to fund a terrorist organization. I'm sure that you know how I feel about taxes and how I feel about not paying taxes to the government. I'm sure that you know how I feel about terrorists. I'm sure that you know that I believe that the government of the United States is an extension of the government of Israel, which is an extension of the government of the Vatican, which is an extension of the government of the State of Israel, which is an extension of the government of Rome. I'm sure that you know that I believe that the State of Israel is nothing more than the Vatican without the Pope. So, what I'm saying here is that the people who are being targeted by UNRWA are the people who are being targeted by the government of Israel. And if the government of Israel is the government of Rome, then the government of Israel is the same thing as the Vatican. And if the government of Israel is the government of the Vatican, then the government of Israel is the same thing as the United States. And if the government of Israel is the same thing as the United States, then the government of Israel is the same thing as UNRWA. So, since the government of Israel is the same thing as UNRWA, then I'm ashamed to be paying taxes to the government of Israel. I'm ashamed to be paying taxes to the government of the United States. I'm ashamed to be paying taxes to the government of the Vatican. I'm ashamed
