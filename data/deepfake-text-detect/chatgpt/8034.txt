While it may be true that the definition of "middle class" has evolved over time, it is important to recognize that the actual number of people who fall within that income bracket has decreased. This can be seen through various economic indicators such as income inequality and the rise of poverty rates. Additionally, the costs of basic necessities such as healthcare, housing, and education have increased disproportionately compared to wage growth, leaving many families struggling to maintain their middle-class status. Therefore, it is not solely a matter of a changing definition, but rather a reflection of systemic economic challenges that have led to the decline of the middle class.
