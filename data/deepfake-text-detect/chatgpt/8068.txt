This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in our galaxy, then how can an intelligent being come from somewhere else and say they have been here for hundreds (if only) thousandsmillions? The Mayans predicted 2012 was going to be a big deal because it coincided with their calendar date when Nibiru would pass Earth on its way back into space after orbiting us once every three thousand years...pretty far outside any accepted theories concerning evolution - which by definition requires millions upon billionsof iterations over time periods measured as fractions (?) less than this number! The same goes true regarding other predictions made pre-Ancient Aliens that were incorrect including those associated specifically relating UFO's extraterrestrials etc.. Oh well.....we'll all find out soon enough now won't we?!I personally feel there are things mankind has yet uncovered within physics metaphysics involving parallel universes repeating multiple times; but no one really knows what these truly mean even though people claim some do know 'the truth'....sounds like most books written pertaining thereto will tend toward FUD since many cannot express themselves cogently nor analytically at least beyond simple rhetoric where ideas go unchallenged while avoiding critical thinking. commons "critical Thinking" ( http: en wikipedia com ments "iteration
