I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the ranks of Japanese animation (and is one of my all-time favorites). It's a really fun movie. It has some interesting concepts and it does them very well with an original story!
