A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was allowed to be used without hacking... You probably shouldn't use sniper with no hacks unless you run the free weapons perk first thing every day
