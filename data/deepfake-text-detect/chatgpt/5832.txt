To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to be extended to the LGBT community. However, I cannot condone the method of decision-making behind this ruling. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, ruled that state bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional. This is not what the court should have done. By overturning the state laws, they are bypassing the legislature, which in turn is bypassing the will of the people. The court should have struck down these laws as unconstitutional under the current Constitution. If they were to do so, then the states would have to hold new elections to decide the fate of same-sex marriage, which would then be decided by a majority vote of the people. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court was ruling from the bench, and I think this is a major problem with our legal system. While it is true that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, our country was founded on the belief that the rule of law should be established by the people. In this case, the people are being ignored, which is a major violation of the Constitution. We need to do away with the concept of "judicial review" and return to a system of judicial review. In the absence of the will of the people, the Constitution should be our guide, not the individual opinions of the nine Justices who sit on the Supreme Court. Supreme Court Votes to Legalize Same-Sex Marriage The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that state bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional. The decision was a 5-4 decision, which was a 5-4 ruling in favor of same-sex marriage. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for the majority. This ruling is a big deal, and has the potential to cause a lot of problems for Christians in this country. After all, if the government can force us to recognize same-sex marriage as legitimate, then what's to stop the government from forcing us to recognize polygamy, pedophilia, or bestiality as legitimate? If the government can redefine marriage, then why can't they redefine other things? This ruling sets a dangerous precedent for our nation. As I write this, I'm keeping in mind that the Supreme Court can only rule on the Constitutionality of a particular law. If the laws that the government passes are unconstitutional, then they are unconstitutional, and the court can strike them down, but they can't overturn the laws on their own. However, if the laws are constitutional, then the court should overturn them. That's the whole point of the court. The court is supposed to make decisions based on the Constitution, not based on the preferences of the Justices. If the laws are constitutional, then they should stay in place. If the laws are not constitutional, then they should be struck down. To overturn the laws on their own is a clear violation of the separation of powers, which the court is supposed to uphold. I have no doubt that this is a major violation of the Constitution, and we're going to see the consequences of this ruling in the future. If the Supreme Court can overturn laws based on their personal preferences, then what's to stop the government from overturning laws based on their personal preferences? Our legal system is a mess, and it needs to be fixed. Pentagon Tells Christians They Can't Distribute Bibles The Obama Administration is telling military chaplains that they can no longer distribute Bibles to people. This is a disgraceful violation of the freedom of religion, and it needs to be stopped. Christians have had their rights violated before, but this is a new low. Chaplains have been told that they can't distribute Bibles to people who are either on or off duty, and this is a huge problem. If the government can force Christians to stop distributing the Bible, then what's to stop them from forcing us to stop distributing the Gospel? Christians are being persecuted in our nation, and this is just the latest example of that. This is a blatant violation of the First Amendment, and it needs to be stopped. This is a direct attack on religious liberty, and we need to fight back. If we're going to stop the persecution of Christians in this country, then we have to speak out against these injustices.
