Im probably going to ramble on and such so I will make my point clear from the way I see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice and proper, but it will be honest. My view is that if you want something, you have to work for it. If you don't put in the effort, then you won't get what you want. This means that you have to take responsibility for your own actions and not expect someone else to do the work for you. You have to be willing to put in the time and energy needed to reach your goals. No one is going to hand you success on a silver platter, so you need to do whatever it takes to make it happen.
