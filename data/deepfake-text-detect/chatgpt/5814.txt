First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person, and I can't understand the outrage against this young girl. Rebecca Black has been subjected to a firestorm of media coverage in the last week, and people have called her everything from a "pariah" to "an idiot." She has been the subject of numerous "tweets" and "blog posts" calling her out for her "ridiculous lyrics" and "awful singing." People have written about how she is "ruining the music industry" and "destroying young girls' self esteem." I'm not here to defend Rebecca Black, or to argue that she's better than the "stars" that are being recognized at the Grammy's. I'm just here to comment on the way that this girl's character has been called into question, and to say that I think it's a bit harsh. First off, she's 13 years old. As far as I know, she has not released any music before this, and most of the people who have commented on this are well beyond their teenage years. That's pretty easy to forget. Second, her lyrics are pretty stupid, but that doesn't mean that she's stupid. And it doesn't mean that she's a bad person. The lyrics are stupid because they are a poorly written song. They are a poorly written song because they were written by a 13 year old. And they were written by a 13 year old because she wanted to be a pop star. Third, I'm not sure why it is that people don't seem to think that girls can be good at the same things that boys can be good at. Sure, there are some exceptions. There are some girls who can't really play sports, and some boys who can't really sing. But most girls are just as good, if not better, than most boys at sports, and most boys are just as good, if not better, than most girls at singing. Some people may say that it's ok for a girl to be bad at something because it's a "male" thing. But how do we know that if it's a "male" thing? It could be something that girls are just bad at too. And even if it isn't, I don't think that it's ok to make the assumption that it is. Fourth, people are putting a lot of pressure on this girl. I'm sure that the pressure to succeed in the music industry is nothing new to her. She may have been dreaming of this day since she was 3 or 4. And it's probably not fun to get "hate mail" (yes, it's ridiculous to call it that, but that's what the media is doing). But she is a 13 year old girl, who has a whole life ahead of her. And it's not like she did anything to deserve this. There is a possibility that this video will go viral. That means that millions of people will watch it. Even if it doesn't, she's probably going to be famous in the next few months. And if she's not famous, it's only because people decide to stop talking about her. It's possible that her future could be very bright, and that could be pretty cool. And if it's not her future that's bright, it's still her life. She's not going to die because of this video. She's still going to be a 13 year old girl with a whole life ahead of her. And she's still going to be able to make the decisions that she wants to make. I'm not saying that this girl is a genius or that she's the next big thing. I'm not saying that she is "normal" or that she is "intelligent." I'm saying that I think it's a little bit harsh to say that she's a pariah. I think she's just a young girl who wanted to be a pop star. I think it's a little unfair to make fun of her for that. I think she's a young girl who deserves the chance to be a pop star. I'm actually a big fan of Rebecca Black. When I first saw her video on YouTube, I thought it was terrible, and I posted a blog about how bad it was. But then, I listened to the song again. It's not terrible. It's actually not too bad, if you
