Being transgender and wanting surgeryhormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think people who are transgender should have access to the mental health care they may wantneed in order for them to transition correctly; however no one needs surgical intervention on their genitals to be happy. That's not how medicine works I agree but when it comes down to genitalia mutilation where there's definitely risks involved then i can see why some trans people would resort to surgery instead of waiting 20 years
