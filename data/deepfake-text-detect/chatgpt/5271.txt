While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to win over the voters. I am so proud that Bernie Sanders has become Democratic standard bearers for many Americans who are tired of living in this country without even a hint of empathy or understanding about how our Founding Fathers lived their lives before America was founded on principles. His message is clear: we need new thinking; we needed reforms immediately after the founding fathers created this nation. He understands all too well the problems facing us - fought against the unjust wars of the past; encouraged American liberalism; talked loudly but only rarely spoken up when America's institutions were broken by the abuses committed by the framers; stood proudly against entitlement programs; and proved himself to be an authentic American hero once again during his presidency. Without this, I fear this president won't get reelected. Bernie Sanders seems like an ideal candidate because he can afford to lose some opponents while winning others. Maybe it will happen someday if he wins this election, but right now, our democracy needs more than he can deliver.
