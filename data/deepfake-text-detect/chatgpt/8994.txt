I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural norm and at worst a form of "muh freedom" for non-Muslims. If you want to get along with the people eating Asiatic food, don't go out in public without them and just take them home. It's not like they can give a fuck about your culture anyway.
