A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was removed from the game and just had a redesign to make him more of an infantry specialist Not such a bad idea. Sniper is scary but it's more balanced imo.
