I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think that it should be possible that these two memories are tied together in some way and have consequences larger than the nature itself like what happens when you combine two opposites? That said, it seems like there might also need to be something else behind this whole idea. Perhaps the kind of memory we see on a day-to-day basis well represents the things we experience outside of our own awareness? Maybe our experiences happen out of a very specific time period or placetime zone or maybe it's more common if we just don't feel any particular emotion at all.
