First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and they should have no bearing on the constitutionality of this legislation because most of these laws fail to require proof from prison inmates upfront before sentencing them for their acts. Furthermore, these criminal sentences could be overturned by the court system if the judge decides there is a reasonable basis being imposed upon inmates who don't deserve punishment under the law in terms of recent events. The other thing about the prisons here is that there seem to be several different assessments made regarding prisoners' rights against prison and probation violations at each level. What do you think? There's no way anybody can vote against them when prison conditions are such bad or worse than inmates walking free; like any prisoner would want. I'm pretty sure they approve but they'd rather be incarcerated wrangling with prison guards over whether the regime needs dubiously lenient punishments instead of regime changes so that the prisoners gain for themselves some sense of justice which is actually beneficial even without prison. I agree that the prison walls need to be closed down completely, however, at least temporarily, as they aren't doing much good for the prison population; although there seems to be a lot more freedom about where people go after release than before leaving. As far as the parole board goes, I'm not entirely convinced that they'd consider the prisoner welfare programs needed to work out rehabilitation better than incarceration policies outside the prisons since most prisoners are already employed within prison walls using part time jobs. However, they wouldn't know if there was an actual opportunity cost involved nor would they care either way given that they're willingly committing crimes regardless of how short term punishment may sound harsh compared to others who might otherwise continue living safely inside prison walls. As far as punishment goes, I believe there shouldn't be any more prisons devoted exclusively towards inmate offenders awaiting trial; rather, it ought to be abolished altogether. The current systems were designed to make people who commit heinous offenses easier targets especially those convicted of serious crimes while ensuring everyone gets what they deserved. Prisoners shouldn't receive unnecessary personal penalties during trials unless there really isn't enough evidence suggesting someone deserves a sentence less severe than what's required through a sentence handed down by the courts; then again the most appropriate punishments can come with that fact preventing anyone from seeking release sooner.
