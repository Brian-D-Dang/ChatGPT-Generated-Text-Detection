Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in the areas of healthcare and infant mortality. CMV is a part of this problem and there are many reasons we have become the "land of the free but home of the sick." Our infant mortality rate is abysmal, we spend more on healthcare than any other country in the world and we have the worst maternal mortality rate. We have the worst infant mortality rate of any developed country and nearly the highest infant mortality rate of any country period. The U.S. has 3.1 million neonatal and infant deaths each year, or 45 infant deaths every hour, more than 23,000 deaths per year. Maternal mortality rates in the United States are among the highest of all developed countries. The United States leads the world in spending on health care per capita and total health care spending, yet the United States ranks 36th in life expectancy and 31st in infant mortality, according to the World Health Organization. Every single year, nearly half a million babies are born with birth defects in the United States. Today, the United States has more C-section deliveries than any other country in the world (71.6 in 2014), and a C-section rate that is twice the international average. A majority of C-sections are unnecessary and done because of the convenience of the doctor and the hospital. A C-section should be done only when it is medically necessary. The CMV is a major contributor to the C-section epidemic and must be dealt with immediately. The CMV is 100 preventable.
