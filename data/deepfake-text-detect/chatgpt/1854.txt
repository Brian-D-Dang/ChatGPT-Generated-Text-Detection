From The majority of sexual assault are not reported to the police (an average of 68 of assaults in the last five years were not reported).1 Those rapists, of course, often go unpunished. Instead of running after one more victim report and another trial, we should be focusing on why these crimes continue: lack of education about consent, a tolerance for date rape drugs or alcohol, ignorance that it is illegal and fear among victims who do come forward because they may lose their jobs, friends or family. More needs to be done by our media outlets to educate people about what constitutes as non-consensual sex actions - something that seems to have become all too common with recent news stories regarding celebrities. Awareness is starting to emerge as all cases of Sexual Assault Awareness Month this year included hashtags like MeToo and TimesUp. These hashtag campaigns will no doubt help us better understand how society views issues surrounding sexual violence but it's time the conversation shifted from awareness toward actionable initiatives designed to prevent crime.
