The Golden Rule: Treat others the way you would like to be treated. The Silver Rule: One should not treat others in ways that one would not like to be similarly dealt with." There is a lot of truth there, but I think we can add an important corollary as well; "One must first learn how their own mind works before they are able correctly deal and interact effectively within society." If people do what doesn't work for them it will result eventually at least some type or degree form burn out (or insanity). And let me say right here now - Burn Out isn't necessarily bad! It's just when things get so intensestressful long enough without break then something has got go wrong somewhere because too much stress on any level tends towards anxiety related issues over time such depression, alcoholism etc... This may sound extreme perhaps even amusingly simple minded - But if somebody knows themselves already know where these boundaries lie don'ts cross this line into unhealthy territory than most often all need does exist only by getting back onto track again once aroused.. Easier said maybe? Than done.. indeed ... more difficult still since our minds tend usurp control from reality almost immediately after being triggered...Since Buddha preached 2500 years ago nothing new under heaven.... yes dear reader....nothing. Just different faces taking up residence inside everybody else trying desperately hard through various levels types social conditioning throughout life experience until finally arriving home sweet self...LoL Kinda gives hope though who knew?! LOLBut yeah basically everyone needs love pretty badly no matter age group probably younger ones slightly less likely due sheer numbers factor lack thereof early learning skills needed today vs 25-40 year olds prior generations which were trained properly during childhood.....This leads directly toward another impossibility quote "you cant teach intuition" yet many professionals pretend otherwise!! Or pray luckily upon arrival might have been successful thus far;) Anywhoo In my humble opinion Immerse yourself fully among those whom feel better about YOU regardless appearance.,and vice versa!! You'll soon find adequate grounds laid beneath your feet sufficient supposed stability required elsewhere....Pieces fall neatly together naturally unless destroyed intentionally!!! Pays off bigtime later down road; LoNexus: As u see fit! Time alone tells wheather its worth reading further:) Good Luck
