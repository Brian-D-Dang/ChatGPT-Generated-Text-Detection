Before anything else, let me say that I am not, nor have ever been depressed, suicidal or abused in any way shape or form. My life so far has been great and I am thankful for all the good things in it. However, I am interested in learning more about mental health and ways to support those who may be struggling with mental health issues. Is there anything in particular you can recommend?
