I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the list of all-time greatest films. IMO, it's a combination of things: great directing (it's Miyazaki you know), amazing animation with colourful characters and settings and story lines which are complex enough but not too complicated; good musicsoundtrack - they really have superb use of sound effects music in their movies! Each movie is like visiting another world altogether as opposed to most Hollywood movies where everything looks similar there aren't any distinctive features about each setting...
