I really like Coke (hell look at my username), like really. I made the trek to Atlanta about a year ago for the sole reason of visiting the Coca-Cola Museum. That's great to hear! The Coca-Cola Museum is a popular tourist attraction for Coke lovers like you. Did you enjoy your visit to Atlanta and the museum?
