While it's certainly possible that some people on Reddit may pretend to like Whose Line is it Anyway to seem cooler or more alternative, it's unfair to generalize this sentiment to the entire platform. Additionally, humor is subjective, and just because someone does not find Whose Line is it Anyway funny does not mean that it's not a genuinely enjoyable show for others. The fact that the show has been on air for decades and has a dedicated following suggests that it has wide appeal and cannot simply be attributed to a cult status.
