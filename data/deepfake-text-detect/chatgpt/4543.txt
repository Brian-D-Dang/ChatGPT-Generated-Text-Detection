I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other people who have tattoos...you name it - whatever gets their attention, they think "Hey yeah I want to get one!" And then we all know what happens next....they go out seeking info on ink shopsartist etc and are left with a huge amount of questions that never really seem to be answered. So many artists say things and don't give you real answers about something as important as your life long commitment to someone elses art work; they only end up getting some kind of vague response because they didn't ask in a way that would cause them any trouble by answering honestly! So why is this happening? Why do we buy into these unprofessional artist's promises before there ever seems to be an actual opportunity for us to see where the process goes after-the-fact. It can cost thousands of dollars in pain and time to finally find out once you're already deep down the rabbit hole if you will. And even when you eventually figure out how bad those canals are nothing compares to the damage done to yourself from having such big commitments made based off incomplete information..it takes years sometimes before you sort through the rubble enough to keep moving forward by trusting your gut again. When asked which studio was used by way of example, please remember TWO THINGS: 1 Artists lie ALL THE TIME (can anyone else verify this?) 2 Be aware of the fact that most studios won't tell you anything unless they feel it will benefit them financially...so be careful not to fall victim to shitty business practices due to lack of knowledge about your options. You DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE!!! Here is my opinion on the matter. I'm going to assume as much as possible here but let me just start with a few questions before I answer each point separately: Who cares?! Where were you thinking about starting to get your first tattoo? Do you have money? Are you planning to become addicted to needles? What colors do you prefer? All good questions right? Wrong. Let's take a closer look at the reality behind our own personal experiences. "Who Cares?!"First lets consider the question "who cares?" about our first tattoo experience. People, friends, family members, colleagues, strangers, customers, clients (i.e., boss), everyone.....we care because we spend hours sitting around dwelling over past mistakes and future regrets concerning such decisions. When you consider how we typically approach our lives issues (getting married, buying cars, signing prenups, making partner level promotions, job changes, buying houses, raising kids..there are literally hundreds of examples) how often do you actually stop to wonder if maybe something has been overlooked along the way? We talk ourselves into a corner every single day without realizing it. Is it fair to make fun of folks for being sheepish, scared, nervous, or uncertain when it comes to making major engagements in life? Absolutely NOT!! That's called LIFE!! Maybe you should try learning to embrace uncertainty too....just saying. But back to tattooing, the more you learn means the less likely you'll need to worry about "Who cares?." As far as getting advice from others, now THAT IS A DEAD END ROAD! To avoid regretting being taken advantage of later on...please listen carefully to everything tattooers advise YOU today. The OPARTS might be great at explaining to you how it works and perhaps even showing you a portfolio of samples BUT THEY ARE GETTING PAID FOR THIS TOO!!!! If you believe otherwise then you haven't learned yet (this holds true whether it is about makeup schools, law school, pharmacy training programs, plastic surgery courses, wedding planners, hair stylists, interior designers, stockbrokers, landscape architects, jewellers, funeral directors, dentists...and yes I am going to add tattoo artists to the list). Remember TOXIC MONEY ALWAYS FLOWS ONE WAY AND IT IS FROM YOUR TAKE HOME WAGE OF 80K PER YEAR (S). Don't let anyone fool you into believing that only lawyers or doctors earn tons of cash. Plenty more opportunities exist than inside traditional careers, especially in areas not directly related to conventional legal matters or medicine. For instance, here are two additional suggestions to save nearly 100k per year on housing alone while helping support YOURSELF during retirement: 1. Become a Real Estate Agent It may sound silly given that selling property isn't exactly similar to representing client interests in courtrooms, but since the market crashed, this remains a tremendous income source for professionals everywhere. With a degree in Finance and Accounting plus several industry certifications, you could easily land a position paying upwards of 65-150k annually depending upon location and talent required. While the average commission ranges between 6 8, expect a slice of anywhere from 30-40. 2. Get Your Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration OR Marketing These two fields are quite rare; there are no place within USDA Diversification (Taillike DiatD2nd, novebrrvenriven
