I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning. It seems to me that we have developed an entire culture around our innate sense of what it means to be male or female, which is something that I think our species has never done before in history (or even at any point). Agreed! I think that's one reason why people are so resistant to transgenderism - they're uncomfortable with how society has changed over time to fit into a gendered expectation rather than accepting individuality as well...
