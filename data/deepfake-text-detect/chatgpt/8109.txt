I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too great for someone like me who has been usedto city life all my live (and really only had access when i was younger). - It is still winter here - though we have seen some nice warm days this week! We also get snow on an almost daily basis at night or early morning.- Your health care system stinks compared with what you can expect if your employer provides decent insurance coverage yourself: So much red tape involved that last time they wanted medical treatment within 3 weeks duea car accident... which turned out quite expensive because there were no "super urgent" specialities available immediately afterall:- (. And even emergency cases will be delayed by hours... yes..hours?And doctors offices seem poorly staffed as well:- Most people don't know each other except through their work colleagues; so meeting strangersisn " t easy unless one visits social places suchas bars etc., but those costs money again......:-
