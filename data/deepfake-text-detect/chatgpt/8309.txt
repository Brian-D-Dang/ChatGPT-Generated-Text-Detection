Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians, including women and children; the purpose was not military but political - with Hiroshima as an example for Japan's surrender that would lead finally into World War II ending (which also meant it put Germany at risk). 2., 3. 4.: The bombing caused more deaths than had been won by any battle fought during WWII prior or after those bombings took place...and there are numbers available showing who died because they couldn't get medical attention once all things collapsed due partly from depleted uranium used against them causing diseases like cancer which don' stop being lethal till long time AFTER wars have ended! What is needed now? More studies done before another nation holds its own citizens hostage through these deadly weapons while believing their country will never come under such attack again expecting self-defense when most Americans know better since what happened last year kept secret so no one could ask "why"?!
