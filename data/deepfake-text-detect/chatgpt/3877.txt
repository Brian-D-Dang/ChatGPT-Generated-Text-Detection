Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I would have had to invite anyways if I didn't. So in other words, you shouldn't do the same thing twice; just send out invitations and party on! I know this might sound weird but invite me also:P We totally need a hangout with someone who really gets what we're doing haha
