This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special considerations within the justice system, usually due to the belief that they are not fully developed mentally and emotionally, and may not fully understand the consequences of their actions. These considerations often include more lenient sentences and alternative methods of rehabilitation. However, there is also an argument to be made that some juveniles commit heinous crimes and should be held accountable for their actions, even if they are not yet adults. This can be a complex issue with no easy answers, but it is important to consider both sides of the argument and gather as much information as possible before forming a strong opinion. It is good that you recognize the current state of your views being not wholly developed, and it is valuable to remain open to learning and other perspectives.
