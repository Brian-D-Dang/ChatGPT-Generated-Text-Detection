I believe this comic expresses the argument most cogently: Now, to my wall of text: I run a small software company that's reasonably successful. I've been doing this for the last 8 years and it's made me feel like I'm actually getting somewhere in life (and has given us very nice perks). We don't really have any clients other than ourselves but we do provide an API or two; one is free and one cost money[1]. Anyway... as much as I enjoy working with code, there are days when I just want to read something interesting - preferably funny if possible:) And then sometimes you find something great on Reddit that will make your day! I'll admit that these comics were not always difficult to spot here at reddit where they tend to get upvoted heavily, but I think this one could use some more love from the community. It struck me peculiarly enough during lunch today.[2] How would someone else react? What about you guysgals? Are you able to detect subtle humour in things normally thought too simple by others? Or perhaps simply over-analyse them?[34]
