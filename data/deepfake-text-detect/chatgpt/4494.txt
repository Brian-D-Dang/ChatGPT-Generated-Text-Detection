This is a very sensitive topic so sorry for posting it here if I am not supposed to. This is a true CMV, I am on the fence about the idea of going public because my doctor would take me off ART at that point and would want me to start treatment with drugs which I do not think are good for us (I have read some scary stuff). We were always able to get pregnant even without meds but never got past 9 weeks before miscarriages - no CMP or bleeding etc. But now we're back and things aren't looking as great! We started trying again about 3 months ago...we had our first one then stopped AF came back 2 days later only 34dpo with cervix closed.. did an HSG was clear except "a little bit" activity in the tubes. She's only 7wks this time so hopefully she'll be fine after 11wks like her sister who didn't grow until 12-14 weeks too. My question....this is crazy enough but what could cause such early loss? Is there anything worse than having babies earlier than you planned? Do any of you know of anyone else where something similar has happened?? Your thoughts will help!! Thank You:) Hi DeAnn It seems when you've been through your history already, it might just make sense helpfor those reading along not to jump right into interpreting everything they see in terms of pregnancy when you don't really know yet since things can change over time and toxins infections etc often play key roles. On further thought though.. one thing strikes me: If you keep getting them sooner more frequently... maybe this means their level (s) of immune systems functioning isn't quite up to snuff? It doesn't sound as if either one of these encounters ended well, did it? And if their levels weren't properly working when those pregnancies occurred, this must surely mean that the impact side effects of the treatments were greater than usual....so perhaps "carrying the extra weight" may also contribute to making their bodies work harder?? What's happening medically between the two seemingly ages of 10 yr olds??? They probably need far less testing? How many times does each kid test negative for CMVs by blood tests done every few months during childhood, adolescence adulthood???? Not enough questions! Sorry!! Good luck God bless you both;) Dear Susan, Yes I think it definitely sounds possible that they lost their twins due to low immunity. As my friend said in the other thread "it does seem that the worst happen at some particular age." So it makes perfect sense for them to lose theirs immediately afterwards. Don039;t worry, keep postive:O) Sending lots of love xxx:-D Thankyou soooo much for responding! The last couple i have gotten tested tp look at their T cell count etc..and all looked ok except last month when he had his 28 week sonogram, dr asked him if there was ever anything that caused problems while TTC and he told us 1 day from ovulation till we conceived the baby..............i found out yesterday that hsv A B AND chlamydia WERE detected in the blood! He swabbed himself before they took the cultures but I feel awful.....my husband says there is nothing that happened before conception that shouldnt have made us come across the results i mentioned above.....what exactly would cause that sort of problem?!?!? hope someone knows: (Hmmm...at least they caught it immediately! No wonder you felt bad ; Yes, the lab procedures themselves won't harm you unless you've recently exposed yourself to toxic chemicals [ie someone contaminated your home ] or handled infected animals, especially pets [otherwise known as zoonotic infections]. Otherwise they'd be running you straight off the floor for quarantine isolation anyway. Losing twins would certainly put pressure on anyone's body's ability to cope with stressors manage infection load...which means higher risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancies. As far as viral loads go, possibly having high numbers at certain points of cycles (57 menopausal women have detectable virus counts during menses) might add another strain to the mix. All this being said though, with proper followup care management, most people usually bounce back very fast usually within 6 months from initial exposure to the virus.The best chance of avoiding long term damage from HAVABITUALEXPOSURE to Herpesvirus A BOTH INTRINSICALLYAND EXTRAORDINARILYis via annual antiviral suppressive therapy [either drug or natural extracts herbs]. When given successfully for over year periods, the chances of residual latent virus becoming active increases significantly and will quickly reduce overall recurrences associated wrecrudescence [ ie reoccurrence of symptoms associated wthe presence of virus particles circulating systemically composing acute clinical episodes ]. This reduced overall recrudescent herpesviral illness burden helps prevent serious chronic harms which includes abnormal appearance of aspects related to premature death to expect seriously persistent enter its real::to proceed with the feeling real::with then to
