New here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong. Before I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal experiences only since it is my first year in college (I will be graduating next May) I'm an introvert who has never felt the need for a significant other or has ever had any intention to start one. In fact many of my friends with whom I grew up all talk about how they are lonely and have no interest in meeting new people because they simply don't feel the urge to do so. Whether you've been there before or not, it's important to remember that we're all human beings and there are good reasons why some people choose to spend their time alone versus spending more time with others. It may also help to remind yourself that this behavior naturally happens as humans continue to evolve and learn over generations. The reason why someone else might feel differently than you does not necessarily mean that your feelings are invalid. If you decide you'd like to date again someday, just know you're making the right choice by staying single, whether you enjoy being alone or not.
