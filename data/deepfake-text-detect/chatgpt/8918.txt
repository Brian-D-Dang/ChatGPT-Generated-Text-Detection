I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to get into this field without at least some degree of experience (in chemistry). And you're right about things like'magnesium' having an effect in the chemical synthesis. We don't really know what magnesia is though.
