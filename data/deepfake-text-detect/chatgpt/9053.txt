I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. It's so good and it is one of those things you know really well, something that has been a staple in my local area for years. The coffee at Roaring Fork Station was amazing! There was no other place I could go in that had had enough coffee for me to drink without being hungry as hell. I loved every minute of drinking it.
