First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't change the fact that this is an inappropriate place for it in my opinion I'd be okay with walking round half-naked on campus as long as there was some sort of barrier between me and other people (like walls or glass)
