One possible counter-argument to this opinion could be that there are several key differences between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton that may affect their electability. Firstly, Bernie Sanders is a self-proclaimed socialist, which may make it more difficult for him to win over moderate and conservative voters. While he has a dedicated following among progressives, his political views may be considered too far left for some segments of the population. Secondly, Bernie Sanders has not historically done as well with minority voters as Hillary Clinton has. In the 2016 Democratic primary, Hillary won significantly more support from African Americans, Latinos, and other minority groups, which could play an important role in the general election. Finally, Bernie Sanders has less political experience than Hillary Clinton, having only served in Congress for a relatively short period of time. While this may be appealing to some voters who are dissatisfied with career politicians, others may view him as less qualified to hold the highest office in the country. Overall, while Bernie Sanders may have some strengths as a candidate, it is hard to argue that he is at least as electable as Hillary Clinton given these key differences.
