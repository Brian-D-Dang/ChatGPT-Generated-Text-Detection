Linux is a hard to learn OS and seems daunting for the average Windows user. Many things on Windows cannot be used on Linux (Distros I have tried were Mint and Ubuntu), and it may take some time to get used to the new interface and commands. However, once you get familiar with the basics, Linux can be a powerful operating system with numerous benefits that Windows cannot offer. For starters, Linux is an open-source platform, meaning that the source code is accessible to everyone, which provides greater flexibility and customization options. Likewise, Linux is significantly more secure than Windows, mainly due to the way files and configurations are managed on the system. Besides, Linux offers a vast range of libraries, tools, and software that can be installed for free, making it an excellent platform for developers and system administrators. The operating system is also stable and reliable, with many distributions offering updates and patches regularly. Overall, while Linux may take some time to learn, it is a worthwhile operating system that provides a unique experience and numerous benefits for its users.
