I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think science works (and yes, I understand its foundations). You'll probably get much more out of my answer if you ask why there should be any sort of assumption about anything at all in order to give an explanation of something natural. [1] By "uniformity," here I am referring to the idea that everything was always exactly the way it is today and has been for eternity. This represents a very extreme version but still allows us to maintain our current understanding of quantum mechanics without going into too many details. There could even be some kind of "multiverse" where things are not the same everywhere we look! But generally speaking: everyone agrees on what water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 Celsius; no one can ever change those numbers by doing experiments elsewhere unless they build their own ovens with different thermometers inside them, which seems unlikely (but doable); no one will ever come up with new facts about energy levels or atoms' masses just because they built ten other identical atomic clocks somewhere else - they'd have to use every single clock available in the universe; etcetera.
