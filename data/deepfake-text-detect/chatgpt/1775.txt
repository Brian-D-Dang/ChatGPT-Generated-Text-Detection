There must have been thousands of times when I was talking about a hypothetical person when it came to picking pronouns and I chose the pronoun she or he, maybe even multiple occasions. And then there were some friends who had kids who would ask if they could call me by their name instead so that privacy in our family conversations wasn't an issue for any other members of my extended family. And then there are those people - such as the ones on this thread - whose parents never learned how words work and just assumed you should be able to pick whatever pronouns you want at birth without knowing anything else - like gender is something learned from books vs. biology genetics which can't change over time but we're supposed to know. This has always annoyed me because no one's ever claimed you need to learn them all before age 7! If your school didn't teach you English grammar until grade 3 (and most don't), do you think everyone knew every single word? No way. But many did. Most people aren't going to make huge changes at once with respect to language but learning new things should not be seen as impossible. I've known plenty trans people growing up who grew up speaking in binary terms to strangers anyway now they use non-binary pronouns etc...
