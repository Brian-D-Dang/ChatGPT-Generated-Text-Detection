This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point being that if you can understand slippery slope arguments and think you are Y (with all its flaws) then you should also understand slippery slope arguments other than Y so you don't have to use any arguments about slippery slope arguments because slippery slope means you're on a slippery slope. And you cannot dispute this. They literally teach you how slippery slopes work in school together with all their shortcomings? Oh please.
