Variable tax, or at least they way the US does it, is poorly done, inasmuch as it often discourages extra labour from people who may very well need the extra money to barely survive. It's not that bad... If you're making too little and are living on the poverty line then you get a check plus any earned income credit which makes up for your tax burden.
