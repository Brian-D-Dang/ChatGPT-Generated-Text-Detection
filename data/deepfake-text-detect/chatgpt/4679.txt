Estimates show that the average american uses around 4 times the resources that the planet could support, if everyone was an American. These numbers are somewhat lower in Western Europe, but it is still a very big gap between what we consume and how much nature can provide us with (check out to see where you stand). What pops into my mind when I hear about these numbers: Admit your mistakes - like we did for example during WWII-and then try to prevent them from ever happening again by making sure they never happen at all...
