My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered when reading scripts to actors in non-Western languages such as Arabic, Tamil or Punjabi would be: heshe (e.g., she acts), themself (i.e., they act themselves). It seems obvious now that we do not need these extra words; however it wasn't always so clear a few decades ago - but this was before many people had been educated about gender diversity." "Audiences like us want clear, simple language," said Professor Holland. "As well as knowing what my characters think, I'm able to imagine their experiences better if I know who they are as an individual person. You might ask me why you care whether someone identifies with the roles they play? The answer lies in how we see ourselves and our role in society. If I am unable to understand a character's identity from the text then there will inevitably be questions raised about the value of my own work and its impact on social change. And those same problems were happening at a time when the UK government was dragging its feet over recognition of transgender identities as valid, let alone equal. All told, I've made around 40 plays since 2014 which have involved trans people in all sorts of different ways, and the stories I tell feel much more authentic because of it."
