I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by saying something that could damage their feelings. Maybe she makes a good point about her religion and wants you to respect that? That's what she did... You should have just said "Hey, I'm not religious, so I appreciate your opinion" instead of dragging the conversation back around to her religion.
