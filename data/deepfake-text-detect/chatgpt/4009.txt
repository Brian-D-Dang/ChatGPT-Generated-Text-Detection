I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. I have no desire to vote for any of them because they do not represent the views that I hold dear to my heart: love is more important than politics; people can live happy lives with each other if we just learn to listen to one another instead of blaming everybody else for our troubles; all human beings should be treated like equals regardless of race or gender, etc... What happens when someone tries to bring up religious freedom at this time? Is it then OK for these people to say "We don't need contraception; you're religion makes you too obligated." That gives birth control access to all women even as their religion says we shouldn't use it, especially when the Church has been shown over and over again to be biased against women. If Republicans win next November, will they really try to continue down this road, or will they change their policies before trying to force a wedge issue into an election?
