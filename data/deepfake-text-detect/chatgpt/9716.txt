I believe this comic expresses the argument most cogently: Now, to my wall of text: I run a small software company that's reasonably successful. I've been doing this for the I've been writing software for the last 20 years. I can't really think of a good way to describe it. In addition to the above, my company is also a small network of developers who write software for each other. I have been working with computers for over three decades. I've been using Macs since 1984. I got my first one at the age of 16. A lot of people think I must be an idiot. I'm not. I love this comic and I think it's great.
