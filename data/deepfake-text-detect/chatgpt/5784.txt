This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... The Internet is not a safe place and is filled with predators. Bullying is a very real problem and it's more common than some think. Bullying isn't just name-calling and taunting, but can also take the form of exclusion and even outright physical abuse. Increasingly, bullying online has led to acts of violence against those who have been bullied. It's not a zero sum game, where someone's being bullied means someone else isn't. The problem isn't the Internet, it's people. Bullying is a problem, and should be stopped. That's my opinion on the matter, and I hope it doesn't have to be said that my opinions are not a given fact, nor are they reflective of all of the users of this sub. This is just my opinion on the matter. 1 Legendary Emerald, Aug 18, 2017 Legendary Emerald said: I agree. This is a growing problem in the world. It's sad. 2 Guardian Angel, Aug 18, 2017 3 Chosen One, Aug 18, 2017 Koishi Yoshino Registered It's not a safe place. 5 Koishi Yoshino, Aug 18, 2017 Not sure where to put this, so here: The problem isn't "the internet," it's people. I agree, I've never understood the idea that "the internet" is somehow responsible for bullying, since it's a tool we use. Bullying is a problem that requires us to address the problem, not blame the tool. 7 Rengar, Aug 18, 2017 CynicalParrot Registered Even though the internet is a double edged sword, it can be used for good. 8 CynicalParrot, Aug 18, 2017 I'm going to agree with this. 9 CamuBear, Aug 18, 2017 10 Lucca, Aug 18, 2017 Koishi Yoshino said: It's not a safe place for young people. 11 Narcissu, Aug 19, 2017 12 Minttu, Aug 19, 2017 LunarWolf said: I don't think there's any doubt that it's a problem, but I think the problem is more a lack of accountability and oversight in the internet. There's absolutely a problem with the internet itself, but that's not what makes it a place where bullying can take place. 13 Nero, Aug 19, 2017 14 daemon, Aug 19, 2017 I've never really understood this. The internet is not a thing, it's an abstract concept. The people are what make the internet unsafe. 15 Chosen One, Aug 20, 2017 The internet is not a safe place for young people Neither is the outside world. 16 Caraniel, Aug 20, 2017 This is true, though a lot of young people are going to be exposed to the internet at a younger age than they were exposed to the outside world, so it's more a risk that they're exposed to the internet at an age when their brains haven't had a chance to develop the way they need to. 17 Legendary Emerald, Aug 20, 2017 I'd say the internet is safer than the outside world for young people. The outside world is the one that has all the predators out there. I think the problem with bullying is actually a lack of real-world education. People don't seem to know how to properly treat other people, and so they act like assholes online and in real life. 19 Aeolus, Aug 21, 2017 I agree, but that doesn't mean that the internet itself isn't a problem. Yeah, bullying is a real problem that needs real solutions. I don't
