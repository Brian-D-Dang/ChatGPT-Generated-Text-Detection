Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one partner is not sexually dominant? Or does it just go away and leave us with something that's akin to masturbation (which I don't find very fulfilling)? Like uLilpumpkin says above me... It depends on your level of sexual maturity- if you're still trying to figure out how to satisfy a woman during foreplay etc then most likely it won't last
