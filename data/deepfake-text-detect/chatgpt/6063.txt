I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several friends who train rescue dogs. I didn't really get to play with the dogs. I think I did, but I have a very vague memory of doing that. I may have had a cat, but I never bonded with the cat as I did with the dog. I do remember riding a skateboard when I was around 4 or 5, which is why I don't own one now. I like to rollerblade, but I never got around to getting a pair of inline skates, and I don't think I'd be able to remember how to get back up if I fell. I'm pretty sure I was also given my first bike when I was that age. But I don't remember riding it. Or having a tricycle. And I'm sure I had a swing set, but I don't remember swinging. The times I'm sure I did do things as a kid were: learning to read, learning to write, doing homework, playing with my dolls, playing with my pets, taking care of the pets, playing outside, and playing with my Barbie dolls and their clothes. I do know I was a little weirdo. I used to pretend to be a teacher. I'd stand in front of my stuffed animals and pretend to teach them, then make up test questions for them to take, then make them answer them. I also used to pretend to be a secretary, then type stuff on my typewriter, which was a cheap plastic one with a little keyboard, and then print the stuff I'd typed, and then I'd try to get someone to pay me for the work I'd done. I also used to pretend to be an ambulance driver and rescue people and then take them to the hospital. I liked to dress up in my mom's clothes. I used to dress up like her and be her. I did that a lot. I also tried to put my head in a trashcan once, because I thought it would make my hair grow.
