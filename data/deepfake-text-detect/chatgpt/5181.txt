Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a war against Islam that was fought to save the ideology of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In Vietnam, the vast majority of the population was forced into supporting ISIS by international forces who had been indoctrinated in Islam through Koran verses. The war was waged for foreign policy reasons using weapons such as drones and missiles. On top of that, they were also fighting against the US government's military strategy based upon a series of false narratives about the United Nations ruling body called Iraq against democracy. It went on from there until the end when US imperialism changed its tactics. The Israeli government was founded prior to World War II which prompted the Nazis to try to conquer America with the help of the Soviet Union to protect their people under Stalinism after the Second World War. Trump has said he will push the Jewish state toward a nuclear arms race because it fears American soldiers would follow them wherever they go if America gives up power over Jerusalem. However, history proves that Israel only did what it felt obligated to do during the Holocaust. Israel's government began as a nationalist movement back then but failed completely due to numerous violations of the Jewish and Israeli laws including persecution of Palestinian citizens. Trump's government has intensified the conflict between Israel and Palestine since his inauguration. Israel has repeatedly violated humanitarian law by burning down Palestinian villages, bombing civilians without authorization or justification, killing hundreds of Palestinians illegally crossing the border fence, bulldozing Palestinian homes, demolishing Israeli settlements, killing Palestinians living on Palestinian land, and destroying entire communities near Gaza. Israel has attempted multiple times to undermine the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority Hamas Movement which has led to violent protests throughout the West Bank where police have killed many protesters and wounded several others daily. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israelis are responsible for Gaza explosion which left at least 160 dead. Israel continues to deny human rights abuses committed against Palestinian refugees which include setting up settlement blocs along the northern periphery of East Jerusalem, shelling civilian neighborhoods of Gaza, violating UN peacekeeping operations, burying children alive in occupied territories, abducting and torturing villagers, murdering Palestinian tourists, carrying out bombings targeting construction sites within Israel, assassinating citizens, parading Jews across the border fence dividing Israel, murdering Israelis on the ground on international missions abroad, kidnapping Palestinians fleeing Gaza and murdering innocent Palestinians seeking asylum around the world, committing genocide against Palestinians, protecting Palestinian people despite decades old Palestinian resistance movements and criminalizing peaceful resistance movements like the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). Trump administration denied Amnesty International report released earlier today showing that in 2018 Palestinian prisoners held prisoner exchange deal brokered by Trump revealed systematic atrocities against Palestinian prisoners in Jerusalem, Gaza Strip and West Bank including torture and summary executions resulting in the deaths of more than 200 Palestinians. Amnesty recommends eliminating all agreements relating to prisoner exchanges set up before Trump took office. Two weeks ago, Trump signed a round of cabinet appointments creating a Department of Homeland Security which will be overseen by Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf ahead of Trump taking office next month. Since Trump announced the new DHS secretary position, the Justice Department has threatened reprisal attacks against Palestinian detainees demonstrating support for Israel and has refused to release prisoners awaiting trial pending trial citing security concerns. The new DHS secretary position marks the second time in three years that Trump appointed himself. There hasn't been any evidence that Israel intends launching missile strikes towards Gaza except for reports here saying that the US military has temporarily stopped sending its troops into Gaza following recent incidents involving Israeli airstrikes yesterday morning. There isn't even anything concrete being done regarding the Israeli military plan which includes putting the Gaza Strip under Israeli control. Meanwhile, Trump administration officials continue to claim that Israel will defend itself against air strikes unless Hamas takes revenge for the murder of 11 Israeli civilians inside Gaza last week. Calling the situation "serious" Israel should have been enough reason why Trump appointed himself as acting secretary of defense instead of acting secretary of homeland security. In addition, President Donald Trump's administration needs to stop treating Palestinian terrorists as enemies of Israel rather than terrorist organizations. The Israeli government refuses to apologize for ending occupation of Palestinian territory which threatens global peace efforts worldwide. Palestinian leaders want to create an independent Palestinian state but are threatening violence and destruction initiated perpetrated by Israel because of Trump administration policies.
