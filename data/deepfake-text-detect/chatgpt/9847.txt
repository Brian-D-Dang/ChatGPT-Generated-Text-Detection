Redditors main real concerns about the website were monetization and the limiting of "free speech" in the rfatpeoplehate drama. Reddit has still brought many people on board independent of Huffman 's actions. Many users are concerned about the website potentially becoming too corporate and losing its original spirit, as well as the potential of censorship of certain topics that don't fit in with a more mainstream approach. Additionally, many users are concerned about the fact that Reddit is owned by a large company (Advance Publications) which gives it the power to make changes to the website without consulting the community.
