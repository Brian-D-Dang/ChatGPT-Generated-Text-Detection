I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, the child will be mine and all that jazz...but they won't know their dad because he'll probably die in a car crash or something while going home from work for missing his shift by 5 minutes. This might sound weird coming out of someone as young as you are right now (you're 21), but do not put yourself into situations where there is risk involved with your jobcareer path etc.. If getting fired means losing insurance then maybe think twice about being so close to endangering yourself like this? That way if things don't go well at least life has its upsides.....
