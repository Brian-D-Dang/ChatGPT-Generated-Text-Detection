To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to extend to gay people. Even if they're not my family members or friends (I don't really know any). So there you go: The three most important things about me right now is 1) That my sister got engaged! 2.) How this relates back to photography... 3.) And why it's so hard for me to write anything of substance here at all.
