I realise that this is a meme one itself nowadays, but as a black man I have absolutely no sympathy for any redditor who was on coontown. These people hate racism because they can't accept the fact that other races aren't just being oppressed and discriminated against by their own country's laws when there are many similardifferent race groups in this world. This isn't about equality or fairness it's about oppression with regards to slavery...
