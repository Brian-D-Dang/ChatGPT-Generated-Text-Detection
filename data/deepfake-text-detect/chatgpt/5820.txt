Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on that below). Okay! The first question is; What was your favourite subject in school and why? My favourite subject was art, because I loved the freedom it provided me to express myself in different ways. I was less than happy with maths, which was always presented as some sort of deity in school, and never felt it had much relevance to the world outside. I am most definitely a right-wing conservative, and I'm not afraid to say so! The main reason is my distrust of what I see as the extreme left, but also that I believe that people are naturally selfish and competitive and it is up to the government to create the rules of the game so that the game can be played by the best. I also believe in the concept of personal responsibility. I believe that people should be held responsible for the consequences of their actions and that the government should not be making decisions for people, or trying to interfere in people's lives. So to summarize, I believe in a minimal government and minimal interference from government in personal lives. I also believe in social cohesion, which in my opinion is best achieved by an individual having a responsibility towards the society that they live in. I don't think that this necessarily means making a lot of sacrifices, but rather a sense of solidarity and a feeling of belonging. And finally, I am a strong believer in the rule of law and think that the law should be applied equally to all. I also happen to be a natural libertarian and would probably support the legalization of drugs and prostitution if given a choice. I don't think these things should be legalized because they are good ideas, but rather because I believe that if something is legal, it should be treated just like any other legal activity. I think that the current level of immigration in the UK is too high. I think that we should control immigration, and for the same reason I would also like to see free trade with the EU, however I think that we should be able to negotiate our own deals. I also think that the government should reduce the amount of people on benefits, and that they should provide incentives to encourage people to work and get off benefits. I do not support any sort of racist policies, and I would like to see immigrants integrated into British society. I don't think that we should have political correctness in schools. This is because I think it stifles free speech, and I believe that free speech is the cornerstone of democracy. I also don't think that we should have compulsory religious education in schools, as I think it is the role of the parents to teach their children about religion. I do believe that a good education is crucial for success, and I think we should improve the education system. I think that we should make it easier to expel disruptive students. I also think we should make it easier for schools to implement discipline. I also think that schools should have less control over the curriculum so that schools can focus on teaching the basics instead of teaching students what the government wants them to learn. I also think that teachers should be accountable for the results of their students, as they are responsible for teaching their students. As an aside, I think that the private sector is better at providing education than the government, and if we privatized the education system, I think we would get better results. I am not sure if I have answered your questions, but if I have I hope I have not bored you too much. Thank you for your interest in my ideas! William Kendall on 11 November 2014 3:13pm Hello CMV! I was given the same questions but I decided to put my answers to this forum. I am not running for any position. I am just curious about what people think of my politics. Well, I am a Liberal Democrat and have been since about 2001. I am not a Tory, as much as I respect them. I just don't agree with them on certain issues. I have a strong Christian faith and this affects my politics. I am not a religious extremist. I am not a "Bible thumper." I do not run around telling people what they can and cannot do. I believe that every person should live life in a manner that is acceptable to them. What I will not support is the legalization of drugs, prostitution, pornography, or any sort of behaviour that would destroy the family unit
