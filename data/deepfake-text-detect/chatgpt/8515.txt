EDIT: a portion of replies I'm getting are focused on the defination of'libertarian' and the rainbow of american groups that claim it for their particular beliefs. If in doubt, replace'libertarian' with 'free marketeer', or at least someone who identifies themself as such (and not solely by referring to economic systems). I have no problem being called one if you want me too... but otherwise my feeling is we should leave each other alone about this topic unless directly confronted personally regarding our identification's validity....
