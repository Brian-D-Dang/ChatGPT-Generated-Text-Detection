A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that region and how they speak it coz mine is French, i.e., Canadian English. Is there a way to determine if your own language is French? If you are speaking French versus another language then you should be able to find out by looking at the barrier between your linguistics establishments website information page for the area of Quebec vs QuebecQuebec francophone Quebecois speakers how much of their vocabulary has been spoken elsewhere etc... not necessarily the person's pronunciation but what happens when comparing where someone sounds like the language spoken by that person from French or Quebec Francophone Quebecois dialects.
