before you guys bombard me with downvotes I would simply like to point out that I am not saying this is true. I am just expressing my conditional views that if it was, then the world might need a new economic system and another way of life altogether (if we are so weak as humans). I think its funny how some people have no problem calling for violent revolution when they get their pay cut in half but can't see any problems at all being caused by climate change even though scientists predicted decades ago exactly what's happening now! It seems every time there's an environmental disaster or oil spill someone will say "The government should take control...." well isn't taking over from corporations more powerful than governments? Why don't these same citizens demand socialist policies instead... unless maybe those ideas aren' re popular....? Just food fo thought
