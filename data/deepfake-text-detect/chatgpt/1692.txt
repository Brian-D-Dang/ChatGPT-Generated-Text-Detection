Headlights are mostly useful for improving the driver's vision while driving in low-light conditions and for increasing the visibility of the driver's car in low-light or foggy conditions. While stationary, headlights make it easier to see pedestrians outside your vehicle (especially at night); they also help prevent accidents caused by people who are unaware that someone else is oncoming when they come up onto their bumper due to poor lighting. A number of research studies have concluded that both daytime running lights and a high beam can be used safely together during inclement weather without affecting either driver safety or efficiency.[1] Unlike standard halogen bulbs, halogen headlamps use separate light sources so there is no need for an additional bulb holder inside the lamp housing like with xenon lamps - although this means you cannot replace them easily if one fails. These light sources comprise small white LEDs which are diodes with three conductors each and packaged into a metal case; the casing itself heats these LED components much more than any other component in the lamp assembly because the heat travels through heat pipes from the interior side of the device towards its exterior face. The difference between 60 Hz and 50 HZ converters is fairly insignificant as far as performance goes but since many manufacturers offer only one type of converter [...]
