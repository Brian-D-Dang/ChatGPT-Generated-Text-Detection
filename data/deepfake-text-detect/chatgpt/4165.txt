Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better. If that is so, what is the point - to entertain? I like fiction because it allows me to imagine myself in a different situation, or more importantly I can be someone else and feel as if you really were experiencing those things...
