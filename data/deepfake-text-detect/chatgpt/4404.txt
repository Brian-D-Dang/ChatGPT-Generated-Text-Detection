I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. As such, I supported Obama when he ran in 08' but now have no desire to vote for him again because of his views toward gayslesbians (i.e., "they should be allowed to marry. My questions: If you were president and the Supreme Court ruled that gay marriage was legal, what would your stance towards this? And, if the court has already declared it is constitutional, do you think all states will eventually recognize same-sex marriages or not? And lastly, why wouldn't someone who believes in personal freedom from government interference feel more at home with Ron Paul than Mitt Romney, despite their similar ages and positions on abortion rights? Yes, they may differ on economic policy, but Ron Paul espouses many of my libertarian beliefs as does Rand Paul (with whom I also share some strong philosophical similarities). First off, yes there is an implied accountability to stand up against those things which are wrong - even if it means losing elections. A politician merely says that something is right; there'll always be people willing to buy the lie over evidence reality. You could call them 'fools', easily find examples among both parties. That doesn't make anyone smart nor less stupid than anyone else, just different opinions. You can question motives or lack thereof without accusing others of being selfish; blatantly obvious hypocrisy just walks like a duck so gets shot by everyone... - zachwaughJun 23 '12 at 18:19 1 Well first off, players commonly don't want to lose money - especially in sports where there's no value gained otherwise. So clearly we're talking about 'what's best long term'? Secondly, there is a difference between saying one thing and doing another. Ron Paul isn't going to, say, cut funding for a university program because he doesn't agree with its methodology values goals. He might dislike the results if, say, science teaching is done through a Christian lens - but look at how much research and effort goes into every scientific discovery. In addition to spending time trying to disprove them, debunking certain theories requires very complex calculations. This takes expertise and expensive equipment, access to resources, etc. Not to mention the fact that you need a whole lot of luck in order to get a major breakthrough. What makes us think scientists aren't subject to these sorts of biases too!? Also consider that actual facts don't necessarily lead directly to truth; just as logic won't tell you whether anything's true outside of math... If we've proven that evolution happens, it may still turn out later that our understanding wasn't complete enough to prove that theory with absolute certainty; afterall, how did Darwin know he'd be able to successfully explain life on planet Earth within only 150 years...? Lastly,'soft power' is usually described as having influence through persuasion, rather than coercion. To use military force while stating that religion shouldn't interfere with politics neither soft nor hard power. - zachwaughFeb 15 '13 at 0:05 18 Answers 18 The constitution prohibits Congress from establishing religions. It specifically forbids any national established church. While during Reconstruction, Southern States tried (eventually unsuccessfully) to establish local churches throughout the South proper under federal supervision, none have been successful thus far. However, three Constitutional amendments (direct translation into English from French): 1.) Abolition 2.). 14th Amendment 3.) 16th amendment) allow each state to define human relationships and family structures. More recently, the U.S. House passed H.R. 1797, the Respect State Religious Liberties Act of 2011, to clarify existing law regarding religious liberty, though it failed in the Senate. Although most Americans support equal civil liberties for all individuals, they strongly favor constitutionally protected individual freedoms inherent to people regardless of race or gender. Nearly 60 of adults oppose allowing noncitizens to legally adopt children while 83 percent said they opposed opening adoption proceedings for interracial couples. About two thirds favored restrictions on stem cell research for reproductive purposes; however, 81 percent disagreed with using embryos created in fertility treatments to conduct research. Only 22 percent of respondents approved of banning abortions unless medically necessary, including 24 percent of Democrats, 34 percent of independents and 38 percent of Republicans. These numbers are slightly higher when looking specifically at Catholics, Southern Christians and older voters: 57, 65 and 67 respectively. We currently live in a capitalist society in which wealth generation occurs via voluntary exchanges of goods and services for cash. We all benefit from these transactions. Private charitable organizations raise funds and distribute public assistance across America with little government intervention. Individual citizens determine what kind of charity works for them, how much they care for other individuals and families, and at times choose to provide food to strangers via soup kitchens, shelters, or orphanages. Doctors donate their knowledge, skills and labor to serve a diligent group of individuals. When performing actions that affectively control the business setting, the job.
