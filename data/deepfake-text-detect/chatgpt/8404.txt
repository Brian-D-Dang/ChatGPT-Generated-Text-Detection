Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better. If that is so, what is the use and role fiction? "There's no way to expand your mind without reading." Maybe not for you; but certainly this can be achieved by listening as well! You might say "You don't have imagination if there aren " nt any books in it." But I would reply: how do we know whether or nor someone has a developed enough brainmind unless he tries something new himself (and feels like doing more)? Most people think they're intelligent because their parents always told them "you'll never achieve anything." Well - thanks everyone who really helped me on my path now:) So... however bad things may seem right before our eyes - just start thinking about positive ways around these problems instead;) Just go ahead with life!!! Don'T care too deeply ABOUT stupid details: YOU CAN!!
