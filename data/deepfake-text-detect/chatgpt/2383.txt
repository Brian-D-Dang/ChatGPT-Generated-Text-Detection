I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I keep hearing about how hard it can be for an adult woman who does not have children and wants them, but none of the successful ones are having trouble finding men or even getting laid on demand due to their age (not everyone considers 35-39 "old," especially if they're in good shape). My experience with both genders has been mostly positive regarding relationships at 40. The lifestyles may have changed somewhat over time as people came into adulthood during different eras, however, so perhaps there was just something missing when those earlier generations were younger? It's also possible that personal tastes shifted along side generational trends. Some things never change though - e.g., divorce rates have steadily increased since the mid 70s regardless of genderage group.
