There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring upon a young person, usually aged 18 or 21 years at that point. As happens with older graduates when they leave school... how can anyone 'graduate', if only because there are no certificates? Maybe it should be called something else instead like: "The day we finally let them go," as I believe this seems more appropriate than graduate from pre-school education!
