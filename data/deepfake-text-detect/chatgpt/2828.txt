Firstly- I'm a Brit, so if I'm missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies! While having a conversation over the phone about a movie (the name of the film escapes me now - sorry!) there was a minor disagreement as to whether it should be "Don't Worry" or "Dont'a worry." The argument being that one sounds more posh and therefore is 'correct'. Now I know both versions are pretty much interchangeable in this context but surely there must've been someone who went through the same thing when they were learning english? Did anyone else go through something similar? Or am I completely off my chops?!
