Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from local recreation leagues at 10 yrs old) from age 10 to 18. I played a total of 16 years, but unfortunately I had to retire due to my left knee injury and as my doctor told me I was "too old" to play. I felt very disappointed and emotional at the time because this was a sport that I had devoted my time to and loved playing. However, today I don't feel the same way anymore because I know that I would have more regrets if I did not take this path. But I am curious if you guys have heard of other CMV kids playing competitive sports? Hello. I have 2 kids with CMV, one boy and one girl. My son, who is 9, has always enjoyed sports, soccer, basketball, and running. We have been very cautious about his CMV and his treatment and have not pushed him into anything. We do, however, have him participate in the fun run during school, and he has played soccer, basketball, and run his own races when he is not sick. He has never played a sport that had a competitive team. He just wants to run, and it is a challenge for him to run, so it is a big deal. He enjoys the challenge. He is also in Special Olympics. He has one sister who is 6 and will soon start gymnastics and swimming. My daughter is 5, and we have been more cautious about pushing her into anything. We have noticed, however, that she is very competitive, and loves to play soccer with the boys. She will say that she scored a goal, but it is impossible to tell because there are 5 kids on the field at a time, so she might be right! I think she also likes the competition, and wants to be like her brother. She is in gymnastics and swimming. My daughter is 5 years old and I am trying to decide if I should push her into playing soccer. She is very active and loves to play soccer outside with friends and family. I feel like she would do great at soccer and it would help her with her coordination and build up her endurance but I am worried about her having any seizures during a game or practice. She does have a very rare seizure disorder and I am scared it may be too much stress for her little body. I am not sure if it would be best to just let her play outside with friends or put her in soccer. Any advice would be great. I have a 12-year-old daughter with CMV. She has been active in sports, cheerleading, soccer, basketball, and volleyball. She also did gymnastics. She has been very healthy. She has only had 1 fever while playing a sport. She has been playing sports since she was 3 years old. She has been diagnosed with asthma but has had a seizure free life. She also plays softball and swims. She will be participating in her first triathlon in June. I have a 22 year old daughter who played softball in high school and college and is currently in the process of going for her PHD. She is also in great health with no seizures. She has just finished training for the triathlon. My daughter is 8 and has CMV. She has always been active in sports and is on her school soccer team. She also takes gymnastics and ice skates. She is lucky that she has always been a very healthy child but there have been times when we had to watch her closely and make sure she didn't get over heated. I don't think we've ever had any problems, other than her playing a lot of sports. My daughter is 25 years old and she has CMV. She was very active in basketball and volleyball throughout high school and college. She was also involved in many school activities and she graduated college with a 4.0 GPA. She has only had 1 seizure in her life and that was in high school. She also has her masters degree and has a great job. My daughter, who has CMV, is 16 and has always been very active. She was involved in soccer, volleyball, basketball, cross country, track, and softball. She is very strong and still loves to play sports. She has never had a seizure
