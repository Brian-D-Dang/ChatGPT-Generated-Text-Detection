"Normal" (adj.) Conforming to the standard or common type. By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various'Normal' states of being, being the human condition, an average of the human condition, a modestly defined, and usually quite particular, mean. As a cliche of our time, we can say that, being a human, one's normal state of being is typically a state of disorder. An average of this disorder, however, is still a norm, as long as the perception of it is in the eye of the beholder. Indeed, the very perception of what constitutes the human condition is often the basis of self-identity, or its antagonist. My mother, for instance, considers me the'abnormal' one; my brother is the'normal' one. In fact, she has already proclaimed to everyone that I am the'abnormal' one. And being the'abnormal' one, she often says to me, I am no one. Or, perhaps, a nobody. In this context, I am not the only one that identifies myself with the'abnormal'. And I am not the only one that finds myself in a state of disorder, though not necessarily of disorder in the same context. The idea of the'abnormal' is as old as the idea of the'normal'. But the'normal' has taken a more predominant role in the context of contemporary discourse. The'abnormal' is not really that significant in the context of a general discourse. But the'normal' is. To be considered normal, one should have a clear picture of what is the'normal'. In the contemporary discourse, the'normal' is that of the Western liberal capitalist democracy, the'normal' of the West. The'normal' of the West has become the standard of the world, in a way, and has become the world's'normal'. The Western liberal capitalist democracy has its own idea of the'normal'. And it is still in a process of defining it, especially in the post-cold war era. And in the context of this discourse, the'normal' is in the context of a hierarchical notion, which consists of values that are, so to speak, of a higher degree of order.
