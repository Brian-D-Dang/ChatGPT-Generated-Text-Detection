My post is inspired by [this article] in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell "shares" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their education. The idea has been proposed before, most notably by Newt Gingrich... who was probably joking when he said it: I don't think the financial crisis will be solved until we have an economic system that allows young people to get some equity on their own capital and invest directly into their professional career... I am not sure whether this would work or not but you could create a new kind of stock market where companies would give shares to young employees as part of compensation packages and then those shareholders would appreciate if they made money working there.... We need to try something different because right now the traditional model does not yield results... But let's say colleges adopt such a policy - how do we know it works? To answer the question, lets study the following graph and see what happens when we allow student loan providers to issue stocks instead of loans (the red line): In 2004-2005, private nonprofit institutions issued about 60 billion worth of student loans at interest rates ranging from 5 to 7. If these schools were able to successfully raise funds through selling stock rather than loans, tuition costs would drop. This factoid is almost certainly true given that banks are charging borrowers far lower interest rates today on similar amounts of debt. That being said, I find myself wondering why universities can't come up with innovative solutions like cutting back on administrative bloat, raising donations, or selling naming rights instead of relying solely on government handouts. More realistically perhaps, it should be noted that most colleges aren't really nonprofits but quasi-public corporations funded mainly via public tax monies. Even so, if potential donors decide to loan their money directly to educational institutions instead of buying bonds backed by the federal government, that means less money going toward federal bureaucrats and more dollars freed up for higher salaries for professors and research opportunities for students! This seems like an excellent example of smart universities cashing out while dumb ones spend all their time looking for subsidies.
