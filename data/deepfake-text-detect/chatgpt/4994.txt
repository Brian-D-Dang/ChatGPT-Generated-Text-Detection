It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be harmed by humans in ways we don't usually consider cruel. But there are plenty of cases where it's wrong to treat them like they're animals; the Atlantic Ocean has been known for a long time as a breeding ground for the endangered species of dolphins and whales. And when they die, sometimes the zoo volunteers who cared for them will try something else entirely instead with their petssuch as leaving them for dead or dying while transporting them somewhere safe. But the animals aren't just endangered creatures anymore- they have lost their homes due to pollution or other factors too numerous to mention here.- Michael Culverin
