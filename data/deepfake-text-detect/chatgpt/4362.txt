Fairly simple premise. I'm 35 years old. I remember the Cold War. The first Gulf War. The Iraq War. War in Afghanistan, etc... I hear talk all the time about how we are at war with terrorism, but what's happening right now is just another skirmish of the same old thing that has been going on for decades. Will it end? Probably not, but it won't be pretty either way. The new Obama administration seems to have forgotten that if it gets us into a major war like this again then it'll only serve as an even more effective excuse for the Republicans to use against its policies. They can say they were preparing for one and were prepared to fight it if necessary (like they did in Iraq) or they could claim they didn't know anything was coming because of BushCheney and let them get away with their bullshit scapegoating without facing any consequences.
