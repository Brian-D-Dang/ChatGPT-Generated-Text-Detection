I have played Hearthstone since its beta and have had great times with it (I still do). My massive issue with the game is that the current meta relies too heavily on card draw. A lot of people are saying to just get more draw engines, but I don't see how you can make a world class deck without sacrificing your tempo, which isn't possible in standard play due to lack of room for creaturesdecks like Boggleswamp or Gadgetzan Auctioneer. These decks rely entirely on having their board clear before they start drawing. At some point we will run out of cards making the entire metagame completely reliant on just 2-3 cards per turn while also running into big issues at higher ranks where there simply aren't enough good 1 mana spells available. My goal here is not necessarily to say "hey would combining Amulet Coin and Skullcrack Totem be better than X" because it could very well be, but rather what kind of effect this sort of meta change has been having over time. Is it as bad now? Are we at the bottom? Has Blizzard fully realized that this new way of playing the game needs tweaking? I personally think they haven't done anything about it yet for two reasons: One being that they didn't want players doing something stupid, such as putting all their eggs in one basket and then realizing after some shrugging things off that egg is rotten and they should've saved up a bit more cash to buy another henhouse instead. Two learning from past mistakes is always easier said than actually done though so throwing these questions around might help them realize that maybe this part of the system doesn't need fixing until it's broken beyond repair. What does everyone else think? Let me know if anyone wanted answers to any other questions along those lines outside of that particular problem! Thanks! Edit: Fixed spelling mistake and added the "beyond" tag. Take care:) - SkyMtnEnderAug 23 '15 at 22:46 2 Answers 2 In a nutshell, high level ladder results show an average winrate by rank of 42 in your first 8 matches going away; 55, 57 and 66. In my opinion, this implies that the majority of games end quickly, before many minions die - usually within the first 3 turns. This means that half of your opponent's resources are spent clearing later minion waves, casting spells on cooldown, paying upkeep costs, etc., leaving little left for their own draws. That is, unless you're lucky, in which case you'll probably lose anyway when you reach 6 points, even when ahead. But even if you lucked out on the first couple scores, chances are next score won't be so favorable. You may already have lost 5 battles by this time, resulting in a lower chance to come back in each subsequent match. So effectively, you need strong early game control with either the right amount of draw power or decent removaltanks to survive until late game, or else you face unfavorable odds both against winning and losing. The latter scenario wasn't really true prior to 4th expansion, but became more common post. It was partly why Shaman received buffs in 7.0 changeset. And also note that winning consistently requires consistency vs opponents who are far behind you in rank. A game between ranked 50k and 100k shouldn't require near 80 minutes to complete, no matter how anxious you'd feel beforehand. However, Ranked Play is not designed to promote sustained long-term strategy versus different classes, only speed efficiency through lane swaps and LoS flips. And therein lies large part of the reason why Paladins were nerfed to hell and back recently even after maintaining good performance relative to other melee classes in recent years (Paladin was among best performing rotations overall), namely that building attrition strategies was becoming close to impossible since most encounters ended far earlier than designed for. Such tendency to inflate competition in order to attract attention led to spotty tournament schedule. Once again, bigger picture makes sense once it enters mind:p Anyway, speaking purely theoretically, a combination of Amulet Coin Skullcracker totem seems plausible to provide additional opening hand advantage and delay lockouts that could force opponent (s) to spend lessmore money based on certain situations. Yet such synergy depends greatly on combined set-up requirements for each spell. For example, opposing player must use Spell Hunter quest reward as Coin target AND take extra damage allowing Amulet drop. While Coin gives them choice of targets and allows additional coins, Earthquake tells enemy exactly which target they have chosen, forcing them to reevaluate plan and potentially create smooth chain reactions requiring low cost components such as buying coin, dropping Amulets... TLDR version: Synergies depend highly on specific board state setup conditions which makes combo harder to pull off compared to solid single card combos which cannot possibly fail outright in any given situation. Even though card draw, especially useful early game via Alchemists Apprentice, could make the combo quite similar to Least Grand Separating Void (which means is dont expect the rest of effects. As usual, should have aj
