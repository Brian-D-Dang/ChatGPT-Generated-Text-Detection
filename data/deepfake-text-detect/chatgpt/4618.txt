I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand that the way to get good grades is by doing assignments, making presentations etc., but somehow it seems impossible for me to actually carry on any of these activities because my mind will always be somewhere else. The moment there's an exam or assignment due, my thoughts are immediately diverted elsewhere (which usually leads into procrastination). A few weeks ago I got myself enrolled at a university where one does practically everything online: lectures, reading material, exams online with feedback as well as practicals and projects which were done entirely over email. To make things even more interesting, we also had weekly tests online at times when I was either sleeping or working. Personally speaking, this made studying much easier since you can easily force yourself out of bed after work hours. This didn't help much though since I still would find ways of procrastinating every time something new came along for me to learn. Of course you think "Okay, just complete what needs to be completed today!." But then again tomorrow comes around and I have no idea how to start off from scratch. Studying feels extremely boring, especially if you compare it to what I used to do before the online learning system set up. And let's face it - it's much harder than sitting down to read through several pages of text or listening to an audio-tutoriallecture series. It seemed so simple before now... Nowadays I mainly spend most of my free time reading books, watching TV or playing computer games. My girlfriend says she'd prefer me being home all day long instead of going outside and hanging out with friends. Obviously, I don't want to take advantage of her home while spending countless amounts of money taking care of a house that has never been mine anyway! So I guess my situation isn't unique anymore and I am definitely not alone in feeling overwhelmed about school life in general. Would anyone here feel the same? If so, I'd love to hear your experiences dealing with these kind of situations. I know everyone probably thinks I should stop wasting my days away, go back to college and finally finish studying, but honestly, I'm afraid I'll mess my whole future up completely if I continue like this right now. At least I did join some organizations beforehand, so hopefully they won't kick me out of them once I tell people what's happening to me right now:D If you're worried about messing up your career chances, I might suggest trying distance education; many universities offer degrees via web sites without attending campus regularly. No matter where you live currently, you could consider looking for opportunities closer to home, such as community colleges or adult schools near you. You may need to majorly change up schedules until you've figured stuff out, but nothing irreparable happens if you've already decided your path early enough. - KragenSep 14 '12 at 8:25 2 Answers 2 First, welcome to CS Stack Exchange congratulations on finding a place where you can receive advice on your schoolwork problems! From talking to others who struggle with similar issues, here's a couple suggestions: Learn to say no. Many young adults, including older ones, struggle with saying no. There's nothing wrong with asking others if they're willing to mentor you, try tutoring other students, or volunteer in another capacity. Saying yes to too much can cause you to miss out on some crucial parts of experience. Whether someone is volunteering for you to do something on their own time, whether they expect payment, and whether you intend to maintain contact beyond initial contact are key factors to keep in mind. Get organized. For starters, set aside an area in your room maybe in front of your desk or a corner shelf specifically dedicated to study materials. When assignments come across your screen, write them off if you plan to turn in anything later. Put priorities above deadlines: Decide which must-do tasks you simply cannot afford to neglect in favor of easy-but-useless choices, and subsequent entries prioritize those items first. Make use of sticky notes to mark important dates for special events and reminders: Set a reminder to call parents regularly during breaks to discuss goals for breakups, decisions regarding extra-curricular activity, and progress towards graduation requirements. Use a calendar app to track small details throughout the week: Create lists of upcoming appointments, whether short term or permanent Study group meeting 12 minutes from now, meetings with different professors, etc. These types of reminder systems can often eliminate impulse purchases of food, movies, video games, or quick distractions from Facebook and YouTube. Make sure you eat healthy foods. Don't skip meals unless you absolutely have to. Ensure your diet includes healthy proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fiber, fats, antioxidants, and water. Stay hydrated. Add natural supplements such as flaxseed oil and choline bitarticature 1 large variety of the true UTA! Understandable! senders after {TTU! ! sorts! reality! of places once injected!
