I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying that they'd be willing to pay higher taxes so long as it was going towards paying down our national debt! After reading all of these comments about how people are just unwilling or unable (morally) to contribute more than their fair share for a cause which is deemed worthy by others...it makes me wonder if we're really worth saving? Or maybe there's no reason atall why any nation should exist beyond its own borders....maybe everyone else has already found happiness in another country...and will soon do away altogether??? If not..why bother trying anymore?? It seems like folks could care less what happens here because nothing positive ever comes from us anyway.....except bills!!! How sad!! Makes you stop appreciating your family members who come home safely after being deployed overseas only once every 1-3 years......leaves little time between deployments when those around them suddenly realize "Gosh darned!!!! You can go back again anytime now!........"wondering where he'll sleep tonight......actually....hopefully over on base!" Yeah right buddy! The concept sounds wonderful doesn't sound too bad either huh? Just pull up one end hey?? No problem!! We gotcha covered, yep everything looks good oh yeah.."DING DONG BOP DA DO SOMETHIN' TO MY KIDDA FACE PLEASE TAKE CARE OF HER TOO NOW AND USE A CLEAN DIAPER THAT IS NOT EMPTY OUT THE BACK SKIRTS.." OH OK THEN DUDE CAN YOU CALL ME WHEN YOUR DEPLOYED AGAAIN SO WE COULD SPEND MORE TIME WITH OUR FAMILY BEFORE IT ALL ENDS FOR GOOD?"
