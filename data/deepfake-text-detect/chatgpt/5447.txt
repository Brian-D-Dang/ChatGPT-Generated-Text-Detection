People seem to feel right now that Sanders is just not well-known enough to even have a chance at the presidency, and that it will stay that way. Everyone has been talking about him as if Hillary Clinton is going to win this election, but not much else seems likely either (except for Bernie supporters who think that Hillary will never be elected), so maybe there was some kind of conspiracy theory that Bernie won't go anywhere with Clinton? Admittedly, Bernie supporters can point out that Clinton isn't popular among many Americans. But you're not alone in saying Sanders doesn't appeal to everyone except those who don't like Obama or Romney that's fine too; people are fascinated by the characteristics of political candidates nowadays because there aren't any real alternatives other than Sanders' candidacy.
