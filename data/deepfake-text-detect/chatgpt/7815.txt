While it may appear that consuming fiction is a waste of time, it actually has numerous benefits. Fiction can foster empathy by allowing individuals to experience and understand situations and perspectives that they may not encounter in their own lives. It can also improve mental flexibility and creativity as it encourages individuals to think outside the box and consider alternative solutions to problems. Additionally, consuming fiction can be a form of stress relief, allowing individuals to escape from their own lives for a little while and engage in a different world. Ultimately, consuming fiction can be a valuable use of time as it allows individuals to develop important skills and engage in self-care.
