before you guys bombard me with downvotes I would simply like to point out that I am not saying this is true. I am just expressing my conditional views that it could be. The problem is that we are all conditioned by our own backgrounds and experiences. I am not a scientist (although I have a degree in chemistry and physics) and I don't have the equipment to check out the effects of this theory. However, as a biologist (and therefore, a scientist) I do believe that all ideas should be presented to the scientific community and peer reviewed. If the theory is flawed and unsubstantiated then it should be rejected. I am not saying it is true. I am saying it is worth looking into. (I have to confess that I have also posted this theory on other websites and forums in the past and have had quite a few downvotes and angry responses. It is nice to see that this forum is a little more open-minded and has people who are actually interested in hearing other peoples ideas. This theory is not my own. It was presented to me by a friend who is a professional chemist. I have used the theory to explain the recent history of Planet Earth to my children (aged 6 and 8) and they have found it very useful in their studies of the history of the Earth and life on Earth. I am not suggesting that the theory is 100 correct. I am simply saying that it is worth looking into. The theory of panspermia states that life on Earth was seeded from space in the early years of its formation. The theory is not new and has been around since the mid-1960's. The theory is based on the fact that most of the chemical elements on Earth are naturally present in space. In fact, there is not one element on the Periodic Table of Elements that is not found in space. This theory goes further and states that there is a chemical element (or compound) that is 'practically' capable of reproducing life on Earth. The problem that scientists have with this theory is that the chemical compound that has been found that is capable of reproducing life has not been found on Earth and is not found naturally occurring in space. Because of this, scientists are of the opinion that the theory of panspermia is not a viable explanation for life on Earth. However, it is the chemical compound that is the 'holy grail' for scientists. It is the compound that allows the theory to survive. Scientists have searched all over the world for this compound. They have dug up the ocean beds and even sent spacecraft to search for this compound. So far, nothing. And in fact, there are some scientists who say that they have discovered a compound that is capable of reproducing life on Earth but they can not find any life to prove that the compound is capable of reproducing life. (This compound is called L-form bacteria and I will explain the theory in more detail later). So, scientists are baffled. Why is it that they can find this 'holy grail' but can not find any life forms that are capable of reproducing it? This is where the theory of panspermia comes in. The theory states that there is a chemical compound that is capable of reproducing life on Earth. The theory also states that life was seeded on Earth from space by meteorites, comets and meteors containing this compound. It is the theory that is giving scientists the answer to the question of how life was seeded on Earth. The theory has been around for more than 30 years and has been used in many scientific papers. The theory has never been proven. The theory is not considered a viable scientific theory by the mainstream scientific community. Scientists have been baffled for decades by this theory and the apparent mystery of the 'holy grail'. This theory has not been proven and therefore is not considered a viable scientific theory. This is the main problem with the theory of panspermia. The theory has never been proven and therefore, cannot be considered a viable scientific theory. However, scientists are baffled by this theory and the apparent mystery of the 'holy grail' that scientists cannot find. The theory of panspermia could explain the mystery of the 'holy grail'. The theory of panspermia has never been proven but could explain the apparent mystery of the 'holy grail' that scientists cannot find. The main reason that the theory of panspermia is not considered a vi
