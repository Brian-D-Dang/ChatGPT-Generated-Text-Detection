While everyone is entitled to their own preferences, having a preference against promiscuous people can contribute to slut-shaming. This is because it reinforces the belief that someone who enjoys or engages in casual sex is morally inferior or less worthy of respect. Additionally, having a height or weight preference is different from having a preference against promiscuous people. Height and weight are physical attributes that do not necessarily reflect someone's character or behavior, whereas being promiscuous is a behavior that is often judged and stigmatized. It's important to recognize that people have a right to engage in consensual sexual behavior without being shamed or judged.
