After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific sense. I think this is because we have been indoctrinated into thinking "free" means no restraints, which for most of us has only meant one thing: living under the control of religion or an authoritarian government. To be clear I am not saying there are no constraints on what you can do with your brain - but these constraints are those imposed by reality (or at least our current understanding of it) such as gravity - not arbitrary humans who decide they don't want to follow their own rules any longer and thus our brains must obey them whether we like it or not! And by "our brains" here I mean my own brain; every other person's brain would obviously behave differently due to differences in environment, upbringing etc., but from within my skull everything looks exactly the same as everyone else's so let us pretend that all brains work the same way... 'Free Will Isn't Real' - What Do Philosophers Say?1 This blog post was prompted after reading a comment left by someone who had received much criticism when trying to explain his belief in Free Will to others. In essence he stated that even if Free Will did logically imply moral responsibility then how could anyone possibly know that God didn't just make him do something especially evil out of spite? Of course we cannot answer questions without knowing more about the situation than is ever likely to happen. For example where does the blame lay- perhaps both parties were equally responsible, not guilty or neither party involved in some instances? The difficulty comes in when attempting to establish laws relating specifically to human behavior. Take two men shooting each other. One man shoots 7 times whilst the other shoots 9 times giving them equal scores of 14 points respectively. If there is a law stating that whoever shot first wins should we not assume that we should look for the first shot fired? We might actually get lucky and discover that the second shooter never intended to fire anything but simply misaligned himself or intentionally missed his target resulting in 4 shots being wasted. Neither scenario makes perfect logic however given that intent is impossible to prove we also can't tell whose intention really matters. So far philosophers haven't come up with a solution other than making things seem black-and white - either I choose to shoot or somebody else chooses to shoot but such solutions are incredibly hard to implement outside of theoretical examples. It seems that humans are biologically predisposed towards self preservation such that whatever legal system emerges will somehow attempt to cover for selfless acts. Can I kill myself and thereby escape punishment for crimes committed against society because suicide isn't considered murder? Does a murderer automatically become innocent if he happens to commit suicide before police catch him? Or perhaps nothing changes whatsoever since our goal is to create laws that protect ourselves rather than punish criminals...even murderers. Regardless of all this I still maintain the idea that it is ultimately impossible to say definitively that you couldn't force yourself to act otherwise through sheer willpower - a concept commonly referred to as "supernatural intervention." That said, I think there is evidence suggesting that supernatural forces play a significant role in shaping our lives and decisions unfortunately the majority of studies showing this kind of influence tend to rely upon interpretations of psychics and mediums or dubious methods involving animal testing and such. This leaves open the possibility that we may end up believing in spirits and ghosts purely out of habit (as opposed to actual proof). Some religions may claim that God controls everything while others state that God created everything including us just to give us free reign over His creations. When faced with a choice between these positions none of us can speak authoritatively from inside a psalterium or religious book. As always the important question becomes "Why?." Why is it necessary to attribute specific actions to fate or destiny when we already posit broader concepts like good vs bad, right vs wrong or freedom vs slavery? More importantly why place complete trust in individuals, groups of people or governments instead of theories and philosophies untested by empirical data? If we truly believed that God controlled everything what possible reason could we have for trusting anyone except Himself? Is our faith justified because He gave us commandment 3: Thou shalt trust thy friend?I'm sure some readers are wondering why I went on a tangent discussing god and the natureexistence of free will when my initial purpose was to refute the notion put forward by a commenter called ozzierock. Here goes...ozzierock wrote:That would require a whole different discussion and I am willing to go off on one afterwards. But basically "we" have decided we aren't going to trust anybody anymore. Not parents, teachers, doctors, priests, politicians and definitely not Gods. Which leads me back to observing your point of view and resultantly mine. While I agree with the overall premise regarding science, I feel compelled to add that modern day scientists often have trouble accepting the fact that humanity hasn't done a great job investigating aspects of science related issues.
