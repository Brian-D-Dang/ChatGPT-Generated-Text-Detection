I mean all jobs, such as police officers, military personnel, CIA operatives, security clearance applications, teachers, lawyers, and doctors. Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if you have any questions about your credentials or credentials that need to be answered by a professional certification officer before you can apply for employment in a particular field like law enforcement," said Joel Tulchin, chief executive officer of The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and former CEO of OPM's Human Resources Division.

Other job applicants feel the pay gap between the industry standard rates is simply unacceptable because they "have never paid any salary above 50K." This raises concerns about pay inequality among employees who want to earn more than 47K - which is just shy of what the federal government charges employers when hiring an individual employee. But government figures show there's no shortage of workers willing to keep up with this issue - millions of Americans work hard enough without paying high salaries despite having little chance at advancement. Still, employers wonder whether they're getting enough compensation from employers since about 70 percent of hiring contracts require hourly wage increases over seven years amid weak labor markets worldwide due to COVID-19 pandemic closures. "Employers must recognize their higher wages aren't necessarily proportional to what they deserve," Tulchin added. "Many of them do not realize it either. They assume that if they raise wages nationally then companies should expect lower wages elsewhere around the globe too." The Department of Labor estimates that three million Americans work full time while earning less than 25 per hour nationwide according to the American Federation of Labor. Also, the report found that nearly half of those working part time "will come out ahead financially through benefits deduction." To address the wage disparity issues facing employers, the federal government has proposed legislation costing employer subsidies totaling 2 trillion dollars toward helping lower costs across sectors including health care services, education systems, transportation assistance programs, food stamps, employment insurance benefits, student loan forgiveness payments, child support, unemployment insurance, overtime protections, staffing requirements and funding for public schools.
