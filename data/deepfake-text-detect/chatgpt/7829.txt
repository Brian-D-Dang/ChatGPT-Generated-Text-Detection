One counter-argument to the claim that morality is objective could be that different cultures and societies have different moral values and beliefs. What is considered morally right in one culture may be viewed as morally wrong in another. For example, some cultures practice arranged marriages, while others find it morally wrong to limit an individual's choice in marriage. Another example could be the use of drugs in different societies - some view it as morally acceptable, while others consider it a vice. This variability in moral beliefs and values suggests that morality is not objective, but rather subjective and culturally relative.
