Let me start off by stating what I believe the reddit basic income theory is. From what I have read from rbasicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society where humans are more equal, there would be no need for an employment system like we have now because everyone will get money delivered to their home every month as if it were government welfare and they can just spend this however they want. This sounds amazing but also insane so far away from our current reality (I am not even sure whether or not humanity's level of equality could ever happen). The question has always been how do you ensure enough people receive the payment? In my opinion, every person should receive exactly 1000 per year which comes out to about 724month at today's exchange rate. The only way I see this being done without creating unemployment is with some form of universal basic tax credits similar to those seen on a number of European countries including France, Germany and Italy. These credit systems guarantee each member receives precisely the same amount. Unlike bank interest rates which fluctuate daily throughout the course of any given day when accounting for inflation, these benefits cannot rise above an agreed minimum due to the fact that all members must pay taxes based upon the cash value of their benefit. Even though Hungary recently raised its national retirement age to 67 years old, the average monthly pension received was still less than 1,000 (around 832) back in 2010[6]. Some EU nations claim that UBI schemes cost significantly more than US100B annually while others say the figure might actually be closer to US20B.[5] The UK government had previously set aside around 3 of GDP to fund a Universal Basic Income plan after Brexit whereas proposals have since been dropped following the election result.[49] More commonly known asuniversal basic servicesare forms of social insurance offering unconditional payments made to residents regardless of financial status who meet certain criteria such as having a disability, illness, being dependent, living in poverty, etc.. They exist worldwide, most notably in Finland, Canada, Denmark amongst other places. A common criticism against UBI schemes is that they fall short of meeting the needs of individuals suffering severe poverty. However in recent studies in Norway,[10] Sweden, Netherlands, Switzerland and India among many others hundreds of thousands to millions of citizens have begun receiving guaranteed incomes; often on par (or greater) than that provided under traditional safety net programs.[1112]UBI and negative income tax are two distinct concepts. Negative income tax fails to take into account that making work mandatory increases costs dramatically, negatively impacting wages drastically instead of simply forcing employers to provide better jobs with decent hours and higher starting salaries. Under UBI, both employer contributions are reduced because workers end up earning extra income through different sources than before. That means no matter how much one earns, he or she gets paid something fixed - either directly via direct deposits, or indirectly via transfers from recipient households at a pre-determined time frame.
