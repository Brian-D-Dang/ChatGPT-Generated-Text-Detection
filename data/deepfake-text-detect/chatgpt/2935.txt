I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If we are only here for THIS LIFE, what makes us think that there is something else? What if all the beautiful things and experiences were simply illusions created by our brains to make us feel better about ourselves in an attempt to live longerhealthier because humans need external validation (or some other rational explanation)? This goes both ways though. You can't prove me wrong either since you're just as much of a skeptic against everything as someone who believes in God's existence.
