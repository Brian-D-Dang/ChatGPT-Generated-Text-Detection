Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the new bill, however, that would not apply to certain categories of federal agents, such as those who are in charge of "national security investigations." In other words, agents of the FBI, the CIA, the DHS, and the NSA could all lie to the public with impunity, and not fear the consequences of a five-year prison sentence. Of course, Obama is trying to do this because he knows it will pass. It's called the "Slippery Slopes" fallacy. When a bad law is passed, it will be used to justify even worse laws. Obama thinks this will pass, and then they will come back and "fix" it. Here's my question: How far can this go? This is the slippery slope to fascism, folks. Our founding fathers were incredibly wise. That is why our government has checks and balances. One branch cannot make laws, they must be proposed by the other two branches. And as I pointed out yesterday, the courts are supposed to be a check on the government. But how long will it take for the people who live in this country to wake up to the fact that we have become a fascist state? If we do not wake up now, when will we? What happened to the original intent of the Founding Fathers? They wanted a government that was small and limited. They wanted a government that would be a servant to the people, and not the other way around. But now our government is a giant that has gotten far too big. Now the government wants to watch everything that we do, and it wants to watch us all of the time. Just consider the following excerpt from a recent article by Simon Black.... This is being accomplished through the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones. As I've explained before, the US military has at least 30,000 drones. It's being accomplished through the collection of DNA, fingerprints, and retinal scans. The government is gathering and storing the biometric data of millions of Americans. It's being accomplished through the use of satellites, interception of electronic communications, and physical surveillance. The US government has 27 satellites in orbit which are able to listen to phone calls and read emails from ground level. It's being accomplished by adding a "Black Box" to vehicles to track our movement. GM is now installing a "black box" in new vehicles so that the government can track the location of every vehicle in the entire country. It's being accomplished by requiring all Americans to purchase a "smart" ID card. The government wants to make it mandatory that all US citizens carry a national ID card. In my previous article about the "national ID card," I included a video from a man who is the CEO of a company that specializes in making national ID cards. In that video, he says that it would be possible to create a "government-issued" national ID card that you would carry with you all of the time. But what would happen if people refused to carry it? There is a growing resistance to all of this. For example, the following is from a recent article by Michael Snyder.... Do you think that the U.S. government should be able to require all of us to carry a national ID card? I sure hope that you are not for that. Sadly, most of the other "alternative media" out there seems to support this. But I really don't think that the American people are going to stand for this. This is the slippery slope to tyranny, and I don't know how far it will be allowed to go. But hopefully this will be stopped. Let's hope that we can still find a way to avoid the fate that the Soviet Union experienced. So will you stand up and defend liberty?
