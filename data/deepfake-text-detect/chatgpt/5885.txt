This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... All the attention and criticism of Gamergate I read, I didn't get. It seemed to be like a way of trying to shut me up with the most bizarre andor incomprehensible straw men I've ever seen, and to avoid talking about the issues. I think it's just a very, very strange group with very strange motivations. So that's why I wasn't really bothered by the harassment. I'm not sure why people went after Zoe Quinn, but I didn't think she was that interesting, so I didn't pay that much attention to what she was saying. The only thing I know about her is that she makes video games, which I don't think is any more interesting than the fact that some people make radio programs. It's possible that someone was mad at me because of some thing that I said, but I'm not sure what it is. I think they're trying to find out who I am, so they can come and arrest me. I'm not bothered by this because I'm not actually afraid of anyone. I think that if a person who wants to harass me shows up at my house, I'll just invite them in. I think that it's more important to talk about the issues than it is to try to "win" any debates. I'm not a fan of the Gamergate style of argument, where someone talks about something and then when someone else talks about the same thing, they say "That's not the same thing." I think that a lot of the harassment is about sex. I think that people are less likely to harass men for being "feminists" and more likely to harass women for being "feminists." I think that if you said "I'm a feminist" and didn't have a vagina, you wouldn't have any problems. I think that there's a lot of sexism in this world, and I think that feminists are trying to make this world better for both men and women. I'm not sure what "feminism" means, but I know that I support the idea of making women equal to men, not superior to men. I think that I'm a moderate liberal. I think that I support having a lot of freedom. I think that I support having the government help the poor. I think that I support having the government protect people's rights, and I think that the government should help protect people's rights, but not infringe on them. I think that I support a lot of the things that liberals support, but not all the things that they support. I think that I support the idea of being able to have an opinion. I think that I support the idea of being able to talk about that opinion. I think that I support the idea of being able to have people talk about that opinion. I think that I support the idea of being able to argue about that opinion, as long as the arguments are about the opinion. I think that I support the idea of being able to have a conversation that doesn't involve any of those things. I think that I support the idea of not having to hear someone's opinion. I think that liberals should stop saying "you're racist," "you're a homophobe," "you're a sexist," "you're a misogynist," "you're transphobic," "you're a sexual harasser," and "you're a rapist," but instead, should start saying "I disagree with your opinion." I think that I'm more "radical" than a lot of people, because I think that it's important to be able to have an opinion, to be able to talk about that opinion, and to be able to argue about that opinion. I don't think that I'm very "political," because I don't think that politics is really important. I think that I'm a moderate. I think that I support a lot of the things that conservatives support, but not all the things that they support. I think that I support the idea of being able to have an opinion. I think that I support the idea of being able to talk about that opinion. I think that I support the idea of being able to argue about that opinion, as long as the arguments are about the opinion. I think that I support the idea of being able to have a conversation that doesn't involve any of those things. I
