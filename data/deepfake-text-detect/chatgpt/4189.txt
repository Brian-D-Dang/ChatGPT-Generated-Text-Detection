Throwaway account, my main is used for school. I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She has supported me through college and we both push each other to do better in life as well as in relationships. We have an amazing sex life but live apart due to her studies. I also am currently in the process of starting up study abroad with this girl! Have you gone home or are you still there?
