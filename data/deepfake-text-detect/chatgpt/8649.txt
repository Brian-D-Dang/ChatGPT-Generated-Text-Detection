I'm a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find sillytrivial. I'm currently dating a girl who is a little older than me (she's 19). I wouldn't date her if she wasn't younger. Eh really... I don't think that's valid at all. If you're not interested in getting into an actual relationship then we have more of a problem.
