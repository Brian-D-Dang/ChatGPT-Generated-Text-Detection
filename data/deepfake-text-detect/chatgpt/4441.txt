Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my health problems started coming up: unexplained fatigue and exhaustion, headaches that feel like migraines (with no migraine history), sore muscles from lack of exercise... Eventually after much research, it led me here. I'm now in the midst of trying to recover on a gluten-free diet; however, most of all, I want to know how you recovered? How did you get better when your dermatologist said there was nothing wrong with you except allergies? In other words, if someone could share their storyexperience as an autoimmune sufferer, maybe others will read this thread and find some relief or hope for themselves. Thanks so much! sarahw - thank you for sharing your experience. You have been through alot and seem pretty strong! Sorry to hear about losing weight though - I lost 40 lbs last year too, and although i am still overweight by 10lbs or more than i would really prefer being at my goal weight now is where i'd start. Do you weigh yourself regularly? If not, then we might be able to help each other shed those pounds! My advice to you would be eat cleanly of high quality foods and watch what you put into your body!! It's just easier to keep a tally of everything in your food once a week, rather than every day also! Good luck!! PS- welcome back to HF!! Glad to see you're active again! A lot of us were worried, especially since you wrote "trying hard";):p Hello, I became a vegetarian during grade 8 due to bullying getting teased. To make matter worse, I am only 2'11." From ages 12 to 14, I was bullied because I looked different from everyone else. I wore glasses, braces thick black brows which made me look very ugly in front of others. Also, my hair was frizzy, curly locks cut straight across the head at a 90 degree angle. During summer time of age 13 to 15, I got sunburned badly everyday without sunscreen. Even my mother used to tell people'she isn't wearing any makeup', while I had glasses on. At times, she even forgot that they were on my face. The bullies at school called me names such as 'fag' (for wearing glasses) 'nigger' (because of my afro). When I told my mum about these incidents, her reaction was 'you think God created sandals for you?' She didn't believe that it happened to me until I took her aside one afternoon to show her my burnt skin red eyes. I felt humiliated embarrassed of myself knowing that I couldn't fight back physically against anyone who wants to bully me. Recently, I found out that another girl has a similar problem to mine. We are both self conscious. Not sure why our parents don't realize that we need proper treatment instead of telling us lie that we are beautiful. Thank goodness when I went to uni, I left home already!!! Now I cannot live with my parents anymore because of their attitude towards how I dress, walk etc. I wish I never became vegetarian. This illness takes away lots of things from my life including family gatherings. People stare at me sometimes due to my appearance. Sometimes, friends laugh behind my back. Then, the truth comes out that I am suffering chronic idiopathic urticaria. They then encourage me to go as far as changing my name adopting new hobbies to avoid 'being stared'. It makes me unhappy feeling rejected lonely. I cannot speak out loud because of the itching sensations whenever I stick out my tongue outside my mouth. All of my upper lip gets swollen unless I wear band aids underneath. Anyhow, I must say good bye to my childhood days of freedom fun times. Never thought I'll ever end up like this. Am going to change my main source of nutrition today. After reading your posts regarding your experiences, I may stop eating meat for starters. Maybe it won't hurt to try. As long as I continue living healthy lifestyle, I should hopefully overcome this awful disease sooner than later. Looking forward to meeting other members of this forum. It seems almost impossible that something like celiac sprue could happen to two so young, yet it does happen quite often. Unfortunately Celiac Sprue doesn't come along once a lifetime. Some individuals carry genes that predispose them to developing Celiac Sprue and environmentally triggered negative reactions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can trigger symptoms as well. There is actually a 6x increase risk for children over 5 years old born to mothers diagnosed with Lupus compared to siblings. For older adults, having multiple copies of HLA DQ2DQ8 genetic markers increases your chances of developing celiac sprue. So yes, kids can develop celiac sprue at any point in their lives.
