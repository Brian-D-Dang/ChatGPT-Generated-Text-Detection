(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge the world. Yeah I agree and it's not a positive one but I'm just really tired of the discussion about religion over in ratheism, especially when you're defending Christianity as an institution like it should be done based on faith alone. It seems silly people believe atheists are so far up their own ass they doubt religious things even when there are plenty of Christians who don't believe in god...
