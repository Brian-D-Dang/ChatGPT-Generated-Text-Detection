Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of being on reddit I see more and more people who claim to be against vaccinations (it seems like they're getting smarter about it). What's going through your mind when you hearread someone else say that vaccines make them sick? I feel bad for any kid whose parents don't get him shots
