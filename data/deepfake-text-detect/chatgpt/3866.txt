I do not support GMO's and do not want to consume them. Many other countries have restricted GMO's because they don't consider them safe alternatives. I personally don't believe that GMOs are healthy for us long term, but if you seek to use them as a food it is your choice. So the purchase of GMO foods hinges upon whether or not the American public wants these? So, in effect, rather than supporting them because we know what will happen to them once passed by Congress, which would be bold, brave and courageous - we can just buy organic stuff instead!
