In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals . That is good in theory, but there's no evidence that this actually works. I remember reading an article a few years ago about how one study had found that dogs that received similar nutrition in both conditions were much more likely to develop cancer (that might be wrong though), so it seems like a case of 'better safe than sorry'.
