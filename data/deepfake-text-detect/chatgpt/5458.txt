I'm not asking anything about why we self harm - trust me I've got many answers for that. My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is wrong, but no one wants to sincerely explain what happens when you're hurt and may even think self harming actually makes them less attractive. And where are the human rights advocates saying that people should be able too? We all know that most of us aren't scared or embarrassed by our decisions and it sounds like they don't want others to feel bad enough Edit: Autocorrect mistake my bad
