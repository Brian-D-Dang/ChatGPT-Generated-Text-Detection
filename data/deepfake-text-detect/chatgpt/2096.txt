I'd like to preface this by saying that parts of my post may sound like they're bragging, but they're not trying to come across that way. Also, I'm using a throwaway due to the nature of what happened and how it might affect me in the future as well as a number of other reasons (some obvious some less so). But if you've been following along here at all for any amount of time then chances are good that we have something in common: A desire need to get laid more often than normal people do! All too often when discussing pickup or seduction techniques on forums etc., many guys will mention things such as "Girls don't give out blowjobs unless the guy is super hot." Or " (s) he must be really hornyturned-on" or even just straight up demand them because he's an alpha male who can say whatever he wants. This kind of rhetoric usually stems from the fact that most men are still under the impression that sex penis vagina contact where women act solely upon their biological urges without regard to anything else going on around her....or with him. Even worse yet though there seems to exist among certain segments within our community those individuals who believe strongly enough about these beliefs to go beyond simply spouting off nonsense into actually acting on said ideas. Perhaps unsurprisingly given his reputation one individual named Dax Flame comes immediately to mind...as does another jock looking dude known only as The Game Guru. At least once before now - maybe twice? - i've mentioned both names together and made reference to several specific videos involving each of them taking advantage of girls while pretending to help them improve their game; claiming that sometimes bjs aren't even worth getting since they almost always involve swallowing cum which means she has to make sure no drops hit her tongue otherwise its ruined forever. There was also someone called the Alpha Male Coach whose name sounds vaguely familiar as well although I admittedly haven't seen much content featuring him either compared to others featured further down the page link above. However regardless of whether your reaction towards claims surrounding female BJ habits falls somewhere between skepticism disgust or amusement ridicule please keep reading anyway because today marks an important watershed moment for anyone interested in increasing their sexual experiences through hooking up with strangers instead of relying entirely on long term relationships. With thanks to the man himself Mr Michael Simmons aka Pickup Artist Mike Salsbury recently posted a new video answering precisely why giving oral sex isn't completely pointless after all despite what many claim. You see according to Salsbury:"When executed properly, performing cunnilingus on a woman leaves little room for error. She'll know right away if you did everything correctly and gave her pleasure..and she'll respond accordingly!" He goes onto explain exactly how all of us can learn to use the skills necessary to ensure maximum satisfaction every single damn time. Unfortunately however for everyone involved based on recent comments made by PMS over at Roissy et al.'s site ROK Forum the full video won't ever become available again anytime soon meaning unfortunately nobody outside of members of PAS's inner circle will likely ever be able to witness first hand what makes sucking pussy different from regular intercourse. If anybody amongst y'all happens to be partaking yourself feel free to share details via comment below:D Anyway assuming none of that changes anytime soon consider this blog entry as your opportunity to finally hear directly from the horse's mouth rather than secondhand accounts shared loosely online. Consider it TLDR version 2.0;)
