Article content The Quran's teaching is set out as an inspiration for life by Allah Himself. Muslims worldwide are commanded to study this book if they wish to know everything about Him: His attributes, His deeds, His words, His promises - all those things that make up Who He is. By studying the Qur'an, one will come into contact with the Most High (Yahweh) and His beloved messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him), whose message was to teach Islam to his people so they would have peace and tranquility throughout their lives. Because it teaches followers how to live peacefully together under the rule of Allah, Christianity believes this ancient revelation must therefore have been inspired by our Creator; only if believers approach these teachings with intellectual respect can we understand why the Christian Scriptures were written down over two millennia ago." - Rabbi Mendel Schneerson Islam does not believe in original sin because there's no evidence for it. To it, Adam brought about nothing except death which is what happened after he ate the forbidden fruit - the curse on humanity. Even though Muslims say they're monotheistic, their prophet Mohammad made fun of Christians calling them "infidels" who had no proof of his god's existence. And when people asked him about the miracles performed during his lifetime including healing sick people or raising the dead, his response was always the same: "I am an ordinary man like you," adding later: "The angels (jinns) - they do wonders. But I don't think they can raise me from my grave." Do you really want someone telling you that Jesus Christ isn't real? If you truly love YHWH then your heart should rebel against such insanity!
