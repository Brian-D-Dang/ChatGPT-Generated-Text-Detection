I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured to use her husband's name after marriage or children. It is hard for me to imagine someone who would want that kind of pressure even if it were legal. If you are from New York though, this is probably not an issue as you can easily get around using your former spouse's surname in public. People here know how to deal with their married surnames and they don't care which ones others happen to choose. If your new friends ask about Newbury, you will simply tell them "My family lived there before my parents got divorced." Since we're talking about social pressures, why does anyone still bother to keep hisher maiden name? Also, while some may consider changing their surname upon getting married, many couples change theirs back when divorcing (at least in Britain). Why should one stay married just so they could continue to carry on being called by their ex-spouse's first name? Finally, what happens when two kids decide to call each other Mr.Mrs., but dad persists in calling himself John Smith?? (And vice versa?) When it comes time for the kids to go to school, where does Mrs. John Smith fit into all this? Is she expected to use both her maiden AND her husbands' names?!? Mieux vaut mettre son nom et le nom de ses enfants dans la rubrique " prenom " que dire qu'on est mariee a X parce qu'il porte un nom different du sien... A moins qu'elle ne veuille pas se faire appeler Mme Y qui n'est rien si elle n'a jamais ete une femme? Et je pense bien entendu aux personnes encore soumises au Peres Noel! En tout cas ce serait la le bon Nom pour lui donner du prestige sur Internet: sous mon courant sanguin Tome 1 homosexuellement oriente: La Vie sexuelle dans les mondes heterosexuels: de 10 000 ans jusqu'en 2013! On verra ca plus loin! Really, everyone has different reasons for doing things. Your reason isn't necessarily invalid, especially since people come up with all kinds of crazy reasons for doing things. So really, it doesn't matter whether you like Sue Heatherton or Laura Dennison better than Wendy Megumi Carter or Liz Wan; it matters only that you prefer either way. You should also note that although it might seem strange to make a big fuss over something that most people don't think much about at all, I am glad that Jason invented the word 'hetero.' Since I'm sure he wouldn't mind if people changed their minds about the term later, I wish him only good luck! Aaaaaand, TheWendy brings up another valid point: Even if you never had any intention whatsoever of keeping your previous life intact, somebody else might set themselves up to be "the only wife" or whatever. My mother used to say that if ever we talked about marrying, neither of us wanted to marry our current partners - and then, out of nowhere, she became engaged to someone she barely knew. So obviously we didn't let something arbitrary stand between us and true love. But now that was long ago and far away. And nobody expects me to live under my maiden name any more anyway, because my full professional title shows up everywhere already, including ebay listings, obituaries, etc. TheWoozles says: February 11th, 20077:46 pm What's hilarious is seeing these same people gripe incessantly about how people change their names. As if it's such a horrible thing. That seems ridiculous to me. What the hell is wrong with changing your name? Who cares if you call yourself Jane Doe instead of Susan Phillips? Nobody. Except maybe the IRS which treats every transaction involving money differently depending on what your name is. I mean, I've been known to occasionally mislabel my checkbook register solely based on what day of the week the latest payment fell due. Why should anybody think twice about giving oneself a new identity? Seems stupid. Unless you intend to deceive someone, and who the fuck cares anymore? By the way, I'm going to change my name soon [to] Sarah Kayla Fazenda Bongiovanni Scarnifero. It'll take a couple weeks until everything goes through, but we'll see. grabs tissues This thread has passed beyond the boundaries of sanity. Let's put this discussion aside for right now.
