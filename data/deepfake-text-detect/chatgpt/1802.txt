Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than others. There should be a difference between patriotism and nationalism, otherwise you end up with an "us vs them" mentality which isn't healthy for any group of people including your own nation-state since it's just as bad if not worse when done by citizens who aren't from there I disagree entirely. Nationalistic behavior is healthy, especially now given how much we've lost our sense of community through globalizationbut I agree about patriotism being unhealthy, and shouldn't happen anywhere but on a personal level within the boundaries set out under international law after WWII
