I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community and I believe that everyone should have the right to love whoever they choose. Having said that, I do not believe that same-sex marriage should be legal in all countries. Every country is unique and has its own culture, values and beliefs. I think it is important for each country to decide what type of marriage it will allow based on its own cultural norms. For example, in some Muslim countries, same-sex marriage is completely forbidden and would go against the laws of their religion. Similarly, some African countries may have traditional views on marriage that are not conducive to same-sex couples. In my opinion, while same-sex marriage should be allowed in certain countries where it is accepted and welcomed, it should not be imposed upon those who do not agree with it. Ultimately, it is up to each country to decide whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage.
