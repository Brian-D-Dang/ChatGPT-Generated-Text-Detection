Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 100,000 songs stored on their PC and not a single one available through this programm. I'd rather pay 10month in order to stream them then use some website that uses lots of CPU or even download each song everytime I want to listen to some new track...
