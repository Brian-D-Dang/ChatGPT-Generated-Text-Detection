I'm not a cop hater. I like to think I'm a relatively reasonable person but I'm honestly not even 100 sure how I really feel with the constant barrage of hate for people who abuse police officers and their families, especially when they're doing what most cops do every day: serve and protect each other justice." "What's wrong with that?" asked James. "If you've ever seen the footage, it doesn't look good whereas they act in such a way that they'd be hurt by you being there first," he added. "It makes them want nothing more than to kill you no matter what happens next because the fact is why would anyone go out there by themselves? Why does this need to exist?" James said he thinks the department needs to better understand that violence against law enforcement has increased since the pandemic began. Police Chief Lawrence Wiley said Monday afternoon during a virtual news conference that he wants everyone involved in any shooting incident where someone dies or seriously injured to explain to officers exactly what happened before or after the officer shot the suspect. Wiley noted that a homicide investigation into the shooting will continue Tuesday morning due to "extensive scrutiny" from the state attorney general's office. Wiley also announced plans Wednesday for a news briefing on Wednesday at 11 am. Chief Wiley urged residents across the city to report suspicious activity - including thefts involving vehicles belonging to businesses stolen over the past year - if possible. Wiley said officers are investigating reports of multiple break-ins occurring around the city through October 2020. Wiley pointed out that offenders could face criminal charges should investigators discover evidence of crime inside businesses that have been robbed as well as shoplifting incidents on the city's east side. A police spokesman did not immediately return requests for comment Sunday night regarding the shooting incident which occurred shortly before 11 pm last Thursday evening near Shepherd Expressway and along Interstate 94. Wiley provided an update via email stating that officers were called Friday morning about a possible assault victim outside of a Starbucks restaurant located in the area just south of the city limits, but that officers found no suspects. Wiley said he believes that robbery was identified earlier Saturday morning following calls reporting that two men armed with handguns attacked a hotel room. Wiley confirmed that store surveillance video showed two men leaving the scene together while another man approached the store from behind wearing masks and gloves.
