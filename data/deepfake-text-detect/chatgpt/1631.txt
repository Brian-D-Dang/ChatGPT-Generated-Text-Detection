This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... The people being targeted by GamerGate are not oppressed. They just don't like what's happening in America right now with regards to politics (and they have every right). There is a difference between "not liking" something and trying to censor it through violence while also calling for them to stop speaking entirely because that would mean things will never change.
