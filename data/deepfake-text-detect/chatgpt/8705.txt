Some Definitions Islamism - Political Movements that use Islam to justify either their end goals (ie. a religious state, or "caliphate or the means they use (ie. violence, terrorism). Islam is not defined by its political foundations but rather based on its ability to attract men into it and transform them in ways similar to those of other religions. Islamis - A religion which has a specific form when used by Muslims for their own purposes. It is a sect which uses Islam as a tool for its own ends as well as its own people's. This is a term used in Islamic theology as opposed to using it as a dogma in practice. Islamist - The belief that Islam is an interest-based system of law and order without any formal system of interpretation. There are two sides to this: one side believes that Islam is God's will and the other side denies this belief. Both of these types of beliefs hold that Islam can be neither real nor claimed at all; both holds that Islam is an ideology whose attainment cannot be determined solely from human experience and that the way Islam is discussed should be the chosen path of many generations. Some see this relationship between Islam and politics as a tangential thread in the wider social development process. Modernism - Modernism is concerned with modern society and its issues that affect us most today and over time. Its aims differ strikingly from that of the past. Modernists believe that in the future every human race shall have the same rights, powers and behaviours as before, i.e., within our own countries and nations, and that no nation or leader should ever challenge their rights or privileges above others. They also view the need for self-determination among peoples and ideologies as a human right, and only one aspect of democracy or coexistence amongst peoples may be acceptable: universal suffrage. Their belief that such a right could be achieved through properly regulated democratic processes would seem an even bigger step towards true equality than that of the more radical forms of modernism which I currently identify with. Religious freedom - Religious freedom represents an intermingling of interests and values that is common to all faiths throughout history. In religion there are the fundamental tenets of faith, including the acceptance of certain beliefs and practices regarding the nature of life. Religion does not imply a spiritual basis, however since religion has been practiced in almost every form of culture, religions are often thought, viewed and practised differently depending on how we interpret what they mean. Political and social rights - Political rights protect societies from oppressors and seek the betterment of all mankind regardless of whether a person chooses to live in the country where heshe is born or elsewhere. By providing these rights, Islam allows Muslim citizens to exercise their religious freedom and to strive toward higher ideals just like Christians do. However, these rights must be respected and protected against abuse and discrimination. This includes the right to work in civil servants' offices. While Christians, who are forced to serve the country's government, have long enjoyed rights under international treaties and frameworks, Muslims have come under scrutiny due to their different political preferences. They fear being discriminated against and exploited or taken advantage of by foreign forces simply because they don't fit into a particular political party or ideological set up. If Islam was seen as aiming to promote equality between people of different backgrounds and cultures then it would surely benefit Muslims particularly who have been subjected to discriminatory laws and policies. Capitalism - Capitalism relates directly to the domination of individuals who maintain a vested desire to obtain wealth via the exploitation of other peoples' resources. To achieve this goal, capitalism demands equal opportunity so that everyone in poverty can gain tangible benefits as well as benefits from economic opportunities provided by productive employment alongside working capital. Under capitalism, each person receives a share of their salary or earnings and the third part gains access to capital markets to support hisher desired lifestyle. Capitalism encourages the individual to become reliant upon hisher own income to sustain himselfherself, while ensuring that hisher needs are met in order to attain his or her desired physical condition. Whereas natural resources provide security for more than 70 of us, these resources limit our ability to construct new ones. For example, the production of oil requires human labour, whereas natural resources produce much less energy than natural resources. Thus, the country's dependence on fossil fuels cannot be ignored for longer than needed. Indeed, global warming is likely to increase cases of CO2 poisoning due to man-made climate change and human population growth. With increasing demand for natural resources, industrialization drives up costs for consumers and creates a shortage of workers. Socialist - Socialism emphasizes the demand for self-reliance through social actions such as national activities and popular movements. Social policy aims to establish conditions that stimulate collective action and make necessary changes through the incorporation of principles and values. These include the promotion of ongoing civil society advocacy and encouragement of community service. These principles focus upon establishing the basic needs of all humans in close collaboration with others, in accordance with the rules of science.
