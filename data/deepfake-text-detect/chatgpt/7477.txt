While some may argue that leasing a car is always a bad idea, this is not necessarily true. Leasing can be a wise decision for those who prioritize having a new car every few years, prefer lower monthly payments, and want to avoid the hassle and cost of repairs that come with owning an older vehicle. Additionally, lease agreements often include warranties and maintenance plans that provide added protection and savings. It ultimately depends on the individual's financial goals and priorities.
