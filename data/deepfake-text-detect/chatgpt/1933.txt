Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move onto something else. I find myself doing this as well because once a week or so there will be some girl murdered and raped by her boyfriend husband who ends up being executed for his crimes against women which just makes me want scream! These are real people with families out in society... that they didn't even get justice at trial time. What bothers me most though? That the members of their family had no idea what was going on until after he was sentenced.. How do you not know your kid has been arrested let alone convicted?? Don't you guys usually check if someone gets arrested?!?! Maybe its different where i live but here we always seem to hear WAY before any arrests happen!! If my son were ever charged like one of those boys I would probably never stop crying and calling him til i knew whatever happend wasn't too bad.... Does anyone feel differently???
