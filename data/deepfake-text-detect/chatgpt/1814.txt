For context: I am in the UK, so that is the political system I'm most familiar with. I am also NOT very knowledgeable about politics in general, but I have read enough to get a basic understanding of how things work and how they are supposed to be run. That's actually not bad at all! You'll find out quickly which way it goes once you start paying attention too.
