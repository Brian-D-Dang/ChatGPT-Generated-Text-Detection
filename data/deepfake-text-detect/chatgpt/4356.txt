To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental differences between the sexes.[...] I was fortunate enough to meet a few of these individuals in Rome during my last visit as part of the global symposium on transgender rights organized by UNESCO-UNICEF. I spoke with them about their experiences of discrimination against transgender people who are HIV positive or pregnant or have children: "People go crazy because we come out as trans. People think you will die if you don't know your gender. Some are more educated but they still treat us like second class citizens. We face a lot of abuse and harassment even when we try to join the [health] system which means giving birth at some point. If our lives become complicated for any reason - being sick, raising our child, getting divorced... - we won't be able to afford the treatment that would help the health system treat us properly. It really breaks our hearts. This is why we need equality; this is what makes it possible for us to live freely and without fear. It must end!" [...] The reality is different from what most Westerners believe. In places where women are equals within marriage (which is still incredibly rare), women can easily stay home and do all the work involved in caring for their families while their husbands earn money and travel around doing whatever job they please. However, in countries where male dominance reigns supreme, life is much harder for women, including being forced into prostitutionsex trafficking due to their inability to earn an income, forced to marry someone else they do not want, and the risk of domestic violence. So many countries had such strong restrictions placed upon women before the adoption of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, yet today they allow their values to devolve back into archaic hatred towards those who dare consider asserting themselves outside of traditional norms and roles, for no good reason whatsoever. Women cannot lead lives free of fear simply because society does not wish for it. Also, these men and women are both individuals. They may look similar (almost always) but each one has their own personality and background, just like any human being. Their feelings, thoughts, habits, etc. are very unique to them and nothing in the world can change that. So often times, people make statements regarding people based solely off appearances instead of actually knowing anything about them. For example, saying "Oh man, I feel bad for them" after watching someone die, regardless whether they were killed through violence or accident. We see this happening everywhere, especially online. You never hear anyone say "Oh man I feel bad for the person who got hurt, regardless whether he deserved it or not." There is something so wrong and disgusting about this mentality - it's a prime example of illogical thinking, of putting oneself ahead of others, of jumping to conclusions, and of generalizing everything. When we talk about equalities, let's not forget that we also have to care for individual people beyond our stereotypes and prejudices.
