I don't personally feel that the arguments against meat eating (morality, sustainability) have enough depth andor meaning that directly affects me or others around me to make me feel as if I should not eat it. But then again....maybe they do? Is there any need for "depth" in something as simple as this: In my opinion, if we insist on trying to live in a world where people die of starvation while some can afford steak dinners, we are being short-sighted, selfish and just plain stupid (and cruel). If you're able to formulate an argument from one single sentence like this, maybe your beliefs are rather shallow. You could say the same about a person who says "All men deserve equal rights under the law," which is essentially what veganism requires since animals cannot give their consent. Another example would be "all children should go through life free from all pain." My oven is bigger than yours. It therefore prints more recipes.

Because animal agriculture wreaks havoc on environmental resources, food safety nets and even human health, creating hugely negative impacts across multiple fronts. And yet, despite these harms, millions upon millions of people remain convinced that consuming animal products makes them better humans. No wonder so many vegans want to talk smack about us carnivores. To those vegetarians and vegans struggling with our perpetual bad rep and inability to convert nonbelievers, here's our down-to-earth guide to "making peace" with carnivores you might already know. 1. Don't assume people care only about what they believe directly impacts themselves, unless you plan on becoming a martyr yourself. We take far greater interest in issues affecting other living beings because most species exist at lower trophic levels than Homo sapiens. Moreover, when we try to wrangle over consumption habits among ourselves, we often end up getting caught up in seemingly intractable debates about values that affect multiple aspects of modern society-like gender equity or LGBT equality-as opposed to focusing on our own needs first and foremost. That said, consider bringing into conversations discussions so touchy that you prefer to stay away from such topics entirely. For instance, instead of decrying the fact that lions kill antelope, celebrate instead that the relationship between lionesses and male pride members helps balance nature's ecosystem. Acknowledge that all people aren't always looking solely after themselves; sometimes they look at the big picture too. Acknowledging that other species share planet Earth doesn't mean you think they're worthy of the same respect and compassion as you do. Just ask anyone who has ever lost a pet dog or cat. 2. Stop using terms like "meat eater" or "carnivore" to describe someone else. These labels hold contemptible connotations in western culture, making it seem okay to call another human being less than fully humane simply because he eats flesh. Call that person whatever feels appropriate-roast beef chipper, cheese grater, grilled cheese sandwich guy, burger fiend, omnophiliac - but never label him based on his dietary inclinations alone. There are more than 4 billion vegetarians worldwide, but no more than 15 of the global population base their meals off plant material exclusively. Plus, according to PETA research, roughly 80 million American consumers claim to identify with either the main diet category identified-vegetarian, pescatarian, lacto-ovo-semistocatal (LAS), flexitarian or pesco-vegan-while the rest dabble in various degrees of frugalness. Most Americans fall somewhere along the spectrum of partial or complete abstainers. So stop assuming the state of a cow, sheep or pig determines whether they are ethical to eat. Everyone knows chicken nuggets taste good, but does it really matter if chickens are raised humanely? Not necessarily. But all things having been considered, put yourself in the shoes of carnivorous friends and relatives. Do you tell them meat tastes great, or just enjoy the fact that they don't need to eat fish sticks anymore? Would you expect them to change just because you adopt certain morals concerning animal life, or would you accept that they maintain their own set of rules regarding the treatment of animals? 3. Consider educating yourself. Many uninformed people have difficulty understanding vegetarian diets correctly and properly calibrated quantities means that are deemed acceptable reasonable if they expect a lotusriparmanagers to manage?
