As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a difficult decision to make. However, it is important to consider the value of a human life and the impact that it could have on the child's family and community. It is also important to consider the potential for medical breakthroughs and future medical advancements that may improve the chances of recovery for the child. Ultimately, it is up to medical professionals, the family, and the community to weigh the potential costs and benefits and make a decision based on what is best for the child and society as a whole.
