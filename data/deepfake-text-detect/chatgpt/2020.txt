This is a very sensitive topic so sorry for posting it here if I am not supposed to. This is a true CMV, I am on the fence about the matter and would like your commentsthoughts. Edit: thanks everyone:) I know that people often say "no one deserves this" when talking about rape or sexual assault but... they do deserve it because we are all monsters in some way right? We're all capable of committing acts far worse than what these men did (and have done) before them. It's how humanity works unfortunately.. That doesn't make sense at all. If you actually believe anything even remotely close to that then why didn't you start with that as opposed to defending rapists?
