For those who don't know, the trolley problem is this: You and another person are on a bridge which is over a trolley track. 5 people are tied to the tracks in front of you so they can be run down by one of your ride-ons if it comes that way (or any other possible outcome) but you have no means of knowing whether or not that will happen now or tomorrow. If all five of them were viable candidates for riding the rails into oblivion then there would only ever need to be enough room left at the end of the line after the cars had passed through for two more passengers. So hypothetically speaking, let's say we're about to blow up an international airport full of innocent civilians; how many would get saved? If everyone chooses someone else as their candidate to die instead of themselves they'll save 3 outta 5 because each one could theoretically sacrifice 12 of himself just like everyone else has already done. I think most people would choose me though
