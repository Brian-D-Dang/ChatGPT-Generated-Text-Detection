I am an American High School student who was taught 2 different versions of the Civil war throughout my schooling career. In elementary school we first learned about the civil war as if it had no relevance to us today and that there were only positive elements in our country's history with the end result being slavery, then when I reached middle school they started teaching me a more accurate version where Americans actually fought for their rights against the government until finally winning independence from England. However after learning this my opinion on both sides changed drastically because now instead of seeing myself as fighting for something very important (consisting of freedom) to be taken away by another human being, I see them as two completely separate entities which are not related at all.
