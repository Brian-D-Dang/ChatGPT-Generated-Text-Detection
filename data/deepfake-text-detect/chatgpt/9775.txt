After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the issue of gun violence in schools arises, it is important to understand the root causes of why this occurs. While some people may point to video games or other cultural factors as the cause of gun violence in schools, the underlying cause is a lack of mental health resources and support for students in school systems. To address the problem of gun violence in schools, it is necessary to focus on providing more mental health professionals in school systems. Mental health professionals could be used to help identify and intervene when students are exhibiting signs of stress or potential violence. Furthermore, more attention should be paid to creating a safe and supportive environment for students who may be struggling with mental health issues or be feeling isolated or powerless. This could involve providing additional counseling services and peer-to-peer mentoring programs. Additionally, legislators should look at ways to reduce access to guns and ensure that those who do have access are properly trained and knowledgeable in gun safety. This could include ensuring that background checks are conducted before guns are sold or requiring a waiting period between the purchase and possession of a gun. Additionally, laws banning the sale of firearms to anyone under the age of 21 should be implemented. Ultimately, reducing access to guns and increasing mental health resources in school systems are key components of addressing the issue of gun violence in schools. It is essential to take a holistic approach to this problem by looking at all the potential causes and providing solutions that will help keep students safe.
