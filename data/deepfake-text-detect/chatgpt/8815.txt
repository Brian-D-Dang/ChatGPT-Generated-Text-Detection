Snowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned. Snowden did not reveal details on his efforts in China or Russia, so the story only serves as an excuse for him to hide behind his political convictions and ignore the world's most powerful people. Obama must recall that in 2006, Al Gore was president when George W. Bush ran for president; Obama should remember 2007, when Hillary Clinton became first lady; and Barack Obama should remember 2009, when Mitt Romney became president.
