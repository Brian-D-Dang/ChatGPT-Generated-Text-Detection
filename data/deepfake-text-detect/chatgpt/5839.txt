This is a problem I always encounter when I drive on a highway. The speed limit in the most used highway where I live is 70. I usually go at about 80. I really don't know why, but whenever I pass a car, the driver tries to match my speed. I don't want that so I usually over take. I know they are just trying to get out of the way of the person who's behind me, but that's not the problem. What do you think I should do? Is it my fault if they do that? Or should I just ignore them and let them pass?
