Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians, including children and women; the harm caused was immeasurable. 2. Those bombs also killed innocent people who had no direct part in any attack on the U.S., such as farm laborers and others working in Projectile Fusion plants. 3. The vast majority of Americans have expressed disappointment regarding President Truman's decision to use nuclear weapons during World War II. What is your evidence supporting or against the assertion that the United States has never justified its nuclear use?
