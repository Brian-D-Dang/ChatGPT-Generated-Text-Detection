Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in their field of study. Now one would think that since we are so far away from the equator we should be much better than this but it doesn't look like that is the case. What do you all think? Are Americans too lazy or just simply don't care about getting good grades at school? Thanks! Quite honestly, your question is poorly worded. The term "lackluster" tends to suggest that these students aren't motivated enough by the material they studied (or weren't able to grasp certain concepts), whereas you're asking if Americans are too lazy, which implies that what they did was bad. In other words, no, they are actually not as capable as some people may assume because they choose not to get jobs after college. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though; let's face it, most of us were probably only barely above average during our highschool years and even with the help of tutorsstudy groups, we still struggled to make it through any course worth mentioning. The difference between someone who will graduate college with an A and someone who won't depends on where he went to college. Some of my closest friends graduated with BAs in their respective fields before heading into the workforce, while others dropped out due to chronic stress following graduation. Of course everyone has different reasons for choosing to go to college and ultimately deciding against going for wider employment opportunities afterwards, but that's sort of the point I think you asked a very hard-hitting question with very vague wording.
