I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost mathematically impossible to get these species in pure form. What is causing this behavior? So far: It seems like all chemical reactions tend toward equilibrium (chemical potentials cancel out). So why does some element start with an abundance of one kind over another? Is there something about the bonding that this element has which would make it unlikely to be found in masses larger than 1? Please don't explain anything too complicated; just state what bond (s) causescontributes to the stability of those species being more abundant than others - for example, if you know how thermal motion contributes to the formation probability of heavier atoms, then tell me!:) EDIT: As pointed out by MathieuMontabone, there are indeed stable isotopes of many elements in nature. This shouldn't affect my question though because we're talking only about synthetic chemistry here. The reason these aren't "stable" at room temperature is probably due to their short half-lives. Are they still unstable enough not to appear naturally except under very particular conditions (such as where they can catalyze redox reactions)? Also, please note that I already know the answer to my own question below;):D. Thanks for the answers anyway guys )! A: The number you cite refers to relative abundances, i.e., the ratio between two quantities. One quantity should go up while the other goes down in order for both to remain constant during the reaction (as your textbook mentioned). However, the absolute values will change depending on temperature changes etc. so the ratios might stay basically unchanged, yet species could become less or even absent from standard laboratory reagents used for synthesis purposes. Relative amounts are usually explained within the framework of statistical mechanics. There is certainly nothing fundamental in them as long as systems reach thermodynamic equilibrium - and the construction of a perfect physical model is extremely difficult even when dealing with simple molecules.
