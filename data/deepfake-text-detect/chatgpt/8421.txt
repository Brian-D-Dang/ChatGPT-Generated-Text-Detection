I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past and present nuclear tests, we know that no country has ever been able or willing - even with complete control over their environment -to clean up those radioactive messes once they are made on a large scale." http:www-ianwhitney dot comnonukes The US government supports Israel making nucs but not Iran nor North Korea (http: thinkprogress.org 2010...). Apparently it'd be cheaper just buying them from China than cleaning after our own testing!
