It is understandable for individuals in committed relationships to expect sexual exclusivity from their partners. This expectation is not inherently controlling nor unhealthy, as it is a mutual agreement made between two consenting parties. Instead, it is an important aspect of establishing trust and security in a relationship. In fact, studies have shown that sexually monogamous relationships have lower levels of relationship dissatisfaction and higher levels of overall relationship quality. Ultimately, it is up to each individual and couple to determine their own values and boundaries regarding sexual fidelity in their relationship.
