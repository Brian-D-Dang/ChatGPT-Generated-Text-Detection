GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a need to be completely self-sufficient yet. 2. I understand the benefits of working together and relying on others when appropriate. That being said, the general rule of being self-sufficient is to take responsibility for your own needs and not rely on others for everything. This can include financial independence, being able to cook and clean, managing your own health care, and having a plan for dealing with emergencies. Learning how to be self-sufficient can give you a sense of control over your life and help you feel more confident and prepared for whatever challenges may come your way. However, it's also important to remember that no one can be completely self-sufficient and it's okay to ask for help and support when needed.
