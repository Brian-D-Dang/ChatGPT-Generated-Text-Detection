There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man exposing himself to women? What if he were doing that while driving or working out at the gym?). Yes! If you can't walk down the street without flashing people then I don't know what else they would expect. Then again this guy was on tv so i doubt many people saw any skin but still- if someone went down my street like that well let me say i wouldn't appreciate it much...
