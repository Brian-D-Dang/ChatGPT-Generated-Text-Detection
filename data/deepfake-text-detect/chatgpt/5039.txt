I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately dismissed her as a liar. It seemed like they were saying things like "she's just trying to say she has no idea who she is" or something along those lines but aren't even bothered by the fact that she basically told them what she sees herself doing for herself? Now everyone lies about anything except for her being gay! What are the odds?!?!?!?!?!
