So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to get consent from a biological male without causing harm, but how much of that could potentially cause harm would be naked passion control and coercion on both sides or whatever else we're talking about here? I don't know what I've heard other than that proponents argue for rape based on the idea that there's no such thing as consensual sex between people who have abortions (which might keep them alive). More generally they say that abortion should not be illegal in modern times when there aren't even laws protecting women struggling with their sexuality anymore so why can't human beings just fuck each others lips instead?
