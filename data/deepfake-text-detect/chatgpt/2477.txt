EDIT: a portion of replies I'm getting are focused on the defination of'libertarian' and the rainbow of american groups that claim it for their particular beliefs. If in doubt, replace'libertarian' with 'progressive'. I don't think you can just get rid of any sensecategories entirely...the point is to define what "Progress" (or whatever) means within your society as an organizing principle....someone will always be left out. All this does though is let people shut down debate by calling others uneducated or bigots simply because they disagree.....
