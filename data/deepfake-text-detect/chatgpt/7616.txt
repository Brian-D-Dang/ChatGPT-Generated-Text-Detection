Counter-argument: While there may be differences in opinions within liberalism, it is not accurate to say that it is undergoing a schism and splitting into two factions. The core values of liberalism, such as individual freedom, equality, and democracy, remain unchanged. There are differing views within liberalism about how to achieve these values and how they should be prioritized, but this is a common feature of any political movement. What is important is that these discussions and debates are part of a healthy democratic process, which allows for a variety of voices to be heard and for refinement and improvement of ideas. Overall, it is important to recognize the diversity and complexity within liberalism rather than oversimplifying it as a schism between two factions.
