First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are lost every day to the destruction of wild animals by hunting them for food or their hidesfur etc... What's worse than losing a perfectly good animal? Taking one away from nature so it can be raised in captivity forever! That means taking something out (or killing) an otherwise healthy individual just because some idiot wants its hide as decoration on his wall at home instead if using "natural" materials found nearby?! To me this makes no sense whatsoever - these people have absolutely nothing better going our about life then how many trophies did you get today?? For example: Lets say someone hunted down 10 lions last week.........and he got 9 kills......how special does THAT make him??? Especially since HE killed those innocent creatures with HIS OWN HANDS!! Does anyone really care what kind person has more trophys hanging up around there house???? NO!!!! But lets face facts here......50 percenters will go after anything humanely possible during hunts!!! As longas all rules laws regulations were followed before hand including permits ect. (hunting party included) these idiots feel justified enough nowt take such hard-earned wildlife material over any other humans possessions simply becuase THEY decided which ones looked best where!!!!!!!!! We don't need anymore examples but thats exactly why our country treasures appear daily being destroyed due too ignorance within ourselves.It takes real courage not only physically into doing harm against another living creature,but also having compassion develop your own self first (you know who i'm talking aboout). Yep most hunters do work very arduously throughout thier lives yet never raise children themselves........so again when asked whats wrong wth raising domestic livestock? Well................they didn'T grow insightfully right alongside us LOL Bye bye zoo baby 1??
