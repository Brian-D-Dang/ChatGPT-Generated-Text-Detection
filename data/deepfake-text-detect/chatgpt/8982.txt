Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, or requiring, this price hike. The idea is to reduce the amount of money people pay into their credit cards if they get sick due to a health condition that prevents them from working. Becoming more expensive doesn't mean higher wages for workers. It means cheaper labor cost. We've already seen this in many other countries as well: 15hr or less has been raised to 16 an hour by governments because some employers want to lower wages.
