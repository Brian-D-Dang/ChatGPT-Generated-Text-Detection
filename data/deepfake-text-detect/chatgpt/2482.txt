Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news x] , [x] after delivering a speech in which she said that "for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of black men being killed by police is not so much an incident as it is proof to them ... that something horrible and unjust must be happening." This statement was made during her visit at Howard University on April 4th. Hilary's statements are quite interesting considering what I heard her say about Trayvon Martin back when he got assassinated: "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago"; however now she seems like someone who only cares for herself. She states how all these African American lives matter but where were you when those young boys died? Why did they die? Because there are some killers (police officers) out here who don't care if anyone gets hurt or dies! Do we really need this type of person leading our country?! We do NOT want another president George Bush...!!!
