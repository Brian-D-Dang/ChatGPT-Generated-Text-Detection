I mean all jobs, such as police officers, military personnel, CIA operatives, security clearance applications, teachers, lawyers, and doctors. Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if you have ever used drugs or alcohol, but most just require a vague answer that allows them to still hire you with no questions asked even though there is virtually zero chance for you to pass their drug test. My friend works in an advertising agency. No doubt they'll run some kind of background check, but he's not concerned about it (he has none). I don't know whether other high-profile jobs do this sort of thing...
