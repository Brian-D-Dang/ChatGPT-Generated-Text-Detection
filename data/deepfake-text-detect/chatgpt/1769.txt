When the german leaders were put on trial after WWII, They claimed they were just following orders but it was decided that this was not good enough. Hitler could have been charged with war crimes as well because he did in fact order people to kill Jews and others using gas chambers at Auschwitz. So I guess you're saying a "good guy" can get away with an atrocity if their leader says so? Do we need laws for genocide or something?
