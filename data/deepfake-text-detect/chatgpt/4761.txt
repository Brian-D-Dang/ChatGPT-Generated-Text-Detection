My post is inspired by [this article] in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell "shares" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their education, so that they can pay back the loans. The idea has been around for awhile. It was proposed in 1973 as an alternative to student loan forgiveness following graduation and it's being resurrected now because of concerns about rising federal debt (and related tax hikes). As far as I know, this proposal hasn't gone anywhere yet - but given how much attention the current proposals have gotten recently, maybe we're close? If you're interested in helping make sure this gets turned into something real one day... there are some things you should consider: 1) What if someone sells his or her shares before age 25, when heshe wasn't able to repay them? Would they get any money at all from selling off those shares earlier than expected? Are other people going to buy these shares on speculation? How will prices react to new buyers entering the market and buying more shares just because they think demand exists? When interest rates rise, what happens? Do higher fees affect profitability? Will private equity firms be willing to invest in shares purchased under terms like this? Who would issue certificates representing such shares? To whom would the shares belong? If the government owns them, wouldn't shareholders vote against raising taxes simply because doing so might increase indebtedness even further? If the government doesn't own them, who does? Where do users go once they've sold their share to somebody else? Is there anything stopping them from reselling those shares later? A good example is eBay - no matter where your item comes from, sellers aren't allowed to re-list their items after sale until 90 days later. Why shouldn't college graduates be forced to wait the same amount of time before they can start profiting from the work they did at school? This could lead to ethical problems. For instance, if the state owned shares and distributed profits based on need rather than ownership, wouldn't the owners of low income families profit less or not at all due to sharing out funds according to need? And suppose that law enforcement agencies were granted special treatment and awarded shares instead; who takes care of divorcing spouses or victims of violent crime who may end up owning shares through a divorce settlement? The possibilities seem endless! 2) Let's imagine a scenario where every single person graduating with a degree enrolls with 100K worth of newly issued shares and records a big gain over 4 years. Instead of paying off the loans, everybody immediately starts taking dividends. Of course, nobody knows exactly how many shares each graduate will receive, nor do most realize what kind of returns to expect. But since everyone gains money while others lose, the price falls dramatically to reflect expectations for lower distribution without actually receiving any mutual benefits from the arrangement. Once trading begins, though, anyone hoping to recoup lost investments quickly realizes that the real value isn't reflected in the price, but only in its projected change. You see, companies must lend out more resources (labor equipment raw materials) to keep production running smoothly, meaning fewer goods available overall. As a result, stockholders are borrowing lots of money and putting themselves deeply underwater, unable to generate financial growth or subsequent growth in wages owed to workers. Sooner or later, consumer confidence evaporates, leading to cascading failures across markets. In response to concerns regarding bankruptcies, banks stop lending. As a result, unemployment skyrockets, businesses shut down and consumers find themselves drowning financially. Not surprisingly, the price of stocks plunges worldwide as fears spread faster than facts and governments begin enacting measures designed to prevent economic collapse, including free credit, bailouts and stimulus packages. Many countries impose capital controls once stock prices sink below certain levels to ensure depositors don't drain liquidity needed to fund operations and loans to exporters suddenly dry up. Too late, economists point out that high unemployment means ample labor supply to absorb excess capacity, but little consumer spending power left for exports. Without exports, foreign trade dries up and economies stagnate for lack of competitive products. Unfortunately, too few people realized the problem ahead of time and did enough research beforehand to prepare for currency devaluation and wage cuts necessary to balance budgets. Consequently, world leaders choose to let inflation run rampant in order to protect citizens' savings and avoid having to explain massive budget deficits, resulting in double digit inflation. Faced with sharp increases in housing costs, much of the middle class finds itself priced out of homeownership. The natural outcome of greater wealth inequality leads to increased political strife, resulting ultimately in civil wars and mass migration to places considered safer. By contrast, emerging nations with stable growth enjoy increasing prosperity as international consumption and investment drives development along with greater employment opportunities and incomes for local residents. Over time, millions migrate abroad seeking better jobs or escaping corruption. Still, population density remains relatively constant causing all of humanity to settle together as cities become overcrowded and air pollution rises exponentially. With consumer demand driving resource use higher, energy revenues continue growing large margins and our fingers unimportantly small business industry analysts agree.
