Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. Why would anyone want to go to space to make a space station? If you're gonna make a space station, why wouldn't you just build it here on earth, in orbit around the earth, and you could do anything you wanted to. And if you wanted to go somewhere else, you just leave, and come back when you're done. And if you wanted to go somewhere else, you just leave, and come back when you're done. And if you wanted to do something on another planet, you just go there and do that thing, and then come back. And then what would be the point of going to space to build a space station, when you could build one here on earth? And then what would be the point of going to space to build a space station, when you could build one here on earth? And if you wanted to do something on another planet, you just go there and do that thing, and then come back. You don't need a space station, and you certainly don't need space debris, because you could just send rockets to do anything. All those rockets flying around space would never have to worry about colliding with anything, because you could just send another rocket to take care of them. And you could build a space station anywhere you wanted, because you could send a rocket to go there. And if you wanted to go somewhere else, you could just send a rocket to go there. And if you wanted to do something on another planet, you just send a rocket to do that thing, and come back.
