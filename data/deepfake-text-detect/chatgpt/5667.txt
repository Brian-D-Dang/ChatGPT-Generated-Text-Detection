Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news x] , [x] after delivering a speech in which she said that "for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear" (Clinton, 2015). The reaction to this speech was varied, with some saying that it was a courageous move to talk about the issues of race and racism in America today, while others have called it tone-deaf and inappropriate (Frum, 2015). The problem with this speech is that it avoids the issue of race completely, instead choosing to talk about policing and crime. This is not a sufficient approach to discussing racism in America, since, to quote Hilary Clinton herself, "It is absolutely clear that there is a deep-seated problem in the culture of policing in this country...that has to be fixed." (Clinton, 2015). The fact is, for a very large percentage of African-Americans, police officers are not viewed as protectors and helpers, but as oppressors and abusers (Kozol, 2015). For African-Americans, this is not a simple matter of having bad cops; it is a matter of how police officers are trained and the way they treat people of color. This is a very serious problem, and it should not be ignored. In order to make America a better, safer place, people need to start talking about the fact that there are serious problems when it comes to race in America. This includes talking about the police, but it should also include talking about the way racism has been and continues to be institutionalized in the country, including the way that school districts are segregated and the way that the economy continues to reinforce racism.
