As long as I've been alive, I've always poured milk before cereal. I've done this because I am a textural eater and I hate soggy cereal. I believe that pouring milk before cereal is an American thing because it's an unpopular opinion where I'm from (Canada). I can't tell if you're genuinely interested in Canadian terminology or just trying to be amusing but there are other countries besides America where people drink cereal with milk.
