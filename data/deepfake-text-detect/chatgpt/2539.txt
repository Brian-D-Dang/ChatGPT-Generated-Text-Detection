I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand this is an extremely unpopular opinion on Reddit but honestly it's how I want to live my life right now. Edit: I am aware that there are ways of working around this so I have no reason for making excuses or anything at all, just saying what I am right now What's your major? Just curious about the "never" part... I know some majors can succeed without studying much (you still need to learn though).
