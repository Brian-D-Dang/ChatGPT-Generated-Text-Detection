As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is irresponsible." On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that the constitution does not guarantee equal rights for women in the United States because of their age and reproductive status. The court also overruled a federal appeals court's ruling that said the constitutional right to be used as an excuse to force abortions was unconstitutional under Article I, Section 6 (a) of the U.S. Constitution. But Roe v Wade overturned the law in 1973 when the justices struck down a ban at birth limiting abortion access. The government appealed that decision to a lower court, which affirmed the decision by two-thirds of the country.
