To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For H.G.I.G. I'm just saying that the debate is a bit heated. If I'm not right I'm in support. If I'm wrong I'm in favor.
