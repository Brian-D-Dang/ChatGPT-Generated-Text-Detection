Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I don't know if the term "color" has a formal definition in this context, but it is usually understood as referring to all kinds of visible wavelengths from near-infrared through ultraviolet. For example: The reason why we call color what we do might be considered an artifact of our culture (and also why perhaps most people think human vision works differently than yours). But there's no particular rule against talking about colours other than red, blue, green and yellow - after all they're still macroscopic properties of objects, just with different physical characteristics.
