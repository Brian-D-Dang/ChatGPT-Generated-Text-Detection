First thing, let's assume the biblical Jesus is completely true. Now, I have a fair knowledge of the biblical tale, but if I say something wrong, feel welcome to correct me (I am an atheist and know little about religion). The amount that one needs to believe in their god based on this story requires believing: 1) That there was no death before Adam 2) There were two people who existed at once 3) One person spoke with God 4) The other had "the mind" 5) This all happened within 6 days while using simple tools such as rocks! A person cannot even construct a bookcase out of 6 stones without modern methods; so how could Moses do it? Obviously he didn't - therefore we can conclude he did not exist or his stories are fictitious...
