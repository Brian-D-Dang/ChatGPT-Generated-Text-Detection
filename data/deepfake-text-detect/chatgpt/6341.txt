Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than America as a whole. Nationalism is also a form of secularism. It is a fundamentally unconstitutional ideology. I have advocated universal human values rather than the message of nationalism. But the ability to apply universal principles to our daily lives is so highly valued and valued that one can not even question how our freedom of speech and freedom of religion can be exercised in the world, or that that freedom should be exercised in our own society. As such, we can't make a difference at all.
