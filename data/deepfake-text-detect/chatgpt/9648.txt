I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the sue McDonald's for medical expenses - claiming a McDonald's owned by McDonald's for a cup of coffee and then the lady who spilled coffee on herself, and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and who bought herself a coffee for her injuries and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses.
