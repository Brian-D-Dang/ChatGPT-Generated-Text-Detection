As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not the most efficient choice for taxpayers, although there are some who feel it should be illegal. I agree with you wholeheartedly. There has been an article in this paper (the Expositor) about one girl's life-threatening condition and what she will need at various stages throughout her recovery process as well as after it ends; it is horrendously expensive. I don't understand why people disagree so strongly against spending money on these kids? It blows my mind! These children deserve every penny spent on them. No matter if they were injured, or had their home destroyed by fire, no matter the situation - all families deserve help when needed. The fact that children can suffer from such devastating events that make them unable to function physically or mentally puts us to shame as a society...and yet we fail to take care of our own. Simply put: If there was an option where a family could opt out of receiving assistance because they didn't want to burden the system then maybe things would change but until then, I am completely behind helping these little ones during hard times.
