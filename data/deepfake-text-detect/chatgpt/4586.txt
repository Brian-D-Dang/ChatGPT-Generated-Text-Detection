We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been "thin shamed" or "skinny shamed" by another woman. I don't see how that is possible in American society, where we are free to be whatever size and shape we want, but you might not know this about the French if you only read what's on your Twitter feed: I wouldn't call it a trend yet, but there seems to be an increasing concern over so-called "unhealthy eating habits" among young people. This fear may stem from several sources (probably all of them), such as media coverage of various celebrities making poor nutrition choices, reports about obesity rates in France going up (which should come as no surprise), increased concern for good health, etc... Regardless of its source, these concerns seem justified with the latest attention being placed upon childhood overweight issues within our culture; problems which generally aren't addressed appropriately until adulthood anyway - when things like bad relationships can complicate matters even further. In my view, however, concerns about children and their overall physical well being need to take precedence since research has shown that kids who engage in healthy behaviors at home tend to adopt more positive lifestyle practices than other students do. As parents, teachers, coaches, friends, etc., though, we also need to acknowledge that these discussions will likely continue amongst us adults whether we realize it or not. However, while most of the time we set rules of acceptable behavior, others will continue to find new ways around those boundaries that could still prove harmful both physically and emotionally, especially since many of today's teens possess little self control due to lack of experience... When discussing exercise with some of my coaching clients lately, one particular issue came up involving the ancient practice known as barefoot running. Unfortunately, barefoot running has become trendy again via YouTube videos such as this one below, which displays why much of my clients think it's great advice: Moreover, when suggested, they often say something along the lines of: If a runner doesn't use proper footwear during hisher run then heshe must simply accept the risk of injury. To me, though, that is false logic since running without any form of protection can lead to injuries including shin splints, stress fractures, ligament damage, torn meniscus, ruptured cartilage, broken bones, and other related ailments. Although the above video claims there is nothing wrong with running barefooted unless you get blisters, plantar fasciitis, etc.,..., the reality is that running without shoes puts one at higher risks of developing certain foot conditions. Besides, too much emphasis shouldn't be put upon wearing protective gear until the body develops enough strength to achieve sufficient levels of injury resistance. Yes, running without shoes does require greater focus upon technique and balance but you'd probably agree that it would be safer to ignore that fact altogether instead? Of course, doing so isn't advisable long term either since ignoring basic training principles can teach one to develop unhealthy posture perspectives and cause muscular imbalances. That said, however, practicing barefoot running safely should never serve as justification for regular disregard of running protocols. Instead, it should merely inspire caution regarding safety guidelines before taking off into the wilderness! Let's keep in mind here that athletic trainers will tell us that runners shouldn't walk barefoot until their bodies are fully developed just look at the name of this blog post title for proof. Ask yourself now: Have you ever met someone who was injured while walking barefoot? Was it really safe? Yet, did anyone stop him or her right away afterwards? Obviously not! Like I've stated before, there's always a reason behind every accident. Always remember that. But let's move back onto this topic of barefooting versus shoe running. A few years ago, I heard about a teenage boy whose legs were badly bruised after he decided to try out a different workout routine that involved running barefoot. By chance, he happened across a large group of adult runners outside of school grounds. He approached the adults who seemed interested in talking with him, asking questions pertaining to how they trained. Then, one man noticed that his leg had started bleeding profusely, prompting the teenager to express his confusion by saying: 'You mean I'm supposed to injure myself?' The answer given by the older man wasn't favorable towards barefoot running at first, responding by stating: Sure, in theory, maybe your body won't dislike running barefooted as much as mine does. Hence, the man told him to wait a bit longer so that he may figure out whether or not he feels comfortable running barefooted, noting that he himself hadn't tried it recently since his last attempt almost two decades earlier. Afterward, the teen ran around the track once more before heading inside because he wanted to sit down and rest under the shade of a tree. This time, the man stopped, brought the boy closer beside him, and announced: You're ready!!! Finally!! And with that statement, he pointed moving toes, four non mowins', all three feet, hands, all three to meet his own[3 show venture perdrey. What will pull my Customize the bestow co-
