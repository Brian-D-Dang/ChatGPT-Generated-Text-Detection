If addiction is a disease, why do most addictions end spontaneously, without treatment? Why did some 75 of heroin-addicted Vietnam vets kick the drug when they returned home? It's hard to imagine that it was because their bodies suddenly developed an immunity or physical dependency." And then there are simple questions. For example: If doctors said AIDS could be treated by taking more drugs than were available in all clinics on Earth and sending them into Africa - what would we say about such advice if Africans ignored us? And who'd get credit for saving lives (and how)? But what kind of individual can't see these things as morally wrong unless he believes himself possessed with infallible knowledge from God Himself! Perhaps one reason religion has always been so dangerous is precisely this belief; not only does it give individuals control over others but also itself becomes like LSD and other mind-altering substances which distort perception even while supposedly making people "feel good" during use. The problem isn't religious faith per se, either at its best or worst; rather it's those who don't recognize any limits on power once granted through claims of personal revelation.
