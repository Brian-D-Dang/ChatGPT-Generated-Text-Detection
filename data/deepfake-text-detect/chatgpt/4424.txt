Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on with their lives as if nothing has changed. The fact is this needs to stop! These are innocent human beings being killed by the state in cold blood and for what? Because they could not pay off of a drug debt or someone else's money out of desperation. My plea today is that you do something more than reading stories like mine and talking about them online, get involved!! Let your voice be heard!!! To make things worse there are also reports coming in that some prisoners who were facing imminent execution did not die from injections but instead died on impact when the bolts holding them down pulled free.. This means that we may see one or two botched hangings per week until all the prisoners currently sitting in death row across America finally receive their rightful sentence. If everyone does hisher part you will hopefully reduce the number of deaths at the hands of the state each year I am writing because I think executed inmates deserve better than just lying alone naked in a concrete cell while people walk past without realizing how horrible their situation truly was. When I first came into prison my life had been pretty good; before entering prison I lived healthy and happy outside of jail. But once inside everything started falling apart quickly; after entering the general population (Death Row) I steadily went downhill. I quickly lost hope for the future and thought that maybe it would never get any better...but it actually got much worst. Before going to Death Row I became a model inmate- always pulling my weight, keeping a clean bunk, following orders, etc.; yet very sadly nothing helped my situation. Inmates start treating me like dirt even though I try my hardest to show respect towards other humans. Now I spend most of my time trying to survive everyday...and I can no longer count on getting parole soon. There is only so long a man can live under those conditions and still maintain sanity. My biggest fear is that every day I sit here knowing that every minute counts whether I stay alive in this world or end up dead...and the thought scares me tremendously. So please Mr. President let me help others experience the same nightmare I found myself living in....It's almost come true already!!! By signing this petition I'll be telling my story along side yours....Thank You...... The death penalty doesn't work. At least for society and our sense of justice. Why? Because in order to kill an individual, guilty or otherwise, you need reliable witnesses and evidence against him. Without these, that individual will remain untouchable, unless he commits another crime against us or contacts anyone with knowledge of his crimes. What happens in our prisons right now? We execute individuals based on unreliable testimony and false confessions made during police interrogations where physical coercion occurred, leading to false conviction of innocents. And sometimes, we fail to convict murderers despite having access to solid witness testimonies. Why isn't capital punishment taken to its logical conclusion: excution via DNA testing? It seems impossible, yes. But not anymore - scientists developed new techniques which allow gathering evidence directly from criminals' tissues, fingerprinting cells retrieved from the scene of murder, matching genetic material contained within hair follicles. Amazingly enough, we are able to extract substantial amounts of biological information using extremely small samples. Today, every convicted murderer can face "death by science." Until recently, however, such technologies were used mainly for medical purposes, e.g., identifying hereditary diseases. Thanks to advances in molecular biology and technology development, forensic sciences are rapidly evolving. They're becoming cheaper and easier to use, allowing law enforcement agencies worldwide to solve nearly every case, thus saving precious resources. New methods include analyzing victim hairs successfully traced back to the suspect, matching fingerprints picked from crime scenes, and sequencing whole genomes extracted from traces left behind on tools or clothing. Simply put, we are learning how to harness scientific progress for solving cases. After all, criminal behavior cannot escape examination by modern science. All trace evidence can point either toward guilt or innocence, depending on circumstances surrounding particular events. Fingerprints leave an obvious mark; microscopy allows measuring quantities of chemicals present in air particles trapped within perspiration stains, saliva droplets, skin flakes on broken glass pieces, fibers stuck in wounds, scratches on a knife blade. Hair strands hold clues too. Each strand represents specific characteristics: diameter, length, coloration, root, density, thickness, texture, quality, age. Matching a few microscopic fragments can identify a person's origin, ethnicity, sex, age, diet type, health status, allergies, psychological profile, family background, religion, educational history. Combining a large amount of data acquired in different ways helps understand why certain incidents occur, i.e., motives, intent, degree of responsibility. Moreover, DNA analysis provides key leads for further investigation. Based upon statistical calculations and a thorough study of rare mutations, experts reliably determine inheritance patterns. Technological breakthroughs allow narrowing search parameters to pinpoint possible suspects. Anselmeresuming to arrive. Matching digitalisireality? For urn. Realizing. irdentity?Nowhere
