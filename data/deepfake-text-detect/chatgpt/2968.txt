Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make a "I paid 100k for my engineering degree" joke but hear me out: What's going to happen? Will we see huge increases in student loans like they've had here recently? Or will it just be free collegestudent loan forgiveness programs like what is happening with FAFSA or even general tax breaks (which would also help)? Will we see huge increases in student loans Yes. The Government has been pushing banks into loaning more money since 2008, when government guaranteed low interest rates on those loans ended after the financial crisis. Banks are lending at way higher than normal interest rates these days, so schools can charge much higher prices without losing too many students.
