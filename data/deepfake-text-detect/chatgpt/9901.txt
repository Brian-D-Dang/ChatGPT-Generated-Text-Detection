For whatever reason men commit about 80-90 of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where men and women are equally likely to commit them; however, when it comes to violent crimes, men still have a disproportionate rate of participation. This is true across countries, cultures, and time periods. The reasons why men commit more crimes than women vary depending on the particular society in question, but some potential explanations include biological differences between the sexes, socialization, and gender roles and expectations. For example, boys may be socialized to be more aggressive and accept violence as an acceptable way to solve conflicts, while girls may be socialized to reject violence and instead focus on peaceful resolution. Additionally, gender roles and expectations can lead to different outcomes for men and women. Men may feel pressure to conform to masculine ideals, such as strength and dominance, which could lead to higher rates of criminal activity. Ultimately, the answer to why men commit more crimes than women is complex and cannot be boiled down to a single explanation. Different theories suggest that various factors, such as biology, socialization, and gender roles, contribute to this phenomenon.
