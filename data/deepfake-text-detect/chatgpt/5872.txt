First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised. Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, and to be honest, I cannot remember the pain of my circumcision. It is an amazing way to be. I also believe that if you have a penis, you should consider circumcision for yourself. I am not trying to push this on anyone, nor am I trying to convince anyone else to get circumcised. I am simply stating my opinion. I encourage anyone to do their own research, and make their own decision. However, I am glad that my parents made the decision to circumcise me. Secondly, I believe that every man should have the right to choose to be circumcised. I think this is important because it is their body, and they should have the right to make that choice. I am going to use these two paragraphs to talk about the pros and cons of circumcision. I will talk about the pros first, and the cons second. The pros of circumcision are listed below: Health Benefits of Circumcision: 1. Reduced risk of HIV, AIDS, and other STDs - Although the risk of HIV, AIDS, and other STDs are very small, they are still there.

Reduced risk of penile cancer - Circumcision reduces the risk of developing penile cancer by a whopping 20! 3. Reduced risk of HPV infection - HPV infections are extremely common. 4. Reduced risk of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) - UTIs are extremely common. 5. Reduced risk of smegma - Smegma is a smelly substance produced by the foreskin. It is not a health risk, but it can be annoying. 6. Reduced risk of Phimosis - Phimosis is when the opening of the foreskin is too small to allow for a normal erection. 7. Reduced risk of Paraphimosis - Paraphimosis is when the foreskin retracts behind the glans, cutting off blood flow to the glans. 8. Reduced risk of Balanitis - Balanitis is a redness of the glans due to a fungal infection. 9. Reduced risk of balanitis circumscripta plastica - Balanitis circumscripta plastica is the most severe form of balanitis. 10.

Reduced risk of urethral stricture - Urethral stricture is a condition where the urethra gets narrower due to scar tissue. 18. Reduced risk of meatal stenosis - Meatal stenosis is where the opening of the urethra becomes too small to allow for a normal flow of urine. 19.
