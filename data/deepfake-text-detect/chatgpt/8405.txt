While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept them. The best thing we can do right now is research more about it so as a society in general will be able make an educated decision on whether or no they should use this technology." In saying "it's probably ok" here she hasn't said anything factual (and even then if you look closely her statement has two BILLION caveats). She says "I don;' know" with respect of safety but apparently knows plenty regarding risk assessment... For someone who talks frequently against environmentalists etc., he sure doesn'nt seem very aware how science actually works... Speaking generally: Never trust people whose primary interest seems always been money rather than truth - especially when their statements have multiple missing consonants!
