First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person. My opinion is that if a woman is raped, it's rape. Whether or not she is wearing a burka or a bikini, it makes no difference. The fact is that someone has taken away her freedom. So my question is this: Why do we have to start this conversation in the first place? Why is the burka part of this story? Why is this issue not raised when the "victim" is wearing a bikini? I am not trying to be funny. I honestly don't understand why this matter has become a public debate in the first place. This is about a crime against a woman, not about her clothing. yasmeen: Because when the burka is used as a tool to restrict a woman's rights, or for the oppression of a woman, then it is part of the story. When a man rapes a woman who is wearing a bikini, it is still rape. But the bikini becomes a part of the story only when the bikini is used to restrict the woman's rights, or for the oppression of a woman. I can give you more examples if you need them. Awesome comment. I'm going to go with this one. "I can give you more examples if you need them." Can you give me a few examples of when the burka is used to restrict women's rights or oppress women? The burka is not the problem here, rape is. I hope you are not a feminist, because you do not sound like one. I'm not a feminist, but I'm not against them either. I just think feminism should be about the rights of women, not about whether or not a woman is dressed provocatively. I also don't believe in the feminist argument of "if women are dressed like this, they are asking to be raped." I think that women should be able to dress as they please and be treated with respect as long as they are not promoting bad behavior. I also think that when a woman is raped in a burka it is still rape. But the burka has to be used as a tool to oppress or restrict a woman. I'm not a feminist, but I'm not against them either. Your words are confusing. Are you against feminists? I just think feminism should be about the rights of women, not about whether or not a woman is dressed provocatively. I also don't believe in the feminist argument of "if women are dressed like this, they are asking to be raped." That is your personal belief, not a feminist belief. I'm a feminist and I have never said that. I think that women should be able to dress as they please and be treated with respect as long as they are not promoting bad behavior. And you still don't understand why the burka is part of the story. The burka is being used as a tool to restrict a woman's rights. Maybe I'm still not understanding the argument. You said that the burka is used as a tool to oppress women. But it is the rapist who oppresses the woman. If the woman is in a burka and the rapist forces her to get naked, is it still rape? In the case of the woman who was raped in a burka, the burka was used as a tool to oppress her. Because she was in a burka, she was treated differently than she should have been treated. She was a woman, and she was raped. It should have been the same story either way she was dressed. So if a woman is raped while wearing a burka and she has to go to court, because she has to testify to what happened, she should be allowed to cover her face and testify behind a screen. That is the case in many countries, including Canada, I believe. But if she's in Canada, she shouldn't need to testify in court, because they have a system of justice called "innocent until proven guilty." I don't know if the accused was in Canada. I don't think that is the point. No, the point is that there is no reason to have a debate about the burka in the first place. The burka shouldn't be part of the story. The burka doesn't make the story any more tragic. It makes it worse. The burka is not the problem here. This is
