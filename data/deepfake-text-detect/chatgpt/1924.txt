This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in our galaxy, then it may be because that belief has been injected into your brain for a variety reasons and no amount evidence will change anything." The paper was co-authored by Stephanie Luu at The University of Texas at Austin; David Nesvorny at McGill University in Montreal Canada; Christopher C. Sheppard at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) where he led the CheMin instrument's analysis effort during its flyby of Bennu on October 20th 2019, when OSIRIS-REx collected particles from surface sand grains. "We didn't have to do this," said Wendy Freedman, an APL planetary scientist who also worked with scientists at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop the XRT spectrometer - which could determine the elemental composition of these rocks. We're just glad we did!" "It wasn't until after the spacecraft arrived back home last December that their results started coming together," says Linda ElkinsTanton, Mission Principal Investigator of the mission based out of Arizona State University. "Seeing how well they matched up made me realize what fantastic work had gone into collecting all those samples - and using them as seeds for helping us understand the abundance of elements throughout the solar system."
