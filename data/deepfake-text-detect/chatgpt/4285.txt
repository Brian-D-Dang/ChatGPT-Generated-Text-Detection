I can only see socialistic systems (The harder variety that imposes 90 tax rates and such) work out in ethnically, culturally homogenous societies like the Nordic states, or certain Orthodox Christian sects. Is this not true? Not sure what you mean by ethniccultural homogeneity. The big difference is with religious groups who tend to have very narrow views on issues.
