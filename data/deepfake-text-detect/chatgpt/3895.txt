I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually not the same as those in public schools, most of them very poor and low IQ. I can't imagine that they get a better education than those in the state funded system... I have never seen any benifit Until recently, the US educational system was the best in the world, and private schools were expensive for many families (not just wealthy ones). It wasn't until recent underinvestment into public education by the increasingly conservative Republican leadership in Congress that things began to change.
