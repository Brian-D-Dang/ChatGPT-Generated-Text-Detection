I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is by far one of my favorite shows in recent years. Now, there are two views on SAO regarding it's art style and quality; some people love it for what it does do right (the setting and story) and others hate it due to its flaws (art-style). Having watched multiple animes with both styles of animation over numerous decades, I am here to say this: whether you like or not, don't let anyone tell you how to enjoy your show; if they can't see past their own personal bias when seeing something enjoyable then who needs them? On the other hand though, please keep in mind the following things about SAO so that the next generation may be able to appreciate them too... 1.) It takes place online, where such real life issues and themes will have no bearing whatsoever.2.) The characters, while all being humans, aren't really "human." They're nearly perfect in every way imaginable which means that even without virtual reality, bloodthirsty monsters would still exist.3.) You yourself are fighting against those monsters.4.) A deeper meaning behind this whole situation is left up to interpretation and simply puts into perspective our current society and future trends regarding technology and social interaction.5.) The soundtrack gives me chills every single time i hear any piece from it.6.) Don't get caught up in pointless debates because the truth is out there!7.) If someone tries telling you that the end was weak because it had nothing to do with anything else going on, think back upon your schooling days: why did we learn about Romeo Juliet, Hamlet and Macbeth? You didn't need Shakespeare to make sense of it either yet he wrote plays to cover just these kinds of topics.8.) When the series first came out, everyone said it sucked. Now look at it, now look away from it...it doesn't matter anymore anyway.9.) Kirito isn't the hero of the game but rather the character representing humanity itself. He might be the best player, yes, but nobody has ever been better than him outside of the real world.10.) Is Asuna the heroine of the show? You decide.11.) And lastly, remember this: from the very beginning, Kirito knew he wasn't supposed to win and honestly expected his friends to die regardless of what happened. That kind of selflessness defines the true hero, whatever form he may take. So after reading through most of those points above, were you convinced enough that SAO is worth checking out? Are you writing reviews making fun of the title only to find that you love everything else? Have you seen more than one person praise the series despite hating the art style? Have you realized that saying something sucks based solely off of visuals alone is ignorant and stupid (and completely irrelevant)? Do realize that opinions mean jack shit unless you're trying to incite riots? Were you prepared to read a novel sized post full of thoughts weighing pros and cons and opinionated ramblings followed by an ending that leaves you wanting more? Well then, welcome aboard to a great new show whose name shall never be forgotten! For those less familiar with the overall concept, click on spoiler below to view what happens during the final episodes...but beware of spoilers! Honestly, I won't lie to you. The title sure is misleading. There's no actual "Sword Art" involved except maybe once throughout each episode. But hey, the premise checks out since the main character actually fights using swords! Also, that's pretty much all you'll see in terms of battle scenes. In fact, almost all plot progression occurs within the VR environment. Whenever your group reaches a certain point in the storyline, another area opens up to explore - well, technically 3 different areas depending on your choice of starting position. Each one contains dungeons to clear in order to gain experience toward leveling up and the items needed to equip your party members along with gaining knowledge on the stories surrounding all the enemies encountered. Basically, you fight the bosses throughout the entire journey then collect loot to improve your weapons, armor, accessories and potions. Then repeat until happy. Once the boss battles begin though, trust me, they give Cave Story a run for its money in terms of difficulty. Be ready to die repeatedly before finally reaching victory. Yes, it gets repetitive fast especially without any sort of changeups to spice things up between levelsdungeons. Still, fans of RPGs should definitely consider giving this game a spin and there's plenty of reasons why newcomers shouldn't miss out on such a unique ride either. Just turn on subtitles and pay attention towards subtle hints given throughout the dialogue; they go a long ways in helping deciphering what exactly is going on within the narrative. This also goes for any non English speaking viewers (who usually happen to be avid gamers themselves), so listen closely and try to figure it...
