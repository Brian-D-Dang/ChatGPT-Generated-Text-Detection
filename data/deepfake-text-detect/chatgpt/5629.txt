With our constant fast technological advancement people seem to think that we will lead our selves to destruction because we do not use technology with care, but recently all new technology is of great advantage and help to man. No one would have thought that something as small as a smart phone would be able to detect cancerous cells and help save lives. If only people were more aware of the uses of these items we might be able to save a lot more lives. If someone had told me that I could have a device with which I could detect cancerous cells in my body I would have never believed them. But recently a new discovery was made in the USA and it was found that the smart phone that is so useful can detect cancerous cells. With a simple application you could save yourself from being diagnosed with cancer. The researchers at the University of Washington have found a new application that can help detect cancerous cells. With this application, a smart phone can be used to detect the cellular phone. In the application a photo is taken of the person's skin, which the application processes and through an algorithm it determines whether there are any cancerous cells in the skin. The application uses a technique called fluorescence spectroscopy, which detects cancer cells when they have an abnormal structure of proteins. The cancerous cells emit a certain light spectrum, which the application detects and then gives a reading as to whether they are cancerous or not. The application is not yet in use, but researchers are hoping to have it available for public use as soon as possible. 1. The user takes a picture of their skin using a smart phone. 2. The application processes the picture and detects any irregularities. 3. The user can then go to a doctor and get an official diagnosis. The application is extremely useful and could help save many lives, if it was developed into an official application. The application is extremely useful and could help save many lives, if it was developed into an official application. It is simple to use and it does not require medical expertise to determine whether the cancerous cells are present or not. The application is still in development and the team of researchers is trying to get the application ready to use. They are trying to get the application ready so that they can begin testing it in hospitals.

They are trying to get the application ready so that they can begin testing it in hospitals. At the moment the application is only being tested on cancer cells that are in the lab. The application has the potential to save many lives and to help those who are diagnosed with cancer live longer and healthier lives. It is amazing how much technology has evolved in the past 20 years and to think that something so small and common as a smart phone can detect cancerous cells, is amazing.
