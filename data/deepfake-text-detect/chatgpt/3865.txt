I think that all humans deserve the same amount of respect, all else being equal. In other words, if I don't know you at all, my respect for you won't change because we haven't met up yet. But if I've been introduced to you by a friend, that would be different. It's one thing to not have a lot in common with someone but it's another where they're not very nice about introducing me and treating me like crap when I do meet them. If I don't know you at all, my respect for you won't change because we haven't met up yet. No your respect will decrease based on how you treat people on reddit!
