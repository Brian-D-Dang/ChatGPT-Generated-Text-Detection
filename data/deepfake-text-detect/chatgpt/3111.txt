To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific need for humans to consume meat or dairy products, because it makes people happy in the short term (and I assume has some health benefits as well). So you are fine with raping someone who brags about how much they've ingested or enjoyed alcohol? It's all relative.
