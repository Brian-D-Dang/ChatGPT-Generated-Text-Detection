Hi Reddit. With all the news over the past couple weeks regarding Caitlyn Jenner's transition and coming out, I feel now is a good time to discuss gender's role in the modern world. I'm a man, and I'm on a quest to find out more about gender and how it affects my life. The idea of gender, sex, and sexuality are very interesting to me, and I'm not sure why. I don't like the term "transgender" because to me it's just a word for people who don't like their gender, not a term for a community, so I'm going to refer to transgender people as transgendered people. I want to start with a little personal background, then I'd like to get into some of the more interesting things I've found out over the years and maybe discuss them here in a constructive way. 1) I was born female. I don't like it, but I've been living my life for almost 26 years as a woman. I'm 25 now. I have long hair, like most women do. I've always worn pants and short-sleeve shirts, and I often go topless or wear a tank top. I dress modestly but try to keep up with the trends. I have breasts and hips, which are feminine, and I've never had any surgery. I have always felt that I was a man, but I've never wanted to become a man, because I feel that I'd never have any of the female qualities I love about myself. I'm not even sure how to describe the way I feel. I think of myself as a man trapped in a woman's body, but that doesn't sound right. 2) I've always been sexually attracted to women, but I've never wanted to have sex with one, because I wouldn't like to do that to a woman. 3) I've been attracted to men and sometimes had crushes on men. I'm not attracted to men as much as I am to women, but I'm more attracted to men than I am to transgendered men. This has always bothered me, because I feel that I'm a man who happens to be attracted to women, which doesn't seem fair. I'm really attracted to transgendered women. I would consider myself a lesbian if I was a woman. 4) I'm not attracted to transgendered men, because I don't like their bodies. I think that they look very feminine, and I don't think it's fair for them to have to look that way because they're born male. I don't think it's fair for me to be attracted to them because I'm born female. It's like I'm attracted to them because of their gender, even though I hate their gender. I don't want to have sex with them, either. I find it interesting, but I find myself wanting to stay away from them because of their bodies. 5) I've had sex with men before, because I wanted to experience it, and I've enjoyed it, but I wouldn't want to do it every day. I would prefer to have sex with a transgendered woman. 6) I am a feminist. I am very comfortable with my gender. I don't want to have sex with a man, even though I don't mind being attracted to men. I don't like being attracted to transgendered men, but I like being attracted to transgendered women. 7) I'm not attracted to men who have had surgery. I'm attracted to transgendered women who have had surgery, because they look like women, but I'm not attracted to women who have had surgery. I think that they look very masculine, and I don't think it's fair for them to have to look that way because they're born female. It's like I'm attracted to them because of their gender, even though I hate their gender. I don't want to have sex with them, either. I find it interesting, but I find myself wanting to stay away from them because of their bodies. 8) I have a girlfriend, but I feel like I'm more of a man than a woman, which is why I'm attracted to transgendered women. I don't think I'm going to like being a woman. I feel like I'm going to hate being a woman. I'm pretty sure that I'm going to transition to
