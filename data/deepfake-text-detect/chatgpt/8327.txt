I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually wealthier and come out later doing everything that their peers do in college, except for having tuition paid on top of all those loans they already took a loanout application with when applying into public universities or community colleges (secondary education). Thank you!
