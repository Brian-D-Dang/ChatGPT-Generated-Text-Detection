Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. "That means that marriage of men and women isn't real in the eyes of god." How do you know? Is it because God used a man (Adam) as an example instead? And before anyone asks: Yes, I am gay. This was my thought too...after reading what OP wrote, all I could think about were those stupid fundies saying that Adam Eve wasn't meant to represent any actual couple since they weren't married or anything!
