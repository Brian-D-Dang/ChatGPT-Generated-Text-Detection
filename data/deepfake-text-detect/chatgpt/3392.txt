To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. That's okay! It's important to approach complex issues with an open mind and a willingness to listen to different perspectives. It's possible that with more information and discussion, your opinion may change or become more nuanced. What's important is to engage in thoughtful and respectful dialogue with others and continue to learn and grow in your understanding.
