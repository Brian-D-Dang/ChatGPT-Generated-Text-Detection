I mean all jobs, such as police officers, military personnel, CIA operatives, security clearance applications, teachers, lawyers, and doctors. Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if you have been convicted of a crime. If you have been convicted of a crime you should answer truthfully. But why? Some people might think it's a good idea to "spin" the truth. The reason why I would suggest against this is because if you are convicted of a crime you probably did something wrong. If you did something wrong, why would you want to lie about it. Even if you are a good person, and never commit crimes, it will still look bad on your record. You will be more likely to get fired, not get hired, or even lose your job if you are convicted of a crime. What if you have been convicted of a crime? What should you do? Even though it may seem like a good idea to spin the truth or lie, it isn't. It can be a terrible idea. You can get into even more trouble if you don't tell the truth. You can even be charged with a federal crime or a crime in your state, and end up going to prison. You should never lie on a job application or any other form. You should always be honest and tell the truth. Even if you are convicted of a crime. If you are charged with a crime you should hire a criminal defense attorney. If you are convicted of a crime you should hire an attorney to assist you with your criminal defense. The attorneys at the Law Offices of Richard C.
