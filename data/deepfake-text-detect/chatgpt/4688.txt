The reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using taboo language or phrases we can really give our ideas a boost and if you don't want the phrase "I love you" being thrown at your face then simply avoid saying them. Avoid repeating expletives (or any other phrases) in social media posts, blogs etc. It reflects poorly on yourself and makes others feel uncomfortable with you. Remember not all people will understand what you mean by an insult so be careful who you use them around as well as how often you use them. For example - If someone says something like; 'You idiot!' You could reply back immediately with: 'What did you just call me?' but sooner than later it seems likely that person would have learnt from you and therefore wouldn't repeat such behaviour again. So take advantage of some time go re-read Lonesome Cowboy Blues and learn from his mistakes... And while you're there find out why he wrote the song Rhyme Or Reason. If you see a tweet or Instagram post where someone uses swearing or abusive terms, write out exactly WHY they were wrong (using examples). A lot of times people make these kind of statements without actually having a point to prove. For instance; Let's say you posted about skipping school yesterday, however now you've been caught up for doing said thing you claim to hate. Well the first place your friends should look before going off attack you online is to spend ten minutes writing down every time you ever skipped class throughout elementary through high school and college years so they can show physical evidence against your claims. People may laugh as you explain that considering you never got into trouble until recently, but once you start presenting cases against your incorrect statement you'll soon realise its poor form to lie in order to defend themselves. It works even better if you tell them how you learned to become aware of inconsistencies between truth and falsehood. This goes hand in hand with my next tip which is to throw shade whenever possible... In addition to showing things which aren't true via twitter accounts, keep track of everything you do. Maybe you forget to lock your door one day, or maybe you leave your keys inside your car overnight. There are plenty of ways too many to list here, but compile proof of anything negative related to you or anyone else. Once everyone knows that you're guilty of certain actionsbehaviours they won't bother looking further unless it starts affecting their lives. Its important that real life consequences arise from breaking rules and laws as opposed to just knowing about them online. That way you get respect for living outside the law and also prove that social etiquette does matter to society and the world at large.
