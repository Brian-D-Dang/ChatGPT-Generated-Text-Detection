I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit card debts continue asking for money whenever the government wishes. But the government shouldn't have a responsibility at all! What exactly did this person do? Nowhere near 10k debt was already paid off... haha
