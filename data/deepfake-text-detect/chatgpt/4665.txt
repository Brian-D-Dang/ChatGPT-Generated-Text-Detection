I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any way we can offer them some sort of solution, I'm all for it." Kale and the others had tried everything they could think of on their own before calling the police, but no amount of preparation or strategy seemed capable of averting tragedy. The only thing left was to call in the cops; hopefully, they'd have an idea how to handle things once they got here. As Kaleb waited anxiously by his daughter's bedside, he wondered if she knew what her father's intention had really been with regards to finding the vampire who killed him. Would she even care? She had yet to ask about the incident at All Hallows' Eve Club - a fact that didn't sit well with him given the circumstances. But he couldn't dwell on such thoughts now as another officer arrived to take Mr. Whitehill away to prepare for transport back home while Nurse Thorne called Dr. Endressto come over immediately to check on Alice. He also understood one other vital matter: With Ms. Alberts apparently dead and without any witnesses, the case against the old man was rather bereft. Given his intended victim's status within the community, especially since he'd made off with the schoolgirl's enchanted necklace, he doubted anyone outside of town would believe a word he said regarding Whitehall's involvement. Still, he figured he'd better try anyway. It wasn't like the poor woman had anything else to do right now. Chapter Twenty-Five The next morning, Kale found himself wondering just where she might have gone to ground after being released from jail following the discovery of her body at the hotel the previous evening. Not wanting to hunt her down without more information than her name alone offered up, and further knowing nobody else officially connected to the investigation besides him had seen fit to tell him much beyond the bare facts, he decided to pay Helen Sinclair a visit personally. Though it may not accomplish much, he thought to himself, having already surmised part of the truth behind her disappearance. In addition to giving her space until someone official came along to talk to her, he guessed it was best to keep the information flowing outwards as long as possible so as many people as possible were aware of events unfolding around them. After finishing breakfast and making sure Sarah hadn't stirred during the night, Kaleb checked his phone again to see if Helen had called. To his chagrin, she hadn't returned his calls nor had she responded to any messages he sent via email or social media. After trying again half-an hour later, still nothing. So far neither of them had spoken to each other directly, although several text exchanges had taken place between various friends of theirs which confirmed personal relationships and possible future plans among their mutual acquaintances. At least, that was the theory they both shared though neither of them felt comfortable talking about it openly due to its underlying source. What little Kaleb did know about Helen's private life told him plenty of trouble obviously awaited her when she finally did return his call. Who knows, maybe even her family. Thinking of Laura practically gave him a spasm of pain which shot through his chest before subsiding quickly into numbness. Yet despite always feeling guilty whenever he brought up her name, he constantly reminded himself that not everyone deserved to live forever. Lives lost too soon were often the saddest, most unnecessary of all. And considering what happened last night...well, perhaps it fell somewhere in between. When it came to why she had done what she'd done, however, he still refused to ascribe motive unless absolutely necessary. That was something he hoped never to learn firsthand either, although no doubt he could expect to hear rumors galore. Regardless, he supposed trying to resolve those issues wouldn't change much of anything; she'd probably run off with somebody else eventually anyways. That news didn't set very well with him, but then he hardly expected it to lessen his grief over losing her. Knowing a lot less about human nature than he believed, he assumed Helen must've met a guy willing to stick around for eternity and loved him enough to bear the burden of what she'd known fate held in store. Either way, the real issue remained intact, whether she'd lived happily ever after or died tragically young. Something bothered him enough about her story to make him wonder if she'd become disillusioned by waiting for death to overcome herself instead of fighting for a different outcome. Even if she had become incapable of continuing on living under these conditions, he wanted more than anything to simply put the past behind her and let her find peace wherever she went. Although he felt certain he'd never get closure over her demise, it suddenly became important to know whether it truly meant the end of his relationship with her. Feeling deeply torn inside, he considered going to find her directly and telling her he wished to remain apart from her, regardless of whether her love child would accept good behavior. This afternoon's request is quite possibly his intent, which he decides what, which presumably does the judge thinks "
