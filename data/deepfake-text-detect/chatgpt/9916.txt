I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. The national debt is growing at an alarming rate and I worry that it will affect my future. If the debt continues to rise, there may be less money available for other programs and services, such as Social Security and Medicare. This could lead to a decrease in quality of life for many Americans. Additionally, if interest rates continue to climb, it could become harder to pay back loans, leading to even more debt. The situation is concerning and needs to be addressed before it's too late.
