Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one partner is wanting sex a lot and the other is not? I've read a lot of the posts on this site and in the media about how it's supposedly "normal" for a man to want sex 5-7 times a week and it's not normal for a woman to want sex once a month. I find that this is a load of bullshit. I've never met a woman who isn't interested in sex 5-7 times a week, but that doesn't mean that they want it all the time. Or that they want it at all times, with any partner. So what happens when one partner wants sex more than the other? Women don't want sex at all if they aren't in the mood? Men are dirty creatures who just want to have sex with anything that moves? I find that this is the most common scenario I've encountered. The partner who wants sex more than the other doesn't want to come off as a "slut" or "demanding," so they agree to sex, and then feel miserable about it afterwards. I believe that this is completely unfair. If you don't want sex, it's fine. If you want sex, it's fine. But sex is a two-way street. Just because one person wants it doesn't mean that the other person wants it or is obliged to have it. Both partners should be able to say no to sex without feeling guilty about it, and should be able to ask for sex without being afraid that they are being "demanding." I'm not suggesting that the "only want it once a month" women should just have sex more. I'm suggesting that both partners should be able to communicate about their desires and enjoy themselves more. That's all. Just my opinion. This entry was posted in feminism, Uncategorized and tagged communication, gender, love, marriage, relationships, sex, sex drive by feministcupcake.

We have 3 children and are sexually active, however we have NEVER had sex less than once a month. We have a great sex life, and we both enjoy it. I think if people would just communicate instead of hiding how they feel about sex, or not communicating at all, then we wouldn't have so many problems. feministcupcake on August 20, 2012 at 12:35 pm said: Yes! I'm so glad you agree! just a girl on August 21, 2012 at 1:50 am said: I agree. I think women just have less time than men to want sex. I'm talking about my own case: 1) I'm really busy with my job and 2) I'm not really into sex. I mean, I do like it, and it can be very fun, but I don't think it's something really important in my life. I think the "a month" is something exaggerated too. My boyfriend is not really that much into sex, but I think I'm the more important part of the relationship. I don't feel like a slut because I have sex once a month with my boyfriend. I think women can be just as horny as men, they just find ways to use their sexual energy in different ways. I agree! I'm really busy with my job and I'm not really into sex.
