I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to synthesize these elements. "The one remaining element is ununetrium." It's actually very easy if you know what you're doing: Find the electron orbitals of your desired atom Find the proton orbital (s) with respect to those orbits Pick a free deuterium orbit, with minimal overlap between the 2D and 3D orbitals (or use a deuteron instead), which will give you [delta-U] (URL2). You can then pick out an appropriate deuterium ionization energy so you have a U isotope Repeat step 1 for each and every other element until there are none left!
