So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor sexuality or something? I don't think it's healthy to pretend that a large amount of people in the world are immune from hate because they're "not like other races." It doesn't matter how much melanin you have, if you're gay or look different than most everyone else around here (which is pretty common) then you can still get shit on for being who you are. Sure there might be more acceptance where you live but insults come with just living out loud sometimes. And by putting forth an argument like "it shouldn't exist because we all bleed red," you're furthering the stigma against those groups instead of helping them.
