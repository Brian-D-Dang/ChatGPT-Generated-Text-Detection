This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced by saying the above statement isn't meant in a serious sense: it seriously says what you just read! Tolkien was obsessed with sex because he wanted to create the most sexually charged novel possible - his idea for Middle-earth seemed like a paradise of pure sexual energy where men were ravished from all sides! He even wrote several allegorical novels about sexuality such as The Waters of Elves (where two elves are captured by trolls and raped) or Elrond (a tale of love between two dwarves). We must not forget Tolkien also had absolutely no interest in religion at all; he simply despised Christianity due to its overbearing influence on society back then. However, he wasn't exactly opposed to sex either - one can only speculate how much more intense his own sexual imagination would have been today if the sexual revolution hadn't happened...
