While it is tempting to believe that healthcare and education should be free in an ideal society, this viewpoint fails to recognize the costs associated with providing these services. In reality, someone has to pay for the resources, facilities, equipment, and personnel required to provide healthcare and education. Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect these essential services to be entirely free. Rather, it is important to ensure that healthcare and education are accessible and affordable for all members of society while also balancing the need to fund and sustain their operations. Additionally, if these services were entirely free, there would be a lack of incentive for providers to improve the quality of their services, which could ultimately result in a decline in the overall quality of healthcare and education.
