It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. Because there have been numerous studies which has shown that the very fact that we allow these vehicles onto our highways causes traffic congestion, while producing no benefits to society at large other than our own pockets, not only on this side of the border but down here too - Canada. Hopefully the Alberta government will wake up to it's responsibilities and stop being so cheap by allowing these companies into our province before they can completely ruin our economy with the cost savings they'll be getting from using everyone as their own personal slaves.
