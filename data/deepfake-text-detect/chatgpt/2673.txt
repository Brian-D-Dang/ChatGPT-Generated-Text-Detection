Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable given that Humans are a very stable race (i.e., they don't undergo metamorphosis or mutation) but it does make you wonder how much effort goes into diversity training for every human to become aware of their place among other species in society while also understanding their status as the most important species on Earth. As with many things in Trek, this is perhaps justified by the fact that any competent person can be trained into being good at whatever job needs doing; unlike real life where some people will just naturally excel in certain fields. The same could probably apply here since many of those "high" positions require relatively low levels of education (think about teachers). Of course I would expect them to have higher qualifications than say Data or Troi, who were raised with unique backgrounds compared to typical humans. The overall quality of the writing makes me think that Gene Roddenberry had more time available during TNG than he did later on. He planned all seven seasons of TNG when DS9 was still finding its feet. As such, he had more time to give proper attention to character development for each individual crew member.
