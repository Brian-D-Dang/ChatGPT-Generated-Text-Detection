People who have no interest in politics, and are not interested in learning about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it its just going to make them look bad. There is a growing consensus amongst some politicians on what is wrong with this country: it's decided to change its laws on immigration by taking away the right of every single person of any age to immigrate. In fact, at least two-thirds (74) of people who say they support such changes said so in December 2018. A poll by Farage's The Daily Telegraph also found 70 of those surveyed thought that Canada would have to create a permanent ban on people from certain countries entering the United States if it was voted into law, with significantly more than half saying the same in May 2019. This will either delay the date or give the Conservatives much more time to file their own bill against it as the party has already passed legislation supporting the immigrants' rights. But while there may still be some uncertainty over this controversial move, many believe that it will stop free movement around the world for all.
