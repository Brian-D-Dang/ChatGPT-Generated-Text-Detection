First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways were in the works for years before we saw them in the real world and as that was happening it became very clear that they could never work in another medium. We should have had one franchise. There's no way anyone can be wrong about that. I wasn't suggesting that. We all agree on that, even if we disagree with each other. If you think there is a reason why Disney doesn't want to make a franchise like Marvel Studios or Marvel Studios, then let me assure you they'll go down in history as being the most successful franchises ever made in the business.
