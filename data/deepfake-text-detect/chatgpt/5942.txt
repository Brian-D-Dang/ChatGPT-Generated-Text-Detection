I am an American High School student who was taught 2 different versions of the Civil war throughout my schooling career. In elementary school we first learned about the civil war. We learned that President Lincoln was a great man who did great things, and that his actions saved the Union. After we learned that President Lincoln was a great man, we learned about how African Americans were slaves and that the South was fighting to keep slavery. I learned that President Lincoln freed the slaves and that the South was fighting to keep them as slaves. In middle school we learned about the Civil war.

Did I learn anything in college that I did not learn in elementary school? The answer to the above questions is, very little. While I did learn more information in college about the Civil War, I did not learn anything that I did not already learn in elementary school. However, I did learn something in college that I did not learn in high school. I learned that President Lincoln was a great man, however, he was also a racist. He did great things for African Americans, however, he did not do nearly as much for African Americans as I was taught. Lincoln freed the slaves, but he did not help black people get civil rights. The civil war did not free African Americans, it simply allowed them to be free and have their own lives. Lincoln did a few things to help African Americans, but most of them were not helpful. One thing Lincoln did was to establish the Freedmen's Bureau. The Freedmen's Bureau was designed to help newly freed African Americans. The Freedmen's Bureau helped many African Americans by giving them food and other supplies, as well as helping them to find work. The Freedmen's Bureau helped many African Americans, however, it was not helpful in the long run. The Freedmen's Bureau was only established for two years. When it was established, it was a huge help to African Americans. However, when it was disbanded, the Freedmen's Bureau did not do much. It did not give many African Americans food and supplies, so they could not live off the supplies. It also did not help many African Americans find work. Many African Americans were still struggling to find work and food, even after the Freedmen's Bureau was disbanded. Lincoln did not help African Americans get civil rights, in fact, he did not help any minority groups get civil rights. One thing Lincoln did to help minority groups was to appoint many African Americans to important government positions. Lincoln appointed African Americans to positions in the United States Army, and some to important government positions in the White House. Lincoln did this to give African Americans a chance to move up in society. However, Lincoln did not help them get civil rights, as minority groups still did not have civil rights. I think I learned a lot in college, however, I also think I learned very little. I think I learned a lot about the Civil War, but not as much as I did in elementary school. I think I learned a lot about the Civil War, however, I learned very little that I did not already know. I think I learned a lot about Abraham Lincoln, however, I learned very little that I did not already know.
