For whatever reason men commit about 80-90 of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where women are the perpetrators and not just the victims, but it's still an extremely small sample size on which to base such broad claims as "more than half" or "most crimes committed by humans." While there is evidence that domestic violence has decreased, this does not apply to all intimate partner relationships (IPR). Women who have been abused physically through IPRs may be at increased risk for subsequent abusive experiences from different partners Regardless of whether abuse precedes or follows cohabitation, previous research has found similar rates between spousal abusers and nonabusive males. A study published in April 2019 measures both physical criminal behavior in addition to sexual assault; this study finds higher levels among male spouses compared with other females, including one third of female officers' arrests being related to family issues. Male respondents were more likely to own weapons and use them during violent episodes against their wives.
