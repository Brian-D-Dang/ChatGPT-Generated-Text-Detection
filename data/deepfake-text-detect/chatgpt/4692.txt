There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, as if it were like getting candy from Santa Claus at Christmas time. Others say higher taxes don't encourage people to work harder because they have no money in their pockets. But what about creating domestic demand through direct spending? What happens when you give more to someone than he spends on himself (or something)? It is possible to estimate how much Americans will spend this year with respect to the total amount of income earned by American households since 1980. The Census Bureau publishes detailed data on personal consumption expenditures every month - which includes spending on food, clothing, housing, entertainment such as theater tickets, medical care, etc., plus purchases made for business purposes including commuting costs such as gasoline used while driving between home and workplace. In aggregate, these expenses are called "personal disposable income" and show up monthly in consumer price indices published by the U.S. Department of Labor. These numbers tell us how much Americans spent last month but not who spent them. Personal consumption expenditure also include borrowing so we know both where consumers save and loan out funds: 20 of our national gross production goes toward household debt service each year. This means that there is some connection among individual spending patterns, saving habits, savings account balances and bank loans. If your neighbor saves his own earnings instead of piling it all into an investment fund run by Wall Street firms and banks, then your neighbors cannot borrow enough dollars to finance other countries buying goods and services directly from America. It may be true that your neighbor would rather hold cash than purchase a new car; however, collectively, we need cars to buy everything else in society - think school books, computers, beer cans, toys, large appliances, clothes for everyone in the family, vacations and - most important for now - financial investments. When Americans use credit cards, phones or any kind of payment method besides physical currency for almost everything, we become less competitive worldwide. So we should pay attention to changes in personal consumption and lending trends. Note: the graph below shows annualized figures based upon 1 million per quarter. Therefore the units given here are quarters of real GDP per capita. Since President Obama took office, the economy has grown by 6, well under its potential rate of 8. However, during George W. Bush's presidency, four consecutive years saw real income grow faster than population over those same 4 calendar years - 2 QTRs above levels, 2 QTRs lower than levels, 3 QTRs above 2007 levels. The next chart provides information regarding economic activity during the current fiscal year versus historical norms. As shown, average annual growth rates peaked at 5.3 percent during World War II and declined steadily after 1945 until 1961, reaching zero during the recession of . Moreover, during 2001-2003, slightly above the long term trend of 0.5 percent, consumer outlays grew twice as fast as population, indicating severe contraction in private sector balance sheets. By contrast, starting roughly in 2004, the pace slowed until 2008, near normal. During 2009, the first year of President Barack Obama, the pattern reversed again - 3 straight years of unusually high growth, double the previous decade's average (2.8), although still short of the postwar norm. Thus, while recovery remains fragile, there seem to be certain stabilizing forces operating within the economy despite political pressures to pull back. Our second graphic illustrates the relative importance of various components of CPI manufacturing prices compared to overall inflation. Manufacturing contributed little to overall inflation before the late 1970s, falling below 10 of the index during part of the 1960s. Overall, however, manufactured prices accounted for nearly two thirds of inflation since 1984. Today, over 70 of overall inflation is attributable to factory products and raw materials. This might explain why many economists and pundits believe that the recent drop in interest rates could help ease the worst effects of the collapse in mortgage markets. Lowering short term interest rates merely helps bond investors earn better returns (as opposed to riskier assets like stocks) without actually causing much additional spending. After all, we already had plenty of cheap mortgages prior to the crisis. Furthermore, low yields meant increased profits for highly leveraged entities like hedge funds, as well as relatively safer alternatives to take advantage of lower rates (like prime commercial mortgages), further reducing demand. Tax cuts, of course, are another way supply side enthusiasts love to blame bad behavior on poor incentives. Yet, even though most Republicans want cut capital gains taxes, none advocate cutting corporate welfare subsidies. A good deal of stimulus packages have been geared towards paying businesses to keep existing workers employed, as opposed to hiring unemployed ones. And, as seen earlier, stock market bubbles often precede full employment and rising wages. Still others point out that Keynesian economics tends to focus too heavily on output statistics, ignoring perhaps equally compelling evidence showing increases in real effective procedures tend to conclude that recent statistical analyses indicate reason is totally defensalvenursin, with a steady state density pertaineseventual
