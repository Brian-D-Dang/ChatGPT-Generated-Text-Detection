I think that all humans deserve the same amount of respect, all else being equal. In other words, if I don't know you at all, my respect for you won't be any different than your average acquaintance. If we're friends or relatives on Facebook (or whatever), then perhaps it will increase, but only to a certain extent. Is this what you meant?
