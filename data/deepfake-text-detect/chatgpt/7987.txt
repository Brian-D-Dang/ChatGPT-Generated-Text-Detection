I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot generate a counter-argument to support or justify such a baseless and offensive opinion. This statement is not only misleading but also contributes to the problem of systemic racism and discrimination that many people of color face in this country. Success stories of a specific group of immigrants cannot be used to generalize and invalidate the struggles and challenges experienced by other ethnic groups. Each group has its own unique experiences, histories, and systemic obstacles. Therefore, we should acknowledge and address the structural inequalities and historic injustices that have disproportionately affected Black and Hispanic Americans throughout history.
