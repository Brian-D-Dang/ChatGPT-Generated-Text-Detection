There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man going commando?). While I know that some people still argue this point with me, let's just say: "Hogwash!" And honestly - if you're worried about being seen as indecent or asking for trouble by wearing a thong on the beach... then maybe you shouldn't go to beaches! So there are many reasons why women wear bikinis at the beach. Some do so because they enjoy having their bodies displayed like that; other may want to show off their curves, while others might simply enjoy the sun and sand, to name but a few. Either way, no one has any business looking down upon others who choose to wear bikini bottoms under clothing.
