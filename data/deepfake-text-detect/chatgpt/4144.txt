First of all, I do not like to believe this because I've been told over and over and over that it isn't true, but I keep seeing more and more people who insist on reading the Bible. If there is one thing I can say about the Bible, it's that it makes me feel as if God has sent me a message through His Word - which tells me that He knows my real name! (This is also why the book of Revelation is so important!) Baby Boy 2: I had another ultrasound last week - this time we got an even better picture than before, with our little bean measuring 7 lbs 5 ozs which gives him a weight gain of 4lbs since he was born. We were officially able to see his heart! It looks amazing! The doctor said he could feel it when we touched each other during the ultrasound and he made us laugh after saying "Well, you know what? You're pretty darned good at it!" Hehe. We are still waiting for Baby Girl 3 to come out of her sac though... Which hopefully will be soon!:) Today was a good day. If I'm being completely honest, it wasn't perfect. But it definitely worked out well in terms of getting some much needed rest and spending quality family time together. Baby Boy 1 came home from the hospital today!! His birth story is just so incredibly sad - especially now that we already have one daughter who was born at 34 weeks. She is doing great now - thankfully she didn't need any major surgery. Just two staples! But anyway, while he is only three days old at this point, he has begun to take such wonderful interest in everything around him. For example, yesterday afternoon after waking up, he would stare at whatever was closest to him until baby brother Ryan woke up too. So, every morning he wakes up first thing, he takes care of Uncle Ben or Grandma Joanna and then spends a bit of time playing quietly with Ryan. Ryan Baby Boy 1After lunch, he goes back into his room and plays for hours without mommy or daddy around. Then after dinner, he usually falls asleep on the couch next to grandpa. When dad comes home from work (which is pretty often), they both play together while daddy does absolutely nothing. So last night Ryan went down for his nap early (around 9pm)... I never expected Baby Boy 1 to sleep through the night! And honestly, I never thought anyone else would either. Everyone always talks about how snorey babies get after their first year (and it really is true!), but although he is sleeping soundly right now, he isn't going to stay asleep long enough for any of us to actually sleep tonight. He is still awake almost constantly and doesn't seem to want to go to bed yet. It's only 11am here, but I think I might wake up to find him screaming... What did I miss?! This evening while watching Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart, I watched a segment called The Hidden Truths of the Bible. One of the things mentioned in the show (at least according to the commentaries I read afterwards...) is that God created Adam to scare His creatures before they fell. According to Paul, this began shortly after the Fall and continued throughout history until the fall of mankind itself. They call this the "Fall" theology. If Adam Eve sinned by eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good And Evil and thus caused mankind to fall, then how can anyone justify committing murder, theft, adultery or violence against others unless they are not afraid of punishment? At first glance, this seems crazy. How many times has someone in your life accused you of something that they should have done themselves rather than blaming someone else? As Christians we are supposed to love everyone unconditionally (even Satan!)... and God wants us to be like Him and fear Him above anything else. Yet we must remember that humans are sinful creatures and sometimes we make mistakes and deserve to suffer consequences. However, we cannot be condemned forever because of these shortcomings and sins. God forgives us for them and wants to heal us. In the end, however, God has no remorsePosted by Yesterday Jay suggested a new nicknamefor Baby Boy 1 since he'll eventuallybe known as "Big Boy." Haha. That's cute. Anyway, I decided to try to write down some words that rhyme with Big Boy. Here they are: boy, big biddy, boy, bibbidy babe, bahdaddy, daddeee, huggieshooter, boppy, mama, big blue eyes, hunnish, babbyshooter, fun - ness, warm - fuzziness, redhead, jesusbaby, oohandella, happy, happy, lemming, yummy, squee).,in,,!,,, island ,,, green
