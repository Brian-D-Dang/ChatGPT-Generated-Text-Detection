With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned as it should it was an equal community of all backgrounds and races and genders etc. but like any community it is built on the people that join. For a very long time it was a really great community that provided a space for people to interact and express themselves and be heard. Over the years there has been a lot of trolling. There have been a lot of people who've abused the trust and allowed toxic behavior to go on. There has been a lot of drama and bad behavior. There have been a lot of people who didn't have their best interests in mind. There have been a lot of people who have been there to make it worse. Because of that there has always been a community of people that have pushed to make it better. That's the kind of people that are willing to call out bad behavior, it is the kind of people that make the effort to try and make it a better place. It's the kind of people that try to improve the community. Now, there are a lot of people who like to point the finger at Reddit as a whole and make accusations about them all. That's the "it's the fault of the people in charge" crowd. They are not wrong. The people in charge of Reddit have a lot to answer for. They allowed things to go too far. They allowed things to get too toxic. They allowed the users to have more power than they should have. The problem is that there has always been a community of people who have made Reddit what it was. They are the people that are willing to put in the effort. The people that try to make the community a better place. The people that try to make it a better home for everyone. They are the people that have been overlooked, because it's easier to point at Reddit as a whole and blame them for the state of Reddit. They are the people that have kept Reddit going. They are the people that have made Reddit what it is. But, Reddit is not a monolith. It's a community. It's a collection of people. It's a group of users who come together to share a common interest, but it's more than that. It's the people who make the effort. It's the people who put the effort in. It's the people who are willing to make it a better place. It's the people who are willing to get involved. They are the people that are the true heart of Reddit. They are the people that make it what it is. They are the people that are Reddit. I don't know what will happen to Reddit in the future. I don't know if it will recover. I don't know if it will survive. I don't know what the future holds. I don't know what it will be. But, I do know what it was. I do know what it has been. I do know what it is. I do know what it has done. It's a place for people to come together. It's a place for people to interact. It's a place for people to share their stories. It's a place for people to express themselves. It's a place for people to be heard. It's a place for people to have a voice. It's a place for people to be able to find a community. It's a place for people to connect. For years Reddit was a place where all of that could happen. Where people could go and be who they wanted to be. Where people could go and share their stories. Where people could go and express themselves. Where people could go and be heard. Where people could go and be able to connect with others. Where people could go and have a voice. So, Reddit, the people that built you, the people that have made you what you are, we will not be silenced. We will not stop fighting. We will not stop trying. We will not give up. We will not be scared away. We will not back down. We will not stop believing in you. We will not stop believing in us. We will not stop believing in the power of a community. We will not stop believing in the power of Reddit. We will not stop believing in the power of you. We will not stop believing in us. We will not stop believing in ourselves. We will not stop believing in this. We will not stop believing in ourselves. We will not stop believing in
