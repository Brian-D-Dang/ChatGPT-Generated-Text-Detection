First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" does. But even if you do not use feminism as your umbrella term for all things related to women's rights (which would be more consistent with the definition), then why lump together egalitarian and feminist? I think that feminists need to start asking themselves why they are using the word 'equal' when it is so clearly not equal - while even saying they want equality they still do not seem willing or able to achieve equality without first trying to remove some sort of oppression existing in society before they get there. It just seems like it both denies responsibility for their own actions, but also implies that their actions cannot possibly be wrong and therefore can never be right (as well as implying that gender roles must change). This sounds very much like these young girls who claim they were raped at 13 by their uncle because he was drunk! She claimed she was raped by her father later in life. These two incidents should tell us something about how this supposed rape claim has been manipulated into a crime against the family, yet no one pointed out that these stories were several years apart until four years after the rapes took place. Is it possible the person being accused might actually have done nothing other than provide food and shelter to his niece? If that is the case maybe everything we hear is true: When a man is raped it is often assumed that he did something bad and the victim was punished accordingly. In addition, it certainly explains why there isn't an investigation of this matter by police since it will simply add fuel to the fire that the victim is lying. The sad thing here is that many people believe the words of women on television programs, books and newspapers online and from publications such as The New York Times Magazine. They are sometimes accurate, especially for those who live in countries where the laws regarding reporting crimes and prosecuting perpetrators vary greatly. However, speaking up against injustice is admirable, however, reportage based solely upon hearsay should be avoided at all costs. Many organizations, including the United Nations, have established statistics showing that 80 of sexual violence victims suffer from post traumatic stress disorder. Trouble is that too often accusations are made based purely off of feelings rather than facts and figures. As we all know, most media in the world focuses only on one side of any issue; often ignoring or downplaying information which contradicts what they say.
