As a german, especially in the city I live, there's honestly too many turks and muslims here. My old school was 80 turksmuslimsguys from eastern europe, which seriously lead to me feeling unsafe when it came time for gym or lab reports etc I'm half Turkish and lived all over Berlin but never felt unsafe although people did look at you funny if they saw your Turkish passport But yeah, most of them are turkish immigrants
