For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to my recent development of sexual interest. I am in a long-term monogamous relationship, and my partner and I have discussed this issue extensively. I am a gay male who, prior to beginning my relationship with my partner, had never experienced sexual attraction to, or physical contact with, any person other than my current partner. Since beginning our relationship, I have experienced sexual attraction to, and had physical contact with, a number of people other than my partner, although this attraction has been minimal. I have heard a number of times that, while it is uncommon for a gay male to experience sexual attraction to and have physical contact with people other than his partner, this is not unheard of. While I know this to be true, it is still something that concerns me, and I worry that I will not be able to prevent myself from experiencing these desires. I know that this is a complicated issue and I have a number of questions, so here are a few. Would it be unusual or concerning for me to experience sexual attraction and physical contact with other people after having entered a monogamous relationship? Is it possible for me to prevent these desires from occurring? Will my relationship be negatively affected by the occurrence of these desires? I would appreciate any advice or comments that you may have regarding this situation. You are not alone in experiencing this. But it is still a little unusual. I'm gay. I'm 26 and have a partner of 2 years. I have never had sexual feelings for another man. I have never felt the urge to kiss another man or hold hands with another man. I have never wanted to "be with" another man. But I have felt sexual attraction to women. I have had sexual thoughts about women. I have had sexual feelings for women.
