I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most true when it comes to face products, which makes me cringe every time my mom asks how much longer she will have to wait for her foundation or concealer (she's very impatient). 2) We pay a ridiculous amount of money just so that our skin doesn't look 'broken'. 3) We're constantly wearing makeup because the idea that we should be wearing nothing looks terribly unattractive. So...that leaves us with one big problem: No matter what you do in life - whether its playing sports, reading books, whatever - the end result only matters if it leads somewhere. Because beauty isn't something you get at the end of your journey; no matter where you are now or who came before you; there has always been someone behind you guiding all along. And wherever you may go from here on out depends entirely upon yourself.... That was never more evident than today as I stood alongside her. She had arrived home early after an exhausting day working through a case...and still managed to find the energy to eat breakfast while making herself presentable enough to meet up with some fellow investigators. As soon as I saw her beautiful smile, I knew exactly why God had brought me down that particular path two years ago. Just knowing that He would let me help her reach those goals mattered even though none of them were my own. There wasn't one thing wrong with Mom, but everything inside of her said "you don't belong hereand she really didn't know any better! And that made ME feel broken. To see her eyes lighten and start smiling again; to hear her laugh once again; to realize that she knows who I am; to watch her cry tears of joy over simple events meant far too little. The question remains: Would Jesus allow me to truly live without His presence? In other words - If heaven were real -wouldn't I spend eternity longing for Him closer rather than farther away? Wouldn't I follow Him everywhere? Of course not!! How could such a concept exist?! But there is hope. Jesus knows each and everyone of us by name. He loves every single person laid beneath His feet -no matter their past, current circumstances, or future plans!!! You see, Jesus wants EVERYONE. He desires BEYOND ALL DESIRE TO...let YOU come HOME WITH HIM!!!!! Does it hurt right now? Yes. BUT HE WILL NEVER LEAVE US OR FAIL US. Join me tonight as I share with you three things He tells us NOT to worry ABOUT but instead WHAT TO WORRY ABOUT: 1.) Your physical body 2.) Your spiritual Body 3.) What others believe about you. Let me tell you straightaway: These last two things aren't going anywhere anytime soon. They may hinder you momentarily, sure, but they won't ever actually keep you from Heaven. Believing them, however, CAN keep you from Heaven. Why? Well because they are based upon false beliefs about reality. False belief means we expect results for believing something, whereas truth breeds faith. When you refuse to accept the TRUTH about everything around you-especially gravity!-then you will continuously doubt whether or not you deserve eternal life. With that kind of self-loathing, it's pretty easy to convince ourselves we cannot receive salvation since we obviously haven't done ANYTHING worthy in the first place. Then, you begin questioning your worthiness to rely on Christ alone in every aspect of daily living...which then causes your mind to wander back towards sinning in order to justify your existence. Isn't it ironic...how very human that sounds!? My heart aches for you. Don't give into these lies anymore. For reasons I mentioned earlier; because in truth, you already DO HAVE A Father Who Loves You unconditionally regardless of whatever actions take place within your life (And yes, they sometimes happen quite unexpectedly...) AND-as long as you choose to trust Him completely in all things and ask ONLY FOR HELP IN THE PLACE WHERE IT IS NEEDED...he will ALWAYS EXIST. Call God at TODAY and reserve your ticket to eternal bliss. Tell him Lani sent ya;
