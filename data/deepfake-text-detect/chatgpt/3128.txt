Human sentience (or consciousness, or sapience, or whatever term you like) is an emergent behavior of neurons and their interactions, which can be replicated in non-organic systems, i.e., computers. Thus , it is possible to create artificial intelligence (AI) that can potentially possess similar cognitive and problem-solving abilities as humans. However, it is important to note that despite the potential similarities, the workings of the human brain and the behavior of AI systems are still fundamentally different. AI systems are programmed with rules, algorithms and data, while the human brain operates on a complex network of neurons and chemical interactions. Additionally, AI is not capable of experiencing emotions, thoughts, and feelings like a human being, which is an important component of human sentience. Therefore, while AI can be a valuable tool, it is crucial to acknowledge its limitations and the unique abilities and perspectives of humans.
