So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern science and engineering is based on scientific findings, so why not just argue that they are correct? You're arguing for a higher standard of living than you were saying, meaning it's an entirely different subject from what people have been saying since birth. You should not say "I'm a scientist" or something like that. I would rather call them "expert scientists."
