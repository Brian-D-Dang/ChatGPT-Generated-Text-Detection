As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not the right choice for most people, and if you are one such person seeking help from advanced-care services I can assure you that many parents whose children haven't recovered don't want or need your money either! The fact remains that there are still more than enough deceased donor kidneys available in North America (about 6000 per year), all while waiting lists increase by roughly 1000 cases each month - or about 5 annually. This means over 100 significant donors die every week without their organs being used to save others who might otherwise die waiting. Their families know this and yet they continue to donate with full awareness that their loved ones will never receive an organ transplant but at least their family members won't be forced into living hell until death do us part. Most often when patients die awaiting kidney transplants, no other organs become available because these marginal candidates were deemed too low priority. This leaves patients who could benefit from lifesaving treatments dead. The good news is that as long as our government continues to "encourage" the public to give up healthy body parts at the drop of a hat they will keep having access to donated organs. In ten years time chances are that another 10,000 Americans will die due to lack of availability of organs. How ironic then, that the same government which has encouraged so much voluntary donation has also legislated against any non-volunteering citizens trying to harvest their own organs after death under the guise of some new law supposedly designed to protect them? Is it possible that American political leaders truly care only for themselves, their friends and special interests, and not in the health and well-being of its citizens? Unfortunately, yes. As far back as 1994, two U.S. Senators introduced legislation known as the Organ Procurement Act prohibiting states from implementing regulations permitting organ recovery by relatives or next of kin after individuals died. However, before dying of natural causes, these individuals would likely elect to sign organ preservation directives in order to ensure their organs remain viable for future potential recipients if needed in times of medical emergency like dialysis failure or acute renal rejection requiring immediate life saving treatment. Sadly, even though the law was passed two decades ago, numerous state governments across the United States still permit removal and recycling of human tissues for transplantation such as cornea and bone marrow. More importantly, federal law does nothing to prevent hospitals, nursing homes and doctors from donating organs for purposes beyond mere science experimentation. People may wonder why we should allow hospitals to take possession of a patient's heart, liver, lungs etc., yet refuse permission for someone else to remove organs after heshe dies naturally? Or shouldn't doctors encourage autologous blood transfusions rather than giving away their plasma for profit? Why must social workers dictate what a sick woman should do after she loses her health insurance runs out of options? That question aside here are 22 reasons why you should oppose mandatory organ harvesting: 1) It is immoral 2) It is unethical 3) It violates religious beliefs 4) Medical professionals aren't allowed to participate under current laws 5) There is already an organized industry of organ theft 6) Donors' families suffer 7) Public opinion opposes organ harvesting 8) Families caring for brain injured survivors of mass shootings deserve better 9) Hospitals performing organ donations violate ethical principles 10) You're missing the point 11) Do something useful 12) Not helping in research 13) Laws are confusing 14) Prohibitions don't work 15) When death occurs outside hospital 16) Human trafficking 17) Standard procedure 18) Forced organ removal 19) Advance directive 20) Better alternatives 21) Sharing information with the general population 22) Right of self determination So where exactly did we go wrong? Let me explain... First off, if you've ever had anything done to yourself you'll realize that surgery requires anesthesia - something that depresses activity levels (and replenishes sodium levels). Basically, under anesthesia and analgesia a patient enters a kind of autism wherein muscle tone cannot be maintained....meaning the unconscious individual will stop breathing unless artificial respiration is administered. Intravenously injected drugs effectively control the respiration process resulting in apnea, sometimes lasting several hours. During that period oxygen molecules bind avidly to hemoglobin in red blood cells to form oxyhemoglobin. Oxygenated blood pools around vital organs creating a partial vacuum within them causing decreased venous return and increased cardiac output. Eventually normal rhythm resumes, heart rate increases, and circulation to peripheral tissue begins again, beginning the cascade leading to restoration of normal arterial pO2 at various vascular beds throughout the body. If the respiratory cycle recurs during the initial stages of reoxygenation (e.g., when awakening), a final stage of hypoxic insult ensues characterized clinically by profound drowsiness and lethargy.
