To me, online entertainment is such a flip of a coin. You either get a partnership or you don't, and even if you do get the partnership, there's no saying it'll be a long-lasting one. But if it's not meant to be, there's always some reason why it isn't, and it's probably not for you to question. That's not your job, because you can't know what the other side is thinking. You can only do what you're supposed to do, and that's all you can do. I've been there, you know? I've been rejected before by partners who thought I was too old or too young or too something. I think that's why I wanted to be with MU Online. I wanted to work with them because they're younger than most of the partners I've worked with. I'm not saying that age is everything, but I think it can definitely help in the case of an online game. Korean companies are very technologically-oriented, and they're very fast-paced, very dynamic. I've worked with a couple of Korean companies before, and I've seen that they know what they're doing. There are many things that I like about working with Korean companies. Aside from the fast-paced nature of their development, I think that they're very knowledgeable about what they're doing. And it's not just a one-way street. I've also learned a lot from working with Korean companies. I've learned from their experience, their knowledge, and their understanding of the market. They've opened my eyes to a lot of things that I never knew, and they've helped me understand the market better, and that's really important. The bottom line, I guess, is that I had a great time working with MU Online and I hope that we'll be able to work together again in the future.
