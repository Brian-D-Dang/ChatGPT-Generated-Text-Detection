There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is a bit counter intuitive in that it provides the highest possible protection against corruption, but it does not provide enough protections against fraud. However, if you are aware of any voter who has falsified hisher registration and is attempting to vote at an election, please alert me so we may seek legal action to prevent such attempts at voting fraud.

Monday, June 29, 2015 I've been asked many times how I get people to really believe what they read about me. How do I convince them? Well, I will tell you why the average person believes everything they hear here in Canada: because there isn't much else to choose from other than government propaganda. If you go over into Europe where society still respects freedom, your story just doesn't seem credible. There are far more channels available to watch TV news since most European countries don't have local public broadcasting stations like CBC Television or Radio One. Also when Europeans travel abroad they tend to stay away from places controlled by dictatorial governments. In the United States as well, one gets more information from Cable News Channels such as CNN and Fox News. And then there's YouTube! All these sources give some credibility to reports coming out of those areas. The internet makes everything easy to access internationally now. We're seeing this trend emerge even in North America today. Although Canadians love to bitch about American politics, US newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post are viewed more favorably outside of the USA due mainly to Americans being afraid to speak up about things happening back home such as FBI spying programs, NSA data collection or illegal drone strikes overseas. The Internet gives us direct access to whatever subject matter interests us online without having to worry about censorship. Just type "Steve Miller" plus 'Ammerica' into Google. You'll be bombarded almost immediately by plenty of articles concerning the many issues besetting the U SA Government at present. After reading several stories per day you'll soon realize how critical it is to know the truth before it becomes totally censored out of existence. Even the native media outlets are struggling to keep themselves afloat lately. This is partially due to the fact that too many progressive reporting organizations like CHCH News are going broke and must lay off staff while trying desperately to maintain solid journalistic integrity within Canadian standards. As early as 2008 CHCH was forced to cut its coverage drastically. It seems everyone wants content but no one trusts mainstream print reporters anymore because they had failed miserably at applying basic journalism principles. Blogs are another hot topic right now. They offer everything the old school journalists were supposed to report - facts rather than opinions; credibility above bias or partisan agendas; and openness regarding funding sources. Unfortunately though, blogs often lack depth or proper context to certain subjects. When it comes down to it, ALL media outlets need to apply better judgment to what topics are published online. For example, did you ever notice how CHCH news never speaks about abortion? Never mind pro choice vs anti choice. Why aren't we hearing news headlines aloud stating something along the lines of "150 Million Children Aborted Since Roe v Wade"? These types of topics should definitely be reported considering the obvious consequences of human rights abuses around the world. But instead we get pollution warnings delivered in simple terms to citizens that probably wouldn't grasp the significance of such dire statistics anyway. What happened to the days when serious investigative journalism could be done!? During the time of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau NDP Member of Parliament Jack Pickton served on the House Public Works committee. He used this position of responsibility to uncover a lot of disturbing truths. His massive research project eventually changed Canada's laws pertaining to child custody cases affecting aboriginal children after he discovered, among others, widespread abuse caused directly by abusive parents. Back in 2007 he uncovered documents showing RCMP officers investigating the murder-suicide of two British Columbia First Nations men knew they were dealing with child abusers yet proceeded on anyways; they didn't want to get involved because they believed "these problems would disappear." Other findings included corrupt police officials tampering with evidence and lying under oath during court proceedings thus covering up criminal activity. So what happened to him? No charges filed even though Jack proved beyond reasonable doubt a major coverup existed inside of Ottawa Police Services. Instead, following investigation and debate the Conservative Harper cabinet made changes to outdated legislation prohibiting child molesters from travelling outside Canada, and protecting victims of parental abduction. That same year four RCMP officers faced trial for perjury and obstruction of justice related to the Pickton murders. Despite overwhelming evidence the jury found none guilty, proving once again incompetent prosecution in Canada. Finally Quebec Superior Court Judge Jean-Guy Crepeau heard small-determineable groupies. A few years later Praya said nothing said about getting every individual case destined to dave Press'rtBrax
