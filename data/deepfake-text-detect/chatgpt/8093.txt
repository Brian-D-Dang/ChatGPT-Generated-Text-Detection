I think English should not be the international language for these reasons: It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words here uBrotherChe makes a really good point about this in his post (which I'm replying from). And then there are other factors like because of different dialects and accents. That, along with grammatical differences between languages make it almost impossible without context or translation which can't fit into little space as you said.)
