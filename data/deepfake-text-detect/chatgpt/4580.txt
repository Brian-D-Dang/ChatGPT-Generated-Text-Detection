As long as I've been alive, I've always poured milk before cereal. I've done this because I am a textural eater and I hate soggy cereal. I believe that pouring the milk first is best way to make sure you don't lose any of it when eating with your fingers. I tried adding dryer sheets inside my Vitamix blender the other day but they definitely did not get blended well! It just made them into powdery lumps so unfortunately I had no luck using the Dryer Sheets Method for making smoothies. But I'll keep trying.:] If anyone has used Dryer Sheets successfully in their Vitamix or another high-speedblender please post how well they worked out!:)
