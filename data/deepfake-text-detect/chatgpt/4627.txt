Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions... but in reality has the opposite effect on society as a whole; just like feminism fostering a false sense of empowerment which only raises women's self esteem so they can demand even more equality than our ancestors could ever imagine (because we are now thinking about equal rights for men), social justice culture pushes people into anti-social behavior, both male AND female, because they feel entitled to everything while feeling that no one else should be allowed access or control over anything. The following is primarily meant to show how what sounds 'equal' really isn't at all, and why these things don't benefit other groups either. It also shows how we're not already living in some kind of perfect world where everyone gets along regardless of race, religion, sexual preference, etc., rather we still need work done in order to make sure that happens (it will take a lot longer though). The last part deals with my personal views on gender roles, since you'll see from the first paragraph that I'm very much opposed to them. Sorry if there are any typoserrors, I've written several articles previously but haven't updated them yet. This was originally going to start off as two separate posts today, but then changed back to this format when I realized that I had put far too many ideas together without having time to set up proper paragraphs. So please bare with me As someone who identifies herself as an independent thinker, let me say right away: I do NOT think "everyone deserves their own opinion." That presumes that your opinion matters. You don't matter. Your life doesn't matter. Everybody else's does, whereas yours absolutely does. If I am being perfectly honest, I'd have to say there certainly aren't enough resources out there dedicated to educating us on topics such as those below, hence why I decided to write this article instead of throwing another Facebook comment down the drain I come from a LEGITIMATE FAMILY! My parents were married in front of God everybody after church services. They never cheated on each other nor treated me bad. We didn't live in poverty nor did I go hungry growing up. In fact, I grew up comfortable and rich due to the loving understanding environment provided by my father. While he wasn't always around physically, he made sure his teachings got passed onto me through role modeling. Again, thanks Dad. He raised a respectful young lady whom nobody would call "Stupid," "Idiot" or "Crazy" behind her back. As a result, she knows how life works and accepts whatever comes her way. She does not correlate EVERYTHING to sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, ect. Rather, these issues are merely examples used throughout history and present day in relation to current events. Once again, that means you matter less than others Many religious leaders have been asking recently whether children should stay home alone overnight. Should kids allow anyone inside? What diseases might they catch? How safe is safety anyway? Is there something wrong with letting teen girls wear makeup to school anymore? Why are new laws forcing schools to teach fitness class? Where does government end and parental authority begin? And what qualifies a mother to discipline her child? For example, if a parent beats their kid everyday until they are 12 years old, do they deserve extra credit? There are tons of questions out there, and parents are realizing more every single day how important parenting skills are. While these questions may seem silly at the surface level, they are actual questions that are coming up more frequently within families across America. Parents everywhere want answers! But, HOW DO WE GET THEM!? Here are 5 tips for getting started. 1) Educate yourself. Read books, watch TV programs and movies to better understand what you are dealing with. 2) Talk to friends and family members. Find out what advice is best for YOUR situation. 3) Communicate with your doctor. Let him know WHAT you are experiencing, WHO IT HAPPENS TO BE happening to, WHEN it happened, and WHY YOU BELIEVE THIS IS WRONG. 4) Start gathering information. Look online for websites that offer unbiased educational materials related to early childhood development, nutrition, health, education, current news stories, public policy, sustainability initiatives, economic trends, employment statistics and overall societal changes. 5) Take action. Make informed decisions regarding the future of your children based upon ALL available sources of data. Don't jump blindly into the rabbit hole simply because you are afraid of making mistakes. Choose wisely, educate properly, communicate effectively and act judiciously. Now GO FIND THE ANSWERS There are nearly 9 billion different animals on Earth.
