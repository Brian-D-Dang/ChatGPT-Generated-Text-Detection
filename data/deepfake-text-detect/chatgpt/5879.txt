First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" has. But I know there are a lot of women who embrace egalitarianism, even if they don't use the word to describe themselves. And I know that for many people, the word "feminist" has gotten a bad rap, so there are women who would be repelled by the word "feminism" and yet, are in fact feminists. So I thought "egalitarianism" would be a good word to use for this series. And I know that the vast majority of the women in the United States, even if they don't identify themselves as feminists, are feminists. They support equal rights for women, they want to see women paid as well as men, they believe that women have the right to control their own bodies, and they believe that women are smart, capable, and deserving of all the same opportunities as men. It is just that these beliefs are not labeled "feminism" and, in fact, these women have been told for years that feminism is a bad thing. They've been told by their friends, their families, their coworkers, the media, and society in general that they should be "just" women, that they should be subservient to men, and that they should be perfect, and that feminism is a "man-hating" movement. But in fact, feminism is about empowerment and equality for women, and about the liberation of women. And while I would certainly support any woman who wants to identify herself as a "feminist," I also think it's important for women to know that even if they don't want to identify themselves as "feminists," they're still feminists. They're still strong, intelligent, capable women who deserve equal rights and opportunities, they're still women who believe in equality and equal pay, and they're still women who deserve equal pay for equal work. So that's why I'm going to talk about "egalitarianism" rather than "feminism" here. Because I think it's important to remember that it's not just about saying you're a "feminist" to say you're an egalitarian, it's about believing in equal rights and equal opportunities for women and supporting equal pay for equal work. And that's why I'm going to talk about "egalitarianism" rather than "feminism" here.

And so I'm going to use the word "egalitarianism" to describe what I believe to be true about women and women's rights. I'm going to use the word "egalitarianism" because I think it's a better word for what I'm trying to say. Because I want to talk about what I believe to be true about women and women's rights, not just what I believe to be true about "feminists." Because I'm not just talking about feminists, I'm talking about women. And so I'm going to use the word "egalitarianism" to describe what I believe to be true about women and women's rights.
