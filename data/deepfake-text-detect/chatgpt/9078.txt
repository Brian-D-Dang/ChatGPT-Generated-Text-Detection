First of, this is only talking about people who are vegetariansvegans for ethical reasons. If you are a vegetarian for any other reason, this does not apply Being a vegetarian does not mean being vegan in that way. I know I'm just trying to be calm-ish and avoid the whole topic. I don't know how saturated all this shit is in other areas; it seems like there's really no limit to what can or can't be done on a one-to-one basis.
