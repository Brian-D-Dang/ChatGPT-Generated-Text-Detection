This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in AvX 1]. Avx was one of my first comics as a kid and it really stuck out to me how much diversity in mainstream comic books there has become over the years (even just within Marvel). And yet even at its release back then there wasn't any black characters on the cover or barely any black people in the book itself - no Ms. Marvels or Black Catz. I think at some point right after Civil War II ended there were only three black superheroes left: Captain America, Spider-Man, and the Human Torch. Granted, both Spidey and Cap are kind of filler heroes, but still... As someone who's read most every Marvel superhero title since the early 80s, including Defenders stories, and runs on titles like X-Men Blue, and Avengers Arena; and sometimes even the occasional Justice LeagueJustice Society story from DC Comics... well they're all kinda white manly men! And those stories had their moments, such as "My Friend Panther" by Steve Gerber and Gil Kane in Tales From The Silver Age 35. But when you look around the entire industry, where do minorities fit? Where can we find these characters so prevalent in other media?
