First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person who loves to read books and see films for entertainment purposes only (and because it helps pass time). If you take pleasure watching horror flicks like The Exorcist or Poltergeists than go ahead! But if your taste leans more towards something along those lines of Saw etc...than maybe these types are best avoided by just being too intense? I do think there is an intrinsic problem with many mainstream film makers today which they fail miserably at depicting functioning human beings; rather strange considering how much money movies generate worldwide every year - but hey ho what can we expect as long people keep buying tickets en masse?! So why then would anyone want their children exposed over-night into such things when real life could become so nightmarish itself due its own sheer unpredictability alone?? Also consider all other non mediated ways one might fill ones mindsenses on TV shows radio programs: music videos news coverage focus chiefly around violence anyway!! Films have always been regarded superior intellectually though aren't necessarily funnier [the exception perhaps possibly Porky's]. When was last heard anything say against violent documentaries beeing shown "just once"? What happened after 9 11 didn't exactly change anybody minds here either.. Ahhh don t get my wrong nor claim i'm suggesting replacing popcorn munching amusement methods altogether - oh no! It seems most parents themselves may even agree wholeheartedly except where morality comes involved. Even still imho plenty should remain within parental control without total censorship unless truly harmful well thought out material appears elsewhere, e g internet?. On top again few will argue games never lead kids astray online:) Are young adults simply incapable nowdays regarding subjects beyond fart jokes? Double standards surely apply evidentially!.So yes some scenes were scary whilst others also unnerving frighteningly surrealistic indeed especially amongst newer titles: Bunuel No Escape Cage Behind Bars Tidelands Funny Games Beyond Sight Inception Interstellar Bye bye Butterfly[especially] Silent House Happiness Lies Triangle Abduction Party People Evil Dead 1 2 3 Piranha New World Nightmare Reincarnation Needful Things Phantasm Scarecrow Shock Witches Of Salem Now leave them behind lads!! These days imagination frittering away has gone totally mad ......
