"Safe" Don't have to worry about the majority of the community using the downvote button as a disagree button Example: [The most recent example that is driving my view] In fact, I'd consider it an insult if someone says something like "that guy sucked at this game." Oh i thought you meant no ones allowed to say anything. That would be bad too because then people only post when they think there's some need for negative feedback That makes sense in theory but usually takes away from discussion and ultimately can lead to toxicity
