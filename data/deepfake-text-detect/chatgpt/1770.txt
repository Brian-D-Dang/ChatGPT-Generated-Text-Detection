I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites for certain types of records (date ranges). A year or two later though, our team became much more focused on building "real-time" applications which required tons of processing power, so those skills are definitely useful! This is great information thanks:)
