Most colleges do not require trigonometry for admissions, and do not require students to take a trigonometry course. It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math requirement, but if you want them to know it than I suggest studying up on it yourself. Did they start requiring students to send their scores from standardized tests? When i went through college first time around no one took any of those aptitudeaptitude testing things before graduating just because we had so many exams already taken when we applied there was never even an option to test out of anything.
