There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man 's undies on his head or even stuffed into his mouth?). I would ask why you think the right to bare one's buttocks belongs solely to women? What if two men decide they want to go out for dinner together wearing only their undershortsis that OK because it's just between them rather than being public? If so then what happens when three guys walk around downtown dressed this way and talking loudly about which girls will pick them up? Are we really saying that exposing our bottoms in such a manner is somehow an expression of love toward us but merely an exercise of freedom to do as we choose with ourselves and each other without any social consequences whatsoever? If anything, I feel like maybe some people are guilty of "sensationalism" in reporting on these incidents, maybe exaggerating the story. Maybe mention a few things that were done by more polite means prior to the incident. But also don't let the headlines get away from the fact that this was meant to humiliate someone who clearly didn't need humiliation at all! In reality there have been many male-to-male butt slapping events already - including gay ones - albeit less publicized. Perhaps the reason I haven't seen this particular event reported here before now is precisely because its probably fairly common among young males and therefore wouldn't cause much controversy amongst feminists anyway... But it still seems pretty ludicrous to me. The whole point of pantiesunderwear is not to show off.The world has enough images flashing through everyones imagination. These types of actions might make sense during locker room sessions or something, but certainly not out in public where strangers can see. This reminds me exactly of this post: [quote]And while my experience is heavily limited to heterosexuality, I'm sure that hetero dudes know how bad this looks.[quote] Same thing happened to me last week (well actually, four days ago.) A guy came running down the hallway yelling "Did anyone see me pull my pants down?!" in front of everyone in the entire building. He had no idea he did it until he saw a girl pointing him out. Fortunately she told her friends instead of spreading gossip. He got caught doing the exact same thing earlier in the day. He apologized profusely and explained he thought he could hide behind this excuse because he wasn't familiar with the area. No apology worked though; since everyone knew it was happening, he looked like the biggest idiot ever. Apparently he used a different tactic EVERY time he tries this little game; sometimes he does it without realizing it, sometimes he forgets it completely, and other times he pulls it off perfectly and runs home covered with glory. Not cool man. Not cool AT ALL. I honestly wonder why he thinks pulling your pants down is 'funny.' Is there NO form of humor better than making fun of yourself? It makes me sad, because apparently we live in a society where humiliating yourself isn't shameful. This attitude leads me to believe that if this guy wanted to cover himself from ridicule, he couldn't find another outfit to wear...

Right after he starts singing 'Oh oh,' KLAZZZZZZZZAPPPP!!!!!!!!! LOLOL!! Wow. That was hilarious!!! And totally awesome.... [IMG My dearest cousin has worn underpants everyday since birth. She's 6 years old, religious, and very sweet. When speaking of underwear, her favorite phrase is "they're keeping my privates nice." Her parents are both conservative Christian professionals of average height and weight, and they've never met a stranger. So seeing my cousin encounter a random person was surprising to say the least. As soon as we approached the friend, she turned bright red instantly. We were curious, and asked if she'd minded giving out any personal information. She started crying immediately, shaking her head yes and looking confused. My cousin ran back inside the bus smiling happily, asking over and over again if the man said hi and was he going somewhere special too. She broke down and confessed everything. She felt ashamed, embarrassed, and violated. Even now I'm having trouble writing this part, especially considering she and her family are at Disneyworld right now.
