People talk about'natural' or'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like "free speech" or "free association" are'inalienable','natural', or'God-given', how come so many people don't have them? Because those things exist, and they're given to us by our creator. But because we create everything out of nothing, there is no reason why the creation must abide by a set of rules that were never put in place for it (and which were not created for humans).
