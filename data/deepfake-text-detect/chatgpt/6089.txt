I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my family members... I'm sorry that they feel the way that they do. I hope that you will be able to work things out with them and become closer and more accepting of each other. A sister is a wonderful thing and we can't imagine life without her, but... she can be a pain in the butt.
