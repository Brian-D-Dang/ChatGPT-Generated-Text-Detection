Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I don't want or need anyway! Cool. Anyone know how much time would you estimate it'd take me to finish this project? Just finishing up my 20th birthday shopping spree later today...
