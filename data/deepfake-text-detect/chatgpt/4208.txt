I say "killer asteroid" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth. I have three such objects in my database at present: Asteroids and comets are relatively small targets compared to asteroids and planets with much more mass, so it's not that hard to hit them with a suitable weapon. The main problem is getting those things in our way without causing some kind of catastrophe like we saw when asteroids approached earth last year. That said, we may be able to design better weapons later on as technologies advance.
