One could argue that the US Constitution and its amendments are designed to be a flexible framework that can adapt to changing times and circumstances. The Constitution already provides mechanisms for updating its provisions, such as the amendment process outlined in Article V. It is also worth noting that the US Constitution is not an isolated document, but rather one that is shaped by the ongoing interpretation of courts and the political process. Furthermore, attempting to completely rewrite or overhaul the Constitution every 100 years could prove to be a daunting and divisive task, potentially leading to significant political and social unrest over the direction of the country. Instead, it may be more productive to focus on making targeted, specific changes to the Constitution as needed based on current challenges and societal needs, rather than undertaking a larger-scale revision.
