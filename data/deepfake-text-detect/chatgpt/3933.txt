Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable that they might be related to each other as well through shared genetic heritage or simple geography - but why does that mean their relationship is any more than a matter of convenience? The episode didn't provide much information about this point either. In many ways it was probably the saddest one of these episodes yet, because Tasha Yar had already become such an integral part of the Enterprise crew at this point that her leaving meant an end to so much of what had made Star Trek great over the years: Tasha being the Captain and Spock being the officer; Tasha being the one who knew all the best people on Earth (and that includes her father); Tasha being the one who took care of Dax, Worf and Admiral Archer just like she did for her sister Jadzia Dax; and then there were the endless jokes about how odd it would be if Tasha ever got married with the Captain taking the lead (her father). This is especially sad when you consider that both a) Tasha was becoming a very good pilot despite not having been trained traditionally before and b) Kirk never even had female captainship experience himself, nor cared to learn them anyway after he saw his wife, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, take command of a Klingon vessel during the early days of the Seven Year War. Meanwhile, the only human character we get close to from the Federation side of things are Odo and Kathryn Janeway, but neither has any real connection to the human race beyond that of being the captain of the USS Voyager. They're both a bit...odd, no? Instead of trying to figure out why human beings are so important in the Federation, perhaps I should try to understand more about the balance between their various powers within the organization. Tasha Yar's Original Series Character Gene Roddenberry's Legacy We don't know too much about Tasha Yar's actual origins until the series finale - it turns out that she was actually born into wealth, but died young due to complications following childbirth. This became known decades later by way of letters between her family and who else may have come across her body while searching for bodies of missing persons during the search for the Enterprise. In those letters, Tasha states that she doesn't believe in religion as she believes that "science trumps faith," which I've always taken to mean that science can override contracts and make decisions based on facts, whereas faith relies on supernatural explanations. She also says that she feels that Starfleet often operates differently than the rest of society because its leadership often comes from religious backgrounds. As far as I'm concerned, this confirms the idea that Tasha was actually raised Christian although she wasn't particularly religious herself; however, given Picard's habit of speaking from his own perspective and ignoring the opinions of others besides his fellow officers, it's possible we wouldn't hear about Tasha's beliefs unless we knew about her father. So where did Tasha Yar fit into the fabric of the Federation? Well, she was the first woman to represent the Federation in every respect. How coincidental! The characters we see acting as examples show that women could serve as valuable members of Starfleet. For example, Officer Sarek is at least as competent a leader as his male counterparts, and he never once used military force against any alien species that he encountered throughout five seasons of the series. His heart isn't necessarily in war, though - he wants to protect humanity from evil. He represents the Federation in the same manner as Dr. Beverly Crusher represented the Federation in the Star Trek films, and yet both went on to become successful individuals within Starfleet. Yes, in some sense, Tasha Yar was both a representation of the Federation and also a symbol of the changes brought on by the events of her life path until death. There's plenty of room for discussion here about female roles in Starfleet or the impact feminism has had on Starfleet, but let me sum up my thoughts: Star Trek introduced us to a strong woman who stood behind the men and led the ship along its journey of discovery; that makes for compelling television, regardless of gender.
