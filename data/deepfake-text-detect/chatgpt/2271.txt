I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. And why should that be? If she isn't up front and honest with you what else are you supposed to make of her other than someone who just wants attention from as many menwomen possible?
