I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience, it is my assessment that the USA will not hesitate to use nuclear weapons in the future. And the threat of these weapons does not just affect the nations they are used against, but also the nations that supply them. It is my belief that the USA is planning to use nuclear weapons against North Korea as soon as possible. This would be in an attempt to prevent them from further development of their nuclear weapons program, and would be a warning to the other nations on the earth, North Korea and Iran, that the USA is able to use nuclear weapons, and also a demonstration that the USA is willing to do so. I also believe that the USA has been stockpiling nuclear weapons in anticipation of this eventuality. The USA is now expanding it's nuclear weapons arsenal, and is in the process of building a new type of nuclear weapon that is far more powerful than the ones previously used against Japan. The USA is also developing new methods of delivering nuclear weapons, and has perfected new types of nuclear weapons that can be carried by submarines. And the USA has launched a new generation of ballistic missile submarines that are capable of carrying hundreds of nuclear warheads. I believe that the USA has already developed new nuclear weapons that can be delivered by stealth bombers, and that these new nuclear weapons are capable of destroying entire nations in one strike. And I also believe that the USA is actively planning to use these new nuclear weapons against North Korea, and Iran. I believe that the USA is actually planning to use these new types of nuclear weapons in a first strike against these two nations. The USA has the ability to destroy the entire world in one strike. And the USA has demonstrated that it is willing to do so. The USA has also demonstrated the capacity to destroy the entire world in a matter of minutes. And I believe that the USA is actively planning to use these new nuclear weapons to destroy the entire world. The USA has a history of using nuclear weapons in a first strike. The USA has already used nuclear weapons in war. The USA is also the only nation in history to actually use nuclear weapons against an enemy. And the USA has demonstrated that it is willing to use nuclear weapons again in the future. And I believe that the USA is actively planning to use nuclear weapons against Iran, and North Korea. I believe that the USA is also planning to use nuclear weapons against the Palestinians. I believe that the USA has actually started to use nuclear weapons against the Palestinians.
