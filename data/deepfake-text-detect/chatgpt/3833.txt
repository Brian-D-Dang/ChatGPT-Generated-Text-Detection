I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites for info on things that needed testing or development. What's the best way to get started with this sort of thing? I've heard good things about R and Python but have never used them before. How would you recommend getting started (or start somewhere else)?
