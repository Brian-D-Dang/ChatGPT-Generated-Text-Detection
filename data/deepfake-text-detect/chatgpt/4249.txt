I have recently been told that my pro-life position is "forcing my ideas on others." I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary. If one believes life begins at conception, as an atheist or agnostic, the birth of a baby would be murder by default. Consider that Christians don't talk about God being just because they don't think he exists. They are convinced that there is no way to know for sure whether this is true. The fact that we can't say does not change the fact that human beings do come from our Creator and therefore the reality of their existence cannot be denied. To deny that the idea of god must be something other than his nature (something that doesn't exist) means to deny what makes us who we are and to reduce humans to mere things to be handled with care. As an atheist or agnostic you could never be guilty of murder, but when it comes to abortion your position puts a person in the same category. This is where the problem lies - many people don't want to see someone killed simply because it seems morally reprehensible. There are those who will argue that it isn't murder until two weeks after pregnancy. Some argue that its okay to kill a fetus immediately upon diagnosis of Down Syndrome. How long do we give babies who suffer mental problems? We wait before letting them live? It should really be made clear that unborn children are sacred life from the moment of conception. Their lives begin and end right up until the very moment they join the earth's inhabitants; then it ends. This truth should stop any freedom movement that aims to limit abortions to save human dignity. The whole argument against abortion has become a personal attack against women's rights. Many feel that giving choice back to women is causing more harm than good. Women are often assumed to be selfish creatures just because they are looking out for themselves and their families rather than following whatever ideology may generate a sympathy vote. If a woman's choices mean she wants her child to die so be it, although such action does cause suffering and sometimes death itself. Yet public policy is meant to benefit the nation and not every woman's decision needs to be supported. Abortion gives women control over their own body, which is incredible when you consider how little control women have in general. A few years ago I was having a conversation with a friend and co-worker about how some feminists take great pleasure in attacking women - "you're getting pregnant to have sex!" Oh dear, they were saying. But why? Why do certain groups pretend like we all need a license to reproduce?! Or maybe it's just a ploy. Maybe everyone else actually enjoys the experience of procreating - men too perhaps. Perhaps that is why modern feminism focuses so heavily on tearing women down. It feels cathartic to mince words, discourages reflection and raises ire. By attacking women and assuming the worst about them, feminism allows others to form false impressions about humanity and society. Feminism now seems to involve basing morality around the arbitrary point at which a theory states that a baby can be considered human while still being alive. What a harsh world!
