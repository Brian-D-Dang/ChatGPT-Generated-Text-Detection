I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most noticeable with eyeshadow because they're easy to see, but it's hard to imagine anyone wearing eyeliner without having to sit down for an hour or two first. 2) Even if you do wear it correctly, the paint will inevitably rub off after one use (or smear in your case). This is especially true if you have sensitive skin. 3) If you apply too much product on the skin, be sure to become an expert at applying concealer beforehand so that there are no marks left behind. 4) All women know they need foundation.5) (This made me laugh out loud.) 6) Apparently hair is covered by makeup as well... Maybe women don't care about their own appearance?7) Why bother putting on makeup then?8) And finally: 9. If you want to conceal acne scars, just use a new set of acne creams every few days.10) I'm not trying to make fun of makeup, I love it! But even though I'll never be able to afford it, I would rather spend my time doing other things than worry about someone else's "beauty" needs. i understand beauty products in general, but i disagree with 1- seriously, everyone should buy some! why waste money when you could save more money by going without make up? everyone knows how self conscious people really are.
