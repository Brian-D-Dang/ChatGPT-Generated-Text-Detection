What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy to speak they're really fighting for - truth vs liesfalsehoods or the powerful who want their viewpoints heard regardless of accuracy (and especially if destructive) over people with a desire that "what we say" actually be objectively accurate in relation what ACTUALLY happened at any given time so those words can have meaning later on down this road -or something like: The whole nine yards being when you present some sorta claim verbatim but make no effort whatsoever toward providing even one shredding bit o evidence otherwise than your own reputation testimony which does indeed stand up well enough under scrutiny...But his name has been washed away by history along wit all records thereof due t having come from someone obviously guilty himself! And therefore every word he spoke was suspect anyway....So there's nothing left..He doesn't exist anymore except I guess "in spirit" thar ever since somewhere around sometime during WW2.....In fact regarding facts themselves none were probably more fictionally challenged nor had less credibility then him......You got me goofing here........I'm outta gas already...C'ya folks
