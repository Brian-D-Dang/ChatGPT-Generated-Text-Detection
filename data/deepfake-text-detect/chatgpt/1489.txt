I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with that, to me it shows the person who disagreed that his ideas aren't worth listening too because they don't match up well with their own views of what will benefit humanity in the long run Ideas shouldn't be decided by majority vote or majority agreement. They should be determined based on whether something makes sense from a practical standpoint or not. For example: Vaccines cause autism isn't true. But I accept this as fact and so do many other people (maybe even more than just "many). There have been studies done about vaccine-autism connection but no one can tell me why vaccines make autistic children and adults worse
