Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, would you do something like this? I don't really understand why people have trouble getting into this field of study. It's just a hobby and some people get bored after the first few years. But... I feel like it should be pretty easy for people out there, especially those with no real work experience in this field. I've seen lots of "off-the-shelf" companies doing this and they're terribly underpaid.
