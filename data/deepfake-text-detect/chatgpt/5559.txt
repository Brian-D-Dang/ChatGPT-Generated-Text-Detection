Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a low number. I would like to see more people's opinions and votes before I offer another. I've been thinking about this for a bit, and I've come up with a few new ideas for the forum, and a couple of different parts of it. I've got a whole lot of suggestions, and I'm thinking I'm going to have to go through and discuss them with the admins, but I thought I would throw them out there in case there were any thoughts or concerns. I'm not sure if I should put them in a new thread, or just post them in this thread, but I'll go ahead and throw them out there here first. I just thought it would be a good place to start. 1. I was thinking of adding a separate section for art and writing. I really want the art section to be more like a gallery and less like a forum. I really feel like the art section has a lot of potential, and I would love to see it turn into something big and great. 2. I also think that there should be a section dedicated to music. I feel like there is a lot of potential for this forum in the music section. I've seen some great bands pop up from this forum, and I would love to see more. 3. I feel like the forum has a really great writing section, but I'm not sure if the writing section and the art section should be separate or not. I'm not sure if people would prefer separate sections, or just one section. 4. I would love to add a section dedicated to roleplaying games. I think this section could turn out really big, and I feel like people would like it. I feel like the roleplaying section would be a great place to discuss and make roleplaying games. 5. I'd also love to add a section dedicated to fan fiction. I think this would be a great place to write fan fiction, and I think it would also be a great place to get ideas and start roleplaying games from. 6. I'd also like to add a section dedicated to fan art. I think this could be a good section to just show off your art and stuff, and I feel like it would be a really good place to start a drawing thread. 7. I'd also like to add a section dedicated to general discussions, like life, school, work, etc. I feel like this would be a great place to ask questions, and for us to just talk about stuff. 8. I'd also like to add a section dedicated to video games. This would be a great place to talk about video games and stuff. 9. I'd also like to add a section dedicated to technology. This would be a great place to discuss and talk about technology. I feel like this would be a really cool section. 10. I'd also like to add a section dedicated to forum games. This would be a really cool section. 11. I'd also like to add a section dedicated to sports. I feel like this would be a really great section to talk about sports, and sports related topics. 12. I'd also like to add a section dedicated to things that don't have a topic, like discussions about music or video games. I think this would be a great place to have discussions about stuff that don't have a topic. I'm not sure if all of these are possible, and I'm not sure if I'm going to go through with this or not, but I just thought I would throw them out there in case anyone has any thoughts or comments. I really want to hear what people think of all of this. I really want to see if I'm going to do this, and what people think of it. I feel like the art section has a lot of potential, and I would love to see it turn into something big and great. I'd also like to add a section dedicated to technology. This would be a great place to discuss and talk about technology. I feel like this would be a really cool section. I feel like this would be a really great section to have discussions about stuff that don't have a topic. I don't think that we would need a separate forum for art and writing. The writing section can be art as well. I think it would be good to have a roleplaying section, but maybe a fanfiction section instead of a section dedicated to fanfiction. I don't know if that makes sense. I think it would be a really cool section to have discussions about stuff that don't have a topic.
