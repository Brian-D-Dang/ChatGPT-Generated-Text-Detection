I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking her husband's name. But I also feel like a guy getting a new last name should be a woman's choice. Oh, and I don't even want to mention that stupid hyphenated last name thing. However, I can't even begin to understand how someone who has the last name of "Robertson" decides to give their kid a last name of "Turkey." Yeah. Turkey. You know, I'm sorry, but I just can't.
