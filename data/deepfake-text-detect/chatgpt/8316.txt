There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: I should note that this kid had been disruptively noisy up until then; he wasn't doing it because there were dinosaurs in front or behind him (whereas before and after his noise level remained normal). I wonder if anyone else has ever seen something like what happened with me here?
