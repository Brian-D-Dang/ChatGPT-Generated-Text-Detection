So, I saw a commercial today about a pill that helps with BED, and I did a bit of quick research on it. From what little research I did, it seems like the best way to treat this is through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which has been around for decades if not centuries. I feel like I know more than my doctor sometimes because he only talks in terms of meds (which are very helpful at times) when we discuss treatment options...and doesn't mention anything else. He refers me to things online but they're all mostly written by people who have never had chronic insomnia themselves nor do any sleep studies themselves so their "cures" as well as information can be skewed greatly. So, just wanted some thoughts from actual experts here! Thanks!
