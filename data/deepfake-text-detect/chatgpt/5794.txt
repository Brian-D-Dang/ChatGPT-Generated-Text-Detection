I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. The fact that I believe that makes me a bad historian. We were fighting for life and freedom against a monster of destruction. We won the battle. But the war was lost. I made this conclusion after I read an interview that Henry Kissinger did with the American Prospect magazine (available here). I think that the interview is quite good, but it is not the point. The quote in the title of this post is at the very beginning. I think that it pretty much sums up the disastrous consequence of the victory in Europe that is the Cold War, even if the quote does not express it very well: When I read the interview, I came to the conclusion that the loss of Germany is one of the major contributors to the decline of the United States. As the interview goes on, Kissinger explains that the United States should have focused on winning the Cold War, because we did not really lose it on the battlefield. He writes: One of the interesting developments after the war was that the United States became the dominant power in the world. One of the reasons was the result of the war. It was the first time in history that a democracy had been victorious over a totalitarian system. In some ways, we brought to an end the idea of a totalitarian system, and that made our position more secure. But as we proceeded into the Cold War, we made the mistake of believing that the Cold War was a struggle of ideologies. In fact, it was a struggle for power, and power is always a dangerous thing in the hands of any government. I believe that Kissinger has hit on an important point. I do not think that the Soviet Union had a chance of winning the Cold War, at least in the long term. But even the Soviet Union was able to extract concessions from the United States. It is my opinion that, had the Soviet Union actually been a good neighbor, the United States would have been able to help them after Stalin died. We could have even helped them in the long term. But it is also clear that, had the Soviet Union been a good neighbor, the Soviet Union would have become a lot less powerful. That is not to say that the Soviet Union could not have become a great power, but I do not think that it would have ever become a superpower. That is where it should have been. But instead, the Soviet Union was a monster and a potential threat to the United States, and the Cold War made it a threat. As the Cold War proceeded, the United States lost more and more of its power. By the time the Cold War ended, it was clear that the Soviet Union was not going to be able to survive. The Soviet Union was not a great power, and the Soviet Union was never going to be a great power. In other words, the United States was always going to be able to dominate the Soviet Union, at least if the Soviet Union had not killed so many of its own citizens. The Soviet Union would have been crushed by a capitalist world. But the Soviet Union had a communist economic system, and the Soviet Union was not going to be able to compete with the capitalist world. The Soviet Union had no idea that it could not beat the United States. The United States was not going to be able to compete with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was able to compete with the United States, so it believed that it could beat the United States. The Soviet Union had massive armies, and the Soviet Union was not afraid to use them. The Soviet Union had the ability to launch a nuclear strike on the United States, and it actually did launch a nuclear strike on the United States. But that did not make the Soviet Union great, and that did not make the Soviet Union a superpower. The Soviet Union was not a great power, and the Soviet Union was never going to be a superpower. The Soviet Union could not compete with the United States, and it was too afraid to compete with the United States. The Soviet Union had too many problems to compete with the United States. The Soviet Union was facing economic difficulties. The Soviet Union was facing political difficulties. The Soviet Union was facing military difficulties. The Soviet Union was facing all of these problems, but the Soviet Union still believed that it could compete with the United States. But the Soviet Union was not able to compete with the United States. That is how the Soviet Union ultimately lost the Cold War. The Soviet Union was too afraid to compete with the United States. The Soviet Union was too afraid to go toe to toe with the United States. The Soviet Union had no chance to compete with the United States, and the Soviet
