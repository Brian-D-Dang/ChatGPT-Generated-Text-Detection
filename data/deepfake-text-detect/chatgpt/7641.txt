A potential counter-argument against the opinion that all tobacco products should be illegal is that the government should not restrict personal liberties and choices. Many individuals believe that adult individuals have the right to make their own choices and decisions regarding what they put in their bodies. Furthermore, tobacco products generate significant tax revenue and a complete ban would result in the loss of revenue, which would be difficult to replace. Additionally, an illegal market for tobacco products may emerge, which would be more dangerous and harder to regulate. Therefore, although tobacco use can have negative health consequences, a complete ban on tobacco products is likely not a viable solution.
