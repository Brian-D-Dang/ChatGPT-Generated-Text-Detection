As a gay man, I can be extremely wary of other people for my own protection. I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate others because it's "too big" or too small. It might have something to do with your relationship with heryour family (or whatever) and how you feel about them having children. I get this too but I don't think there are any principles in life that will make me an aggressive person. I just want someone who has no need to hurt anyone. I know that the whole world seems weird at times but sometimes when it does happen, including me, I'm terrified and I need space
