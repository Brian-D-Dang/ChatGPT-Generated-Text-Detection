I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it It's the oldest profession"; "we should have full rights to our bodies don't wash with me, I'm not convinced it should be legal. But, firstly, I have to be honest and say that I don't care if a grown woman wants to whore herself out for money. This is between her, her conscience, and her family if she has one. Secondly, I have to say that I do think that it should be legalised. The arguments against it - that it will encourage other prostitution, the corruption of our youth, and the general idea of it being unethical - are really not very good. The first thing is that it won't encourage the underage to go into prostitution. As I understand it, there are already laws and organisations in place that prevent underage prostitution. No-one in their right mind would hire a prostitute who was underage, so it won't happen. And, even if underage prostitution became legalised, the average whore is going to be more concerned with their safety than their clients. Thirdly, and, for me, most importantly, it would be great to have some of these women under the protection of the law, rather than the protection of their pimps. There are a lot of women, and children, in situations that are bordering on slavery. I know that prostitution is not the only industry that is bad for its workers, but it's the one I've read the most about, so it's the one I'm going to focus on. The classic case of the "bad" prostitute is the one who has been coerced into the line of work. She's had her passport taken away by her pimp, she has no money of her own, and, as far as she knows, she can't do anything about it. The pimp then holds her over her head - that is, she thinks that she can do something about it - by threatening to tell her family about her "occupation" or to tell the authorities that she is a prostitute. He has a lot of control over her. So, if prostitution were legalised and regulated, that would all change. Prostitutes would be able to come forward and say that they were forced to do what they were doing. Pimps would not be able to threaten to tell her family or to tell the authorities because they would be breaking the law. Prostitutes would have the opportunity to earn a decent living, to not be threatened, and to be able to move on and start a new life. While the idea of the legalisation of prostitution isn't a new one, it's not actually that controversial. In fact, the idea of legalising it was first proposed as long ago as 1977. It was also in the 1970s that the idea of the Swedish model of prostitution was introduced, where prostitutes are allowed to work, but the brothels, pimps, and the johns are all illegal. The intention of this was to create a safer working environment for the prostitutes. I believe that the legalisation of prostitution would be a great thing. I believe that women should have the right to sell their bodies if they want to. I believe that it would be safer for the women, who would be protected under the law, and for the men, who would be protected from the disease that has been passed on by the prostitutes. I also believe that it would make life easier for the police, who would be able to confiscate the earnings of the prostitutes to pay off the fines and, if necessary, help to pay for their rehabilitation. I think the argument against legalisation is a really dumb argument. Prostitution is going to happen, it's been happening for centuries. It will happen whether it's legal or not. The current situation, where it's illegal and thus unregulated, just means that the police and the prostitutes have no control over the situation. The problem of the underage and the pimps is not going to go away because prostitution is illegal, and, if anything, it will get worse. I think that the moral argument for legalisation is just stupid. So, I'm going to move on to another one - that of the economic argument. Legalising prostitution would make it easier for the women to leave the industry. In countries that have legalised prostitution, the women are less likely to want to go back to it, because it's not very lucrative and is more trouble than it'
