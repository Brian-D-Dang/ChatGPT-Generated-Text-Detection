While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems. I believe that science and religion are two separate things; they both contribute in some degree to what is happening in this world today, but it is for us all to take into account when we come across them. The last time humans came together in a cohesive 'community' was on Christmas Day. We had 8 days of focused prayer, worship and debating; there were 6 million people worldwide. That year felt like it had been 5 years since we got up, started praying and praying again in church before heading out to dinner with my family. Now, I think humanity has gone back to 47633, while the world's population grew by 250 trillion. But let me tell you something - if you really want to celebrate Thanksgiving, do not build your own turkey. It will just make you look foolish! Nature and politics can clash at times, because what happens after a storm has passed (which doesn't always happen), cannot always be resolved as soon as possible. Our culture hinges upon these same principles of unity, tolerance and love. But, aside from those two qualities, it's probably more important to focus on how we may fall short of achieving peace and harmony - so that we may enjoy eternity together.
