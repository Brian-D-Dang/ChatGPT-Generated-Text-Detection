I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. It's not that I'm drinking less caffeine, it just seems that I don't enjoy it as much as other people seem to. Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of San Pellegrino, and drink it whenever possible. But regardless of how you feel about coffee in general, there is no denying that they are delicious.
