I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several breeds of dogs and they can be very docile really sweet and wonderful companions but still not good as guard animals or babysitters (yeah we had our friend's puppy while he was away on vacation). You're talking to someone who has never lived in fear that their child will get hurt playing outside alone by other kids... Maybe it would help if your acquaintance knew the context?
