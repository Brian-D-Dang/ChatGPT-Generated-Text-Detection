So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern societies grew out and are dependent upon Christianity in some form or another (and most still do). I know many people will say that's not necessarily a good thing it might've been better if we never had any Christians at all... But without them there wouldn't even exist our current society! We live today because they decided NOT TO BURN PEOPLE FOR THEIR RELIGION back then when asked by those who were burning others alive just-because-. And yes you're correct; atheism is only practical as far social structure goes - no one really trusts each other unless everyone believes something common enough so hostile acts can take place with impunity versus shamingblame being applied directly onto individuals rather than an abstract ideology like God religion etc which makes cooperation more viable since punishment doesn't need physical evidence anymorethink about how much crime has gone down over time compared historically speaking..it would seem impossible otherwise given what your saying:) Also regarding 3: You don " t believe someone should pay taxes? Or does paying tax make him different from anyone else he pays his bills too?? Have these exchanges made sense thusfar? If necessary please tell where i went wrong:D Good luck!
