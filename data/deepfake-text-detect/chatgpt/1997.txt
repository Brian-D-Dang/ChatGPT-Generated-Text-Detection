Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as a distinct entity from the rest of their website, it's not so bad... but they've been playing with fire for years now by mixing stylecontent on all pages (e.g., regular articles mixed with quizzes). The Washington Post is way worse about this.
