This is something that's always bothered me, all the way back to when I was a kid. I never understood why it was considered polite to say "bless you" after someone sneezes or coughs - and if we really are supposed not add anything extra in our prayers (which makes sense), then what on earth does this mean? Is more power somehow better than none at some point during an illness of any kind?? That said...even though there isn't much scientific proof for these things as far-reaching superstitions go,...I've been doing my best lately!:)
