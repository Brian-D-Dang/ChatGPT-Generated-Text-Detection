Let me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers for not giving a damn about the gameplay being nice, but they did deserve credit for making it fun and engaging to play. I bought the game on Monday because it was free. Most of the time I'm going to pay 10 more for an expansion I didn't want to spend money on during the week when there were SO many other things going on in my life. That said, I'll be honest and say I'd rather get some CoD for free just so I can play BF4. It's still free as heck.
