The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustratedcritical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single people and those who don't want children might feel like spoiled brats if they don't get their way - so would the women returning from pregnancy leave a man alone with no need for affection? In fact, our culture has very different expectations than what I just described above. It expects us to be emotionally available at all times. The guy can have sex whenever he wants; it doesn't matter how tired or ill-prepared he may be, as long as his partner meets him halfway by being ready and willing anytime of day or night (without needing an explanation). This means being open 247 - not only about sexual availability but emotional openness as well: you must always be looking for ways to show your love. Not because we expect men to actually do something worthwhile with that love every single second, mind you, but because we think it's up to them whether or not they choose to take advantage of it. Being unavailable should never result in feeling lonely; on the contrary - because you're supposed to put yourself out there in order to win over another person. I've seen too many good opportunities go down the drain when someone was married one moment, engaged the next, and then went back to 'being' either broke, divorced, or dead before finally deciding to settle on'single'. In my opinion, falling into poor choices due to loneliness shouldn't even be considered a choice anymore - it's simply insurmountable fate. As far as I'm concerned, anyone who creates such conditions around themselves and ends up unhappy therefore deserves exactly what happens to them. They also deserve whatever consequences follow along. Now, maybe I sound harsh... and admittedly, perhaps some of that sentiment comes across in part 2. But it boils down to this simple truth - compassionate people recognize that life can sometimes make bad decisions impossible to correct, regardless of intent. And while giving folks the benefit of the doubt isn't easy in any circumstance, it certainly gets easier when circumstances aren't self-made. If someone falls through the cracks and winds up living among wolves instead of staying home amongst friends, then heshe makes no mistake deserving of misfortune. There are plenty of options for finding happiness - why limit oneself to merely seeking out those things compatible with the standard American Dream after working hard enough to reach its promised land? So Why Is My Love So Unrequited? Love songs were created to comfort lonesome souls longing for connection beyond mere physical attraction. These romantic ballads remind us of our desires, and give great hope for future romance...but usually without much realistic expectation of results. Nobody tells us straight out "Your boyfriend will dump you if you refuse to sleep with him again tonight!" - though some songs could come close to hitting that mark...if the lyrics didn't contain more subtle clues pointing towards rejection rather than acceptance. No songwriter worth his salt ever asks outright "Will you stay with me forever?" After hearing dozens upon dozens of songs made famous during the course of pop music history, that question seems almost ridiculously naive. Yet, despite its widespread prevalence throughout popular media, it's still pretty rare to find real answers to those questions anywhere else.That said, if the answer is sometimes obvious most often, true love waits until death does its work - and other times, it takes longer for the relationship to grow to maturity before budding feelings blossom into action. When two people agree to spend time together, both parties typically envision using that same opportunity to progress to the next level which really covers half the dating world right there. For better or worse, relationships tend to form slowly, growing naturally over years rather than months. As time goes on, various aspects of society begin pressuring individuals to meet certain goals within a specific timeframe - marriage, high school diploma, kids, etc. We tell ourselves these goals will help tie everything together nicely once achieved, making sure nothing will fall apart later. However, when it doesn't happen fast enough, the pressure becomes immense, leading to frustration, anger, and insomnia. Things seem to spiral downward from here ...and suddenly, a couple is in bed together, wondering where to go from here. Where did the romance, passion, lust gone missing? Often, couples become annoyed with each other - or disenchanted, bored, or otherwise dissatisfied when the situation calls for new adventures.It's important to understand that emotions vary greatly between individuals. Perhaps your friend knows she'll marry her husband someday, but you know you'll probably end up spending the rest of your days sky diving solo. Such differences exist in relationships everywhere, and should not automatically lead to divorce. A healthy couple can weather storms no problem. Furthermore, struggling singletons who remain loyal to their partners can survive anything short of actual death. However, if attachment feels forced, disappointment grows exponentially, adding up to becoming a potential salvation. Life termination requires a goal: now is the condition itself. Attractive persons agree to either possible loss there anyway. PM.
