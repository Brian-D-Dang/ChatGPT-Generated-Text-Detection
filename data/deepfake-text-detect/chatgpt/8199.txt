This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point here isn't to criticize all such kind of argumentation as unthinkable and wrong but rather just pointing out an important feature about how we sometimes make them when they represent something like "the natural conclusion." In this case your specific counter example seems pretty good (I agree with it). No one can reasonably claim everyone who calls himself Christian must believe in reincarnations - this would drag Christendom down into Hinduism levels from where Christians had managed so far not even reaching! However there will always seem some other permutation possible because Christianity doesn't really restrict itself on believing anything at any time - except maybe God's existence which has its own set complexity problems given our lack thereof knowledge concerning himher etc., though those aren'nt quite relevant right now either...
