Would you go to Enterprise and rent a car for 24 months? That's very similar to what a lease is. 1. Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, does not advise renting or leasing a car. She recommends buying a used car for cash. 2. Renting a car for 2 years is a long time and may end up costing you more than you bargained for. You'll be paying for the car for the entire 24 months, even if you don't use it, and you'll also have to pay for insurance, repairs, and maintenance. There are better options out there.
