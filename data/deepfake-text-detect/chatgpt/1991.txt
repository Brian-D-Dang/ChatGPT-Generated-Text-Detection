Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from when i was around 6 or 7 years old), and like many playersathletes in sports at that age, there is one thing almost every player does without fail: they begin using steroids either before their pre-teens, during their teens, or early on into adulthood for performance enhancement purposes. I do however believe this kind of behavior has become very common amongst young athletes across all regions worldwide nowadays...and it's sad....especially considering how much physical development occurs between ages 12 - 18. Kids body's change so drastically from those ages! But everyone uses them because big muscles good right? And these are kids who think no harm can come with such use even if you know nothing about drugs what so ever.....but then again most people don't really care until something bad happens to someone close too them regardless of any knowledge they may have had beforehand anyway....so yeah........just wanted some other peoples thoughts cause its kinda interesting stuff....
