White girls very rarely date Asian men. Even in Asia white men are much more popular than Asian men. Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white girls, they are likely to be rejected due to cultural and social norms. That said, it is possible to find successful relationships between Asian men and white women if both parties are open-minded and willing to communicate.
