One counter-argument is that human labor cannot become as redundant as horse labor because humans have the ability to learn and adapt to new skills and technologies. While horse labor became obsolete with the onset of the Industrial Revolution and the rise of machinery, humans have been able to continually learn new skills and move into different professions as technology has advanced. Additionally, there are certain jobs, such as those in healthcare, education, and creative fields, that require human interaction and emotional intelligence, which cannot be effectively replaced by automation. Therefore, while some jobs may be automated in the future, it is unlikely that human labor will become completely redundant.
