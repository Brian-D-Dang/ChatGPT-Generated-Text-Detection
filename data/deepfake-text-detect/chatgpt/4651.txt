I like Bernie, love his politics in fact. I doubt there is a politician I agree more with. I like the fact that, unlike most politicians, his rhetoric matches his actions and policies are actually pretty progressive, while he has charisma, oratory skills, if you prefer; style over substance as our saying goes. You might not know me but it's all on here: My opinions of Hillary Clinton however, have changed drastically since 2008 after watching her run for president at least three times (once against Obama she was untouchable) and what has happened between John Edwards' death in August 2007 until today when we learned last week about Bill peddling sex toys to prostitutes from back in during their affair. That was then, this is now? A tale told by an idiot..., anyone who can believe anything they read in tabloids etc? The story came out via Wikileaks along with other government documents about the U.S.'s foreign policy. Now let's look at some of these rumors surrounding both candidates in terms of possible causes and evidence leading up to each candidate being elected. Looking at how things were done can give insight into why and how it could happen again even though polls indicate voters do not trust either one enough to make them President. We'll start with Obama because those close to him tell us he will win re-election. It would be nice to see him proven right! If the following information leads anywhere maybe someday the truth will come out before another election takes place and someone else gets elected under false pretenses to become POTUS. The first time around did no one think Hillary had any chance winning? She didn't seem too interested in getting involved unless it benefited herself financially or politically; perhaps that explains her change in attitude toward the Sanders campaign. As far as Bill goes, I wonder if she knew something was going on and didn't want to risk losing whatever influence she may still possess among pundits and other influential people who also play golf together including Warren Buffett and David Rockefeller. This reason alone looks suspiciously political to me. Maybe Bill really did fear public outrage should they find out he had been having affairs. He grew up Catholic so perhaps he feared hellfire for sinning. In researching Hillary's failed marriage with Marc Mezvinsky (while he ran Mezvinsky Capital), a former business partner said he thought Bill used gay prostitution rings to pay off women. They say money always talks and everyone knows Bill loves big bucks and big cars. Perhaps he found himself caught up in blackmail. Or just realized many others were doing it. And it worked, he got away scot free despite knowing full well immoral behavior wasn't acceptable in the company where he worked. Let's keep looking. Here is a list of various factors contributing to certain outcomes which differ greatly based on whether you're Democrat or Republican. Hope your thinking process is fair and honest without bias. 1.) "Did Republicans do everything possible to ensure victory?" No. Even with Ralph Nader throwing the 2000 Presidential race into limbo Democrats were able to retain control of Congress, hold seats previously held by Nixon and Ford, and had George W Bush defeated Al Gore in Florida, outnumbering the 2000 votes cast, Al Gore may very well be sitting in the Oval Office today. We saw similar results occur when Democrats gained more than 60 of House and Senate seats following Reagan's landslide reelection in 1984. To quote Michael Moore, "But when it comes to elections, they only steal 'em." 2.) Was voter fraud committed? Absolutely yes although they deny it and state it never occurred. On November 6th 2000, ballots were counted within days showing Kerry winning rather than Gore taking office due to two counties refusing to count 3rd party votes. These same voting machines were used during elections across America every few years with little concern shown after reviewing security issues regarding electronic voting systems designed using inadequate standards, lack of audits, lack of transparency and non-existence of laws mandating secure standardization. If you didn't already suspect it probably says alot about the integrity of American democracy as it stands when our own federal Government does not enforce its own regulations yet insists anyone trying to reach citizens outside the country must comply with these rules or face severe punishment. While speaking in Tonga, SADC (Southern African Development Community) Commissioner Dr Peggy Kaawa stated, "Voting machines need better protection - otherwise they leave themselves open to manipulation." In 2010, National Ballot Integrity Network filed suit alleging ballots from 29 locations were rejected improperly meaning millions of dollars worth of federal funding for states went unaccounted for because officials did not follow proper procedures. All but 1 of the 39 counties participated in voter suppression activities according to plaintiffs. Voter rolls in Pennsylvania were purged in 2012, it raised suspicion because prior counts showed higher percentages of registrations in 2012 than 2011. Both major parties took part in vote rigging nationwide such as redistricting to benefit Democratic incumbents.
