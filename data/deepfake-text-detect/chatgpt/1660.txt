As can be seen in [this image] , in most places in the U.S. (and maybe elsewhere that right-on-red is allowed?), it is legal to turn right on red from any direction, so long as you do not impede traffic going straight through the intersection and if necessary make a parking lane clear for vehicles turning left into your business or lot. In this case, I think they are both probably parking illegally even though one was using hisher turn signal. It seems like there's always some kind of conflict between these two laws: what does "right" mean here? It doesn't seem likely many people would expect an illegal turner who wasn't impeding traffic at all but also has no need to wait until the light turns green before proceeding simply because there might be other cars waiting too! Therefore, perhaps we should define where this line lies more clearly...
