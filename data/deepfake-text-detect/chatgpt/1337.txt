First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that certain people should not be locked up for things they did as a child or teen when there is no evidence they ever knowledgably committed these offenses in adulthood. But those two issues aside ... What's so funny about this? This kid was sent away because he served some time at an orphanage foster home where his mother died during childbirth. Now she has been found dead inside her cell 2 days later! He had nothing to do with this crime yet they put him through hell anyway just trying to "fix" him by using other methods instead! And now he gets taken away from everyone who loves him. Tonight on Fox News we have a segment called 'The Exorcist' which promotes belief in demonic possession...and yes, religious leaders like Billy Graham sell fear of evil spirits...so believe what you want but if you don't understand how mental illness can lead kids into bad choices then maybe our current system makes sense after all since these problems stem directly from that mind set...a mentality based more around faith than science.
