There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man who walks around showing his belly? How about a woman who walks around showing her backside? Are they behaving civilly?). This isn't a question of malefemale standards. It's about good manners. The same thing applies to the way the same people behave in public, the difference being that women and children are potential victims of public indecency. There is nothing civilized about walking around in public, whether at work or on the street, with your underwear showing. It's not acceptable behavior, and it's not something to get worked up about. This is not a new issue. It has been around for decades. When I was a child, it was referred to as "underwear hanging out." Women shouldn't be expected to wear bras, but men shouldn't be allowed to walk around with their shirts unbuttoned. It's just common sense. I agree with everything you said! I also hate seeing people walking around with their pants hanging low. They act like its something that just happened to them. Like they can't help it! Also, what about pants with holes in them? Are these people trying to get people to notice their bad fashion sense?! I don't agree with this. We shouldn't have a double standard for how men and women dress. I see women who wear tiny clothes and a bra on the outside of their shirt or women in short shorts or skirts, and I don't have a problem with that. And it's not true that women are less likely to get attention for their underwear than men are for their shirts. I have seen plenty of women who wear short shorts who are showing underwear, and plenty of men wearing shirts with no buttons who are showing underwear. I have to say, I'm tired of hearing people say this is a "man's world" and that women can't succeed as much as men. What happened to my generation? We should be the ones to change this. This is my biggest pet peeve. I'm not a huge fan of ultra short shorts and midriff tops for women. I think it's classless and not very attractive. However, I think it's also unfair to think that women can't be as successful as men in business, politics, etc. if they wear revealing clothes. I think women should be able to wear whatever they want without having to worry about whether or not they're being perceived as "sexy." I don't think anyone should be made to feel bad for how they dress. I agree, Jen! I am sick of hearing the excuses women give for wearing these types of clothes! "I'm just expressing myself" or "I'm not trying to get attention." As if women have no say in what they choose to wear. The thought never occurs to them that men are objectifying them, and the reaction of the guy at the gym is something to be ashamed of. I'm in the middle of this argument. I don't think there should be a double standard, but I think it's important to remember that women are constantly judged for what they wear. I don't think women should have to cover up to be taken seriously, but I've seen plenty of women who have done that to be taken seriously, and it doesn't seem to work. I think the issue is more about perception than reality. I think I have an issue with this one because there are plenty of guys who are not wearing clothes appropriately and it is often the women who are the ones who are reprimanded for not covering up. I agree, it is not right that a woman should have to be covered up in order to be taken seriously, but a man does not have to wear a suit to be taken seriously. If a woman wears a revealing outfit, she will be judged. If a man wears a suit, he will be judged. If a woman wears a burka, she will be judged. If a man wears a burka, he will be judged. There is a double standard, but the double standard exists for both men and women. As far as your comments about women not being able to say no...I agree. I do believe that this is a problem and if a woman does not feel comfortable being pressured into doing something, she should not feel forced to do it. I think the problem is less
