Although I'm conflicted about all aspects of Justice, Inc., I would be happy to see [this kid] rot in a cell for decades. Making examples of people like this is the worst thing you can do overseas." The five men accused of murdering Nixon were sentenced to death on Monday afternoon after a jury convicted them of murder and conspiracy charges last week that put an end to a trial that began March 22nd. Michael Vail MacDonald, Jr., 58, has already served time behind bars awaiting sentencing on manslaughter charges stemming from his involvement with the 2007 slaying of Nixon in Knoxville. MacDonald was arrested Sunday morning following a search warrant at his home where he killed Nixon by setting fire to the home's front porch roof during a robbery attempt three days earlier without cause or provocation. A reward amounting to 250,000 awaits MacDonald if he successfully completes an appeal. MacDonald faces up to life imprisonment if convicted. Regardless of whether MacDonald conspired with Nixon, his lawyers have said they plan to appeal the verdict. MacDonald contends the jurors' decision to convict him should not apply because it conflicts with his convictions against others who committed the crime. MacDonald claims his accomplice was a fugitive from justice when he murdered Nixon. MacDonald argued the jurors wrongly believed he escaped justice claiming he had been spared jail time based solely due to his own guilt over the death penalty conviction. MacDonald says he made the decision to kill Nixon due to his desire to protect his family while protecting his reputation as a convicted murderer. MacDonald also claimed Nixon encouraged him to commit the crime knowing he wouldn't face conviction unless he confessed to the crimes. MacDonald has appealed the jury's guilty verdicts to the Nevada Supreme Court but the case remains unresolved until MacDonald requests appeal before the appellate court. MacDonald will likely seek a new trial later this year since his attorneys did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening. McDonald's attorney declined to discuss MacDonald's motives regarding his client's acquittal. Fellow defendant Lester Goodman has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charge along with MacDonald. Goodman told reporters afterward the trial resulted "from injustice" when MacDonald admitted killing Nixon through a deposition transcript obtained by prosecutors. MacDonald is seeking 25 million for his legal costs related to an oral argument he gave last February versus MacDonald, a claim MacDonald denied saying he could not afford. MacDonald maintains Goodman acted alone prior to the shooting. MacDonald says he believes MacDonald did everything possible to save his daughter from a brutal attack, along with other witnesses including his son and dog. MacDonald says he left his daughter unattended inside when the gun fired near Nixon's home Saturday night so the gunman couldn't harm her. MacDonald testified that he choked Nixon into submission using the pistol he used to kill the two-story home. MacDonald claims he tried repeatedly to stop Goodman from slashing Nixon's throat several times and later saved her life by holding her down till police arrived. MacDonald relies heavily on information from another witness who said Goodman did not provide any details surrounding the incident involving Goodman. Prosecutors say MacDonald fatally shot Nixon seven times outside Nixon's home just weeks after Goodman was acquitted of murder charges stemming from a 2005 robbery attempt. MacDonald moved into Nixon's home shortly afterwards under false pretenses according to evidence presented during his testimony. MacDonald says Goodman called police and confronted him around midnight Friday night with a knife aimed toward Nixon's head, threatening him with a knife and telling him Goodman was responsible for killing Nixon more than 100 miles away. MacDonald allegedly overpowered Goodman and assaulted him with the gun before MacDonald grabbed Nixon's shirt collar button covering Nixon's mouth and held it out for police officers to remove from his arms while he lay dying. MacDonald claims Goodman acted alone. Nixon's widow, Donna Sternberg, sued MacDonald for defamation alleging MacDonald sexually harassed her between 2010 and 2016. Sternberg alleges MacDonald attacked her emotionally and physically abusing her throughout their marriage. Sternberg filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging MacDonald's innocence pending review of his sentencing citation. MacDonald appealed his conviction further denying Sternberg's allegations, arguing Goodman didn't cooperate with prosecutors despite being present when the shooting occurred except when police showed up to investigate the shooting. MacDonald denies wrongdoing. MacDonald also argues Goodman violated his rights by testifying against MacDonald's wife, whom he knew had committed suicide. Goodman was acquitted of a second felony count of aggravated battery against MacDonald earlier this month.
