After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read about 50 of all fiction currently published in English, for instance; no one ever reads it because there's not enough real life behind the pages (or something like that). I find this contradictory statement to be a bit more complicated than you make out. The idea is not just that "real life" doesn't exist on the page but also that a novel can't have more insight into its subject matter than what we already know - and thus isn't useful as an educational tool or as a literary work. You're right when you say that some people do actually read them: they are selling well. But why? What exactly does their existence imply about us? And how much more important is the truth behind the fiction to reality? You might want to look up The Cult of Reading. It was written by an Italian journalist in 1967 who noticed that everybody he knew thought reading novels was boring, although if he asked them how many hours they spent per week on what they considered to be pointless reading (TV, newspapers) they'd tell him they spent way too much time doing so. Then he decided to put the question to himself and try writing a book without any other purpose apart from entertainment. He did, however, offer some pretty interesting insights about his experience and wrote a best-seller several years after publishing that book called La cultura delle lettere The Culture of Books. His point of view was that while most literate people will spend at least 10 minutes each day on reading - to him, that's an average of 15 hours a month, nearly 13rd of the year - the majority of these readers only read very short works (less than 250 words long), which, he argued, were necessary for our survival. This kind of "boredom," he said, is caused by young people living too much in another world, one where cultural references aren't strong enough, meaning social life seems duller and less meaningful. In contrast with novels - which generally give us information or inspiration, rather than simply reinforcing old ideas - short stories provide us with realistic experience and help shape our opinions about things: even though they take place in the past, for example - they illustrate how people can behave in today's society. They also serve as an ideal vehicle for discussing current events and offer us insight into the thoughts and feelings of people far removed from ourselves...and yet still part of the same human family. There's really nothing wrong with reading these little gems every now and then.
