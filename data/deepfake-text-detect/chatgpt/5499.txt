I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that it is not her fault but that it should be our responsibility to protect rapists. For those who believe this, I suggest you look elsewhere for evidence so they don't feel guilty because their victim's life fell apart after being raped or murdered under a negligent driver (if there are no witnesses). But your impulse doesn't exist as long as you're doing the wrong thing made you accountable for what happened to her. Because we know that you'll always come across people like this when you focus on protecting women from themselves? You may have thoughts such as "it was my fault":)
