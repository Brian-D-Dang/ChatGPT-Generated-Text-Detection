I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural experience. Well, it's the same with me and the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. The Samsung Note 4 is a phablet and I can't really call it a smartphone because it has a large display. I think it's better to call it a phablet. But the problem is that we don't really have that many phablets in the market. The Google Nexus 6 is the best phablet in the market but it's a Google product. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is the best phablet that Samsung has ever created and the best in the market. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is available in 3 different variants. The one I'm using is the ATT variant with 32GB of internal storage and 3GB of RAM. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is really a very good device and it's really amazing in all aspects. Samsung has really become the best Android manufacturer and Samsung's mobile division is really a force to reckon with. Samsung has really made a lot of improvements with the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and this is definitely the best Samsung has ever made and it really feels so good when you hold it. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is a phablet so it has a large display. The 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display really looks amazing and it looks better than the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The display has a 1080p resolution and the colors look really good. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is the first Samsung phone to have a 2560 x 1440 display. The display is really sharp and the colors look great but it's not that bright. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has a Quad HD display which is also known as a 2K display and this means that the resolution of the display is 2560 x 1440. I'm not sure if it's a big deal but Samsung has really made it a big deal. The 2K display is really good and the colors look great. The 2K resolution has 386 pixels per inch which is more than the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the LG G3. The display has a 16:9 aspect ratio and the display is really sharp. The display has a brightness of 531 nits and the brightness level is much higher than the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the LG G3. The display is really good but I don't think that it's as good as the Google Nexus 6 which is also 2K resolution. The Google Nexus 6 is also a 5.96-inch phablet but it has a bigger display than the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. The Google Nexus 6 has a 6-inch display but the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has a 5.7-inch display. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has a smaller display but the pixel density is much higher than the Google Nexus 6. The Google Nexus 6 has a pixel density of 493 ppi which is lower than the pixel density of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has a pixel density of 518 ppi which is much higher than the pixel density of the Google Nexus 6. The display is really good but the colors aren't that vibrant and they don't pop out like the display of the Google Nexus 6. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 also has better brightness than the Google Nexus 6 which makes it better for outdoor use. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has a 2.5D curved glass display and the glass feels really good. The display is protected by Gorilla Glass 3 which is much more durable than the Gorilla Glass 2 used by the Samsung Galaxy S5. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has a great display and it is one of the best displays I've ever seen in a smartphone. The camera is the best in the class and the camera is really good. Samsung has really made a lot of improvements with the camera. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has a 16-megapixel sensor with optical image stabilization and it is really good. The camera has an aperture of f2
