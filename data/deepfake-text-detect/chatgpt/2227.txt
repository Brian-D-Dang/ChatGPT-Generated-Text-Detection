Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. Whats the real danger of it? I don't think there will be a global catastrophe from small pieces of junk in low earth orbit... but still they do present an increasing safety hazard for satellite operators and astronauts flying at lower altitudes (such as on ISS) who increasingly have to avoid them
