To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, I agree with me when I say it's wrong to have a gay couple marry like this in Ireland alone! That said, I think it should be illegal for such relationships as long as both parties consenting adults who want to love each other. I understand your opinion but you're just trying to defend homophobia by pointing out all sorts of things about homosexuality.
