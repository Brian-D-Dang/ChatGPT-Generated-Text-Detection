I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too big, the mentality is different and as said by some other commenters crime rates are high. The thing about that though isn't really surprising at all when you just look around most Western European cities which have similar demographics to these rural villages. If they were so much better than where we live now then why don't more people want to move there?
