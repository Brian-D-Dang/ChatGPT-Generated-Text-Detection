From The majority of sexual assault are not reported to the police (an average of 68 of assaults in the last five years were not reported).1 Those rapists, of course, have other victims, other women whom they will rape again and again. Rape, of course, is a crime, but how should we understand the situation of men who commit rape? The US Department of Justice says: "The majority of rapists are acquainted with their victims. A small percentage of rapes are committed by a stranger to the victim."2 In the United States, 70 of rapists are acquainted with their victims.3 Those rapists, of course, have other victims, other women whom they will rape again and again.
