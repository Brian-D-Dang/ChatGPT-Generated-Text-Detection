Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as a distinct entity from the rest of BuzzFeed, then you may find it to be a valuable source of information. However, it is important to be aware of the distinction and not confuse articles in the News section with those in the Entertainment or BuzzFeed main sections, which may prioritize sensationalism and viral content over factual reporting.
