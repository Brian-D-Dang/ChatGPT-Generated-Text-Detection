There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of what women want. Just like men, women have different desires, needs, and preferences. Some women may prioritize financial stability and look for partners who can provide for them in the long run, but this does not mean that they only want sex from these individuals. Moreover, reducing women's desires to financial security is an oversimplification that ignores the complexity of human relationships. Many women seek emotional connection, intimacy, and mutual respect from their partners, which cannot be solely attained through money. Most importantly, it is problematic to generalize and assume that all women have the same motives and desires. We should respect each person's unique motivations and avoid making sweeping generalizations about any gender or group.
