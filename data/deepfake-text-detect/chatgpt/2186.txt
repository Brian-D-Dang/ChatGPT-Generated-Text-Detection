You may have seen news that BlackLivesMatter protesters interrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Seattle. I think this was wrong to do, because he has fought for civil rights his entire career and should not be attacked by angry mobs like other candidates would've been in the past. Yeah but hes also done some pretty shady shit too so as someone who's very liberal i don't know how much credit you can give him on this front
