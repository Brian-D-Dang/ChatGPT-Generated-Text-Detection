Although it is true that advancements in technology and space exploration may lead to the discovery of extraterrestrial robots, it cannot be said that they are more likely to be encountered than sentient organic life-forms. The vastness of the universe and the multitude of potential civilizations means there are infinite possibilities for the existence of both types of beings. Moreover, it is possible that sentient organic life-forms may be more advanced and have greater technological abilities than the robots they create. They may also have the ability to conceal their presence or communicate in ways that we are unable to detect. Therefore, it is important to keep an open mind and not make assumptions about the likelihood of encountering different types of extraterrestrial life. Further research and exploration can lead to new discoveries that may challenge our current beliefs and understanding of the cosmos.
