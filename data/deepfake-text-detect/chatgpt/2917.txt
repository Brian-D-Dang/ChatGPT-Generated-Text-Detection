I spend my summer as a representative of the college I attend and interact regularly with kids between the ages of 10 and 18. In these interactions, I have noticed that there is no good way to talk about sex. Sex education in our society is haphazard at best: some students get abstinence-based "education"; others receive health class lessons on STDs (sexually transmitted diseases); still others simply learn from their friends or parents. Despite all the emphasis placed upon civic engagement during high school - and for many schools this includes promoting service learning projects such as tutoring, coaching sports teams, creating art installations, etc. - there remains an important gap in curricula when it comes to teaching teenagers how to be informed citizens who can make responsible decisions regarding matters ranging from voting to sexuality policies in their communities.
