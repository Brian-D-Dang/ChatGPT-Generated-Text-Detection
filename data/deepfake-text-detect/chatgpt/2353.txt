I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think about physics and biology: Imagine there are two different species on Earth with radically different evolutionary histories - one evolved in an environment where gravity was much stronger (let's say Mars) while another had little gravity but larger amounts of food around them so they became enormous creatures which would be similar weight-wise if you compared us to elephants or hippos. But these very large animals have poor mobility and agility because their bones aren't made by evolution to support such massive bodies. That doesn't mean we could not find some mechanism somewhere within ourselves that allowed both ways of life to exist at once; like perhaps our brain has evolved differently from other primates simply through its size being greater, allowing more connections between neurons without needing major changes throughout all of our anatomy. This sort of thinking also helps explain why humans do things like put together rockets when science tells us every physical force inside those devices works against each other except maybe strong nuclear forces? It just means someone adapted something else well enough into usefulness despite everything working against herhim doing so!
