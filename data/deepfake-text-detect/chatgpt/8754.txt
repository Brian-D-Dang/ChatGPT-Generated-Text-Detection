What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy we have to decide if the project of free expression should be pursued (I'm guessing that's a term for you). The problem with this argument is that people always end up being more like you than they really are. The author doesn't just say "This was an opinion piece, my opinion will never change." He says that in essence he understands that there is no objective basis for attempting to make your own opinions what others think or believe. One way to do this would be to say explicitly: "1) I agree with your ideas 2) I am against them 3) I have a similar point to make 4) would it ever work?" That's how I've felt personally about the debate over freedom of speech since the early days of leftist censorship. But like any other issue, we must speak up for ourselves regardless of who we disagree with. One thing I'd offer here is that once something comes along which looks at all our current participation patterns and yet thinks we can't have anything that conservatives prefer or want, we'll see it again. This was exactly the case with the civil rights movementthe people were afraid to show their opposition to slavery and segregation, but when anything comes along that seems to be as much ideological preference and belief in the theory as one might expect in the practice itselfwe need to take up the challenge and demand change! We may lose sight of that perspective now, but we're going to keep fighting and we won't let Conservatives be forced into holding us captive forever. Alternatively, if we did get involved through this struggle, I'd suggest that we try and create a better future for our people; like the famous quote from Dina Chandler: "With each generation passing away, we move backward towards the pause and look ahead."
