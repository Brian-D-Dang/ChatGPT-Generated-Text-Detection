I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying that he was "being a little too political." Perhaps it's in part because people just don't get how political he really is. The point of all these debates are to be entertaining for everyone - not the other way around. And for some, it seems, they're just short-tempered for their own purposes.
