This CMV was inspired by this post: I believe that being obese is a disability. Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out. It's a disability that a person chooses for themselves - they don't choose it because of an accident or disease (such as cancer). I think obesity should be covered the same way people who are blind have their eyesight taken care of in terms of medical coverage and accessibility issues; such things include rails on all chairs so they can always find them without taking off clothing, larger sized public transportation vehicles with adequate room between seats, etc. There needs to be accommodations made at every level from federal government down to local governments if we really want everyone to succeed. If one isn't healthy enough to perform everyday tasks like shopping then how will he ever better himself? Anyone over 300 lbs would not be able to do many jobs let alone run businesses! So now there need to be retail stores built for these gigantic individuals...etc. This country has become too soft. Many people feel entitled and throw tantrums when denied what they "deserve." Obesity doesn't deserve any different treatment than other disabilities. Oh yeah....and no smoking inside buildings either!!! And ban soda machines!! They're just everywhere nowadays even in elementary schools. SMH Here's another idea.....maybe start eating less?! That seems pretty simple to me but hey maybe some folks haven't considered THAT option!? ALSO......don't eat something again until your stomach hurts!!!! Eat only once per day stay away from fatty foodsjunk food!!!!! Stop drinking pop!!!!!!!! My goodness does anyone learn NOTHING FROM THE PAST??? Read about our past Presidents' dieting habits and exercise routines while serving in office. You'll find plenty of examples of successful leaders who lived right, ate well, exercised regularly, and were extremely fit despite having stressful careers and busy schedules. Why did THEY manage to maintain their health all those years ago?? Because they didn't make excuses.......they simply took personal responsibility for THEIR actions instead of blaming others or society for shortcomings. Some may argue that America wasn't nearly as huge back then compared to today where land masses double almost each decade. Well DUH.....how else could it possibly grow unless more efficient means of production came along allowing tons of additional acreage to be put under cultivation???? We wouldn't HAVE any extra space available otherwise since much of 1000 square miles used up worldwide by humans already consists mostly fruit farms LOLOL Reply Leave a Reply.
