To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific need to consume meat for survival. As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or attitudes towards any issue. However, I understand that everyone has their own moral beliefs and values. It's important to acknowledge and respect differences in beliefs while also striving for empathy and compassion towards all living beings.
