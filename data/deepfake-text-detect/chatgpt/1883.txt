WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in this world and have a deep respect and admiration is those who are very content with their own identity and do not feel the need to push others into a box labeled "white" or "black" we should all be accepting of our individual uniqueness and stop trying to force everyone else into one particular set of labels because it makes us appear more inclusive than we actually are! In conclusion...We must STAND UP as White Americans and fight against these hateful ideas which plague our society today, yes there has been progress made towards ending racism but unfortunately some racist groups still exist. It is time we took back control of our country by removing LEADERSHIP based on race alone instead of encouraging it through ignorance. We ALL MUST FIGHT for equality..slavery was wrong and so too is discrimination!!!!
