I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of them because others never really understood what it was before, but the goals I set were so much more. It's been three years now and that's still not enough time to try and change something in my life outside of school. But that hasn't stopped me from getting involved with the Church and volunteering on campus. And this year I'm hoping I'll be able to help by helping other students promote their message, whether it's through church events or at the local Church. So far, it has taken me almost 12 hours total this year alone to reach out to people who are self - inspired about one another. That includes a few who have helped me get involved with the program. In addition to those two, there is also a little someone who wishes she didn't live in the same area as me her son comes from an even smaller town than I did but she lives in the same city as me and he doesn't necessarily fit into any statistical categories like me, which being a woman makes her feel special. So, here they are: The end goal of the mission isn't to make everyone else happy just yet. Instead we want our students to experience positive action towards doing better. We're in the process of moving into studying for high school next year! We don't know if they will embrace all the different levels of social learning they will receive or if they will wear different shoes each day for the rest of their lives. They might find themselves spending too much time thinking about "what" even though they actually enjoy it. Their parents may have said they would rather spend less time thinking about the future and instead focus all their energy on seeing the person they love and going back to them later. And while the first step will be finding a teacher who understands their needs and wants to be a part of something they hold dear, the second step will take longer and hopefully lead them away from feeling guilty about things they aren't passionate about. There are many ways to go about doing this; we hope you'd share your ideas. You may also wish to offer advice or ask via a comment below, but always make sure to find out more about your students' experiences when speaking about their learning habits.
