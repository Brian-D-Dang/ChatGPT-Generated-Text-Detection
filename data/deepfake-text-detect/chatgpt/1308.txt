"Normal" (adj.) Conforming to the standard or common type. By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various'Normal' states of mind. Religious Beliefs and Practices: All religions have something in common; the belief in some kind of supernatural being who provides order after chaos by controlling events on Earth from heaven. The specifics vary, but all those with such beliefs are said to 'fear God.' Thus, we will consider only religion as it relates to its followers' relationship with their deity (ies). For most people, religious faith comes naturally out of childhood years spent attending church services every Sunday morningor even more frequently for many young children. For others, however, this faith must be cultivated through education and study until they come to understand what exactly they believe about God and his role in life. Some students may already know the answers to these questions before entering school, while others decide to put off formal knowledge because it would interfere with other priorities which might take precedence over learning new things. In any case, each person's path toward knowing the answer lies within themselves alone anyway. In addition, not everyone believes in one particular god. Although Christianity has been around far longer than Islam, Muslims had lagged behind until relatively recently when Islamic teaching became sufficiently sophisticated to produce scholars whose writings use mathematical methods rather than cultural ones to solve problems involving divine origins and Heaven and Hell. As long ago as 1900, Karl Marx wrote "There is no God," but today, he seems almost like an old-fashioned theologian returning to his roots! This world changing development attracted millions of religious believers towards Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's austere interpretation of Islamism. We'll now turn to the claims made regarding Allah and Jesus Christ. It was once believed that the two were synonymous (a); henceforth referred to as simply 'Jesus,' although the Muslims still refer to him as the Prophet Mohammed by traditional tradition. However, recent scholarship indicates that Jesus did not exist apart from mythological stories concerning himself created thousands of years later during Christian apostasy and persecution. The same applies to Allah, who also appears in legend among different cultures throughout history. So why does anyone bother believing in either? Many psychologists state that our minds work best if we accept them logically first instead of rushing into conclusions without thinking deeply enough. Therefore, I've included information below along with links where you can read up further yourself. Also, I won't say anything disparaging about your personal feelings here since that could affect how well you grasp the complex material contained herein. Just keep in mind that atheism, just like superstition, originates from ignorance born of experience and culture (b), so please don't let me offend you too much.
