First I think I should make all the clarifications I can. By "true Christian," I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ. Someone who is devoted, committed and dedicated to following God's will on this earth. I am not referring to a person that agrees with or accepts certain moral principles as they are commonly understood in our society today: murder is wrong; rape and molestation are evil acts etc. These are basic human values backed up by science (we have an evolved morality). Also while we don't know everything about the universe yet, it is likely true that some things such as good and bad do exist objectively. It is my opinion there are no Christians. There may be followers of Christianity but no real Christians. A number of them told me they were going to heaven when they died because they had done so much good deeds throughout life. So if you're doing your best to be kind and helpful then how come you'll end up saved? Why would God save you for being good rather than simply saving you from hell? After all he is omnipotent... He could just pull you outta here the moment before death. And what happens after death anyway? Heaven, right? Well why doesn't every decent human being get into heaven automatically? It seems pretty arbitrary to me! If there was really a god....and let us assume that he wasn't evil like most people believe him to be...then wouldn't he want everyone to go to heaven immediately upon dying without having to wait around until Judgment Day which might actually take place during one's lifetime depending on previous actions and beliefs?? How can anyone call themselves a Christian and still hold these views? True Christians follow his teachings closely. They try hard to become more loving and caring towards others. True Christians accept those same morals and ethics even though many of them are under attack nowadays from corrupt forces within modern culture. Many of them are despised for holding traditional religious beliefs. One thing I noticed is that true christians seem to almost feel guilty over believing the truth while those believers that aren't sold out to secularism often appear delusional even hostile against those that speak the gospel according to jesus. This is where many believers mistake religion for something completely different. Religion to me isn't about converting others to listen to your views and opinions. That goes back to what I said earlier. People that claim the name of Christ need to understand that it is their obligation to spread the word not force it down other peoples throats whether they agree or disagree...especially if they disagree strongly enough. The goal of religion must always be conversion through love not coercion..not fear. Religion exists solely to help mankind toward a higher level of consciousness. We've forgotten that simple fact. We got too busy trying to tear eachother apart instead of building eachother together through mutual respect understanding and forgiveness. This whole planet could benefit greatly from millions of churches filled with worshippers singing hymns and praying to whatever god they choose to worship. What better way to show humanity how far beyond petty differences we truly are?! If only all religions taught this fundamental lesson to its members then we'd see less conflict..... "We contend that for a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle." - Winston Churchill Now onto some stuff...............Firstly, one of the arguments given in favour of the existence of God is that he has created the Universe. If he did indeed create the entire Universe then he also created time. Now there has been quite a bit written regarding the nature of time. For example there is theories suggesting that nothing ever existed and therefore anything at any point in history is merely perception as opposed to actual reality. On top of that, there are theories stating that for every second we perceive lasts 10 years in the past. My own personal belief however is based off of Einsteinian theory. Time is relative. That means that something happening at one side of Earth affects another side of the globe instantaneously. In simple terms, one man on the other side of the world perceives things differently to somebody living next door due to the speed of light. When we look across the distances between galaxies, we find ourselves looking backwards in time. As we move away from objects, we slow down slightly and when approaching close we speed up again. All of these facts combine to suggest that despite the passing of time in relation to Earth, events occurring elsewhere occur instantly and vice versa. Of course for the sake of clarity, the statement above pertains mostly to distances greater than that achievable via teleportation or similar technology (such as wormholes)....the farthest distance travelled by anybody walking is roughly 25 km). However we have already seen from Newtonian physics that the closer we travel the slower we process information travelling outwardly, thus effectively slowing us down. Therefore moving near 'light-speed' would render all outside events taking place in front of you instantaneous in comparison to yourself. You essentially experience approaching infinity whereas everybody else experiences pulling.....
