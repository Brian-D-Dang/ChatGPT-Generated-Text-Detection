Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. It is true that throughout Jewish history, Jews have faced persecution and threats of extermination from various societies and governments. From ancient times to the present day, Jews have been targeted for their religious beliefs and cultural differences. One of the most devastating examples of this persecution was during the Holocaust, when the Nazi regime in Germany systematically killed millions of Jews in concentration camps. However, it's important to note that not all non-Jewish societies have been hostile to Jews. In fact, many Jewish communities have coexisted peacefully with their non-Jewish neighbors throughout history. It's also worth noting that Jewish culture has greatly enriched the societies in which Jews have lived, contributing to art, science, literature, and philosophy. While it's important to be mindful of the history of anti-Semitism, it's equally important to recognize the diversity and positive contributions of Jewish people and to work towards creating a more inclusive and tolerant society for all people.
