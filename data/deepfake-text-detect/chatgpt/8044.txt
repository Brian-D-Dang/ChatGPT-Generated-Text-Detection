I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural experience given my upbringing. It can be awkward and it turns out you need practice for years before becoming proficient enough (if even possible) not just in handling them - which should come naturally as they are quite similar with your fingers only longer! During travel one of these utensils may look like an alien device or would go against some cultures' norms; this poses problems especially if travelling around Asia where there's no table service most likely required by law since being seated on chairs without back support isn't good ergonomically speaking:) So what about portable plates? Well first let me mention how we usually serve foods: We put things into bowls then scoop from those containers onto our own personal dinner plate using plastic spoonsforks made specifically designed so handles don't fall off when lifted upwards too far away... This process takes time because people often have other stuff going during meal times besides eating - talking etc., whereas having something set next door makes more sense while dining outdoors anyway - think cafe tables benches rather indoors loo-like environments... One thing leads another though until everyone has their serving ready including veggies salad appetizer crackers breads cheese milk drinks fruits dessert ...then comes drink (es)! Now imagine hitting all dishes sitting right beside eachother yet separate under "one dish" cover...that looks odd doesn' t make any difference between real ones filled w wine glasses water juice jugs soda cups cup calevers mug mason jars honey pots excuses aside here goes nothing Not sure why OpenTable thought its OK giving such funny names amp;x2614;, maybe due saving space
