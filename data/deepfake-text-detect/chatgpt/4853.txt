In the usa gay marraige is always being debated in the media and in politics. Like most controversy in the usa it is assumed that there are only two sides to this issue, which usually means one side is right and the other wrong. In reality however, there can be many correct opinions and positions on a given topic (for example: Should people have guns?). Therefore, if we try to make an opinion based statement about something as complex as homosexual behavior and marriage our position will likely not hold up under scrutiny. The best way I can think of thinking about this is this... We all want what's good for ourselves. That means that when we fall in love with someone else we ask "is their eye-color attractive? If so then how much weight should I put on them becoming my legal spouse? Would I like them more or less if they had brown hair instead of blond? Is their junk bigger than mine? Do you see those athletic abs?? How do they smell after sex? What does he look like naked? Does she feel soft against me like his skin and breasts and ass? Am I ready to get married again by age 30 or 50? etc. People who wouldn't ask these questions before falling in love don't deserve happy marriages because no matter how deep the love is between heterosexual couples there are still things weighing on consciences such as religious beliefs. The same holds true for homosexuals. As far back as i remember, every single person has asked themselves at some point in life "will having another manwoman in your bed become difficult? Will heshe demand too much from me sexually? Has heshe paid enough attention to her appearance lately? Are they willing to share responsibilities equally in parenting? Could I trust himher completely? Etc.. And yet over time we find relationships where none exist but plenty of things stand out as differences. So why would we assume that anyone would commit themselves to anything without seriously considering each others issues? When someone becomes involved romantically they should definitely consider whether they could handle the potential fallout later down the road. For example, male gays often face discrimination in workplaces while female lesbian stereotypes run rampant in society causing serious damage. However, both cases involve two very different situations that may not come into play until years or decades later. Some men also fear getting into an argument with other males in public places since this situation rarely ends well even though physical confrontation is never necessary to avoid fights. Many women prefer monogamy versus open relationships because of fears of AIDS exposure in long term relationships. Others shy away from casual hookups for similar reasons. All of these factors must be considered before jumping into any commitment with another. It is important to realize that relationships cannot always work smoothly regardless of sexual orientation. Always keep in mind that discrimination towards others exists everywhere... just when it doesn't apply to you there are probably dozens of instances when it does. Homosexuality in particular makes taking risks to protect yourself that easy for straight folk. Just take note that everyone else around you faces the same risk! Also, in general interpersonal relations are easier for hetero individuals since typically masculine traits provide better social skills whereas feminine qualities tend to spoil things. Since homossexuality features both femininity AND masculinity LGBT individuals sometimes struggle socially since they appear neither one nor the other. Additionally, bisexual men or woman exist although they are unlikely to choose either gender due to feelings of loss. Moreover, transgendered students are qualified to attend schools across america although few actually do. There is a reason why official statistics show that almost 1of adults self identify as transsexual and transgender despite growing acceptance especially among young adults. Their experiences add nuances to friendships, romantic partnerships, business dealings and parental bonds leading to increased understanding regardless of sexuality or gender. This fact alone encourages greater acceptance of diverse viewpoints in America including those associated with homosexuality. Of course, opposition to sexual minorities remains strong giving rise to laws criminalizing consensual forms of anal sex, oral sex and intercourse even between partners of the same sex. This attitude unfortunately seems to permeate throughout society. Most Americans view homosexuality negatively even with respect to its causes such as mental illness or childhood abuse. Unfortunately, this sentiment extends beyond dating relationships. Gay bashing occurs regularly and includes name calling, verbal assaults, threats of violence, property destruction, vandalism, harassment and murder. Statistically speaking, LGB members experience higher rates of rape, assault, murder and suicide compared to heterosexual citizens. These tragic conditions force many to live underground rather than seek help from family or government agencies. Considerable numbers of homeless kids also spend nights sleeping outside or inside abandoned buildings and vehicles. Although it may seem silly to state this now, with proper counseling assistance, many of these teens find new families in supportive communities. After coming out and trying to establish healthy lifestyles it became apparent that some parents (even fathers) refuse to believe biblically justified prejudices regarding homosexuality resulting directly in alienation of sons and daughters. Furthermore, children enter school suffering from reduced academic abilities and emotional distress. Despite these problems plus problematic clients, Congressional resolution 2 A, two groups of clients are victims of shame that are connected to talk mean 3rd to firm 2
