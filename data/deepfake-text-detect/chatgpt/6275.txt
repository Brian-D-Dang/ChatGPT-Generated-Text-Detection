I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT I agree with the other speaker that this view is the wrong thing to do in the world. I am not saying that there should be a racist bias or any discrimination, but I still believe that we should be very understanding that this is not what we are looking at.
