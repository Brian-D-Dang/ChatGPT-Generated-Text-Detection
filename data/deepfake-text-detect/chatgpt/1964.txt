I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites for certain information (like the highest level of education). Eventually this turned into scraping other sites too; looking up historical records on old buildings, finding out how much power is generated by solar panels etcetera... This led me down some interesting paths: compiling these datasets in new ways so that they are actually useful when visualized or converted back to text format, creating tools which help with the research process like an APIAPI wrapper around existing APIs as well as writing scripts myself using libraries such as scikit-learn., pandas as well as python's own scientific module.. It seemed like quite fun work! So now I want to learn more about algorithms, neural networks etc.. but there seem to be many different programming languages to choose from - not sure what would be best suited towards all those things? Also if anyone has any good books (preferably online) preferably free ones then please let me know:)
