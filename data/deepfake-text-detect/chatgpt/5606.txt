So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern and post-modern (at least) moral systems have as their foundation the idea that certain things are intrinsically good, bad, right, or wrong, but that they're not absolute, and that they are absolute when they're applied in specific situations. For example, I personally believe that killing an unarmed person is always wrong, but that in the instance of self-defense, killing an armed attacker is always right. However, in order for the statement "Killing is wrong" to be meaningful, it must be absolute. If it's not absolute, then what does it mean when someone says, "Killing is wrong, unless you're killing me"? I believe that it is wrong to kill, period. That's the ground of the argument. But then, I also believe that the value of life is a matter of personal belief. I don't think it's possible to apply an absolute value to any human life, because then we're all just numbers. If someone believes that a life is worth more than another, then that's their right. If they think that a life is worth less than another, then that's their right. They may be right, they may be wrong, but it's impossible to say that one opinion is right and the other is wrong, because there is no intrinsic good or bad associated with the value of human life. So, while I may say that it is wrong to kill, I also believe that anyone else's personal moral system is valid as long as they abide by it. It's okay to think that killing is wrong, but it's wrong to apply that value to someone else. I'm with you on this one. I think it's pretty simple. The government, with its huge force, can be the greatest bully the world has ever known. If we, as individuals, are to be able to defend ourselves against this, we must have the right to arm ourselves. When I was in the military, I was trained in how to kill in order to protect my country. When I get home, I'm not to use these skills for my own defense. It's wrong. I would like to be able to defend my home and my family against the possibility of someone breaking in and harming them. People who would want to murder my family and me, have killed my family and me, and are still out there, waiting. I should be able to protect them. I think most of you could not provide a defense for your ideas if you were faced with the actuality of a murderous situation. I'm not going to attack you on this because we all know that you and I are on the same side of this issue and I don't want to disrespect your beliefs. But, the point is, most of you would be very comfortable with the idea of killing someone if it saved your child's life. In other words, none of you would want the decision of when to kill made by the government. You would want to make that decision. That's what we're talking about here. When it comes to the government, you're all on the side of the people who want to take the decision out of the hands of the individual and put it into the hands of a small group who will make the decision based on whatever criteria they choose. You're all for taking the decision to kill out of the hands of the people and placing it in the hands of government. You just want that government to be a better one than the one we have now. But, the real point is, most of you would be very comfortable with the idea of killing someone if it saved your child's life. You are way off base here. You are attributing to people things that they do not believe. I don't want the decision of when to kill made by the government. You would want to make that decision. I never made any such statement. That's what we're talking about here. That's not what I'm talking about here. You are again attributing to me beliefs I do not hold. When it comes to the government, you're all on the side of the people who want to take the decision out of the hands of the individual and put it into the hands of a small group who will make the decision based on whatever criteria they choose. You are also attributing to me beliefs I do not hold. You just want that government to be a better one than the one we have now. I never said that either. You can be as angry
