EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one should "play" the game for its own sake, without worrying about acquiring things like land or wealth beyond basic needs and some physical comfort (i.e., clothing is pretty important). The only reason this might not seem correctvalid from most people's perspectives is because they're being encouraged by society at largeand even many other players!to pursue those ends so that they can become more successful on their servers as well! On another note... what if it would have been possible to trade with NPCs? If we could sell stuff to merchants then maybe there wouldn't need to be such fierce competition between player-run shops since you'd just buy your items elsewhere regardless, while allowing them to make money anyway:O It seems odd how rare gold and silver are too; perhaps trading NPC vendors might also drop useful loot during quests battles so long as no one else buys out all stock beforehand xD That way everyone wins?
