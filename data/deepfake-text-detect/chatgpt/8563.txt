I'm not a cop hater. I like to think I'm a relatively reasonable person but I'm honestly not even 100 sure how I really feel with the constant barrage of posts accusing me of being racist and that it's just so blatantly wrong when my first comment does nothing to help. It is so easy for us to get defensive about it, or at least try to make things more obvious if we call you out. Then again, it might be hard for us to stop noticing, since some people are actually actively trying to deny others' accusations.
