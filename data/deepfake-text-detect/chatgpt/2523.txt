I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. I can easily see myself voting D down the line because of it (not that the GOP has any good ideas when it comes to economics or foreign policy). You're not alone!
