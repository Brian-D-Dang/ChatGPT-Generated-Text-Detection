Theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying doesn't do that. Economic efficiency average happiness: violating the individual rights to be unharmed and leave property alone does not increase economic productivity or result in more average happiness at all times, nor is it the best way of doing so if you consider other costs besides those mentioned above (like brain damage from excessive pharmaceutical use). DarthBen If by "stealing" he means making a copy, then I don't see any problem with him using that word. Many people who are against piracy make similar arguments about illegal file sharing as well - just like many artists say they have no issue selling their work online but object to websites where people upload copies illegally for others to access without paying them royalties. As far as the costbenefit argument goes, there's some really good papers on this out there. The basic gist is that piracy has had either negligible harm or positive benefit depending what studies one looks at [here] (URL0). It seems very plausible that such an activity would drive business decisions toward greater conveniencefreedom of choice rather than extra money. For example, prices for movies might become absurdly high if legal methods became less convenient and pirates were driven underground into downloading things off P2P networks. But when you look at these types of results over time, non-pirate sales end up going down anyway (and the data suggests that most will go back and pay eventually anyways), which seemes to suggest that customers prefer pirating content even though it may hurt certain industries in the short term.
