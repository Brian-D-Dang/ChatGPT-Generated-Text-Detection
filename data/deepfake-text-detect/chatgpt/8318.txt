Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, do the majority of people on this blog talk down and bash everything? If you don't have anything nice enoughgood-enough (I believe these two words may be synonyms) then why bother posting at all??
