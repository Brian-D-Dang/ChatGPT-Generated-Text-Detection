tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to watching the action, no other sport can hold my attention like football does The excitement is that there are more than 7 people on the field (or court) and because of this, they have an incentive to give 100 effort in order for their team to win. It's not so much about the playoffs or Super Bowl, just getting through each week
