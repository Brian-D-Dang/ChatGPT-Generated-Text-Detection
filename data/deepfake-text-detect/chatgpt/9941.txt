Islam ism is not synonymous with Islamic fundamentalism, a movement that seeks to return to the fundamentals of the faith (in the same way as conservative Christians seek to return to Biblical fundamentals). Rather, Islamism is more political and can be used to justify various ends. Salafism - A type of Islamic belief or movement that seeks to emulate the earliest followers of Muhammad in terms of their beliefs and practices. Salafists often reject modern interpretations of Islamic scripture as well as popular Islamic practices such as veneration of saints and shrines.
