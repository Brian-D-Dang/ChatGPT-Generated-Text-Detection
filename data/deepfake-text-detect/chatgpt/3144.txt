Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. I'm sorry, but that is not entirely true. While it is true that anyone can theoretically speak words over a beat, rapping involves a high degree of skill and technique to be executed effectively. It requires excellent timing, dexterity, and breath control, as well as the ability to write clever, meaningful, and relatable lyrics. Moreover, many successful rappers have spent years honing their craft, learning the art of storytelling, and perfecting their rhyming and wordplay. They continually challenge themselves to explore different musical styles, and many successful rappers incorporate social and political commentary into their lyrics. It is also important to note that not all rap is the same. There is a wide range of styles and sub-genres within hip-hop that vary in content, tone, and delivery. While some rappers may prioritize making club anthems or party music, others focus on telling personal stories, addressing social issues, or addressing political issues. Ultimately, rap music, like any other genre of music, is subjective and should be appreciated for the unique perspectives and styles that each artist brings to it.
