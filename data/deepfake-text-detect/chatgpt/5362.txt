The state of Palestine has 4 million people residing within Isreal. The West Bank and Gaza strip together have 6,000 square kilometers of land. The North Sinai Governorate alone has an area of 180 square miles (266 square kilometres) with the city of Tel Aviv being a notable exception considering its size and location; it is located on the Sinai Peninsula which is known as the center of Israel's Arab majority population living in the West Bank including the Gaza Strip. While Israel has never formally recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital since 1948; there are several Palestinian enclaves that lie outside Jerusalem however. The Jerusalem Municipality being one such community is situated between Jerusalem, Hamas-run Gaza Strip and Gaza Strip borders. Israel has not recognised the capital until recently. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is currently leading the Palestine Liberation Organisation in the Arab world had been pushing for recognition to be established before the referendum was conducted by the Jordanian parliament speaker in Bahrain earlier this month despite calls from Hamas leaders to not allow the referendum due to the conflict over Jerusalem. Despite Trump acknowledging the Israeli annexation movement would result in "a great difference between the two States of America and Israel," he said: 'There will always be representatives among us depending upon each other against those who do not recognize Israel as Israel's capital." According to Al Jazeera, Israel also hosted the London School of Economics hosted its first international conference on Palestine last week and said Palestinians were likely responsible for most of the violence during the Gaza war but their actions were isolated incidents caused by political reasons rather than terrorism or lack of support. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has repeatedly called on Israelis to stop supporting Hamas while claiming Palestinian prisoners are stolen lands. But supporters say they should remain united when fighting erupts causing more deaths and destruction at home.
