The likes of ratheism argue that most of the world's problems come from religion, and that a post-religion world would be miles better. As humans, we inherently drive ourselves into groups based on shared beliefs and values, whether they stem from religion or not. Therefore, it is unlikely for a post-religion world to immediately solve all of humanity's problems. Instead, it is important to address the root causes of issues that are currently attributed to religion, such as intolerance and discrimination. Encouraging education, critical thinking, and empathy can help promote understanding and acceptance of different beliefs and cultures. In addition, promoting ethical principles and values that are shared across religions can also help provide a common ground for people of various backgrounds to cooperate and work towards common goals for a better world.
