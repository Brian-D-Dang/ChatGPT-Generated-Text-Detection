I agree with most of Bernie's domestic politics, but foreign policy is a critical aspect of the presidency and I don't think he has what it takes. To convince me , someone else would have to speak on his behalf... That's why you vote for people who are willing to say things like that. It's not just about being able to get rid of Trump (although I do believe he could be) or even "winning," its also about having an opinionposition on issues that matter. Best of luck this year!
