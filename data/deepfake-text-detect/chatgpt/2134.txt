My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered on Twitter: sodonnellphd DangerousPax I do hope you understand why we need to resist "they" (singular theytheir) as a singular pronoun, right? - SevenSaul (SevenSaul1k) January 31, 2016 But how does this strategy play out in practice when it comes down to actual policy writing or even just everyday use by individuals whose language may have evolved over time without any political considerations whatsoever? Note - I am NOT saying one should never ever change their own language; political speech doesn't count here because human beings cannot help but adapt our modes of communication constantly based on what's around us all the time! EVERYONE changes their vocabulary and grammar from generation to generation!! The only question at hand is whether those changes made due purely through natural linguistic evolution ought to be regulated against by government decree. And if so...how exactly?! Now let me begin with an example where my answer might seem obvious: In fact, if someone were to ask me which single word could arguably make more sense than another given English dictionary definitions alone notwithstanding," anyone?) then yes, grammatically speaking there would certainly appear no conceivable possible reason to pick up your pitchfork about replacing it within every law text across America regardless of its age simply because millions upon millions of people already naturally adopt said replacement whenever used in spoken form today. But context matters!!! That former hypothetical seemed too easy though, didn't it?? So now imagine yourself before a bunch of strangers. Do you say good morning sir instead of good evening ma'am??? Well guess what....THAT IS ACTUALLY AN ILLEGAL MIXTURE OF GENDERED PRONOUNS!!!! Let me explain. When using gender-specific second person plural forms in English like thee and thou, both of these possessive pronouns will always refer exclusively towards males unless preceded directly beforehand by the article either woman or gentleman respectively...and vice versa with he and she. To illustrate, take this sentence: "Thee shall learn thy lesson well." Clearly, since the words 'thou,' 'thee,' and 'thyself' occur together such phrase must reference two different persons who share the same property otherwise referred to as being male. Therefore, while referring to oneself indirectly via the third person perfectly acceptable (as indeed happens hundreds of times per day), telling someone else off right after mentioning themselves requires employing female signifiers preceding nouns excepting proper names. Why???? Because throughout history women were historically considered legally subordinate to men henceforth rendering anything ending in -man-woman ambiguous until certain legal constructs changed allowing females equal standing under the law rights along with men themselves. Again, examples abound everywhere including popular culture thanks to recent years bringing forth many films depicting prominent roles assigned specifically toward females e.g. Gone Girl, American Hustle etc.. This sudden uptick has led to widespread confusion among younger generations growing accustomed to mixed gendered situations thus prompting modern society to stop forcing these realities onto youth by removing subtle cues in order to better accommodate whatever variety social background each individual occupies. With regards to contemporary usage however, look no further than television shows such Younger much less Downton Abbey itself wherein characters freely switch between addressing other characters orally solely by masculine designations yet plenty others still residing inside the home invariably fall back into traditional feminine labeling practices depending on circumstance. Much akin to applying shoe polish to leather shoes prior to wearing them outside, old habits die hard especially during long periods away from formal settings and direct influence from surrounding peers endowed with significant leadership positions. At least mentalities don't necessarily change overnight regarding physical attributes associated with genders anyway considering girls continue going crazy trying to emulate Justin Bieber and guys routinely try way harder to tone down their gay tendencies rather than embrace them. For instance, consider the following passage involving note cards displayed prominently behind Hillary Clinton during speeches designed to reinforce her authority despite also making herself laugh courtesy of expressing a bit extra leg muscle on display underneath sheer clothing moments earlier....but wait.....why aren't young boys doing that kind of thing?? The reason is simplesociety continues to force standards unto children to prevent normal childhood curiosity leading kids astray from fulfilling future expectations forced upon adults. As parents ourselves, myself and wifey often agonize over swapping out potentially offensive toys purchased online merely on account of assuming innocent little tykes won't know any difference. Not sure how far things would go once child eventually enters public school environment i.e., introducing biological facts related to reproduction versus pretending nothing exists altogetherboth scenarios affect learning outcomes somehow; Though neither scenario seems really worth worrying about completely banning books written decades ago lest seeing blood spatter get left on pages adds realism to crime novels reenacting events similar to real life accounts portrayed therein versus shutting everything down entirely cuz nobody wants to think there's actually evil people running around murdering everyone indiscriminately sorta thing......anyway moving forward none of this site, (These landing MR and player NN.02... players, 3, v joint haunt submissions, los players - ins -, 5,
