First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and have been for years. But someone's got to hold their own against you when it comes to what happens if you say something like "I agree with him strongly but not enough to change my mind on whether I support or oppose his views." That is just not true at all; I see a lot of people who are determined to be anti-religious and even condemn homosexuality as a sin and therefore they promote Christians and other religious values. It's not a thing where one person says it would make sense to deny others religious freedom. Finally, since we both agree it should no longer be illegal, I will say that there is some difference between saying he doesn't believe in gay marriage, and saying he believes in abortion. While abortion is a rape, that is not really a crime because they don't cause birth defects. So, while I wish I could tell you that I do disagree with your position, I also think it's very important to remember that many activists have worked hard over the last few decades to ensure that their rights were respected so that everyone has equal access to healthcare and education. And I was fortunate to work alongside four wonderful women - and our daughter, who came fourth through sixth grade - to fight to prevent the passage of a law that would make it harder for parents to obtain health insurance. So maybe one day we can really get rid of these laws for good! Comments aren't allowed here without permission.
