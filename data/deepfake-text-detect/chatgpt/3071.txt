Posting on my secondary for obvious reasons I grew up in a extremely abusive house. I dreaded coming home and the site of my mom made my heart skip a beat, god forbid she was happy to see me without makeup or with paint smeared all over my face from some project we were doing at school. There is no way you can fix this other than finding another person who treats you better. I'm sorry that happened to you - it sounds awful!
