"Normal" (adj.) Conforming to the standard or common type. By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various'Normal' states of mind will exist in these people's minds. I am not referring here exclusively and only to normal humans but also to other species as well including some animals like dogs, cats etc... The 'normal-ness', however, must be expressed by their own specific traits which are different from one another. Each specie has its own unique way of expressing this characteristic - they too have their own "normal." A dog for example might show his sense of loyalty through licking you on your toes instead of biting them off. Some horses express it with the speed of their gallop while others do so with their strength; likewise birds fly fast or migrate long distances while still others maintain an even pace. All these examples belong to the same category of expressions called'Cultural Signifiers'.So what does all this mean? It means that each animal acts according to its nature since he comes preprogrammed with such innate behavioral characteristics just like the man who came programmed with certain basic instincts. From birth, most animals follow certain routines which make up part of their culture - meeting its needs in the best possible manner given their respective surroundings. And the fact that every creature shares these routine behaviors shows us that these routines are indeed culturally acquired rather than genetically inherent. By examining our daily lives closely, we see how much technology goes into making any activity become easier or more convenient. For instance, machines help us cook food, wash clothes, drive vehicles, operate machinery, water plants and gardens, detect gas leaks, light up homes, clean out sewers, heat houses, cool houses, monitor radiation levels, aerate soil, sample air, control traffic lights, display advertisements, analyze blood samples, run medical tests etc.... These are not technological advancements made available by God himself but are purely the result of men's ingenuity and skill. Therefore, if somebody claims that a machine did something miraculous (e.g., flying) he would be getting carried away because the alleged miracle was wrought solely by human powers alone. In principle, any entity operating under mechanical principles could perform these actions no matter whether it were alive, dead, sentient or non-sentient. As far as I know today, no living thing has ever performed the miracles described in the Bible unless perhaps the accounts refer to beings previously extinct, e.g., dinosaurs or mastodons. So when someone says that a machine flew or walked down the street without being pushed, pulled, lifted or guided by anyone, then there is nothing supernatural about such feats except the account itself and such stories usually contain embellishments designed to bring attention to themselves and thus enhance sales. This, though, doesn't change anything about the truthfulness of the story. We can say otherwise that those things mentioned above don't require external forces acting upon them or else we'd risk going backward in time where everything happened spontaneously in a mindless fashion - without cause and effect relationships. That, after all, is what science teaches us: Cause Effect. Take note that in all cases, events took place within the universe of reality wherein happenings cannot occur outside such limit. But if we look at the world from an extra-dimensional perspective, it becomes clear why natural laws may seem capricious and unreasonable and further questions arise concerning the rules governing such phenomena. If God exists beyond dimensions - i.e., supernaturally and therefore outside empirical realities - He should create no boundaries to prevent Himself from performing His duties and undertaking activities outside the limitations of space and time. Yet, for reasons unknown to scientific investigators, human life spans often exceed 1000 years whereas reptiles and fish live for hundreds of thousands of years before dying naturally. Such discrepancies call to question whether God really operates beyond dimensions or simply chooses not to use His omnipotence against us mortals. Can God simply ignore us and leave us behind forever? Is He capable of doing amazing things without allowing us to participate? Does He care so little about the fate of mankind that He lets them perish after merely giving them a single opportunity to practice morality and virtue? What kind of divine plan could possibly explain such decision? Why would God allow us to continue existing at all? Couldn't He have created something magnificent for us in the first place from the beginning of time without having to wait till now? One possibility is that God didn't want to play favorites among creatures in the vast ocean of existence. Perhaps He wanted to save both good and bad souls alike until later times when everyone will share the same destiny regardless of behavior during their short period of earthly existence. Nevertheless, that explanation seems absolutely implausible. Another issue involves the omnipresence aspect of God that is, His ability to physically touch and communicate directly with every living soul everywhere simultaneously. Supposing God existed and had this capability, He would surely act according to logic and rationality if left free to exercise His power however He chose to deem fit. Since the purpose of computerised characters coming across players and potential users of the worst case scenario, that idea!
