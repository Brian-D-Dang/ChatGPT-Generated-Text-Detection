Throwaway account, my main is used for school. I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She lives in another state, but we'll be married next year. Favorite foods: sushi, pizza, anything I'm not allergic to. I can't eat meat, but I don't mind vegetables. Favorite sports: football, basketball, and baseball. Favorite TV show: I don't watch much TV, but I do enjoy good comedy. Favorite music: I love all kinds of music, but I'm more of a hip-hop and jazz fan. Favorite movies: I like most movies, but my favorites are The Departed, Shawshank Redemption, and The Godfather. Favorite book: This is just between me and the girl I'm dating (and the only one she hasn't read). My name is Beaker, and this is my journal. But I'm not a real doctor, and I'm not a real scientist.
