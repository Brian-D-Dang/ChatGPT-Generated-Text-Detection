In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals so they get fat. You should be able to eat what you want but putting animals through that is wrong in my opinion "We can't control ourselves! We just stop eating when our 'pet' reaches a healthy weight!"
