As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this trend. The 'Honey Tax' is currently being implemented across six countries with some of these countries implementing it in a variety of ways from utility bills and even taxation on share prices to taxes on food products. While all these measures were instituted by the government to stop obesity in developing nations, most Kenyan companies have been reluctant to adopt them. Many of these companies include REC, Wizz Air Limited, DATE Technology Services Ltd., Niamh Tanawana Manufacturing Company Limited, MZU Holdings, SSSI Holdings, Kiptoo Inc and Nuair Corp among others. Some of these companies also allow their employees to partake in eating disorders through a kind of counselling programme run by the National Obesity Control Institute (NOCIU), which offers free coverage for healthcare and other health-related services that can be accessed for those who need help at scale.
