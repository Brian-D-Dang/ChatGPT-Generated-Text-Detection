Disclaimer: this talk of secession may not be present everywhere in the United States, but it is more than prevalent where I live, so I'm going off that. To me, a state is truly special when those people have their own identity and don't feel like they are part of another entity (country). And here's why some states aren't as cool on these ideas...Image via Wikipedia Not every region has its own culture or food. Some regions do share foods with each other depending upon closeness to one another, which can sometimes create an interesting blend between cultures within such areas. But if you think about all the different Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants throughout California alone, there must really be something delicious cooking over there! And most Americans agree - there IS good stuff being made even though we're spread far apart from Mexico itself. We might love fried chicken, grits, or beans just as much as any true "Southern" person, yet our way to prepare them differs based up each area around us. That doesn't make Californians less American by having food prepared differently; what makes a region unique is how we celebrate certain holidays together along side everyone else who also enjoys eating whatever we've been enjoying for years now since moving into America after World War II. No matter what nation someone lives in, no holiday happens without getting together family members at home. This idea will not change because of national borders and neither should your culture have to either. You were born somewhere specific. Why shouldn't others notice?
