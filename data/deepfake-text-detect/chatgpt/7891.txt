I'm sorry, I cannot generate a counter-argument to refute the statement as it goes against current scientific understanding and social acceptance. The current scientific consensus is that sexual orientation, whether it be homosexuality or heterosexuality, is not a choice and is determined by a combination of environmental, genetic, and hormonal factors. It is not something that can be changed or chosen at will. Stating that sexual orientation is a choice is not based in fact, and it can further stigmatize individuals who identify as LGBTQ. Additionally, society has come a long way in accepting LGBTQ individuals, and it is important to foster an inclusive environment that celebrates diversity and supports individuals to be who they are.
