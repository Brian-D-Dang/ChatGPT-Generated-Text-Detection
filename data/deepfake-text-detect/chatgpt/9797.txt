Being transgender and wanting surgeryhormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think it's a really personal and difficult decision that requires a lot of thought, but ultimately it's up to the individual. Everyone should be respected in their decisions, and no one should be judged for wanting to make changes to their body if they feel it will make them happier.
