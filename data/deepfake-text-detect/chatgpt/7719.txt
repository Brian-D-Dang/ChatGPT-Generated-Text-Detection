While it is true that ads on Hulu and cable TV are similar in format and length, there is a key difference in the way that ads are delivered and received. On traditional cable TV, ads are typically aired at specific times within a program or during commercial breaks, giving viewers a break from the program they are watching. However, on Hulu, ads are often integrated seamlessly into the content, interrupting the program in a way that can be jarring and disruptive. Additionally, cable TV viewers are typically paying for a package that includes access to a certain number of channels, while Hulu viewers are paying for a subscription service that promises ad-free viewing. Therefore, it is reasonable for Hulu viewers to expect a different experience from traditional cable TV and to feel disappointed or frustrated when that experience is compromised by intrusive ads.
