I am a fan of many sports, and all of them seem to take a lot of skill. But golf has always been the one I hated. It's always been about the speed at which you swing your body. My first game was in 1995 with my son Jayden. He won his first championship, but lost his tournament. Unfortunately we were so close in age that that day had to be cut short due to car problems. In 1983 we moved into our house while he was born. His father took him to school when we got married; he taught me how to suck it up and play golf real quick (the driving range is a half hour drive from here). So there is no doubt that if they're like you or if they are not good enough for a certain sport then there must have been something wrong. But now I do not understand why they don't teach this as part of their education. Shouldn't people learn on playing golf? There seems to be some sort of spiritual connection between taking golf practice classes and teaching how to play golf. When I start to look it up again I realize that it isn't just about practicing; it's about winning tournaments, making friends and becoming successful. The goal isn't necessarily golf; it's about how you put it together. And playing golf helps us to get better at building relationships with others, particularly those who aren't committed to sports themselves. For example, golf is about being able to talk to each other and talking life into helping each other succeed. Golf can help develop and improve friendships and still compete against each other. There are more forms of learning than golf and it's both fun and hard to follow around the course of a professional golf course. What I've found most important is that there are always opportunities for improvement: when I find myself struggling to keep up with practice or getting frustrated, I could improve. That way I'd never get bored of playing completely. At a younger age, what I did was to move away from taking lessons from parents because there wasn't anything else to do even though I knew I wanted to make a difference in the world. Sometimes in a relaxed environment, I would spend hours working out, training, playing off-course sports, etc. I believe in myself and I try not to think too far ahead. Life is a long journey; there are far fewer opportunities to achieve what I want. But the end result is always the same - progress.
