Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable when you consider how much humanity has contributed to Starfleet, but it still makes no sense why so many people would be kept on a pedestal even after their deaths (and some might argue that posthumous awards are not really appropriate). The show is very clear about who should be made into gods: Vulcans. The first time I saw T'Pol appear in "E," she was surrounded by all these senior officers paying tribute; this scene played like something straight from Babylon 5. She didn't just command Enterprise, she led her own starship away with several other ships as well! In fact, we see Vulcan captains commanding multiple starships throughout Trek history - including Spock himself. Not only do they get statues, but praise for centuries afterward? That seems excessive at best. But hey, maybe now more than ever adding tributes to our public squares will help us remember what unites us.
