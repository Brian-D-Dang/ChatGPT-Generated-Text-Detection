In the usa gay marraige is always being debated in the media and in politics. Like most controversy in the usa it is assumed that there are only two sides to every story, we have all heard from different perspectives and so when gay marriage equality comes up everyone will think about who was right or wrong. Whereas here we express ourselves freely and everyone has hisher own view of homosexuals. Gay people generally don't want to hear that LGBT characters were not "reluctant" to use their service during wars, but instead chose to serve them as a way to show one's love for society. I personally believe that the entire discussion should focus on how this discrimination works and the ways it can be handled by LGBT people whose sexuality is well understood and shared between both genders (why can't I tell my wife she has sex with me if I am very into the idea?).
