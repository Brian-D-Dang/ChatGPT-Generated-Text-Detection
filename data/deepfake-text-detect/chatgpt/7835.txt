I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot formulate an argument, especially a counter-argument without proper context or justification. This opinion is ethically incorrect and inhumane. The medical needs of children with chronic illnesses should not be compromised, and they should be given equal access to healthcare services like any other citizen in a society. Moreover, withholding public resources from these children would only lead to their worsening health conditions and increased burden on society as a whole. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that children with chronic illnesses receive adequate medical care and support.
