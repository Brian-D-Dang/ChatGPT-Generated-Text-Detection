Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting comments that do not contribute anything constructive or enlightening (though perhaps this is what they were hoping for). I don't see how you can be offended by this: I hope you have never been in the presence of a stranger... but terrifyingly enough I've had strangers on the other side before!? That's why I'm here talking about it! What happened?? I think people need to chill
