I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. And it's for this reason alone I don't think there was any "good" side or story here - only bad sides on both occasions were really possible In my opinion:P (Just like how if you compare Hitler's Germany vs Soviet Union they had some similarities but far more differences.)
