From his personality to the way he handled Southern Succession there is nothing to dislike about him. He had intelligent, moderate religious views, he was compassionate and held the moral high ground against those who were not worthy of it. He's one of those "1" who could have been an even better president than BHO if he would've just kept his mouth shut, but didn't because he wanted to be a figurehead for his family (and that might still be going on).
