So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal , if the U.S were to use nukes it would be only in one scenario; If NK fired first (or maybe second) at another country like SK or towards Guam 2: Even then there are other alternatives for solving things diplomatically before we get to that point such as sanctions isolation from international community 3: What makes you think we even need nuke capabilities? Is not having them now enough assurance? 4: Nuclear capability does nothing but create fear among citizens which can easily be avoided by using conventional weapons 5: Also what do you mean "we don't want to start World War III?" Do you really believe every nuclear power wants WWIII? 6: Lastly how much money will North Korea gain out of this deal? Isn't all the land, resources etc they currently possess worth far more than 100 nukes? The US has made it clear many times over that any attack on us soil would trigger a response with NUKES! So... let's assume NK launches a missile toward Seoul. A response could range up to being an immediate full-scale invasion of NK including dropping hundreds of thousands of troops. We dropped our "mother of all bombs" on ISIS and killed dozens of people so why should anyone doubt we'd drop some bad boys too if needed? The world doesn't understand how serious we take this threat anymore because 50 years ago it might've been different. However, today... no fucking way. Hell, if NK attacks Japan... look the fuck out. They're gonna melt into glass (all due respect). Now, ideally, that wouldn't happen since Trump knows how seriously he needs China on his side when dealing with Kim Jong Un. He cares very little about anything else except making sure China isn't pissed off enough that they decide to throw him under the bus, therefore leaving him open to impeachmentarrest. Anyways, back to your question, YES, WE NEED MORE OF OUR OWN FUCKING MISSILES IF THEY ACTUALLY ATTACK!!! And yes, everyone wants World War III hence why most countries aren't doing shit right now despite knowing damn well they have these missiles aimed right at them. It takes time, patience and understanding between EVERYONE involved for peace to occur. But please... stop acting like there won't be fallout from firing your nukes unless you're ready to step foot in hell itself...
