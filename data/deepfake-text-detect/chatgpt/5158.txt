Personally, I'm not religious, so I guess I'm trying to get some insight here. Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything for yourself and everyone else has access somewhere out there... So why would I want to accept a godless world? I don't think that means anything just because something doesn't exist. Hey if you're really hell bent on this sort of thing then maybe you should consider joining a more moderate religion like Christianity or Islam haha
