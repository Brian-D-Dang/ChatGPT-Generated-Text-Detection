Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on. I firmly believe there should be a public outcry concerning this and for our leaders (even those who are in favour) to take strong action towards stopping these barbaric acts which try to send a message that they will not tolerate such atrocities being committed by their own countrymen. Our Government's response has been quite slow so far... My view: What do we say? "We don't want them here." Well said! We know that no matter what happens it doesn't really affect us as citizens of Canada because we live miles away from these places of torture. It does bother me though when others make excuses like "It wasn't done properly" or "They were tried before" etc.,etc.. This was all attempted murder using weapons and bombs intended to terrorize civilians into submission. These men where sentenced after years of legal proceedings justly under Canadian law and yet somehow still some people feel entitled to ignore all laws made up by law makers with a responsibility TO BE LAWFUL and ethical!!! Why is it okay for one person but wrong for another?? What would your response be if you get caught speeding and the police car pulls over while turning on its lights, pulls out his gun points at you saying - "Don't speed!" Are you going to argue politely saying; "But officer, my kids are sick i need to come home quickly!." Or an even more extreme example where someone breaks down sobbing uncontrollably during cross examination until the judge stops himher.... People die everyday due to such disregard for life!! The death penalty should never happen anywhere EVER, but especially NOT IN CANADA! If anyone needs convincing please listen to MURDEREDRIVER's song 'Man On Death Row'
