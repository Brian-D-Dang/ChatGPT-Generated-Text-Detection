First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. She's very overweight and has a lot more luggage than needs be for her trip (not that she does this intentionally). In order not cause undue discomfort or inconvenience around other people who have paid their fare you would naturally either give up your seat so someone else could sit down comfortably - regardless if they're already next door neighbours with plenty airspace between them; OR stand until there are seats available again after which time everyone is happy as it was before except now two less passengers had been inconvenienced by those selfish few others making themselves comfortable at my expense while being able-bodied enough also do likewise... ermm.... yeah! That sounds like justice!!!!!1!!!!1111oneeleven111 Ermmm..... noooooooobody said anything about torture but we can make hypotheticals out loud aren'rt us? Nopity nah??? We've entered into uncharted territory here; orca
