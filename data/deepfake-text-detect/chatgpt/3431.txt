I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have livedcurrently live there, I could not be more dead set on not living there. What are some other cities that you might recommend for someone who likes the fast-paced, metropolitan feel of New York City, but doesn't want to actually live in the city?
