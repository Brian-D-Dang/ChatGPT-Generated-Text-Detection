Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, do so many of us read blog posts written by people we don't even know? I've been working on this project for a little while now and have spent some time researching what makes good content on the internet (as well as how to write specifically so that readers will actually care). So let's get started! 1) Know Your Audience: These days, if you are new online at least 30 of your traffic should be coming from organic search results. If yours is not, you're missing out. The problem with most sites is they start writing their blogs once and never revisit them again. It takes less than 5 minutes per day to write one quality post every month for each reader. Don't underestimate your audience there are infinite people reading these words right now. Be sure to think before publishing something; ask yourself "is my motive pure?" and "will other users benefit from seeing this particular page?." You need to find balance between being authentic and keeping up with the times. Nobody wants marketing spam at work. People are searching the web looking for information, in order to help solve problems or complete projects. Write your blog posts based off of those needs. We put our best foot forward when it comes to knowing who we are serving first. Once you understand why you want to create a presence here, make sure others can see that through your writing too. 2) Find Topics That Interest Them: This may seem obvious but most bloggers either choose topics to which they are comfortable or those about which they have expertise. Neither category provides much value nor interest. On the flip side, try thinking outside of your comfort zone, especially when exploring niche areas. There are tons of different ways to approach each topic; you won't always run into resistance or know-it-alls. For example, I'm no expert on ecommerce plugins. In fact, I've only really worked with WordPress itself and haven't done any paid ads yet. But due to lack of knowledge on the subject, I decided to explore affiliate programs instead. Because these two of topics interested me enough to investigate further, I was able to build relationships with others doing similar things and eventually became an affiliate myself. As long as you provide solid research, you'll find plenty of opportunities to expand your knowledge base. Also keep in mind that there is often a lot of competition within niches. Trying to control all aspects of content creation isn't practical because if you don't diversify your efforts, you risk getting left behind BUT you might also gain a following of devoted followers who would jump at having a dedicated source of authority on a certain topic. 3) Have a Clear Strategy: Think back to why you chose to start blogging in the first place. Do you hope to grow a brand because it fits your personalitystyle better? Or do you just want to share ideas with friends and family? If you realize what motivates you, you'll tailor everything else around that goal. How does posting regularly maintain the relationship you already have with your community? Is social sharing worth the effort? Does everyone visiting your site enjoy interacting with each other? Can increasing your engagement rate increase your conversions or sales? To answer these questions, you must use data whenever possible - Google Analytics, Facebook Insights, etc. Noticing patterns and trends helps drive your strategy. 4) Keep Posting Blogs Regularly: Most people are busy. One thing EVERYONE hates (except for fans of a certain show), is going over old stuff or finding themselves stuck in an rut. So avoid it by putting in at least 2 hours a week creating fresh material for your audience. What gets posted today could go viral tomorrow. Although a few posts will generate decent leads or comments, content doesn't count; it counts hard earned interactions with real people. The exception to this rule seems to be articles on subjects where there is such a high level of demand that it becomes inevitable to produce a large amount of valuable information in a short period of time. Herein lies the beauty of SEO though....we'll talk about that later:) By providing regular updates you establish trust among readers, show your sincerity, help promote your business, retain existing customers and acquire new ones. Best case scenario, you'll receive a link from another blogger that converts. Worst case scenario, nobody links to you except website owners begging you to join forces. Either way, you've accomplished something great for yourself while helping others in the process. 5) Make Sure They Read Everything Link Back Properly: Get them hooked early on. No matter what, I begin writing a couple paragraphs describing the benefits of using WordPress vs. using a DIY CMS plugin. Once that page is ready, I include four buttons: 'Buy Now', 'Free Trial', 'Live Support' and 'Contact Me'. All of this connects them directly to my own contact address (usually a rich debatable effect, to feed:P and Business cards of, Bowerz dead after having no longer trying to play stone; drink
