Every election year this is one of the most popular complaints against candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. "So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so far he hasn't done anything," said Cynthia Pierce, a Republican from Jefferson City who has served on the Parsonage County Commission since 2000. For a while, Republicans in the state House have been trying to force their hand by getting state law in place that would give them control over local elections rather than voting for those whose districts are represented at county level. But Gov. Mike DeWine didn't sign it into law until last month when he signed a new law that allows Democrats to choose between two elected officials instead of all three because they're different races. "It's just not fair. It's really unfair to be ruled out from running on it if you'd like a seat in Congress," said Rep. Brett Phelan, D-Palo Alto, who voted with his wife to pass the bill and was among 14 other lawmakers to vote for it. In some ways, the bill narrowly passed despite a robust effort by both state senators to find a way around the requirement that every district get its own rules governing how districts are run. Republican State Representative Robin Loehrman even helped craft legislation limiting state voter access to online polls after multiple people reported being denied votes in her district. She added that the measure was designed specifically to prevent voters from legally casting ballots in one of several large congressional races she represents. But by failing to implement the changes, in some cases both sides were unable to negotiate an agreement on what to do when they lost their race or could lose another seat. That left many local political leaders scrambling to figure out a way to make up for lost time. Jim Merdling, a Republican from Long Beach who voted no on the bill, called it a "bipartisan blunder." He told The Associated Press he thought it "took away (the) potential for improvement." "I support it and think it will help fix things but I don't want it to hurt the party," Merdling said. The bill failed by double digits, according to mezzanine estimates compiled by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office. In the end, federal dollars weren't needed to get the message across. The winner of the 2019 general election, Sen. Luis Garcia, R-Portland, was able to retain his seat and maintain it through Dec. 10, when the state House backed him in a quarter of an hour. There's also more debate about whether Congress can afford to keep on raising taxes. Sen. Richard Spencer, D-Columbus, ran unopposed for president in 2018, but next week, Democrats are signaling they might launch an attack on Rep.-elect Anthony Albanese, a California Republican who opposes the tax increase. Spencer said in a statement Thursday that "Democrats should shut down the House budget process and instead focus on improving our supermajority since we've never had a chance to solve a bipartisan problem." He noted that he didn't personally participate in the process with Ralph Nader, who appeared before the House chamber earlier this year to endorse legalizing marijuana. But in recent weeks, opponents of legalization have mounted their attacks on Stacey Abrams, a black woman who went on the offensive during the 2016 presidential campaign, as well as former Georgia GOP gubernatorial nominee Brian Kemp, who was ousted by Abrams last month. Abrams' victory reignited calls to shift attention toward Democratic contenders, especially Democratic candidates who may face special elections. A "blue wave" could extend the Democratic advantage over Hillary Clinton and potentially swing the vote in favor of Biden. A number of Senate races are likely to decide which candidate wins, including Assemblywoman Barbara Glynn Sargent, a Democrat from Los Angeles County; Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen; Attorney General Jeff Sessions; and U.S. Sens. Patty Murray and Bob Menendez, both of whom rank as key swing states for the 2020 election.
