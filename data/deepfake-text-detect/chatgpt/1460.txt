Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than other groups. To clarify I'm talking about European nationalism, which is not a thing outside of Europe e.g America isn't "America" and Australia is different so it's not American nationalism either
