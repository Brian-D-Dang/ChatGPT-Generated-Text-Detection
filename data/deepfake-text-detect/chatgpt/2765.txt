To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. And this may come as a shocker to you: even if we don't know all of the facts surrounding Sony's security breach, it doesn't mean they aren't guilty on some level. Sony could've done things differently and perhaps improved their security measures by now - which would have covered up the fact that no one knows for certain how the information was obtained. Was someone just walking into the building with sensitive data? Or did it happen via phishing or other means? Did an employee do something wrong? The only two possibilities are hacking (which, in my mind, can never be 100 eliminated) or stupidity. Either way, you're going to get screwed over when someone gets everything about your company off line. The real question here isn't "Did Sony break their own policies" because there will always be loopholes somewhere. It's whether Sony broke any laws or breached any security standards - both cases being highly unlikely. Here's where people go wrong: Proving intent is hard. You'd need proof beyond reasonable doubt that someone from Sony knew full well what they were doing before the hack happened; otherwise there won't ever be anything more than speculation until someone comes forward and admits that heshe leaked details out intentionally. Now keep in mind that these people also had access to credit card info, address info, etc., so again, proving malicious intention might prove difficult. So while everyone thinks that every corporation has that person who wants to ruin them by releasing confidential data, well... maybe, but most likely that wasn't the case here unless Sony hired a complete idiot who didn't realize that they needed decent security or used weak passwords everywhere. If you ask me then, Sony probably got hacked due to unfortunate circumstances. They certainly didn't deserve it regardless though since no matter what happens, Sony still has their customers' money. So yeah, I kind of agree with Paul Ryan in that time will tell us if Sony is actually innocent or not. However, even if they are found innocent, they'll suffer through bad PR either way because nobody likes getting compromised online especially since there's nothing they could reasonably do after it takes place. In terms of legal ramifications, however, Sony faces a number of problems that I haven't mentioned yet. One obvious example is losing customer trust forever. Most companies either try to recover lost stock value or attempt to build new business models around whatever negative publicity they received. That cannot be said for Sony though. Many people simply won't support such a big corporation anymore since Sony went ahead and made themselves look like an absolute joke instead. While that idea sounds fantastic on paper, unfortunately it does not work quite as easily in reality without significant public backing. This leads us directly back to my original point above: Even if Sony isn't legally responsible right away, its reputation already suffered major blows thanks to their actions. That alone makes it seem pretty clear that they weren't very bright to begin with. Oh and finally, let's not forget that lawsuits against corporations cost a lot of money! Not worth the risk for Sony, who agreed to pay 1 million to cover potentially exposed users.
