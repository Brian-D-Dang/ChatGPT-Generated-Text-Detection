Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from very little) and have been doing so for about 7 years at this point. My question is regarding Soccer Coaching what you believe has worked best in terms of development? During matches timetraining did you find that it helped when developing players or was there other factors before training which would help most with development such as... age group played previous season (s), position on field etc..?? Hope someone can offer some advice! Thanks!! Jason I coached one team of Boy's U9 through U17 over the course of 4 seasons plus 2 others we were more successful than our boys program came back year after year until I left the association last summer. I had no idea how much competition really does hurt kids who are still growing mentally while they're playing games against adult men. It became evident pretty quickly since all children lose their innocence around 11-12 years old. There comes a point where parents begin yelling things like "there goes his future if he plays sports" or something along those lines. The reality is, yes these kids will grow into adults and yes they'll leave school wanting to play college level sport because those programs look better on paper than a highschool varsity program. Parents need to realize that it's going to happen regardless of whether their kid plays sports or not. They should be asking themselves why do they want to make sure their child doesn't end up having a crappy job or ends up being overweight and regrets a life spent running instead of walking and eating pizza every night. If you don't think football hurts youth, then I'm sorry you didn't coach any female athletes either. Every single girl wants to go out and play just as hard, just as fast, kick just as far and jump higher than her male counterparts. That's part of the reason women love basketball, volleyball, softball, gymnastics, track and field, cross country, tennis ball hockey, lacrosse...the list could go on forever. But girls have enough pressure placed upon them by society already without us trying harder too. Girls thrive under less success even though boy's will fight tooth and nail to achieve greater heights. Good luck with coaching! You shouldn't feel bad about anything that happens during practice except maybe an injury, because aside from that, you've done everything possible to prepare these young people for the real world. Don't worry about what anyone else might say behind your back, only concentrate on helping these kids become great individuals. Good luck with that! I agree 100 with a lot of points made above: Football IS hurting many of the kids involved. However, I'd also argue that you cannot put down a game unless you know exactly what went wrong and what steps needed to fix it for next year. Most often than not when you see problems occurring in a game, it's usually fixed within 5 minutes of looking at it. Sure, there are occasional incidents that require a larger intervention such as banning a player from the league. In my experience however, its rare to ever hit rock bottom and call it good. Each problem experienced provides vital information to coaches that allows us to improve upon the process. This is why we continue to rebuild club after club. What works well today may be completely different tomorrow as each year brings new challenges. Having said that, If money is tight then you must prioritize health over numbers. Without proper training, damaged ligaments, muscle tears and damage to nerves and tendons mean poor performance. Running full pelt at speed puts strain on joints leaving injuries inevitable. Bags of ice or heat packs used during activity help reduce swelling and allow joint movement. Administering pain killers makes sense when muscles start cramping due to tiredness. Not treating injured bodies means missing valuable lessons learned on the pitch which translates into poorer performances. These remarks apply equally to baseball, golf etc... Finally, lets take the POTUS example mentioned below. Yes, they attended university yet it appears education wasn't without mistakes. One thing i have learnt is to never judge another person based solely on their upbringing. Life isn't fair, therefore nothing worth achieving comes easy. Remember - you control your own destiny, nobody else. People seem to forget the positives that come with participating in organised athletics ie; A positive attitude towards self improvement, learning extra skills, social interaction, gaining respect etc. These benefits alone outweigh the negatives associated with physical exertion. Again, find ways to balance tough times against the joyous moments... jasonmh There seems to be two main camps here:- Children, particularly younger ones, enjoy the opportunity of participation in organized sporting activities. Developmentally appropriate level of challenge, mentoring of elements of skillful decision making and independence, exposure to peer groups, encouragement of sharing experiences, achievements, understanding of values, principles of honesty, respectfulness, responsibility, fairness, loyalty and caring alongside some fun!
