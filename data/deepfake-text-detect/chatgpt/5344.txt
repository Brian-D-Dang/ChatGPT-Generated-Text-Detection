This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point was not to advocate that you shouldn't get involved in arguments but rather argue your case by pointing out the importance of the math and reasoning behind it being a tricky problem to solve at some point when solving non-trivial issues like this with a lot fewer people than the average person who's only real difficulty is figuring out why logic can make things easier because arguments aren't trivial usually involves implications such as: 1) the algebraic relationship between the two dimensions 2) the complexity of the problem 3) the existence of a contradiction 4) the differential equation of the problem 5) the importance of having multiple solutions 6) the conflict between good reasons and bad ones 7) the importance of a pragmatic argumentation 8) the importance of defining a good reason 9) the importance of showing how the opposite of what is wrong 10). The point being, by making this difficult, you're effectively saying "I don't understand what you think you mean." which makes you sound ridiculous, especially since people often do understand what you said isn't correct even though they've never experienced it before (case in point: the aforementioned slippery slope fallacy).
