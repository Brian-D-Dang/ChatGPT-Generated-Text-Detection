1.firstly most people who say it is justified don't understand what "justices" and are using it to say "it was ok!"in a more powerful way so a more fitting way of saying it would be to say "it was the right thing to do" and I do agree with that 2. it is still wrong to just kill someone in cold blood 3. also how do you know they are "innocent" they could have killed someone before and gotten away with it and only this time are being caught 4. yes, you could say it is justified for people that have committed murder before and killed someone and have been brought to court over it but then the fact that they have been brought to court means the policecourt system is not doing a good enough job. 1. You've pretty much just covered all of my points with this paragraph. 2. I'd agree. 3. This is a good point. I'd say that the average person will have more evidence of innocence than guilt. 4. I'd agree. But I'd also say that the police have the power to investigate, and if they are unable to prove a person's guilt, they should be exonerated. 1. the justice system is not perfect and you can't just say that the person is innocent because of that but you can't say that it was justified 2. I don't think it was the right thing to do. I just think it is justified. If it was not justified then that means that they should have brought those people to trial or made some other effort to prove their innocence. 3. I think that they are more likely to be innocent. 4. I'd agree 1. No, you can't just say they're innocent because of it. You can only say that the court system, police, etc have failed them. 2. No, I don't think it was the right thing to do. I'd say that it was an ineffective way to deal with the problem, but not a good justification. 3. I think that they're just as likely to be innocent. 4. I'd agree that the system has failed them, but I'd say that killing them was not the right way to deal with it. 1. No, you can't say that they're innocent because of it. You can only say that the court system, police, etc have failed them. 3. I'd agree that they're just as likely to be innocent. 4. I'd agree that the system has failed them, but I'd say that killing them was not the right way to deal with it. 1. You can't just say they're innocent because of it. You can only say that the court system, police, etc have failed them. 3. I'd agree that they're just as likely to be innocent, but I don't think it is right to just kill them. I agree with this point of view but I have a couple of questions. 1. Does the punishment fit the crime? Are they really that evil? 2. Will killing them actually stop people from doing the same thing? 3. Aren't there other ways to deal with the problem? If they are evil then they should be killed. If they aren't evil then it isn't justice. If they are innocent then they should be freed and if they are not innocent then it isn't justice. I'm not sure what you mean by "fit the crime" - the crime is killing someone, which is a heinous act. I do think there are other ways to deal with the problem. I don't think it is the right thing to just kill them. Does the punishment fit the crime? Are they really that evil? The punishment fits the crime, in that they have committed a crime. This is where I'm torn. Do they deserve to be punished? If they're not evil, then they shouldn't be. If they are, then they should. I'm not sure what to think. Arent there other ways to deal with the problem? Killing people is the most extreme way to deal with the problem. 1. If they are evil then they should be killed. If they aren't evil then it isn't justice. If they are innocent then they should be freed and if they are not innocent then it isn't justice. 2. The crime is killing someone, which is a heinous act. 3. I do think there are other ways to deal with the problem.
