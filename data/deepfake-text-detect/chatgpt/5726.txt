I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to call an element ununtium (or something of that sort) without it having some isotopes that are stable, if only for a few seconds. Does it have to have some stable isotopes (or is it only the first isotope that must be stable) in order to be called ununtium? If it can't be named as such, how would you name the element if it has no stable isotopes? egingroup Related: physics.stackexchange.comquestions8721... endgroup - anna v Oct 13 '14 at 23:43 egingroup anna v: I've already seen that question, but the reason I ask it again is because I'm not quite sure if I understand it. In fact, I'm not even sure if I understood the first answer, so I wanted to clarify it a bit more. endgroup - Solomon Slow Oct 14 '14 at 1:16 egingroup SolomonSlow: I am afraid it's not possible to answer the question you asked as I understand it. Why? Because you have to give a definition of "stability" (at least, you must define what you mean by "stable, and different definitions would lead to different conclusions. endgroup - anna v Oct 14 '14 at 1:19 egingroup I'm not sure that it's impossible, but I do know that it's hard. endgroup - Solomon Slow Oct 14 '14 at 2:10 egingroup SolomonSlow: I would argue that it's impossible, but I am not completely sure about it. It's really not something I think about often. endgroup - anna v Oct 14 '14 at 2:12 I think the answer to your question is that we don't know yet. We have not found any element (or isotope) whose only isotope is stable. But I don't think that "unstable" is the right term for such elements. It seems to me that "unstable" is a term that should be used for a transition state. Anyway, it seems that the first "stable" isotope of a given element has the lowest probability to decay. This means that for any given element, the first isotope is the most abundant. This isotope is called the "ground state." (More information about ground state here.) Anyway, the name of an element is given by the symbols of its atoms, not by its properties. egingroup But the first isotope of an element is not necessarily stable. An example of a case where it is not stable is the first isotope of the element Lead (Pb-202). endgroup - Solomon Slow Oct 14 '14 at 2:06 egingroup SolomonSlow: I'm not sure you are correct: Pb-202 is the first isotope of Pb. endgroup - anna v Oct 14 '14 at 2:09 egingroup The first isotope of an element is not necessarily the most abundant. It is the ground state. endgroup - anna v Oct 14 '14 at 2:10 egingroup SolomonSlow: Pb-202 is the first isotope of Pb, but it is not the most abundant. Pb-204 is the most abundant isotope. endgroup - anna v Oct 14 '14 at 2:11 egingroup SolomonSlow: But even if you say that the most abundant isotope of Pb is Pb-204, it is not true that the most abundant isotope is necessarily stable. endgroup - anna v Oct 14 '14 at 2:12 While the idea of isotope is a bit difficult to grasp, an isotope is just an atom of a particular element which has the same number of protons as another atom of the same element but a different number of neut
