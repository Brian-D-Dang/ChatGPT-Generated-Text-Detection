I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that can be negative and misrepresentative. It's important to beware of such ads and do your own research on the policies and track record of each candidate and party. Don't believe everything you see or hear in ads, as they can be biased and manipulative. It's always best to make an informed decision based on objective information and your own values and priorities.
