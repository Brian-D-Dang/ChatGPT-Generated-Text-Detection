Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than others. Nationalism always has a bad side, and it's never good for the world as a whole. I'd add that its not just nationalism but jingoism which I would define as excessive patriotism combined with irrational hatred of other nations or peoples.
