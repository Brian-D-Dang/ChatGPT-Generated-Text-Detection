I feel like they're acting and it often feels very campy. I don't like how they say "well my brain is more feminine," like excuse me that's something that women can make up for before age if you want to avoid making a statement about your brain sexiness, but when the question comes to themselves, the responses are mostly "oh it was less masculine then it used to be, or because there were fewer toys in the house. Am I bad at guessing?" My mom doesn't like it either so she says she has her own opinion and I said we should just leave it at that.
