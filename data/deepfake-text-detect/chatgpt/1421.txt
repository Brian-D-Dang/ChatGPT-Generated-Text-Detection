First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces acceptance of the most popular opinion (in other words, people who have been redditing for years will probably get more karma than someone just starting). I'm not saying that what happens here is good or bad - it could be either way. But my theory explains everything and we should all take note of its implications That sounds like something a commie would say...
