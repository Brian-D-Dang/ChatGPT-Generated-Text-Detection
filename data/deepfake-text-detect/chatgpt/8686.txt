So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to have a relationship with your mother, but you may not want her to do so for some reason and therefore be without your mother in a relationship with a man. This is probably true. But if a woman doesn't like the idea of being cuckolded, then she's obviously not interested in having sex with him, no matter how much he loves her (and wants a relationship with us). Well... yes, I agree completely.
