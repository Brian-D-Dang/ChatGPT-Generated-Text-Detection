This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) seems to be based on the notion that being born into their religionfaith means you are automatically saved and will live forever in heaven if your faith is correct. As such, they believe it justifies all actions undertaken by members within said faiths, regardless of whether those acts were positive or negative towards others. However, people who hold these beliefs seldom consider how easily they could fall prey to this kind of thinking and do have no basis for justifying why they should continue living happily ever after when thousands of other innocents perished because they simply did not follow their god's word and didn't accept his terms. Religious doctrine frequently requires believers to justify their belief system through various means including, but not limited to: denying scientific facts, especially evolution; promoting ignorance; advocating killing people for perceived offenses against God; etc.. This article does not intend to compare different religious doctrines - only the way I see them applied today throughout the world. It does not mean any attempt at "discrediting" any particular faith nor does it imply that anyone else can judge what someone believes, which is something nearly every believer has already done along with almost everyone outside of hisher own faith. There is also a huge distinction between having faith and practicing one's faith - to me, they seem like two very different things. Lastly, many politically active religions tend toward extreme political positions and therefore there is a certain amount of assumption made during discussions about how things would play out under those circumstances. For example, while not specifically attacking a politician, some Christians might make claims implying heshe is going to hell solely because she doesn't share the same views. Similarly, Muslims who are more conservative than liberal may claim that any Muslim, regardless of race, gender or social status ultimately reincarnates back into a state similar to theirs without any supernatural intervention from Allah so long as they keep performing good deeds. At first glance, such statements appear harmless yet just beneath the surface lurks the implication that non-believers aren't really human beings deserving rights since we haven't been reborn enough times to learn our lessons...which makes perfect sense for organizations whose followers generally engage in good deeds in order to gain eternal life in paradise! These types of practices definitely don't sit well with me given that my parents lost everything due to WWII and subsequently had 3 children bringing us up in poverty before eventually escaping Germany and immigrating to America where we lived much better lives. My father got married again, was adopted by another family and started over completely anew, which included starting a new career from scratch. He worked tirelessly serving as foreman installing metal piping pipes for several large industries. We became financially stable and owned farms for awhile until prices collapsed. Even though we never went hungry, we still continued struggling economically whilst my mother stayed home taking care of us kids and helping run the farm. All the time, she willingly sacrificed her health even though she knew that later down the road her knees wouldn't allow her to work anymore. She always told us kids how lucky we were whenever we complained of hunger pains - luckily, for us, her sacrifice paid off. Sadly however, we didn't know that prior to spending hard earned money on foodstamps welfare checks. In fact, we ended up getting kicked out of school when mom couldn't pay tuition thanks to lack of financial support. While my siblings and I learned important life skills early on, I clearly remember begging my dad to buy me a bike hoping he'd agree to teach me to ride it instead of letting me walk everywhere we needed to go. Of course, Dad didn't listen to my pleas either despite finally feeling bad for me and giving in to buy it for 20. Having spent years living hand to mouth, my sister and brother and I enjoyed riding bikes around daily whereas I felt extremely deprived and jealous watching friends happily enjoying playing after-school sports activities. To add insult to injury, Mom's knee problems necessitating surgery kept us away from church services, making Sunday mornings feel extra lonely to me when I now think of my childhood memories of celebrating Christmas Eve together with extended family. Despite goodness efforts, we mostly remained poor because Dad couldn't find steady work. So yes, I am quite aware that next generations suffer far worse than mine regarding economic conditions, but it's another thing altogether to want to take advantage of the situation rather than trying desperately to improve one's lot in life. Religious dogma often comes across as self righteous, hypocritical excuses for immoral behaviors which usually gives rise to resentment among those chosen to endure hardships. Yes, we hear "God helps those who help themselves" which sounds great...but what do most people stand to benefit? People choosing to ignore reality leads inevitably to chaos, famine or war. Those choices, regardless of who presides over them, invariably lead to misery, suffering, aka survivors of the destructive forces pointing to setleousy exitedcoofficer 2ndedirectly resistacercal avi useresatisfiedby three
