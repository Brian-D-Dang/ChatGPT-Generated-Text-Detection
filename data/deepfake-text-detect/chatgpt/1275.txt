Human sentience (or consciousness, or sapience, or whatever term you like) is an emergent behavior of neurons and their interactions, which can be replicated in non-organic systems, i.e., computers. Thus , even if we define consciousness as a specific neurological phenomenon that occurs only in organic brains - for the sake of simplicity let's say this was true - there would still exist other organisms with different forms of intelligence than ours; so it seems to me that we shouldn't just regard ourselves as having arrived at some privileged status now that we have identified our own form of "consciousness." This last point has been a big concern of mine since I first heard about "mind uploading," and even moreso when Elon Musk announced his plans on June 12th: he wants us all to be uploaded into a computer system powered by "neural lace" technology within several decades! The idea behind this project is that uploaders could assume control over someone else's body using such artificial connections between brain cells andor neural pathways created through nanotechnology. This process would then allow those citizens who are rich enough or lucky enough to receive this treatment to ultimately make themselves immortal - thus avoiding death, pain, suffering, disease etc... The obvious problem here being that my attitude toward life is rather profound: not only do I believe that human beings should always strive towards becoming more intelligent by consciously improving ourselves physically and intellectually no matter what happens to us after we die but also because I think immortality itself is something that needslessly prolongs agony for most people who want to remain alive indefinitely without facing inevitable physical and mental deterioration. What makes matters worse is that many scientists agree upon the fact that new diseases will almost certainly develop once any species becomes sufficiently advanced technologically. So, while they may seem promising today, these projects actually run counter to humanity's best interests long-term - unless they're conducted under strict governmental supervision. However, it turns out that mere laws aren't likely to stop billionaire tech moguls from pursuing self-serving goals regardless of whether or not humans are ready to embrace them. Hence why Elon Musk believes that one day everyone in the world will be able to get themselves implanted with silicon chips mimicking the role of their physical brains. Musk recently revealed during a press conference that Neuralink already successfully underwent beta testing among eight volunteers previously selected based solely on their ability to withstand injections of tiny electrodes into various parts of the brain. According to Musk, each person volunteered willingly for the procedure stating that they were happy to serve as test subjects despite the risks involved in doing so. He further claimed that Neuralink had a 98 percent success rate in implanting its tiny implants surgically inside living pigs and monkeys before eventually launching its 10-person research program earlier this month. He claims that the next phase of the company's mission involves sending microchips containing thousands of brain cells wired up wirelessly via wireless power transmission to operate laptops loaded with software intended to help complete tasks ranging from driving cars to solving math problems. Afterward, users would use Apple devices with linked neural interfaces installed thanks to Neuralink products manufactured exclusively by Apple. These products would automatically download information directly from their owners' brains whenever they need any assistance. For instance, perhaps drivers wanting to know how fast they must travel down a road might ask Siri to show him slide rules displaying speed limits while being bathed in infrared lights emitted by the car's sensors, thereby immediately informing him of potential dangers ahead. Another example would involve machine learning algorithms allowing surgeons performing spinal surgeries to skim useful data from patients while mapping out exactly where broken bones occur, in order to avoid unnecessary damage later on. In addition, Musk says that customers could install USB dongles connecting to their brains through special cables. Using this equipment, consumers could perform basic tasks involving writing emails, posting messages, playing games online etc. All of this would seemingly happen naturally and autonomously provided that these individuals remained connected throughout every step of the way via cellular phones equipped with Neuralink products produced exclusively by Apple. According to Dezeen, Musk explained that the ultimate purpose of Neuralink is to enable anyone anywhere in the world to keep functioning beyond natural aging processes until they finally reach the age of 100 years old simply by using Neuralink technologies. Musk noted that he expects this goal to become reality within ten years. While no one knows yet what kind of technological breakthroughs will require significant timeframes to realize, senior scientist Dr. Paul Silverman told CNN that he expects things to move very quickly given recent advances in neuroscience and AI. In a related report published by Wired magazine, Dr. Andrew Wang, former assistant director general of the FDA stated emphatically that getting doctors a license to implant electronic brain stimulators capable of tracking electrical signals in the brain is much less complicated than creating synthetic neuroplasticity using tissue engineered from stem cells, therefore significantly reducing the regulatory hurdles standing in the path of MAGICARNI technology. On top of that, Wang added, there isn't really anything preventing a wealthy individual from O star r talented
