I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I have had female friends who are fully capable of doing it all and as an independent woman myself I know how confident they can be in their choices. Knowing what we now do about the sexual politics behind our bodies being named after our parts seems like such a ridiculous idea! Why on earth would anyone want or need to pay homage to these ideas? It maintains patriarchy's power over us by making sex associated with the male body more powerful than the connection between men and women, the union between man and wife (hence'marriage' - another set of patriarchal control rituals). Sex should by its nature be equal for both sexes, but not when it is seen through the lens of patriarchy. The whole basis of feminism was to give equality and freedom for both genders. Patriarchy attempts to uphold male dominance while at the same time subjugating women: dictated gender roles, no rights to vote or own land; coercion via legal systems, punishments etc., internalized misogyny in the form of attitude toward one's self, family, children etc. These things work together to keep people dependent upon malespatriarchies in order to maintain status quo. It does so due largely to lack of education about true feminism. If young girls could realize that there were other ways to express themselves and live lives free from abusive relationships, violence, poverty...they might actually become interested in thinking beyond traditional views. But instead, society (and parents) brainwash them into believing that living without dependence upon males is shameful, uncivilized. That's why schools teach boys every single day that they must "man up" because if he doesn't then he'll get beat down by his peers. That's also part of why many families don't even allow daughters to drive cars until age 18-21. Those patterns take generations to change. And then times get harder yet again (as they always seem to), thus reinforcing those beliefs by creating circumstances where most women will never reach independence anyway. I think that once some new generation realizes that having a penis isn't required for happiness or success, they won't feel compelled to name their sons Alfred nor feel any sense of loss. They'd just laugh. Now I'm rambling. My point is simply, naming babies after sex organs is foolish since it creates impossible expectations....not much different than telling someone you're going to marry your best friend's sister. Instead, men and women should consider giving each other nicknames without assigning specific meaning to them and letting each person determine whether or not they want kids of their own based off personal preferences within a long term relationship. To me, that kind of arrangement adds respect to marriage." Followers About Me After years of trying unsuccessfully to have biological children, we decided to adopt two beautiful toddlers.
