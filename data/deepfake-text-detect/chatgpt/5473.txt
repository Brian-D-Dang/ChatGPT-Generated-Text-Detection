Posting on my secondary for obvious reasons I grew up in a extremely abusive house. I dreaded coming home and the site of my mom made my heart skip a beat every time I walked into our bedroom window watching the movie theater screen while the room was dark inside my parents' living room! Thankfully, my mom used to be able to take me shopping at Macy's instead which meant that I had nothing better than a quick look around the store without having to rush out of there promptly afterward. Be sure not only did my dad help me with my homework but also helped me make my friends laugh when they picked me up from school because my mom kept telling them stories about my favorite cartoon character from the cartoon series Spongebob Squarepants! This led to me owning my first real home gym membership (now I just need to find myself one!) and finally becoming a member of Fitness Forever club where I now spend most weekends exercising independently! I'm thankful everyday for those moments like this thanks to my friends who have been so supportive through thick and thin!
