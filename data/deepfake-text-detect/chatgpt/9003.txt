This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I believe the reason why we focused on these causes is because it would allow us to focus on other areas of our lives and not those which we consider to be essential at all times in order to manage interpersonal conflicts and seek to simplify life for ourselves and our loved ones. But what if you had forgotten about them? What if you were missing out on important things like the relationship between the person who gave birth and the family who helped take care of himher? Would you want to lose track of time or lose time with your children, or even just get rid of time when you really need it? Or perhaps it's better to ignore as much as possible in order to find something interesting to do in the future. It becomes a valuable skill in itself, particularly if there are many opportunities available to you right now (even if you don't usually pursue such activities). It also helps to remember that we sometimes have an obligation to re-evaluate and resolve some difficult situations rather than try to hold onto something forever until we can finally look forward again to it. So, here are my top reasons to justify why this approach is beneficial..
