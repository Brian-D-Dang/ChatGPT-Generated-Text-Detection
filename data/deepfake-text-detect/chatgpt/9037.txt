Written hastily, but hopefully I can clarify any mistakes in comments, here we go: The Confederacy was racist according to the cornerstone speech and secession papers (tx): [Cornerstone Speech] excerpt from J. Edgar Hoover's post-Civil War history as a White House Official [The Constitution Martin Luther King Jr.'s Views on the Civil Rights Movement], edited by Charles P. Jones, authored by John W. Dyson and published by Murs Publishing Corporation. I've been trying to figure out what happened with the entire process of DeSantis' speech how it was constructed, where he started, and why I thought that his reasons for opening it were inappropriate... But perhaps most likely is this: In a world increasingly engaged with Big Government and corporate profits, DeSantis' speech highlights the importance of the civil rights movement which has been at the center of Republican politics since before the 1960s, and thus far has not found an outlet outside its institutions and mainstream media outlets. With this in mind, the key question is whether there are still enough "political" voices out there today who want to tell the story about the legacy of DeSantis or if they should focus more on how he helped them through their own efforts and failure to keep themselves alive? Update: It seems like the majority of the people who read this article don't know that DeSantis actually supported Trump during the primary election. This disturbing line in DeSantis' speech was also added to the accompanying transcript below: 1) What exactly did DeSantis say in this speech? 2) Why does DeSantis support big government and corporate profit over the interests of all Americans? 3) How do you feel about the concept that "we must always be united in our resolve?" 4) Is DeSantis really so complicit in white supremacist ideology? 5) Does DeSantis reflect the views of many different groups within the right-wing media or just some, mostly non-nationalists? 6) If anything, why is DeSantis supporting these same organizations when he doesn't even represent one! 7) Has anyone else noticed that, as the title suggests, he had no part in the original speech? And, while the State Department called him out as "a former governor of Florida," as DeSantis stated, why didn't the State Department send him a copy of the speech? This would make sense because DeSantis wouldn't have needed to explain himself publicly to get approval for his speech. Also, why couldn't the State Department have approved the copy of the speech... 8) As some people noted earlier this month (and given the fact that it was written in English), DeSantis wasn't even using the words to describe Donald Trump.... Do voters care enough about fundamental issues within the GOP to seek clarification of DeSantis opinions? Or do they just think the GOP chief of staff is too partisan to understand how DeSantis views important issues? 9) Given the [Republican Party] establishment's preference for keeping President Barack Obama in office, should the party endorse Hillary Clinton again in 2016? 10) After years of campaigning, the Social Security Administration still isn't fully funded (yet). Why should it remain open to the public? 11) Would there be still ongoing funding for Medicare Part B if Democrats took control of Congress? 12) Are there other circumstances that could potentially hinder the IRS from delivering oversight results to the states? 13) Does DeSantis stand against state governments? Is he calling for states to establish the authority for reforms to the federal budget? 14) Did DeSantis vote for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act? Which would result in him being able to veto legislation that would require insurers to cover pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and heart disease? 15) Has DeSantis ever endorsed a bill or plan that would allow the appointment of judges appointed by a president? How much would taxpayers pay in taxes? Constitutional reform, de facto or constitutionally, is how public policy works. Who knows, but perhaps he should appeal?
