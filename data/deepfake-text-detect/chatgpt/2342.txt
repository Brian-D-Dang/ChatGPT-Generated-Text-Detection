My post is inspired by [this article] in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell "shares" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their education. The proposal specifically calls out the idea that revenue from such sales could be used as an alternative source of government funds and potential assistance with student loan debt, suggesting it would help solve both problems at once (something I agree with). I don't know how this might work technically; perhaps some kind of blind bidding process where bids are made based on expected returns rather than income projections? It seems like there ought to be easier ways to do something similar though, so there may more sophisticated approaches already being considered or even implemented elsewhere...
