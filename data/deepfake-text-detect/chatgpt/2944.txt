There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: spelling Thanks for sharing this! I have been wondering about how to go into an event like that without seeming judgmental if someone appears disabled or unable to participate as much as others.
