A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was removed (I know he's been discussed for years) but removing him at this point wouldn't really make a difference to the game overall other than making it more fun and competitive. Some people like Sniper though... Not saying they should remove him, just letting you know.
