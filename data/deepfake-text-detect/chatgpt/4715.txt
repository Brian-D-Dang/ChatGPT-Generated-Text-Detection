tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to the NFL or other major League Sports, my wife and I manage to catch most of them. Last year was one of those years where we were able to see some really good football with both teams winning playoff spots. As somebody who likes watching these things regularly and for many reasons including: (1) social interaction (2) entertainment value-right now (3) excitementsuspense level...it's hard not to love what is happening in the world of professional football right now! Yes there are plenty of injuries, roster movement, off field drama etc. But at this point it feels like most people on either side of the ball are still focused on doing their job while trying to get better before they have another chance to play again. The main storyline has been about players improving themselves and getting healthy and that is great because nothing makes me happier than seeing an athlete improve his skills. With all that being said why would anybody want to take away something from the "regular" season which historically has provided: (a) some quality team vs team matchups (b) better overall storylines then during playoffs (c) fun competitive environment for fans especially if your favorite player gets injured or leaves the team early due to injury (d) potentially memorable moments such as Jameis Winston taking over against Atlanta last December 1st leading Tampa Bay back into sight after going down 21 points behind midway through the 4th quarter only to win by 31 gators victory over Panthers). Now after 10 weeks of non stop action what does that leave us? It ends next week so unless you're just here for the fat lady to sing at Superbowl 50 then there will be no more league wide competition between two teams until sometime around 2020. So let's start with the obvious....the regular season isn't "exciting," nor can any of the games even remotely compare to the intensity of playoff games. When you consider how long it takes to develop offense, defense and special teams schemes along with coaching staff working together to make sure the playbook works correctly...you may understand that even though they have fewer practices (or none), each coach tries to teach what he thinks best prepares his group for upcoming situations based on stats collected throughout training camp preseason. As well, coaches aren't allowed to schedule certain plays without permission from management because of rules regarding substitution patterns during actual games. So even though Belichick knows every detail of Tom Brady's ability to throw accuracy up top or out route combinations for Gronk - on Sunday night,he couldn't put it in the playbook. Coaches simply won't tell opposing defenses receivers running routes or running backs blocking assignments ahead of time. A number of factors are involved: timing, maintaining communication amongst teammates, maximizing the use of limited practice time (which essentially means less instruction needed during game day), penalties called against offensive coordinators after multiple examples caught on film taken during practice setting up opponents offenses (i.e., clock stoppage penalty on 3rd down incompletion thrown short pass across middle). Also critical to understanding the difference between "REAL" football and simulated practice fields versus real life scenarios is what happens once the final whistle blows. There certainly will be lots of 5 yard passes (and longer ones too) on Sundays - but unless the QB happens to complete a 20yd strike to Browner or Rogers,are they going to stand way upfield to block him? And remember the refs blow whistles instead of throwing flags. What separates the truly GREAT quarterbacks from average ones is having enough arm strength and touch accuracy inside the numbers to overcome poor defensive technique on standard coverage schemes. We saw Manning win MVP at age 37 despite often missing throws on intermediate ranges on deep outs and slants outside the numbers missing wide open targets on shorter crossing routes underneath. In fact, part of the reason Manning was so great at playing quarterback in today's NFL and beyond is what made him successful from ages 19 thru 32 he worked harder than anyone else did to perfect his passing abilities and learn new mechanics and mental strategies to maximize off a big leg kick fake plus the ability to move forward or backwards within the pocket without losing balance. Peyton also proved himself capable of making big progressions on plays requiring eyesight and anticipation of defenders moving closer toward his body angles. He became proficient at reading blitzes, identifying safeties movements before they explode. He perfected timing throws with TE Jermaine Gresham using his receiver's drop foot motion rather than waiting until he arrived at full stride to release the ball to clear separation speed. All of this enabled him to put constant pressure upon defenses in order to force mistakes and turnovers enabling him to win games. At times his mobility had become almost legendary. With Manning now 40 yrs old however he still managed to beat Carolina twice on last drive opportunity scoring TDs both times with 11 seconds left on the clock.
