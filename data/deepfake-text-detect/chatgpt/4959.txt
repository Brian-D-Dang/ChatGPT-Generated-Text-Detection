I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot someone who was killing children? Let me tell you something else: every child makes mistakes; every cop should be guilty of some crime if they attack another person, regardless of age. Why don't we look at how much less crimes are committed by police officers than criminals these days? What do cops deserve to be convicted in this country compared with criminals nowadays:? Why do most people complain when a kid gets hurt during an incident like this? Even if it is really just for fun, obviously everyone involved deserves punishment but there's so many other things this does not seem fair....
