I am a fan of many sports, and all of them seem to take a lot of skill. But golf has always been the one I hated. It's always been my favorite sport in America with the exception that it involves leaving your home country after you've finished playing tournaments there as if they are not taking your money out at the end of tournament week like the UFC or UFC fights do when you're traveling abroad for work. When I was growing up most people say America isn't really far away from football but this is just not true anymore because everyone knows you can practice different countries depending on where you live so that means no Americans even play baseball. Everything else seems to be better than other nations except soccer which is definitely foreign though (although it still looks good).
