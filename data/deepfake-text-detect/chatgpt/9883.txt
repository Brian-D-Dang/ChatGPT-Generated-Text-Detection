I'm a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find sillytrivial. I'm currently dating a girl who is a feminist and I respect her views. I believe in equality between genders and think we should all have equal opportunities no matter what our gender is. I also support the idea of women having more rights and being respected and appreciated for their hard work and achievements. I don't think that men should be seen as superior to women, and I don't think that feminism is about hating men. I think it is about creating a better world for everyone, regardless of gender.
