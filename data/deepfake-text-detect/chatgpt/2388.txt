Written hastily, but hopefully I can clarify any mistakes in comments, here we go: The Confederacy was racist according to the cornerstone speech and secession papers (tx): [Cornerstone Speech] excerpt ed below. Secession PapersDeclaration of Causes - excerpts as well. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; "That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights"; That among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." Declaration of Independence The Confederate States were founded on principles which denied equality between humans - whites over blacks, slave owners over slaves etc... Several documents from confederate founding fathers document this. Below is one example, it reads like a letter written back home during slavery times. It's interesting how similar some views remain today 40 years after 'Civil Right' era vs 60 since Civil War ended..? But why let facts get in your way when you have truthiness! If you had bothered reading some history or spending more than 5 minuets talking about what CSA stood for instead of playing games, maybe North might not look so bad now. You know if you weren't such an ignorant fool who thinks he knows everything there would only be southerners left;) Here's my take on the matter...I am from Virginia originally, born raised near Richmond. My ancestors fought both sides of the civil war - Union then Confederates. They came from CT, NY, AR, LA, KY (including Brownsville) TX, MO., MS, AL GA. Some served willingly while others were drafted into service. While I respect those great American Patriots buried at Arlington cemetery almost equally divided between Union Confederate soldiers, I do feel differently regarding Southern heritage versus Northern pride. As far as slavery goes....Whites AND Blacks owned other Whites Black people before slavery ever existed......and I think it horrible that either side enslaved another human being based upon color alone.....but neither party should claim superiority because of their actions relative to slavery when each group did just as much for "their own kind" regardless of race. To me, US History begins right around 1776 until 1865....when America became 2 separate countries separated by a massive river called THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER!! Who wants to battle across THAT?? Still trying to figure out WHY??? All kidding aside, most Southerners who still cling to racism need to understand something profound. Most African Americans will say without hesitation that BETTER THINGS HAPPENED FOR THEM IN THEIR LIVES DURING SLAVERY THEN THEY EVER DID AFTER IT WAS ABOLISHED!!!!! People often ask me where I stand politically............WWJD????????? God bless you guys!!! No hard feelings
