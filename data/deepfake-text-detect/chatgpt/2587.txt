I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most likely true for liquid lipsticklongwear lipsticks because that stuff is so thick; but foundationconcealer tends to take even longer than moisturizer or sunscreen does 2) After you're done putting it on your face looks funny in some way. Maybe just me? 3) My hands are usually super greasy after using any sort of powder blush (powder bronzer doesn't seem as bad). 4) The initial purchase price might be worth the lack of time spent applying make-up if you do not apply much on your face throughout the day - but there isn't really an easy way to get rid of all the extra product once you finish with it... unless you want to buy more! 5) This story needs a sixth bullet point Honestly I don't understand why people wear make up at all then lol
