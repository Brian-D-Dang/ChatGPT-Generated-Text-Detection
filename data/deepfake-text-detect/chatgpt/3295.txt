Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable that humans play a significant role in the Federation, as they were one of the founding members and have a long history of exploration and diplomacy. However, it is important to note that the Federation values diversity and equal representation, and non-human species hold important roles as well. It is also important to recognize that humans may have different skills and abilities that are valued in leadership positions. Ultimately, the Federation strives to operate on a merit-based system where individuals are recognized for their abilities, rather than their species.
