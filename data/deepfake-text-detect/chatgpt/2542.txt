Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women in business - they seem to focus on telling little girls that it's not as cool to be male and female at the same time, while young boys are encouraged to like things that are "manly" (and by this is meant manly-ish). How do you try to get more men interested in being feminine? Because a lot of them really need help with that. I have had many conversations recently with my son who has been struggling with his sexual identity, he is 13 (M) often doesn't feel comfortable w himself..from what i gather, throughout all stages of life...men can tend to be 'over' masculine, either from an early age where they start playing sports instead of dolls or due to peer pressure along wother outside influences....i am not sure how much we can change their perception of themselves but we can certainly educate our children about being accepting of others regardless of gender differences. i know for me growing up wmy mom as a single mother was definitely difficultbut she did her best; raising both myself sister alone in the middle class neighborhood that we lived in.......she taught us so well about respecting everyone else's beliefs whether religious or nonreligious etc., but also showed us when someone did something inappropriate or wrong..it wasn't right no matter your gender, ethnicity, culture, nationality etc.....we were blessed to live in such a diverse community, some great friendsneighbors surrounded ourselves wpeople of different backgrounds..this played a huge part in allowing us all to see each other equally!:)....nowadays these days however there seems to be much division among races religions...even genders too...as parents we must continue to teach our children tolerance towards one anothernot only because it makes sense ethicallybut just simply based upon human compassion!! a lil bit goes a long way!...on my end im grateful that even though he struggles with his sexuality at times...he knows deep down inside that...noone should judge himmy hope is if he continues to seek God daily... yes at times does struggle whimself...that God will lead him to where he needs to go...allowing Him to further develop into a loving person who won't discriminate against anyone!.....i think back at times when i used to play with BarbiesHeMan toys 7yrs old wmy sisters brother...the battles between good vs evil always intrigued me......i developed quite the imagination because of those simple games...im thankful for that...allowing me to grow into the woman that i became todaywishing the same blessings upon ur family! take care!:)
