To me, online entertainment is such a flip of a coin. You either get a partnership or you don't, and even if you do get the partnership, there's no saying that your content will always be successful. However, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of success: 1. Take the time to research what content is popular and trending on various platforms. This can help guide you in creating content that is more likely to be well-received. 2. Consistency is key. Create a schedule and stick to it, whether it's daily or weekly uploads. This helps your viewers to know when to expect new content from you and builds trust and loyalty with your audience. 3. Engage with your audience. Responding to comments and messages not only shows that you care about your community, but it also gives you valuable feedback about what your viewers like and want to see more of. 4. Collaborate with other creators who have a similar audience or niche. This can help expose your content to a new audience and potentially open up new partnership and sponsorship opportunities. 5. Keep evolving and experimenting with your content. Don't be afraid to try new things, as this can help keep your content fresh and interesting to viewers. Just be sure to listen to feedback and adapt accordingly.
