It can be argued that the global war on terror, which began after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, was fought to protect the freedom of citizens in the United States and other Western countries. This war has been fought on multiple fronts, including in Afghanistan and Iraq, and has resulted in the deaths of thousands of soldiers and civilians. While opinions may vary on the effectiveness of this fight, it cannot be denied that it was launched with the purpose of protecting the freedom and security of citizens in the free world.
