We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been "thin shamed" or "skinny shamed" by another woman. I don't see how that is possible in American society, where it's acceptable for a man to be fat and unattractive and still go on with his life as if nothing happened. I've never heard of skinny shaming before but now I'm curious about what the heck you're talking about
