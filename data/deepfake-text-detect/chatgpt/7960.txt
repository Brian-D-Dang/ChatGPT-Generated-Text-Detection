While some individuals with right-wing views may prioritize individualism and self-reliance, there are many right-wing policies that prioritize the greater good, such as free-market economics and a strong national defense. Similarly, while left-wing views may prioritize collectivism and social welfare, there are some policies that could be argued as being selfish, such as taking from the wealthy to provide for the poor or implementing policies that disproportionately benefit certain marginalized groups. It's important to avoid painting broad strokes about political ideologies and instead analyze policies and their potential impacts.
