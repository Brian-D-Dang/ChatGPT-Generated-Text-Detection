In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want it has never been prohibited in any civilized society. I guess the answer might be to shut up and let them do what they want with their bodies, but I think forcing sex on someone who doesn't feel comfortable having sex turns out pretty ugly (and also reminds me so much about how many people have sexual intercourse).
