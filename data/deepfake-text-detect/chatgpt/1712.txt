I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any money left in the fund for them after their decommissioning, I'd like for my family and friends who are elderly or terminally ill to have access to funds so we may live out our lives with dignity. If you're going off of what Abraham Lincoln said about ending slavery on your own dime because "it was wrong," then I'm sorry but no one cares if you die alone
