One could argue that social issues are just one of many factors that determine a presidential election. While it is true that they can be important to some voters, other issues such as the economy, national security, healthcare, and education often take precedence. Additionally, voters are not monolithic in their beliefs and values. Republicans who align more with the party's fiscal conservative values may overlook differences in social stances in choosing a candidate. Furthermore, political parties are capable of changing and adapting their platforms and messaging to appeal to voters, as seen in the evolution of the Republican Party over the years. While social issues may play a role in the party's success, it is not the sole determining factor in presidential elections.
