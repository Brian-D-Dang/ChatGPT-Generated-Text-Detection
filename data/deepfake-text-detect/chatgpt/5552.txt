Being transgender and wanting surgeryhormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think they're pretty much the same thing as the surgery, but I'm not sure. I think hormonal treatment is slightly less invasive than surgery. The following are my opinions on some of the problems with being transgender and wanting surgery or hormonal treatment. 1) An all too common side effect is feeling like you're not transgender enough. It feels like people who get this treatment are not being true to themselves. 2) The cost of surgery is too high. 3) You're going to be miserable for several weeks, if not months, while your body adjusts to the new medication. 4) It's not going to make you happy, it's only going to make you more comfortable. 5) You're going to be out of pocket for the medication. Depending on what pills you take, you could be talking about 1000 a month, which could take you a while to pay back. 6) The pills are only going to work so long, and then you're going to have to go back to a doctor to get new ones. 7) The hormones can have side effects. 8) Your body is going to be a different shape for the rest of your life. 9) Your privacy is being invaded, and people are going to treat you differently. 10) There is the risk of serious medical complications, such as blood clots. 11) You might not actually be transgender, but just going through a phase. 12) You could be putting your health at risk. 13) You have to tell everyone you know about your new gender. 14) Some people think you're doing it for attention. 15) You could die during the surgery, or die from other serious complications. 16) You're going to be miserable for several weeks, if not months, while your body adjusts to the new medication. 17) It's not going to make you happy, it's only going to make you more comfortable. 18) You're going to be out of pocket for the medication.
