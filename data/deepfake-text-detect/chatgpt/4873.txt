I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is what I would expect from a "progressive." Yet, if he's not in it, then maybe there is room for someone else who can take some of those voters? As far as Hillary goes, she really isn't my ideal choice by any means since her positions on many issues aren't progressive at all, but rather center-left or even right wing. But regardless of how much you dislike Clinton, this poll shows that nearly 23rds of the country still view Trump negatively enough to vote against him anyway. That doesn't sound too great either, especially when up until now we haven't seen anything to indicate that he'd actually be capable of leading us anywhere useful. So while I do think Bernie could help with BLM, Rb and other left leaning groups, I don't believe they'll pull more than 1 of Clinton's votes away...which shouldn't affect the election very much anyways. And so long as people feel like voting blue or red instead of greenorange, we might just end up doing better under Obama again in 2016. Either way though, whether or not we have an actual Green Party leader involved, the fact that 3 out of 4 Americans see so much potential danger in having Donald J. Trump sitting behind a desk seems pretty scary to me. If nothing else, it makes me want to get back into politics on both sides of the aisle anytime soon! With regards to your question about whether or not Bernie will be helping BLM, I'm going to say no simply because he's not the only one interested in these kinds of things anymore. It used to be where every major party had their own political representatives dedicated solely towards working to improve society and reduce inequalities. Nowadays however, you've got unions devoted specifically toward certain industries which provide their members with benefits upon joining, governments providing healthcare to citizens, etc. There was a time where national parties were almost always opposed to eachother regarding issues involving labor rights and equality, and yet here we are today, with the Democrats mostly being pro-laborsocialist and Republicans usually anti-union and generally anti-equalitarianism; hardly anyone ever brings them together. Unfortunately, the divide between the two has caused countless problems throughout history without a doubt, and although I certainly don't disagree that a new third force would benefit our current state of affairs, I also personally find motives of wanting to bring everyone together along with typical democratic ideals somewhat contradictory - after all, why should politicians care about improving conditions for all of its constituents if it weren't somehow beneficial to themselves (i.e.; money)? The point I'm trying to make is that there already exists plenty of representation within America and it looks like the public is becoming increasingly frustrated with traditional partisan divides thanks to social media lines that separate people based on their views. As such, Bernie couldn't possibly hope to earn much of his platform's popularity through the Democratic primary alone, and thus I don't foresee him gaining much traction among disenfranchised leftists whatsoever. However, I suppose we'll never truly know unless he indeed does run...but given the current climate, it wouldn't surprise me to see him get squeezed out of the race before it reaches the general elections either. At least it won't keep us from having a viable Green alternative available for future elections, eh? Last edited by mikemoleman; 10th November 2015 at 12:41 PM. Reason: Sorry if I sounded snarky..it wasn't meant to come across that way. There is absolutely zero chance that Hilliary will lose the nomination. She is incredibly popular amongst blacks and Latinos, despite everything though, and there is no indication that she will drop below 50. Moreover, she outspent Bloomberg 5:1 to ensure that she didn't lose. While she may have distanced herself from Bush during the primaries, her presidential campaign will remain strongly committed to maintaining the strong ties among African American and Latino communities. Outside of the black community, however, there is little evidence that Hillary represents anything except pure Republican propaganda, something that is extremely unlikely to go over well outside of the south. Her success hinges entirely and completely on the South, and even Santorum managed to beat Romney 93-7 there. It is definitely possible for Donald to win the presidency, but he needs to expand beyond small pockets of evangelical Christianity. He must work hard to convince minorities to continue supporting him once they realize that he is merely another white man whose values are deeply rooted in racist traditions. He has done exactly what Nixon did, pushing Bill Ayers, Jeremiah Wright, Al Sharpton and Rev. Abby Johnson around like puppets on strings, hoping that blowing smoke up various liberals' asses while painting himself as a non-racist will fool them. In reality, it hasn't worked at all. Sure, he took advantage of the easily distracted liberal brain trust to give off rumors about fire and security threats. But the first, right? What happens next? Adults, adults. Their one juvenile delinquents overpopulation of monsters. "
