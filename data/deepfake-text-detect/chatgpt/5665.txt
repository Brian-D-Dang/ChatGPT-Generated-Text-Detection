Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians, not military targets. The Japanese Empire was already beaten, and the Emperor was willing to surrender unconditionally. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were acts of murder, not acts of justice. 2. It was a violation of the Geneva Convention. 3. It was an act of cowardice. The Japanese were known to fight to the last man, just like the Germans. America could have invaded Japan as we did Germany, and forced the surrender of Japan the same way we did Germany. 4. It was also an act of revenge. The Japanese were blamed for Pearl Harbor, but in fact the Japanese were tricked by the Americans. The Japanese didn't even know that Pearl Harbor was to be attacked until it had already been done. The Japanese were blamed for Pearl Harbor because they were the best-known enemy of America. The Americans simply needed a scapegoat, and the Japanese were the perfect scapegoat. 5. And finally, the bombings were simply unnecessary. The war was already over. It would have been so easy to simply have asked Japan to surrender. It could have been done at Iwo Jima. All it would have taken would have been a USNS ship carrying a letter and a Japanese interpreter. The Japanese would have gladly surrendered if they were asked to, and their Emperor would have been allowed to remain as a symbolic ruler. I consider dropping the atomic bombs to be the biggest mistake America has ever made. I think we've been paying the price for it for the last 60 years, and I don't think we will ever be able to pay it off. The primary reason why we dropped the bombs was to show the Russians that we had a bomb. The second reason was to show the Japanese what we could do. The third reason was to end the war. The fourth reason was to reduce the number of casualties in the invasion of Japan. I hold this view because the people who say that Japan was "nuked into submission" are simply ignorant of the facts. It was not just Hiroshima and Nagasaki that were nuked. 129 cities were also bombed. Most of us Americans only know of Hiroshima and Nagasaki because of the fact that they were the only cities that were nuked. I think it was a mistake, but I don't think it was an act of cowardice. I think it was the best thing to do. It would have been much worse had Japan not surrendered. I agree with most of what you have stated, except 2, the Geneva convention. The Japanese were not under its jurisdiction. The Japanese were a conquered race, in a conquered nation. The United States was not subject to the Geneva convention, and we were not bound by it. The Japanese were not under its jurisdiction. The Japanese were a conquered race, in a conquered nation. The United States was not subject to the Geneva convention, and we were not bound by it. Why were we not bound by it? We could have simply just ended the war, and asked Japan to surrender. We knew that they would have, and that the Japanese Emperor would have remained as a symbolic ruler. It wasn't cowardice, it was the only way to end the war. We were under no obligation to comply with the Geneva convention, or the Declaration of Human Rights. We weren't obligated to treat the Japanese the same way we treat our own troops. I'm not saying that the Japanese didn't suffer. I'm not saying that the Japanese were treated poorly. I'm not saying that we should have treated the Japanese the same way we treat our own troops. I'm not saying that the Japanese weren't forced into becoming soldiers. I'm not saying that the Japanese didn't die. I'm simply saying that the war was already over. The Japanese were not under the Geneva convention. We could have ended the war by simply asking them to surrender. That would have been much easier than invading Japan. It was also an act of cowardice. If you want to attack Japan, go ahead. It was only a matter of time before we had to, anyway. But a reasonable person would have asked the Japanese to surrender first. The American people and the American Government did not want to ask Japan to surrender because they didn't want to be called cowards. The Japanese weren'
