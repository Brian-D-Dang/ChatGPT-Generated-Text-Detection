For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system where the government owns the means of production and distributes goods and services to the citizens. I am also assuming that we can agree that the reason to exist of a government is to provide protection of its citizens' lives, liberty and property, and that this protection is the primary function of government. I think that the consensus in the US is that capitalism works better than socialism, and has lifted the standard of living of the majority of citizens in the US to a higher level than in other countries. However, there are still a lot of socialists in the US, and a lot of people who would like to implement socialist policies. My premise is that the US government, as a representative of the people, should not be able to use its power to do things that are in violation of the individual rights of the citizens. Any government that cannot do this is either not a government at all, or one that is a puppet of some other government, and is not subject to the will of the people who live in the nation. My premise is that, in order for a government to protect the lives, liberty and property of its citizens, it must not be able to violate those rights. A government must not be able to take away a person's property (by force or by coercion) in order to give that property to someone else, or to give the money to the government, or to use the property for some other purpose, unless it can first obtain the property voluntarily from the owner. A government must not be able to use force to take a person's labor to use for some other purpose, unless it can first obtain the labor voluntarily from the worker. A government must not be able to use force to take a person's money or property to use for some other purpose, unless it can first obtain the money or property voluntarily from the owner. A government must not be able to use force to take a person's labor to use for some other purpose, unless it can first obtain the labor voluntarily from the worker. I think that many of the socialists have good intentions, and want to help the "have-nots." They see the government as a means to help the poor and the needy. However, they are not able to see the unintended consequences of their policies. They do not see that by violating individual rights they are actually hurting those they intend to help. The Constitution of the United States was set up to protect individual rights, and government is supposed to uphold those rights. Capitalism thrives on a free market and a government that protects individual rights. Socialism requires violation of individual rights in order to work. One of the unintended consequences of socialism is that it causes the most capable people to withdraw from society, because they are the ones who are most directly affected by its policies. That is the reason for the high unemployment in socialist countries. The people that remain are the least capable, and those are the ones who need the help the most. So, the socialist policies actually end up harming the "have-nots" more than they help them, because the socialist policies cause the "have-nots" to be even more of a drag on the economy than they were before. Socialism requires the violation of individual rights in order to work, and capitalism thrives on a free market and a government that protects individual rights. Capitalism does not require the violation of individual rights in order to work. There is no way to have a free market without individual rights. A free market cannot work if the government uses force to take from the producers to give to the consumers. I think that the reason that socialists have trouble seeing this is that they are not able to see the unintended consequences of their actions. If you violate individual rights you end up harming the people you are trying to help. What would socialism look like in the USA? What would socialism look like in the USA? If we had socialism we would have no unemployment, no homelessness, and everyone would have what they need. All the government would do is redistribute the wealth, and the money and property of the producers would be used to provide for the needy. Socialism is the best system because it helps the needy and it does not require the government to violate individual rights. If we had socialism we would have no unemployment, no homelessness, and everyone would have what they need. Capitalism is the worst system because it causes unemployment, homeless
