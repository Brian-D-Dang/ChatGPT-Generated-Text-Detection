In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals , or lack confidence in sending out dogs with parents who want more time on the dog park. Canadians will now have a better chance of winning the argument about animal cruelty if they understand what cruelty is really like. We don't need to lose sight of the fact that animals suffer during harsh weather conditions but we also shouldn't forget it's only cruelty when faced with heatstroke or dehydration. Given the urgency for us all to be aware of the dangers of our pets being left alone in hot cars or confined indoors due to extreme temperatures, I urge animal advocates across Canada to become active members of the community by listening closely to those organisations advocating wildlife protection efforts.
