We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been "thin shamed" or "skinny shamed" by another woman. I don't see how that is possible in American society, because so many women are thin and skinny. It is their body type and I see it all the time. And I think it's a bit ridiculous. I have tried to be slender, but it just doesn't happen. I was actually slender when I was a teenager. But I wasn't thin. When I was about 16, my mother was on a big Weight Watchers campaign, and was actually thin at that time. She's not anymore, but that was her body type. I was the opposite. But my mother and I have never really got along. But I always tried to diet, not because I wanted to be slender, but because I wanted to be thin. The problem was, I just couldn't do it. And I gave up when I was 25, as I had gained weight, but was still quite thin and never had a problem. I have come to accept that I will always be thin, that I'm not going to get any thinner, and that I'm going to stay thin forever. That's not a big deal. I was always thin, and if I become obese and gain a lot of weight, I'm not going to be able to do anything about it. And I'm not going to be able to be thinner. So I need to accept myself as I am. There are a lot of women who are thin, but who aren't slender. That's just a different body type. They are thin, but not slender, and their bodies are thin, but they have bumps on their arms and legs. They are slender, but they have a small bust. And they are flat chested, but they are still a D cup. So thin women who are not slender can't have any problems with skinny shaming, because there are lots of women who are thin, but not slender, and they will be skinny shamed as well. So skinny shaming is just not possible. And it's not a problem for thin women to be skinny shamed, because they are skinny. And thin women who are not slender are probably going to be more at risk of being thin shamed, because they are not as skinny as the thinnest women. Thin women who are not slender can have a problem with thin shaming, but it's not a problem for thin women to be skinny shamed. We don't see thin women being skinny shamed, because there are so many thin women, and thin women who are not slender are skinny shamed. And thin women who are not slender can have a problem with being skinny shamed, because there are so many thin women, and there are also skinny women who are not slender. And we have to accept that we will always be thin, and we can't control our body weight, and that it's not our fault that we are thin, and it's not our fault that we have a different body type. And we need to learn to accept ourselves as we are, and we need to accept that we will always be thin. Labels: Fat, Ridiculous, Skinny, Skinny Shaming, Thin, Thin Shaming, Women
