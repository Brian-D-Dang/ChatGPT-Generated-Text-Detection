I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends who have faced discrimination and hate for being themselves. I feel privileged to have grown up in a supportive family and I want to use that privilege to help others who may not have the same support system. Do you have any suggestions for how I can show my support and be a helpful ally to those who face discrimination?
