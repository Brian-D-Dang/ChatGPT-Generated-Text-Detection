I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still do not feel they are helping their cause with this type of protest. It is my belief that this type of protest is only hurting our cause. I then stated that I am a democrat, but am not a part of the BLM because I do not believe the way to solve our problem with police violence is to antagonize the police. To me this is the same as asking the police to stop killing black people and then antagonizing them when they refuse to do so. I believe a large part of the problem is that we are telling the police what they should be doing. I understand that they have no right to kill anyone, but I do not believe that by telling them to stop killing black people that they will stop doing so. I then responded with a question to my friend. If we were to tell the police that they should not kill people of any race, would that be a more effective approach? My friend responded with an argument that the BLM is not telling the police that they should not kill people of any race, they are telling them to stop killing black people. I disagree, this is exactly what they are doing. This is my argument against the BLM. First, I want to make it clear that I do not believe the police should be killing people at all. I also understand the impulse of those who want to stop the police from killing people. However, I do not believe the current approach of the BLM is effective. I believe that the current approach will create a war between the police and black people that will only escalate the problem. I believe that the current approach is a dangerous approach that will only lead to more black people getting killed by the police and more police getting killed by black people. The reason I believe this approach is dangerous is that the police will be more inclined to kill black people because they are more likely to think they are the target of the BLM. If I told the police that they should not kill any person of any race, I do not believe that I would be more inclined to kill black people. I believe that this approach will only lead to more police deaths. I believe that the police will be more likely to respond to any threat by using more deadly force. I believe that because they are more likely to perceive that they are the target of the BLM they will be more likely to use deadly force when faced with a perceived threat. It is also my belief that the current approach will only lead to more black people getting killed by police. I believe this because the police will be more likely to respond to any threat by using more deadly force. I believe that because they are more likely to perceive that they are the target of the BLM they will be more likely to use deadly force when faced with a perceived threat. This will only lead to more black people getting killed by the police. The third reason I believe that the current approach is dangerous is that I believe that it will lead to more black people being killed by black people. I believe that because the police are more likely to perceive that they are the target of the BLM they will be more likely to use deadly force when faced with a perceived threat. I believe that because the police are more likely to perceive that they are the target of the BLM they will be more likely to use deadly force when faced with a perceived threat. This will only lead to more black people getting killed by black people. The current approach of the BLM is also dangerous because it will lead to more black people getting killed by police because of the perceived threat. I believe this because the police will be more likely to perceive that they are the target of the BLM they will be more likely to use deadly force when faced with a perceived threat. This will only lead to more black people getting killed by police because of the perceived threat. This approach is also dangerous because it will lead to more black people getting killed by black people because of the perceived threat. I believe this because the police will be more likely to perceive that they are the target of the BLM they will be more likely to use deadly force when faced with a perceived threat. This will only lead to more black people getting killed by black people because of the perceived threat. I believe that this approach will only lead to more black people getting killed by police and more black people getting killed by black people. I believe that this is why the BLM was started. I also believe that this is why the BLM has made their protests violent. They are trying to make the police more afraid so that they will respond to them with more deadly force. I do not believe this approach will
