Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can handle this situation with any dignity and grace. I know they're not really killing anyone, but even if it was killable, that doesn't mean you have to do it. The Joker did nothing wrong in taking out his tormentor and that decision saved Batman a lot of grief later on because he could go back to being normal again.
