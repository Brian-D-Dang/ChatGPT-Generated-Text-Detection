I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the right thing to do in a given situation. What makes you so sure? Do you agree with Kant and his categorical imperative or Hume who said we can't know if an action is good without knowing all of its consequences? Would you say these are both examples of one side being objectively correct while another lacks objectivity?
