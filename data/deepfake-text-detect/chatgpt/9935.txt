As a gay man, I can be extremely wary of other people for my own protection. I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate , and so I do my best to stay away from anyone who expresses these feelings. That being said, I also recognize that not everyone who is homophobic is a bad person or someone who is out to hurt me. I try to be open-minded and understanding when it comes to interactions with people who have different views than mine, as long as they are respectful. I believe that it's possible to have productive conversations and even form relationships with those who have different views, and I'm always looking for ways to bridge the divide between us.
