This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special treatment in this country and it's unfair for them (and their victims) They should be treated like adults when they commit crimes or at a certain age limit depending on severity of crime!! (I do believe mandatory sentencing would help with these issues too.)
