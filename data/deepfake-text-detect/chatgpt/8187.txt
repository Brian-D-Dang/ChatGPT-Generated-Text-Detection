So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal at us, what will the US do? Will it just say "We're sorry we attacked you so hard but now that our aircraft carriers are out in deep water these missiles can't reach back to them"? Or maybe something like ..."we regretfully announce today's attack on your country has been cancelled until further notice..." That would be funny:) 2) If China (or anyone else for which such attacks might cause some kind loss or damage...) does NOT launch its own retaliatory strike against Japan THEN - according as far human history goes after hitting FranceBritain first Russia WILL hit Germany next followed by Italy etc... Then when everything gets finished up America itself becomes one target among many 3rd world countries fighting each other every day over who got more land stolen from whom 4th-generation nukes were supposed not only refused being used because there wasn't time left during WWII since USA still didn' t possess any anyway 5) The conclusion comes naturally From above three points When controlling whole Pacific Ocean region including Asian regions nations tend very much towards use nuclear weapons if someone tries attacking those territories.. So why should Japanese territory belong "anywhere" different than others? 1
