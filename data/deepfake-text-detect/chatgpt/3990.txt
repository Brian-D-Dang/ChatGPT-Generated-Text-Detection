This is a view I've read about from various pop psychology sources, and it has become conventional wisdom. I believe it contains some truth. Can you convince me it merely serves to serve as an ossified prejudice? I have always believed that men are more likely than women to be able to act impulsively in the face of uncertainty or emotional confrontation (or even anger). This tendency seems particularly pronounced when they lack control over their emotions - for example when someone says something hurtful to them during their workday, or a loved one dies unexpectedly. It would seem therefore intuitively possible that they might be prone to aggressive behavior if given the opportunity: If someone else is angry at you, can't you just give him what he wants without considering whether it's right? And this could happen on many levels: "The guard dog will bite without realizing his mistake; so let him attack." The upshot would appear to be that women are less aggressive because they're more aware of their limits than men, and thus can take steps to avoid potentially dangerous situations before they erupt into open hostility. But there may also be something more to it. Men may indeed be better suited to cope with chaos and unpredictability than women. In addition, aggression appears to be directly linked to power, which is a powerful motivator for most people, both male and female alike. So while the riskreward ratio suggests that men should be willing to go out of their way to defend themselves against aggression, the reality is probably closer to the other way around. [Here is] how much someone actually needs to know before engaging an aggressively defensive stance." It's hard to say exactly why we men tend to react more aggressively than do our female counterparts...perhaps [we respond] because we haven't developed sufficient tools for dealing with trauma in our lives? Or perhaps it's simply unconscious gender bias? But either way, I think the idea of forming unconscious biases isn't too far off the mark here.
