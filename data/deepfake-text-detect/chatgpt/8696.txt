I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to get out of the way for dupes. On the other hand, if you want a really good used copy of A LOT OF STUFF (which is pretty easy), try using this one from the LidoSkipper collection: Pictures of the original wallet are also excellent examples. They're a little older than mine at this point, but they still look exactly like those that arrived years ago; what're your thoughts on these? Click to expand... Thank you! I think the general consensus here is that these aren't bad enough to be worth hundreds of dollars. My answer to your question would probably be "not bad." I mean, they're not that great otherwise, but I'd say for most people, their value would probably be around .
