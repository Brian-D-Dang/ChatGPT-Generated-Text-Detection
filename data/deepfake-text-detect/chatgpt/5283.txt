To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to be upheld. The Judge ruled the court should not only allow same sex marriages but also uphold the right of states with laws allowing same sex marriages as well. The ruling will advance a historic opportunity for equality, which has drawn national attention since the 2014 vote by the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide."
