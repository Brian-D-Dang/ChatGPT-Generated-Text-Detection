Just as the title says, I firmly believe that the modern interpretation of the hipster does not truly exist and never has. I'm going to link an article from two years ago from a blog called "The Daily Dot" which basically argues the same idea but was written in 2013. I think the author had some good points in there and I agree with most of it. The hipster has always been here. The irony of a hipster writing this article is beyond me. The real hipster doesn't really care what you think about the things they like. They'll just continue doing it and let you all be miserable about it. The hipster is the one who keeps you from being hip. If you don't like something, don't do it. If you want to be hip, keep it simple. If you're an original thinker, then stop complaining about other people being original thinkers. I'm going to continue to be a hipster. I'm going to keep making things and doing things to make me happy and if you don't like it, then keep your thoughts to yourself. My goal in life is to inspire a generation of creative people to be happy and create things that make them happy. People like being happy. Happiness is universal. It's not complicated. It's not ironic. It's not ironic to be a hipster. Being happy doesn't make you a hipster. Being a hipster doesn't make you happy. In fact, being a hipster makes you a hipster. Hipsters are conformists. They conform to the hipster ideals and look down on those who don't. They think it makes them special and unique. Hipsters are the product of the conformity of others. In essence, they are conformists who conform to the concept of being a conformist and yet fail to understand why. The hipster is an outgrowth of the modern consumer. They are people who were bored with the modern consumer and craved something more. They are the ones who didn't want to be the same as everyone else. They are the ones who didn't want to be happy with things the way they are. They are the ones who craved something more. They are the ones who wanted to be more than what was expected of them. They are the ones who wanted to do things for themselves. They are the ones who wanted to be happy. They are the ones who wanted to be unique. They are the ones who wanted to be special. They are the ones who wanted to be independent. They are the ones who wanted to be free. The hipster is the modern rebellion. They are the ones who wanted to stand out. They are the ones who wanted to be different. They are the ones who wanted to do things for themselves. They are the ones who wanted to be unique. They are the ones who wanted to be special. They are the ones who wanted to be independent. They are the ones who wanted to be free. The modern hipster is the modern consumer. They are the ones who wanted to be happy. They are the ones who wanted to buy something new. They are the ones who wanted to buy something to make them happy. They are the ones who wanted to be unique. They are the ones who wanted to stand out. They are the ones who wanted to be special. They are the ones who wanted to be independent. They are the ones who wanted to be free.
