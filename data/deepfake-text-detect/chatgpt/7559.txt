Additionally, the services they utilize are often necessary for their businesses to operate, and they also benefit from the economic stability and workforce provided by these services. Therefore, it could be argued that it is only fair that they pay more in taxes to support the system that has allowed them to thrive and to ensure that these services remain accessible to everyone.
