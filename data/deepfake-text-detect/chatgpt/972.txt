I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically I'm not overly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically it's much less difficult to make a mistake with a refrigerator than it is to injure yourself with a nail gun. But I do have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy.
