I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to terrorism, but I just can't help but think it has to do with the fact that Americans, especially young adults, love this animal and they want to see it thrive and have a place in the wild. Now, I am sure that there are those who don't care, but I think that that is probably because they don't know what the real issues are. Just like the frog story, the media has been pretty crappy at explaining all the issues and showing how they are being solved, and that's where the frustration lies. People just don't know what's going on, so they are too busy reacting to it instead of understanding it. I'm not the kind of person to sit on the sideline and do nothing, so I'm going to educate myself and then I'm going to speak out. It's the least I can do. Anyway, I would really appreciate it if anyone would point me in the right direction of where I should go to learn more about this. Thanks in advance! Labels: animal, black, lion, white Its too easy to see this as "all blacks are victims" and "all whites are evil." If that were the case we would have no animals left. People need to think about the real issues, not the headlines. A lot of conservationists have been working for years to protect endangered species. Its a sad but common problem for many species. I don't have the answer, but I do know that we need to be more aware of the world we live in and do the best we can to make it a better place for all of us.
