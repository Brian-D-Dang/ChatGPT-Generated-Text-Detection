While public schools are designed to offer comprehensive education, they may not suit the needs of all students. Many parents prefer private schooling or homeschooling to provide their children with a more specialized curriculum that is in line with their beliefs or learning style. In addition, banning private schools and homeschooling can create a negative impact on the economy as these institutions contribute significantly to the employment sector. Moreover, the diversity of educational options also encourages competition among schools, leading to enhanced performance standards and better quality of education provided by both public and private institutions. Therefore, instead of banning private and homeschooling, it's essential to improve the quality of education in public schools to foster an inclusive and diverse learning environment.
