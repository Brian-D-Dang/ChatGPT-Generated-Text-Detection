The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here] . Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things , too bad people doing evil things. Don't go looking for someone who will do your bidding...that's what religion does! Naturally those who believe that there exists a superior being exist only through belief in something else than themselves I'm sorry but this isn't what religion teaches anything about skepticism and the Spirituality is about believing in the supernatural. That doesn't mean we should just assume everything wrong with religion comes from the mind of a person based on faith alone though, it means that everyone has their own beliefs which is why religion as mentioned already is false and one thing atheism depends upon itself:)
