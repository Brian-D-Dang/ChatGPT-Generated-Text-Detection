IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say "preposterous" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more people? It's not like people don't know what preposterous means, but the chances that they do are slim and I think it's a good idea to not limit the audience of your story. I like using words that are well used in the day, but no one uses them anymore. It's usually an example of a word I've read that I liked. I usually write a story and then go back and add the words and phrases I want to use. But i usually avoid the thesaurus as much as possible. I'll stick with my usual phrases and words that I've already written. I usually just go with whatever comes out naturally. Sometimes I think about what I'm writing, but mostly I just write it out. I know a lot of good phrases, but I usually just write the way I want to write. If I don't have a word that I want to use, I'll just use a word that I know is well-used. I think that if you can use some older words that nobody uses, then you should do it. I do it sometimes, too. I try to write in a way that it's easy to understand and use words that people will understand. I don't use very old words or very new ones. I don't think about what I'm writing. I just write. I use older words because I read books that were written a long time ago. I use words I've never used before, words that are a little older, and words that are used a lot. I just write it as I think it. I don't usually use a thesaurus. I use a thesaurus to find words that are hard to say, or sometimes I just look them up in a dictionary. I don't usually use a thesaurus. I just use words that I know will fit well. I don't think about what words I'm using. I just write. I think that's a good idea. Most people don't know what preposterous means and the only reason they do is because they've heard it before. I try to use words that people use a lot in everyday life. I try to use older words that are hard to understand. I think you should just write however you want and not worry about what the words mean.
