A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a submachine gun under adult supervision when the accident occurred. It was a very tragic incident and was widely reported in the news. It is important to always follow safety protocols and regulations when handling firearms, especially when children are involved. It is also important to consider whether or not it is appropriate for children to be exposed to firearms and to carefully evaluate the risks associated with such activities before allowing them to participate.
