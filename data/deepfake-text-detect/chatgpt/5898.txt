I think the real reason people punish others for transgressions is not so much to discourage the behavior, but rather to channel humanity's inherently predatory nature in a way that's acceptable to most. "Might makes right" is a basic psychological fact, and we seem to be able to rationalize it better if we can think of it as "God said it." In other words, we can rationalize and repress our own violent impulses if we think we're doing it in the name of God or the State or "The Community." And we're pretty good at rationalizing and repressing. I have a friend who is a high ranking police officer. Whenever we argue about something, I always bring up the "might makes right" mantra. I think I've really got him thinking. The Law is a system of checks and balances. Each individual is responsible to carry the same responsibility for his own actions, and to hold others to the same standard. If you don't want to take responsibility for your actions, you don't get to complain when others don't either. And no, not "free." I mean free to do whatever they want to whomever they want. Re: Cutting up the libtards in the streets. You're not suggesting that we just start cutting up libtards are you? I think we should start with the politicians. That'll teach them how to use the internet to fund their greedy little schemes. [quoteMoonlight Sonata] I'm not suggesting that at all. I'm just saying that I don't know what it would take to get the libtards to "get it." If you look at the kind of violence they've been getting away with, I don't know what would really upset them. At any rate, I'm not in a position to "lead" anybody anywhere. Re: I think we should start with the politicians. You're right. It wouldn't make any sense to start with the politicians. We'd be at war with the military before we could get to the politicians. Re: Re: Cutting up the libtards in the streets. I'm talking about the kind of violence that's done in the name of "the community" or "the government." I'm sure that you can understand that. You're right, it wouldn't make sense to start with the politicians.
