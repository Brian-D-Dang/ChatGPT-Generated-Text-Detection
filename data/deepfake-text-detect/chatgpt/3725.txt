I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is because of Sanders' long history of fighting for civil rights and social justice. He has consistently spoken out against systemic racism and inequality, and has proposed policies like police reform and ending the war on drugs that are in line with the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement. However, it's important to note that while Sanders may have the strongest track record and policies regarding BLM, it's ultimately up to the individual voter to make their own decision based on their values and priorities. It's also important to consider the intersectionality of issues affecting marginalized communities, including issues facing other communities of color, Indigenous people, LGBTQ individuals, and more.
