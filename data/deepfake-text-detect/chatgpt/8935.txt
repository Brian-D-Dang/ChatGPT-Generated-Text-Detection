One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? It's not really. There are enough people who have an income and therefore can afford to go to school for free. If you don't want those students there, or they aren't qualified to graduate, then it should be free. People getting degrees without paying extra money shouldn't be required by law.
