I was first exposed to the universe by watching season 1 and 2 of the show. I really liked them and purchased the A Song of Ice and Fire books after that, but could never get into the show itself due to much of the dialogue being different than what is in the book. The only reason I didn't like it as much (which admittedly isn't a bad thing) is because they showed so many little things in the show which were in the books. For example, Tywin's weird love for Arya.
