I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing by letting them purchase the lowest common denominator, or possibly higher price point for them (because price). The consumer gains nothing in comparison with the high cost of getting outbid from the merchants buying these things at their own risk and being left behind because they were made artificially lower priced due to the lower pricing trend affecting consumer choice when compared against the retailers on price increases that way less desirable Amazon offers its items first hand vs. those who buy online instead.) Costco isn't even selling these products directly through their website anymore so my guess is that Costco will continue to sell them exclusively through online stores like Walmart and Target via their affiliate program too? It's not as if they only ever want consumers to make purchases there anyway - folks shop there, but Walmart and Target aren't going away anytime soon either since they have massive customer loyalty programs built into their stores as well. Finally, in a world where Amazon has become synonymous with shopping online I'm curious what the price of theiramazon stuff might be in 2019 considering that Amazon bought Whole Foods last year. And let's hope Costco doesn't start hiring people to do all the logistics work themselves though, which would suck some money back up front costs just because of how much their competitors are charging far more per item than Walmart does already (15-20item)
