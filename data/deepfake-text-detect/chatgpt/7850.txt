One potential counter-argument to this opinion is that while the Idaho Stop Law may work well in some areas or under certain circumstances, it may not be appropriate or safe in all states or for all riders. For example, some cities or neighborhoods may have heavier traffic or more complex intersections, which could make it more difficult for cyclists to navigate safely if they don't obey traffic signals or yield to pedestrians. Additionally, some cyclists may not have the experience or skills necessary to make appropriate judgments about when to slow down or stop. As such, it may be more effective to implement educational campaigns or training programs to help cyclists better understand road rules and safety guidelines, rather than simply changing laws or regulations. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on a variety of factors, including the local infrastructure, culture, and cycling community.
