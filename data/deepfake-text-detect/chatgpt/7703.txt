While the value of the property is an important factor in determining property taxes, it is not the only factor that should be considered. Other factors such as the location of the property, the services provided by the local government, and the level of property upkeep and maintenance required are also important. For example, a property located in a heavily populated area with a high demand for public services may require more funding from property taxes than a property located in a rural area with less demand for public services. Additionally, a property owner who neglects their property and causes blight may require more inspections and code enforcement, which would increase the burden on local governments. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider a variety of factors when determining property taxes, and not just the value of the property.
