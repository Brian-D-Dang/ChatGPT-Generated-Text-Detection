If this is a duplicate post, I apologize, an AutoMod told my my old version was too short and that it was removed. Here's my logic, though: If I get off work at 6pm, then I'd like to go the gym right when I leave because there are no rush hour traffic. But if you're not going straight from home or working in an office, well... I think your logic makes sense but only really works with "morningevening."
