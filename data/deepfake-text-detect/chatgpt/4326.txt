It is well known that the old testament refers to homosexuality as "an abomination." However, most christians do not believe in the applicability of Old Testament rules to the modern world. There are several reasons for this. 1) The Bible itself does not describe homosexuality in any way. 2) God Himself has stated that He forbids same sex relations (Exodus 20:13); an out and out condemnation of homosexual conduct and acts should be obvious from the context of these verses alone. 3) The Old Testament does not have a single text in which homosexuals are mentioned or referred to; there is no mention or reference, for instance, anywhere in Leviticus 21:18-22 where homosexual behavior was condemned. In fact, it can almost certainly be inferred from these verses that homosexual behavior, if at all possible, would never be condoned by God (and the Bible). 4) Finally, there are religious leaders who deem homosexual conduct immoral regardless of how it may or may not be morally acceptable to others - they refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Old Testament as a holy book which reflects the will of God. Although many people consider these leavened words in Exodus 20:13 to reflect God's disapproval of homosexual acts, their application cannot actually be tested by science because scientists simply don't know what God truly wills. The only reason such a book exists in the first place is so that faithful followers of Christ could follow Him and live according to His teachings without having to deal with outmoded laws written down centuries before Christ. It is therefore ironic that Christians would seek to repeal the very things they find so offensive about the Old Testament by using its own material against them.
