I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. Those who were willing to fight for liberty have been denied it; those who fought against liberty will surely be remembered as heroes. It's also important not to forget two other non-US allies: Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. While there was no good option on offer during WWII (both sides had atrocities), any loss suffered is one we should feel guilty about.
