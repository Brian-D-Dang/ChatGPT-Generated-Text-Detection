Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from rec teams). Although I enjoyed the game, I didn't enjoy the competitive atmosphere. In my opinion, it was too intense and stressful, and the parents and coaches had unrealistic expectations of the kids. CMV: Competitive sports can be beneficial, but they can also create an unhealthy and unenjoyable atmosphere if not managed properly. Parents and coaches need to ensure that their expectations are realistic and that the environment is supportive and encouraging. Too much pressure can lead to burnout and discourage young athletes from continuing in their sport.
