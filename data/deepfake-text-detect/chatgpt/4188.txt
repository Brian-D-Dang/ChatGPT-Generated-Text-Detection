View changed by a combination of the comments of uceleritas365 and uQwerkss: I guess we all understand numbers differently, but ultimately I think it really is lack of empathy more than anything else. In my opinion, there shouldn't be an "I" in math. The fact that you can't see it as a single entity (1x) doesn't mean others don't. If anything, numbers are just another object (or set of objects).
