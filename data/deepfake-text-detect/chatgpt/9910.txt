It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be kept safe from poachers, can be given proper nutrition, and can even be used for educational purposes. However, the main goal of zoos should be to provide a natural and comfortable environment for the animals. They should be able to roam freely in large enclosures and have access to trees, rocks, bushes, and other natural elements to explore. Additionally, zoos should actively promote animal welfare initiatives and work to protect their habitats in the wild.
