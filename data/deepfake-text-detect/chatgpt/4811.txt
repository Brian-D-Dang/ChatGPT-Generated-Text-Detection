I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still don't think they have any right to interrupt someone else's free political speech or freedom of assembly and expression. This is despite my own experience as a former activist who was arrested at a protest on Wall Street where thousands gathered just to speak out against race-based economic discrimination. My point in writing this article isn't really about what happened during his campaign, although it does affect them; rather, it is more about how we view each other and why these issues are so important to all of us (whether you believe black lives matter or not). We need look no further than our current president for example: he has never been held accountable for defending slavery when asked directly by George H. W. Bush about whether "the concept of reparations" were part of his plan if elected. Instead, Trump stated that the country would be better off without paying back descendants of slaves. He even claimed that he had read into the Congressional Budget Office report before stating that there would be no money spent trying to help pay back black Americans - as only white people could possibly benefit from such payments! Now unfortunately many are arguing that racism is less outspoken after the election but Trump continues to prove otherwise. Donald J.
