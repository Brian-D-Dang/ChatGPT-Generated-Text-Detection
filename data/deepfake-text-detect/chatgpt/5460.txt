It is well known that the old testament refers to homosexuality as "an abomination." However, most christians do not believe in the applicability of Old Testament rules to the modern world. The New Testament also condemns homosexuality as an abomination because it violates Biblical Leviticus 13:19-20 and Leviticus 21:5 (Leviticus 19:11). These verses are explicitly against the biblical teaching on marriage equality prior to the adoption of marriage equality by the Church Fathers from the time of Jesus Christ. Although homosexuality was never adopted into the New Testament canon, many Christians have condemned homosexuality for violating biblical laws relating to child custody rights. Many Christians rejected the New Testament agreement to adopt a new covenant between God and man based upon the Old Testament decree dated Jan 30th, 2000. In this time period, homosexuality has become a topic of controversy among christian community leaders who argue that homosexuality should only be accepted if it conforms with traditional Christian principles such as marriage equality. Last week, the Family Research Council issued a letter calling for the end of all homosexual practices throughout all nations that violate biblical law. In a statement released last Sunday evening, the council stated: "We understand our duty under the law of the land cannot be matched or surpassed without compromising the dignity of every human being... We urge all citizens of the United States to consider what happened heretical proposals like marriage equality before they commit themselves to any form of justice and decency in America today.... There needs to be no greater drama than our government governing itself through its own regulatory authority over self interest exclusively involving the separation of church and state. The country must stop discriminating against homosexuals who govern ourselves. " Some Christians see homosexuality as the embodiment of Satan's deception and want to destroy the Bible and its teachings. Others view homosexual behavior with contempt. According to recent research by researchers at Baylor University in Texas discovered that Christianity has led christians to believe homosexuality represents a common crime committed by people seeking to deceive others about their religion. Christianity commits crimes against others due to its wickedness, which brings shame upon mankind, according to Ezekiel 19:13. A recent study conducted by the American Society of Human Rights Judicial Review revealed that approximately one-third of Americans agree there can't be a justice system consisting solely of adults. This means American society fails to uphold Judeo-Christian values such as the separation of church and state. The study found 50 percent of westerners agreed that homosexual acts condemn Judaism, Muslims, Jews, and Christians alike. Marriages traditionally exist within the family structure where each spouse shares responsibilities regarding marriage, divorce, inheritance, property ownership, social security benefits, health care costs, custody issues, childcare obligations, employment requirements, family formation, and education costs. Therefore, many americans reject consensual relationships including marriage between individuals regardless of whether one partner believes sexual orientation toward another constitutes sin and remains opposed to homosexuality either legally or morally. US Attorney General Jeff Sessions released several statements condemning homosexuality and arguing that Homosexual acts constitute criminal offenses. According to the attorneys general, homosexuality can devastate families but occurs when the public does not listen to reason. As a result, he said marriages occur across generations under circumstances concerning marriage abuse causing harm to children. Sessions further cited statistics indicating that US adults used to make up more than 90 of children living together during the era of the Bible. He insisted that homosexuality will continue until society condemns it fully. Sessions also argued that homosexuals will prosper despite religious beliefs restricting morality, adding sexual activity is sinful. American society seeks to maintain the existing order whereby individual freedoms are respected while protecting secular lifestyles and religions. However, Americans could stand alone if homosexuality becomes legal nationwide. As an alternative to legalized homosexual conduct, many christians support legal marriage between same sex couples since it provides Christian families with equal distribution of wealth and opportunity. According to the American Justice Department, government sponsored marriage licenses would reduce poverty rates almost immediately resulting directly from the adoption of marriage equality legislation. Other examples of gay individuals committing immoral acts include those who rape same sex couples, sexually assault minors and others who disrespecting the faith of others; perpetrators who pervert the morals towards prisoners, pedophiles, rapist and murderers; and rapists whose actions threaten the safety of children. Christians must reject homophobic policies unless they accept the teachings of the Bible and its work pertaining to marriage equality.
