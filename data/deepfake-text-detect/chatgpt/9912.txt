This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this time I am going to take a stance that may be unpopular. I do not believe in the idea of soulmates. I think it is an overly romanticized notion, one which promises too much and often leads to disappointment. While there are certainly people we can connect with deeply, and relationships that are incredibly meaningful and special, I don't think any one person is meant to be with another in an exclusive and eternal bond. I believe that true love is something that anyone can find, with or without a "soulmate."
