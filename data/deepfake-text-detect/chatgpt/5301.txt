Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I know and will support me against my will is more important for me now though because I've been soloing and looking forward to it! Yeah I have an estimate of 15 friends who are willing to help with this trip every day or half hour too!
