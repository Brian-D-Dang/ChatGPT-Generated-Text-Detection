Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as the average restaurant pizza. Frozen pizzas are mass-produced, often with lower quality ingredients than a restaurant would use. Additionally, they are cooked quickly in an oven and not given the same amount of attention as a hand-crafted pizza. As a result, they are generally much less flavorful than a restaurant made pizza.
