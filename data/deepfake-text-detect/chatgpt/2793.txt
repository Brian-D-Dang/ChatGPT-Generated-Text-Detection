So if you haven't heard already, there was a recent [shooting in a Charleston church.] Many reports are coming out with evidence that points it as a racially motivated hate crime. One of the victims is now charged with murder and another has been arrested for leaving the scene of an accident after hitting someone else's car, but not before calling 911 to report that he had just shot nine people at a black church. The shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church on Wednesday night shocked this historic city. The shooter killed 9 African-American worshippers during Bible study. Two others were injured; both are still receiving treatment in area hospitals. We pray tonight for those who have lost their lives. And we ask God's guidance through this tragic time. We also pray for all who mourn - including those who may feel anger or hatred towards anyone dearest to them - that they will be comforted by love from friends and family members. Our hearts ache over what happened here in our state, and in my home town of Charleston. But I know this: We cannot let injustice pull us apart. To everyone affected - please know that we stand beside you. As your governor, I want to assure you that justice will prevail. We cannot begin to heal until the guilty parties take responsibility, and until people of good conscience can speak without fear of recrimination. That's why last week, I called upon South Carolina lawmakers to remove the Confederate battle flag from its place of honor in the Statehouse so that we can focus more closely on the future instead of looking backwards. This evening, I join every American in praying for Charleston. For each life cut short too soon. For families left behind. For peace and healing for all who call this great country home. Now, let me say something about race relations in America. First, some statistics. Let's start with the fact that African Americans make up roughly half of our population but commit less than 50 percent of murders across America. In other words, AfricanAmericans commit crimes at lower rates than whites, according to available data. Similarly, when more blacks are murdered - such as recently in Chicago - the media doesn't describe this as "black on white violence." They describe these events as "crimes" or "shootings." When blacks kill whites, however - like Michael Slager in North Charleston - most national outlets do not hesitate to label it as "white supremacist terrorism." A simple statistic tells the story. According to FBI figures, between 1976 and 2005, only 36 percent of homicide charges filed nationwide involved whites killing blacks. Forty-six percent involved blacks killing whites, while 12percent involved AsiansPacific Islanders killing either blacks or whites. Not one case involving Asian defendants resulted in white fatalities. Another stat shows how seriously we should view these kinds of events. Since 1994, 1 million AfricanAmericans have been released from prison. Yet, violent crime declined faster among nonAfricanAmericans than AfricanAmericans did. Despite this positive trend, many people continue to suggest that racism lies deep within the culture of law enforcement. These allegations simply won't withstand scrutiny. While misconduct does occur, studies show that police officers treat minorities no different than whites for routine traffic stops. Studies also show that unarmed blacks are more likely to be stopped by police than armed whites. Still, there remains room for improvement. Following yesterday's tragedy, I spoke with Sheriff Al Cannon of Orangeburg County, where this senseless act took place. He told me that his deputies received special training following similar tragedies throughout our nation. Deputies learned how to handle situations involving volatile individuals carrying weapons. Sadly, this kind of initiative often goes unmentioned because it speaks well of local law enforcement officials rather than painting them as racists intent on targeting innocent citizens based solely on their skin color. It was clear from talking with Sheriff Cannon that two young men committed terrible acts inside that church. Tonight, I am asking the Department of Justice to conduct a thorough investigation into whatever led these young men down the wrong path. In addition, let us remember Reverend Clementa Pinckney, Cynthia Hurd and Susie Jackson, three of whom gave their lives protecting their fellow worshippers. Their heroism reminds us once again of the goodness that exists among us. There is nothing better than seeing somebody put themselves second to protect others... especially in this day and age. Each of us owes them a debt of gratitude. Finally, although I wish things could change overnight, we need patience and resolve. We must resist any temptation to turn against one another. Instead, let us come together in support of the beloved community that binds us together, regardless of race, religion, party, sexual orientation or gender identity. Only then can we truly achieve harmony. So let us keep working hard to deliver equal opportunity for all, and let us always look for ways to improve ourselves individually and collectively. Because if history teaches anything, it's that improving ourselves happens best when we work together toward a higher!
