I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg , word-of-mouth). Sorry for being unclear. It says 'warning'. Also it doesn't say anything about triggering warnings. I think you're right. The point is: if it's not a trigger warning then why are there "trigger warnings"?
