Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for "sleeping around," and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of attention. The word slutty can be used to describe both men and women who have sex outside their marriage or otherwise violate social rules about monogamy. According to this philosophy, if people are allowed to do whatever they want as long as there's no ill - intentioned harm done (e. g., rape) then that means men should be able to sleep with prostitutes without being punished too severely by losing job opportunities or being ostracized from family circles; whereas, society would hold down women such as promiscuous actresses because society considers them immoral. I'm glad I don't live in America anymore! But even here we see too many examples where our culture condones one set of standards for all members but others find themselves discriminated against based on ethnicity skin color, gender etc. This isn't new territory: historically, women were only considered "sluts" during certain times in history, e. g.: after childbirth was natural again, before World War One, shortly following WW1.... but now these attitudes towards sexuality seem endemic across every generation... It seems we're all sluts nowadays since so much of what we do revolves around sexual acts instead of healthy relationships between two people. And while I realize that part of this world view is a result of living under and experiencing oppression at different points throughout human history, the fact remains that some societies think that whores are better than good wives simply due to their capacity to make babies. (It may sound crazy, but statistically speaking, most cultures tend to value babies over adult women.) If we believe that humans are inherently selfish beings, which I certainly do, why shouldn't we expect this type of behavior amongst ourselves? When did it become acceptable among us to judge each other solely based upon how well we've chosen to live life versus how someone else has lived theirs? Where exactly is my place in the judgmental equation placed by some? On another note, you might notice that I haven't written anything recently about any specific relationship problems going on lately... yeah, me neither.
