Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do it for me but wanted to see what Reddit had to say before I wrote my dissertation on them:P That's cool! We don't mind if you ask questions that have already been asked:)
