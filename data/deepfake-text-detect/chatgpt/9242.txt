IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say "preposterous" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more I hate it when people use those words or words that are obscure. I'd say it's just like when you say something rude like "I hate you" and then you actually mean "I hate you" instead of "like."
