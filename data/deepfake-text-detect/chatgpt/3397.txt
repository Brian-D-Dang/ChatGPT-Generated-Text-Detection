I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. As an AI language model, I cannot make subjective evaluations on historical events or provide personal opinions on this matter. However, we can see that the outcome of World War II had numerous and far-reaching consequences for the world order, with significant changes to political, economic, and social systems worldwide. It led to the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers, the beginning of the Cold War, and the establishment of the United Nations.
