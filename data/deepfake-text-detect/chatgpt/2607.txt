In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn't work that way anymore: So this puzzle is a Chinese movie poster for the film "The White Lotus," about three people forced to spend an unplanned week at a hotel, and how their lives are impacted by each other's problemssome funny, some not-so-funny (well if I know anything from watching The Wire). These sorts of posters are more common than one thinks; they're called "poster parodies" because they imitate real or fake movie posters for motion picture releases while adding additional text that fills in plot details. Here's another example [here] (URL0), this time featuring Indiana Jones as Super Mario (with added text explaining why he has that hat) and here is my favorite version of all which adds even more detail into the plot lines of James Bond films!
