So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to have sexual relations with a dog without raping her, but this would be very difficult indeed and there is no way you could guarantee full consent on behalf of your canine friend (in fact not even dogs can always tell if they've been raped). You see when someone cheats sexually with another person he or she has made an explicit decision about what sex means in their relationship - whether cheating takes place within marriage or outside of it doesn't change anything here. The parties involved know exactly where things stand between them so when one partner decides to cheat then everyone knows just how far over the line that particular individual has gone. But we don't apply these same standards to animals which often leads people who like bestiality to conclude rather stupidly "What does it matter? It was consensual!" Well first off this reduces all animal sexuality into nothing more than rape since almost every single time two species mate they do so by force while at least some of those creatures never had chance to agree beforehand. That being said though...I believe there may well come a day soon when humans will 'breed' other mammals for purposes of agriculture so getting past our own chauvinism might prove problematic as long as female cows continue giving birth once per year only. We also need to remember that human kinship groups were historically much larger back before the advent of farming whereas now monogamy dominates social life among us bipeds due simply to economic necessity. In many cultures men generally maintain dominance relationships lasting centuries during which women cannot refuse his demands despite signing contracts saying otherwise. And yet modern civilization frowns upon marrying children today precisely because child brides bring up generations of people whose parents couldn't possibly give each other permission prior to taking vows together meaning such marriages really aren't based on trust nor love!. Furthermore neither society approves of incest either although many Europeans choose close kin partners through choice anyway according to genetic tests showing family members share similar ancestry. While avoiding contraception isn't advisable unless both participants test negative for STDs my point stands that mating habits differ greatly from culture to culture so perhaps instead of throwing around words like 'rape' let's spend less time judging others from afar while remembering nobody is perfect including ourselves from whom God absolved sin.
