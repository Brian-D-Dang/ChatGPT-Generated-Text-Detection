As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a difficult ethical and moral decision. It puts a tremendous strain on a family, the healthcare system, and society as a whole. It is important to consider the quality of life for the child and the potential benefits of the treatment. In some cases, it may be better to redirect resources towards providing palliative care and support for both the child and their family. Ultimately, each case is unique and requires thoughtful consideration and collaboration between healthcare professionals, families, and community members to determine what is best for the child and the greater good of society.
