How can you convince me that all the nations that I'm allowed to visit aren't all working together to hide a bigger and better and more free world. Maybe the US is looking at this, but it would be nice to see what's going on in other countries. I don't know if you're joking or not but when you talk about "working together" to hide something then you are implying they use the same system as we do here where everyone counts their vote for one candidate on election day, regardless of who wins.
