First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people . That said... in this day age? It's obvious how offensive such a thing is when one thinks about its historical context - but does that make all uses equally offensive now there are so many other ways for white performers (or others) to express themselves with their faces? Is using old "black face" as an example in every single instance actually helping anyone understand or learn from these issues, even if they do mean no harm by doing so? It seems most often used only because anything else would seem too controversial sensitive right now, rather than being seen as another cultural touchstone worthy of discussion on its own merits. That may be unfair, though! Maybe Danielle was just really passionateemotional during her video, which explains why she felt compelled to use examples everyone could relate to...? In any case, my main concern here isn't whether someone should have been offended, if at all possible: what concerns me instead is simply whatever damage might result from oversimplifying complex topics into crude generalizations which miss important aspects left unsaid. My second issue is not specific to BBT itself, either; while comedy shows must necessarily take liberties toward showing things more comically exaggerated than reality otherwise audiences wouldn't find them funny, those same comedies can also sometimes fail quite miserably due to lazy writing, lack of self-awareness regarding certain stereotypes' potential impact etc., leading us down a path where we need to stop laughing awkwardly along with jokes making fun of our group of choice until we've had enough time to reflect upon exactly who gets hurt over various expressions of humor. Here again, perhaps the video below provides a good starting point to discuss problematic themes without kneejerk reactions against minorities as "oversensitive."
