Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to accept the idea of same-sex marriage in an upcoming referendum on it (that's if there is one). So yes...there are many things about me you might find offensive! But at least don't try do make a point with these fake facts because they're so ridiculous!!;)
