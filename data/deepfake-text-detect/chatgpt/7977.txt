It is essential to understand that all forms of self-harm have a detrimental impact on one's physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. While some individuals may justify self-harm as a coping mechanism, it is important to acknowledge that it is not a healthy or effective way of coping with distress. Additionally, self-harm may lead to severe complications or injuries, such as infections, permanent physical damage, and even death. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize that self-harm is inherently wrong and harmful to oneself and should be treated as a serious issue that requires appropriate professional support and intervention.
