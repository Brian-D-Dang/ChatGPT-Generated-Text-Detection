Headlights are mostly useful for improving the driver's vision while driving in low-light conditions and for increasing the visibility of the driver's car in low-light or foggy conditions. While stationary, headlamps also help to reduce glare from oncoming traffic by directing light away from it when turned toward oncoming vehicles (called "dip. At night, a vehicle may have its lights turn off automatically after a predetermined time interval has lapsed since they were last activated manually either by the ignition key being switched onoff ONOFF or via an automatic timer that turns them on every x minutes and then switches them back on again at some later point before turning itself out completely - this is done so as not to fill up battery power unnecessarily if there is no immediate need for their use. In addition, many newer cars come equipped with adaptive front lighting systems which can adjust the brightness level according to road surface type and speed using sensors installed around the headlights. Some luxury brands now offer LED Light Bar Headlights which illuminate all lanes ahead simultaneously rather than just those directly facing forward; these do require more electricity however due both to having multiple separate LEDs illuminating each lane compared to a conventional set of bulbs shining only one directionally into another bulb socket.[2] The first cars featuring Adaptive Front Lighting Systems included Volvo S80 manufactured between 2004-2006,[34] Mercedes Benz E250 CDI production years 2005-2007[5] Ford Mondeo MKII 2006-2009 [6], Audi A8 2001-2003,[7]Toyota FJ Cruiser 2008-2010[8] BMW 5 Series models made until late 2012, Lexus GS , Honda CRV 2007-2008 model year, Chrysler 300 LXS, Dodge Charger SE RT 2009-2012, Volkswagen Passat CC 2011-2013, Cadillac XTS 2010 through 2014.[9]
