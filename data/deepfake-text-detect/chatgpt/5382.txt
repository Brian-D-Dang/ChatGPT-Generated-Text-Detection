Sorry, this is mostly applicable to folks from the US, but feel free to weigh in no matter what. I'll bullet-point for my reasoning: More good folks are killed via drone strikes all over the world than terrorists kill people on the streets of the world's major cities (and a lot less dead), so we need more police officers who fight terrorism with bullets like you do among other citizens right here in America! To the people in the US, thank you for your service and sacrifice. Thanks for your countrymen!
