Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the best spot is usually empty while other people use it. So much so that they have been hoisting up all of those handicap spots this year because they were filling their parking lots with them at the height of winter. I can't believe you're downvoted, but I'd actually be willing to bet on this happening. I work mostly in a medium sized business and if there is any sort of problem I get asked about it.
