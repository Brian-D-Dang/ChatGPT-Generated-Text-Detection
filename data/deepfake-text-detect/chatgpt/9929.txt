So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training , and some even have experience with firefighting. But I still feel like it's a bit of a risky situation for the town. We don't have a lot of money to invest in professional fire services, and that's understandable, but I think that there are probably ways to make it safer. For example, having more resources available to the volunteers would be helpful, like better equipment or more training opportunities. Additionally, making sure that they are well-rested and not overworked would also help. Finally, having a better system in place to quickly respond to fires and alert the proper personnel would go a long way towards improving safety.
