From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have the same influence as Napoleon Bonaparte or even MacArthur. The legacy of the government that took command from the British in France in 1791 is undeniable and the military establishment that preceded him has been over-emphasized by the media. The only reason to believe that FDR was born into conservatism instead of republicanism is because the Democrats were too liberal for FDR while conservatives are already on a roll of liberal liberals. But to me FDR was the most conservative president ever elected by either party. He would've won with the Democrats if he hadn't wasted his opportunity on destroying the welfare system that forced universal schooling before the Great Depression. The solution to the problem lies somewhere in the middle between the two extremes: the right wing ideology that treats everyone equally but rewards those who don't pass education tests and the left wing ideology that reduces people to slaves without labor rights. FDR also stole from the Founders' socialist dreams of socialism through the destruction of the government bureaucracy of the early republic. That's what FDR did so that he could seize power away from the very institutions he ruined. FDR used force against rebel forces that compromised his own goals which resulted in damaging consequences such as the American civil war; he abused the democratic process in favor of coercion; and he killed free enterprise by promoting state intervention in industry and commerce rather than corporate control of industries. Obama inherited from FDR some problems that would be better solved by his predecessors who listened more closely to the concerns of the working class - liberty under capitalism versus state exploitation - but he treated them with contempt towards the poor and freed themselves increasingly unchecked above all others. FDR kept America awash in economic misery despite the massive benefits it provided throughout his presidency, bringing prosperity when needed down low income neighborhoods where worker communities grew up. FDR left no room for people living longer lives with dignity beyond the reach of the wealthiest 3 percent. His policies promoted isolationist thinking while elevating the status quo. FDR had a long history of encouraging state repression for his own benefit regardless of the cost in human suffering during World War II. FDR's policy toward Germany fueled Nazi Germany and led to his defeat at the hands of Hitler. FDR was guilty of gross violations of our Constitution while ignoring the sacrifices made by thousands of Americans fighting in World War I while Hitler controlled Europe much like FDR did during WWII. FDR oversaw the dismantling of the democratic legitimacy of the United States and the destruction of families facing starvation due to the injustices inflicted upon them by the government. FDR ignored the reminders of America's founding principles and restored tyranny while destroying democracy across Europe creating the conditions for war in Italy and Nazi Germany. FDR created a federal bureaucracy with no mandate to run society wisely and falsely equated it to enslaving millions of individuals globally along with actual communism. FDR refused to acknowledge his past mistakes including his betrayal of his countrymen and promised "victory" over all other nations until the end of time after World War II ended. FDR disregarded the warning signs with vast improvements in technology allowing his empire to prosper around world events. FDR promoted the use of state powers to allow slavery and slave ownership worldwide while at the same time waging war against the indigenous peoples of this land. FDR enabled the American workers movement where he encouraged labor unrest whenever necessary leading to mass unemployment caused by his political views. FDR approved slavery even though it violated the concept of equality for black slaves pushing whites out of jobs legally allowing slave owners greater control over their communities. FDR promoted the destruction of America's freedoms since the Declaration of Independence believing that it should belong to the people and not the government yet he brought freedom back home to America thanks largely to his actions making people fear government indifference. FDR destroyed families torn apart by war and violence and enforced racial discrimination forcing African Americans to work just one job beneath whites rewarding white supremacy while plundering wealth generated by slavery both economically and culturally as well as racially perpetuating inequality irrevocably harming countless people impacted by his policies. FDR occupied America using giant corporations as leverage while ignoring the needs of the impoverished and dying communities devastated by his greed. FDR pushed America toward socialism favoring the rich while encouraging racism among his fellow citizens who sacrificed family values to save his blood money. FDR employed racist policies aimed at oppressing blacks while simultaneously hurting the working classes. FDR declared America an empire causing all mankind to suffer unimaginable tragedies including genocide resulting in death rates of 100 higher compared to other countries anywhere else. FDR failed to honor the principles behind our founding documents whereas ignoring the evils of capitalism while enriching himself while giving none credits to those harmed by his actions. FDR ignored or concealed his transgressions barring any positive contributions given to humanity while allowing it to flourish within his organization and keeping his base fearful of dissenters. FDR legitimizing slavery while destroying families of minorities while punishing whites to preserve the power elites held to control them. FDR encouraged racism while undermining the rights of minorities thereby fostering the culture wars discussed earlier. FDR defeated the people of his enemies crime with his loyalty there fear creating violence what society was opposed to stop training. The Los squ order competition.
