So, it's obvious to anyone who took a math class that the average number of sex partners between straight men and straight women must be the same. However, the median number of sex partners might differ due to variations in the distribution of values. The median represents the midpoint of a distribution, so if there are outliers or extreme values in one group, it could affect the median. However, it's important to note that focusing solely on statistics related to sex partners can be problematic as it reinforces harmful societal stigmas and norms around sexual behavior. It's important to prioritize individual agency, mutual consent, and respectful communication and to avoid reducing people to numbers or stereotypes.
