Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable that Starfleet must have a large human presence to command its fleet and enforce peace throughout space [1]. However it is surprising that so many Humans are prominent within civilian organizations like The United Nations or even more surprising that they're running corporations. This pattern continues with the vast majority of fictional characters from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9). In fact, as far as I can find this has been true for all televised TOSTNG series. Even Doctor Who seems to follow a similar path featuring both humanoids and aliens. From logical reasons such as Starfleet having to interact with law enforcement agencies in order to enforce civil rights laws on planets without their own police forces, we'd expect most people working in those areas would be Human. But when one looks at the average member profiles of these occupations, we see two distinct groups emerge: People who look very Human indeed, but often don't act Human either... If you've ever wondered why no Klingon character was seen consuming alcohol until DS9 began airing, or why only half the main cast members were seen wearing hats during "The Way To Eden," chances are good that someone around you could answer before you finish reading this article. And if by some chance none do, just go ahead and click here. Because we'll soon watch Discovery pull the same kind of shenanigans with the introduction of new alien species into every show. What separates them? The next question should probably be what distinguishes any regular television viewer from a sci fi geek: ethnicity! Let's take a look at each occupation featured below, which will include explanations of how these ethnic breakdowns come about and where they fit into real life demographics. Starfleet Officer - As noted above, since there are not many humanoid populations present outside of Earth, it makes sense for Starfleet to have a significant amount of Human officers commanding vessels across the galaxy. The notable exception being Odo who served as chief constable on Cardassia Prime for over 200 years. Conversely, Bajorans seem less inclined towards military service than other cultures due to their pacifist nature. We also never saw Starfleet's equivalent of America's Border Patrol Service patrolling our borders, although there might be exceptions to this rule, especially given that many races use subspace communications networks. Therefore, the lack of race diversity in Starfleet may simply indicate that it serves primarily to guard against extraterrestrial threats; after all, humanity considers itself formidable enough already. This does explain why nearly all Starfleet ships had crews composed almost entirely of Humans back when these shows aired. United States Police Force - While this department includes federal agents and state troopers, the bulk of American law enforcement work is done by local municipalities through various departments including: City ordinances, State statutes and county jurisdictions. Each department tends to fall under different legislation depending upon the jurisdiction it operates in. For example, if an individual commits murder in Alabama they can face capital punishment while operating in New York they risk facing 10 years to life imprisonment. Regardless of the number of regulations involved, the force is still made up mostly of Human beings. Only 12 of US residents identify themselves as Hispanic. Ironically though, despite the relatively small percentage of Hispanics in leadership positions, the NYPD is widely considered to have among the highest rates of minority hiring. According to Wikipedia, 75 of senior commanders are minorities compared to 58 overall. Additionally, 11 of the 15 captains are members of racial minorities. US Military - Despite the Armed Forces' status as one of America's largest employers, few actual military personnel were seen on screen. Even fewer were mentioned in dialogue. During World War II, men comprised 87 percent of enlisted soldiers while women didn't serve officially until 1950. On the surface this appears normal, considering that male citizens represented 77 percent of the total U.S. population during WWII [2]. So why then did the armed services remain largely devoid of non-human actors? Perhaps because the film industry wanted us focused on the action instead of on the personalities behind it. An interesting aside is that the proportion of female servicemen rose to 29 in 1948, coinciding with Hollywood embracing greater involvement by women writers and directors. This change came much further along in time however as by 1953 women accounted for 70 of enlisted Troops [3], and in 1964 this figure reached 85. Other factors besides filmmakers wanting to make films rather than documentaries appear likely too, such as the fact that early movie stars tended to be white males. Once blacks became popular, many studios pushed hard for integration. Eventually, black casts became standard practice except in rare cases such as Blackbeard in Pirates Of Venus. A surprisingly low number of Asian Americans joined the U.S. Army between 1917 1945[4]. By 1943 Asians made up 1.7 of the military, but dropped down to 0.8 in 1944, mainly due to racism [5]. After the Vietnam war finished, early recruits referred to de PaAMILteiligenes: Kitteenschucht[6]deiretta:incoarmeasurement offere
