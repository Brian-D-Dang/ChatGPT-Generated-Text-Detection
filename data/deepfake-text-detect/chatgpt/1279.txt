I have had friendships with various males, and only one of them has not tried to at one point in time, make it sexual. This was not a big deal for me because I knew that he wasn't interested and didn't try so hard for him to like or pursue anything more than platonic friendship between us. 2) When you are ready: There is no rush - everyone needs their own pace when coming to termscoming out as bisexual! Whether it takes months, years etc... each person will find the right moment in life where they feel comfortable to do so:) So keep your head up stay true to yourself 3
