For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system in which government controls and distributes resources to its people through some form or another (for example: command economies like communism). So what does socialism have that capitalism doesn't? It's better for everyone! At least if you're talking about Scandinavian countries who are known throughout the world for their socialistic policies. Their citizens live longer on average than us Americans do; they don't get sick much because even though treatments aren't cheap there healthcare systems protect them from going bankrupt due to medical debt. So how did all these things happen? Not only were no one forced into becoming an organ donor, but it wasn't even just encouraged by law - nobody had to opt out at all! The results speak volumes. They also look quite different when comparing poverty rates between AmericaScandinavia so let me explain... Capitalism has done well against both poverty AND crime since we started using our capitalist economic principles - until now. While economic growth was obviously slower under Obama compared to previous years here in America, he still managed higher levels economically speaking than any other president before him by far. In fact, during his 8 year administration we saw almost twice as many new businesses being created per day as ever before in American history. And most importantly, unemployment among those without college degrees reached record lows. This would be great news except that Trump inherited such amazing numbers while taking credit for none of the work. A lot more people went hungry over night too when he decided not extend federal SNAP benefits past December 31st 2017. If stealing your food isn't enough proof then consider the rising rate of depression amongst teens last summer after he passed tax reform. With fewer companies hiring interns recent graduates looking forward to internships themselves thanks to him Co., I'm sure a few suicidal thoughts didn't go unnoticed either."
