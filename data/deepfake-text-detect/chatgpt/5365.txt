I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural insult. But once you start eating Thai food it becomes easier when you taste the food and enjoy using chopstick substitutes in your restaurant.
