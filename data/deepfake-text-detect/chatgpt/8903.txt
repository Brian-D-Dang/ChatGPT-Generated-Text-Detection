I am a cynical man. I don't believe in heroes, and so I'm prepared to change my view on this. THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about it will add nothing more than the same drivel we're hearing from the media right now: "The government has been advertising for 12 years that "the vaccine will be safe and effective all through people's bodies," but was never given the planning power to proceed with any such announcement." How do you explain a brilliant claim? It must be that there isn't much information out there to prove that? Well if you look at data, amazingly enough, almost half the population (73) had received one dose. So perhaps big doses are closer to 10; that would mean that many were not vaccinated just yet! But even then there is no evidence whatsoever that vaccines have prevented anyone from getting infected by Covid-19 when they first arrived as a result of vaccination - in fact, only sporadic cases of illness or death are reported in the study of adults who got their jab. In fact, infections have also been known to spread via coughing, sneezing and touching. That "vaccination against coronavirus" is based largely on false claims. The important point here is that it doesn't matter how well or badly your immune system reacts to the virus, what happens to those responsible for infection may still occur even after vaccination and therefore once it does occur that doesn't mean that they can always blame you. So why can't there be some kind of scientific argument that one dose of vaccination protects us better than another one due to the effect that protection in all areas is derived from science? Of course, most scientists understand that because they are not experts and don't know everything about vaccines, they cannot make that difficult task easier. But the major issue with this exercise is that it could undermine public trust in our biological systems which are very vulnerable to being undermined or compromised. What should be done at this stage would be a call for an adequate supply of medical equipment and other protective gear. Research into this point might be worthwhile. But it is certainly possible that one of these solutions could also be used to mitigate the impact of mutations caused by severe disease, like Covid-19, at a later date. It's particularly tempting to suggest that the current scientific consensus suggests that there are two ways to prevent this (and potentially prevent others), rather than one way to avoid them entirely. This seems like a sensible approach that could help take us back to where we started, although there are several critical questions on whether this advice is appropriate. In addition, there is a clear case for caution around misinformation type posts, which are sometimes deliberately misleading or dangerous to the public. They often contain misinformation that threatens to drive up prices of goods or services and cause panic among consumers. False statements are likely to lead to hidden costs, including delays in the delivery of essential supplies. And increasingly bad publicity around the pandemic is driving consumer behaviour towards certain types of products and services, like masks, over-all supplements and personal protective equipment. We need to be aware that misinformation can sometimes mislead others into believing something they themselves don't really want to see - a story that appears and causes widespread confusion. We need to ask ourselves if there is a risk that there won't be sufficient source material available to support these arguments, and whether these messages could actually come from actual people. What do you think about the decisions taken to protect us against Covid-19? Are you concerned about the consequences?
