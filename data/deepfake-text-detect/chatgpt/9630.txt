I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically I'm not that worried about the risk involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima is scary, but I'm not too concerned about the risks involved with nuclear energy, as long as the risks are under control and the technology involved is properly managed.
