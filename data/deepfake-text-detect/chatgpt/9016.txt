I have recently been told that my pro-life position is "forcing my ideas on others." I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary. I can't think of a single reason why we need to force abortion, no matter what happens. We know the science and are living through the work of sterilization in order to prevent human growth, but so far there has been little progress toward realising this goal. The only way to make sure that we end life without having babies is for us to want them. That's where you get further away from progress to really understand what really matters. You would be better off than sitting here thinking that something is wrong with society because we don't see that happening and maybe some people do believe it does.
