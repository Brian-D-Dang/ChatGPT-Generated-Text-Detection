Edit: I've been fairly convinced it's not sexist. Still maintain invasive as all heck. Carry on, thanks for getting passionate about it! Edit 2: 7 hours and only a few thousand words later... it seems that a lot of people are bothered by the comments in my original post. In particular there were some really bad assumptions made about me (by a user called lkfjlnks), which took up so much bandwidth that they actually overpowered everything else. This is what happens when you have an unruly crowd complaining about a very specific thing. You get this kind of bullshit backstabbingback-saying behavior where people say things to make themselves look better while at the same time trying to put others down. It makes no sense from any angle except maybe "I'm making fun of it!" That said here we go again with more accusations thrown around. Please take them with a grain of salt because none of these can be proved or disproved without more information than has yet been provided in this discussion. So let's start off with this: today was one minute past 100 days of being unemployed. This means it will probably take me another 100 before finding a job. Some people might find that acceptable but since I'm currently living hand-to-mouth while spending most of my savings on rent instead of food, that's unacceptable. So now I don't even know where to turn anymore. My girlfriend graduated last week and she hasn't had any luck either despite having 3 connections, a former co-worker who employed her right out of college and finally got someone watching over his kids until he could come pick her up himself. Now she works part-time waiting tables and taking care of his kids but after seeing how hard life becomes when you're young and single its pretty clear that's just not enough money to live on. The next step would be to move away from NYC but moving anywhere as far north as Buffalo takes around 12K car rental gas on top of my minimum wage salary if I wanted to try there first. With the stock market trading near record highs, TechCrunch salaries going insane (myself included) and unemployment nearly at a 50 year high it's incredibly unlikely I'd ever see anything close to double digits in income anyway. If anyone thinks I'm exaggerating then they obviously haven't experienced homelessness nor do they understand why credit card debt isn't something that disappears overnight like snow melting during spring. If anyone knows a company willing to hire 1 month contract employees for less than 10-15 per hour please let me know via email (in English). Unfortunately every position I apply for requires at least 6 months experience whereas I currently have zero and I won't even pay my own bills with the meager amount of money I earn. What am I supposed to tell prospective employers? "Hey man I hate myself so much I need to work for free for six months instead"? They wouldn't believe me anyways and then my reputation precedes me... but hey if I have nothing left to lose then screw it lets give it a shot! As far as my qualifications go I spent 5 years working professionally as a programmer writing code for game companies big small. I moved into strategy consulting after that but found I didn't enjoy doing it full time quite as well as coding games. Since then I did freelance web development and worked various jobs ranging from Stock Trader to bartender bouncer for both parties involved. You should be able to imagine from that list that I consider myself reasonably competent when it comes to technology and business. Not too mention I've played video games through 4 console generations and have owned almost every system released throughout that period including PCs running Windows ME. Oh yeah and whenever I feel bored I'll play WoW for about 20 minutes before going back to whatever task needs attention. When it comes to personal skills such as communication, social interactions and motivation however I'll admit to being somewhat lacking. It's understandable though considering I never lived outside cities larger than Detroit until recently and I'd been renting apartments for half my life. After hooking up with my current gf I moved to NY city which gave me plenty of opportunity to meet new people and immerse myself in their culture. Most importantly though I learned what it felt like to interact directly with customers whether that meant dealing with irate parents calling tech support all day long or helping fellow hotel guests figure out how to use our room safe. All that feedback combined with practice talking to real estate agents helped establish good patterns of communication with other human beings as well as general job interviewing techniques. But putting aside those experiences I still lack critical abilities required to perform tasks successfully and honestly I don't think that matters anymore. As far as I'm concerned, people mistakes me for a millennial because I prefer reading books rather than playing videogames, love sitting home alone listening to music or browsing forums looking for answers - at least I'm reenumeration exceptions reasons) casting numbers!) ills - resisting tendencies). inexpert! senile! finally want.) to bechosal exciti?
