A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a .22 rifle with a red dot sight, or power scope as its called in the trade. She had never been to one before and wasn't expecting anyone to be there (even though she could have tried harder). When that happened, it was an instant, terrifying blast of fear from her body. It must have separated the bullet totally and her brain must have hurt (but not a lot), but she is still alive today. The bullets entered into the head first and slammed straight down on her neck instead of just going through her skull like they normally do. They shredded all that soft tissue around her spine and lower jawline, tearing off chunks of bone. There are pictures of her lying in the hospital bed, completely deflated and broken. It's pretty terrible when your baby dies inside you. I can only imagine how much worse this would've been if she hadn't even had a chance to react; if that gun didn't go off so quickly, maybe she'd lived. Poor little thing... Anyways, the prosecutor was concerned about the safety aspect of guns and sent a letter to the parents of the child asking them: "Do you want to give me your consent to take your child to the range?" All the parents were honest with him; yes, their daughter was too young for a gun and legally speaking, wouldn't be able to buy one. He kept calling his office every day after that email, pleading to get permission to grab her from school, or just to talk with them face-to-face without having to send letters. Eventually he was given full permission to bring her to the range despite the fact that no one else could. That day, he brought her out in the middle of winter by himself, wearing shorts, sneakers, and blue shirt with two white stripes stitched onto the front. He pulled up, unloaded the rifle, set the stand apart perfectly, put the scope on, took her finger off the trigger, gave her instructions on what to do, then handed the gun to his kid who was sitting next to her. "You ready?" said the father. The girl turned to look at him and looked blankly ahead, smiling faintly. Then she opened her mouth wide, struggled weakly, and let loose a scream that rang throughout the building. When he finished shooting, he held the gun away carefully as if it was loaded with ammo rather than a weapon. As long as he did that, none of the girls' families ever knew it was at the range until years later. The story makes for a good movie because being on the receiving end of such a traumatic event is truly a nightmare experience. But more importantly, the prosecutor made sure that the family saw that justice actually does exist. He got the call right away, apologized immediately, explained why we need safe firearms laws, and that all of the proper precautions needed to prevent something like this from happening again will be taken. If people want to protect themselves from gun violence, don't allow children under 10 to get a license to own one. And while you're at it, don't show adults over 30 any type of firearm unless they really know what they're doing.
