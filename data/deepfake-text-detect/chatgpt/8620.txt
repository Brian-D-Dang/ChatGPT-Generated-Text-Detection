I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most often the case with me because I have always used my 'normal' makeup. 2) Sometimes there's something that i don't want to wear or think about. This would be difficult for anyone else to understand, but it gives me great motivation to change things up every now and then. 3) Cosmetics give you so much more freedom than anything else. Maybe we need more than just a routine change? This post isn't necessarily about beauty, but also about how I look in general - if you are looking for something that makes your skin look clean, treated well, looks natural (and supple and without any irritation), and that will keep the skin from becoming greasychaffyover-tanish, maybe it should make it easier to buyuse makeup. I'm not saying yes or no, but I honestly believe that by ignoring it all, you may find yourself really looking at something different each day instead of feeling "like" you're wearing something. Live at home, and of course work; I live in a small apartment surrounded by a bunch of other people who share the same lifestyle as me. For for example, I am somewhat self-conscious when doing makeup (especially since I know what mascara and lip sticks do). But I love it! Even though I never use them, I still find myself using them all the time, even when they seem kind of unkempt, which is so nice. A few years ago while traveling around Europe I was accidentally carrying some makeup I wasn't taking off with me, so it seemed silly for me to carry it with me. So while I did this, I actually discovered that I needed to take it off (because it doesn't fall off easily anymore!) and that made everything easier. I didn't realize it until later on, but it seems like I had two choices: Once upon a time I knew exactly where I wanted to go to a certain place or date an attractive woman and I decided to bring it back. Last summer I met a girl who told me she would love me when I opened her eyes and she said she wasn't that interested in being in relationships, but that if she found out I'd come over I would have done everything I could to help her - even asking for money. I'm sure there were many times that I wish someone would be willing enough to pay for my food or my clothes (so I could have a good night's sleep): or offer phone calls. If nothing else, I hope someone will trust me a little bit. Here's another thing I love: when I move in, I learn new ways of living throughout my life. Not only does I journal sometimes that I felt like I couldn't touch the furniture anymore, but it makes it so easy to get lost and decide to stop when necessary. And if I need to go somewhere, I remember that I'm walking across town and seeing exactly what I saw all around me. The fact that I can see all sorts of stuff shows that I live among others, even though I may not like it personally. So why am I writing this post? Well, I live alone. A lot of people live in cities and towns, too. One has to wonder if there's a difference between seeing a city's sights rather than having them physically tour one's city in order to experience it: There's a certain level of isolation, sickness, constant fear of going anywhere to visit a country. From the outside, I guess, it feels safe and friendly. From the inside, it feels weird, twisted, contrived....or yeah, awkward and boring. To feel safe and happy in that way is hard, and a scary thing Tuesday, May 28, 2012 Mummy has had her own problems with taking care of me (after having nieces and nephews, and being very pregnant ) My sister and I moved away last year, and I thought I might try blogging again after our separation. But my sister has been wanting to write and I started posting. She loves to read and draw and I love working with her. We got married a couple of weeks before Christmas. It's been a really amazing year... Now that I'm gone, it hasn't been easy:D I loved every minute of it! Some days I fell asleep, sometimes I was awake (sometimes I thought I was dreaming), and sometimes I sounded tired. But it has worked well: today I woke up about 4am. Wherever I went, I remembered the story with everyone. Everytime I wake up, I'll close my eyes and take a deep breath. I will open them again before closing my mouth and say, "Today is the day." That's when I realized that I forgot to tell my sister about my pain and worry. And, their their the with with my were par one and and in with with us and (but with - be their our - - - ours - - - - - -
