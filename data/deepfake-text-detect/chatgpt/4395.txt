Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 7th century. It was founded by Mohammad and spread throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, and into other parts of the world. The original center for this faith is Mecca. A major focus of Islam has been on spreading its message among non-Muslim populations. Often this included military conquest or warfare against unbelievers who did not accept their beliefs. In addition to these efforts, many Muslims have worked hard at trying to convert people to being Muslim. One example of such an effort can be found in the story below.
