While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept . So basically what we have here is that the FDA has no credibility in OKC's eyes. The entire premise of GMOs is false hope and belief system built on false beliefs about the safety of GMOs as being such a good thing that they should be tolerated by the public while ignoring reality - which means that the government protects GMOs from criticism rather than protecting them from scrutiny with their regulations or any legitimate scientific evidence against them. What these people don't understand is that groups like the FDA aren't bothered much by the fact that GMOs could lead to harmful consequences (as it would seem). They're just concernedobsessed about profits based on the fearmongers' twisted view toward GMOs.
