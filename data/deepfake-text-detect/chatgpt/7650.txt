While it is important to provide equal job opportunities for individuals with mental illnesses, certain jobs may require specific skill sets and abilities that a person with a certain mental illness may not possess. For example, a person with severe anxiety may not be able to perform well in a high-stress job, such as being an air traffic controller. In such cases, considering the mental illness may be necessary to ensure the safety and productivity of the individual and others. Additionally, if an individual's mental illness causes disruptive behavior or poses a risk to others, it may be necessary to deny them a job that involves interacting with the public or working in certain settings. It is important to balance the rights and needs of individuals with mental illnesses with the safety and success of employers and coworkers.
