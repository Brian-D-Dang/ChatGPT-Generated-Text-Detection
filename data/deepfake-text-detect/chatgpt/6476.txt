I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends I usually enjoy a cup of coffee, but I haven't had one for months. I'm a huge coffee drinker and this makes me crazy. I am a beer drinker and I drink a lot of coffee while I'm in the car, but I'm used to going to the store and buying coffee and other sorts of objects to keep myself going. I don't really pick what I drink, but there is something I don't like in the coffee (e.g.: that I find a really solid coffee and I am not going to drink much of it on my trip to the store to buy coffee) and I don't really know why I like it so much. However, I enjoy drinking coffee and I don't have to buy anything to eat. I don't mean I have to eat it, but I do like to drink it anyway.
