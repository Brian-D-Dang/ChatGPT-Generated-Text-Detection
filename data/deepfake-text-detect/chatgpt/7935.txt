A potential counter-argument to refute this opinion could be that the statement creates a false binary of 'understanding' versus 'criticism.' It is possible to both understand the experiences of minorities and also have valid criticism of certain actions or policies. Additionally, it is important to recognize that individuals may have varying degrees of knowledge and experiences related to different forms of oppression, so it may be more productive to focus on learning and empathy rather than writing off entire groups of people as incapable of understanding.
