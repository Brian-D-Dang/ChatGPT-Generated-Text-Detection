As a gay man, I can be extremely wary of other people for my own protection. I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate others who aren't straight but I think it's natural if you're not really homophobic yourself and love your own sexuality! That being said now that I'm sorry I don't know many queer people so all sounds good enough right? I have no problem with any person doing things like that excepting same sex couples, they obviously do something wrong just because they are gay!!
