I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying that Clinton was a bad choice because she had too many scandals. The best way to get some people to agree is by showing them how the Clintons are destroying the Clintons' reputation. Kudos to Mike Huckabee for being right on everything we saw in this video!
