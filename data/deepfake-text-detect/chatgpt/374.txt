This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... CMV of the Day is a weekly meme hosted by The Daily Dot featuring a different user-submitted CMV every Tuesday. The videos are meant to highlight a different aspect of pop culture each week, be it a new movie trailer, a funny GIF, an interesting news article, or simply an attractive person.
