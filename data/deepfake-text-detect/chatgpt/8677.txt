First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from personal experiences; nor do they have anything to with my actual personality. I agree about sentimentality being a factor, but if you want somebody to get your mind going on things in general, it's always best to start down a path of sorts.
