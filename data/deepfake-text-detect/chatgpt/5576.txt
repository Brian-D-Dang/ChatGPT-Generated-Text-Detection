I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for armed robbery, I do not believe they should have to go to jail for 40 years. If you have to do 20 years in prison, then you have served your time and should be allowed to end your life in prison. I am against the death penalty. I think that the government should not be able to take someone's life. I think the government is too unstable to be in charge of taking someone's life. The government has wrongly convicted people in the past, and I think that can happen. I think that it is wrong to take someone's life. I think that the government has no right to take someone's life. I do believe in the death penalty for very violent crimes. The government does need to be in charge of taking someones life. If someone has murdered another human being then they should be put to death. This is only in very extreme circumstances. For example if someone has murdered 10 people then yes I believe the death penalty should be used. I do believe in the death penalty for very violent crimes.
