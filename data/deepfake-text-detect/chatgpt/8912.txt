Countries need children in order to sustain themselves, without a younger generation the country will not advance and will not be able to sustain itself. Elderly will not be able to hold jobs for an extended period of time because population growth will be so slow that it is not necessary for them to work directly on the farms, as they are too old to have children." In terms of female employment prospects, a number of countries have introduced laws that limit female workers from having children. According to research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the labour market in 80 percent of EU countries has surged from 664 million in 2014 to 819.6 million in 2017. This compares with current levels of 23 million births.
