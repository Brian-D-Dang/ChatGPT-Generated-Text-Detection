While cultural views and stereotypes may play a role in how transsexuality is perceived and discussed, it is not accurate to say that it is solely based on these factors. Many scientific studies have shown that gender identity is a complex phenomenon that is not entirely determined by biological sex or cultural influences. Additionally, it is important to note that transgender individuals have been documented throughout history and across different cultures, suggesting that it is not solely a product of contemporary cultural norms. Furthermore, the experiences of transgender individuals who report feeling discomfort with their assigned gender from a young age can provide evidence that gender identity is not solely based on cultural views or stereotypes.
