Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or any other weapon, then that person, in my view, is guilty of aggravated assault and should be prosecuted as such. Also, I believe that the government should not be permitted to use aggravated assault to forcefully take from one person and give to another, unless the government is somehow entitled to do so. Government is entitled to take from some, and give to others. That's the nature of government, and the nature of taxation. It is not the case that only one person's rights are violated when someone is taxed. They're both violated. The right of the government to tax is violated. The right of the taxpayer to not be taxed is violated. Your argument that the government is violating the rights of the taxpayer is flawed. I'm not trying to be mean here, it's just that you're setting up a strawman. You're also confusing the issue by mixing up the moral and legal issues. And I'm not sure that your proposed legal remedy would be workable. It's one thing to say "X person is violating my rights by doing Y." It's another thing to say "X person is violating my rights by doing Y, and therefore I can forcibly take X's property to compensate me for my violation of Y." I think the legal remedy should be a restitution order, which is actually not that different from your proposed remedy. The difference is that the remedy would be voluntary. So, if X is stealing from you, then you can file a restitution order and try to get X to pay you back. If X doesn't pay you back, then you can forcibly take some of X's property to compensate for the violation of your rights. If X gets in a fight with Y, and Y injures X, then X can file a restitution order and try to get Y to pay X back. If Y doesn't pay X back, then X can forcibly take some of Y's property to compensate for the violation of X's rights. If X is walking down the street with a gun and points it at Y, then Y can file a restitution order and try to get X to pay Y back. If X doesn't pay Y back, then Y can forcibly take some of X's property to compensate for the violation of Y's rights. There are a lot of things that a government can do that are bad. But that doesn't mean that we should give up on government altogether, or that we should say that government is entitled to violate the rights of the taxpayer. I'm sorry, I should have been more clear. I'm not arguing that aggravated assault should be illegal. I'm arguing that a taxpayer should not be charged with aggravated assault if heshe refuses to pay taxes. I'm not trying to set up a strawman. It's just that you appear to be confusing the issue by claiming that a taxpayer has a right to not be taxed, when, in fact, the taxpayer does not have that right. I agree that a government is not entitled to violate the rights of a taxpayer. I am not arguing that a government is entitled to violate the rights of a taxpayer. I'm not sure that a taxpayer should be allowed to file a restitution order for any and all taxes that heshe feels have been wrongfully taken. Taxes are a necessary part of government. If you don't agree with that, please feel free to move to a country without a tax system. So, let's say that you and I are working on a construction site. I get a flat tire on my truck. I can't get home, so I call you. You come to my rescue and drive me home. I go to my house and enter my garage. I try to get my car out of the garage, but I can't. I call you to come and help me get my car out of the garage. You agree to come over, but only if I pay you 20 for your troubles. I agree to pay you 20. I don't have 20. So, I call a friend, who offers to lend me the 20. I
