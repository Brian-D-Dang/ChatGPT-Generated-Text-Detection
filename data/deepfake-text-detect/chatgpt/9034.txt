Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never been to any of these events, but have heard that they're pretty awesome! I've always wondered what's the purpose on these types of events.. To get people talking about them Halloween or some shit lol
