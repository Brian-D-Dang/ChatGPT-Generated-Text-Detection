I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically they're very rare events. But what's really bugging me is the potential for meltdown in fuel rods stored at these facilities (the ones used to actually produce electricity). There are enough spent rods on site to potentially melt down if there was an earthquake or other event like it. This could potentially be a disaster the likes of which we've never seen. The worst part is: you can't just stick them under some cement; they need to be cooled by water running through them continuously until they get back into their original shape. The cooling system would require extensive infrastructure (and probably cost as much as building the plant itself), plus regular maintenance so corrosion doesn't occur over time. And even though current designs don't use plutonium anymore, those waste products will still be around forever...forever! Melting your leg off due to radiation exposure might be kind of cool once every 100 years, assuming you survive such an experience. But literally having radioactive material inside our bodies? Not so appealing after one generation.
