With our constant fast technological advancement people seem to think that we will lead our selves to destruction because we do not use technology with care, but recently all new things developed are now said as destructive. The first one is nuclear energy which has been in development for a long time and so far it doesn't have any effect on environment or living organisms; however if the safety rules themselfs don't work out then there might be some problems arising from this source of power generation! Secondly genetically modified food production was meant only help farmers by providing more efficient methods such ass herbicide tolerant crops (plants) instead they got harmful effects like higher pesticide levels throughout water supplies and also plants can spread their genes even further due accidental seedings, meaning having completely different cultivars than those normally found else where (eg wheat). And third most recent example would probably go unnoticed unless you were around when airplanes started being used commonly: after WW2 jet engines became available at very cheap prices cause surplus airplane parts produced during wars caused low demand therefore lowering price drastically. But these same jets turned into deadly weapons causing many deaths among civilians worldwide via both accidents -such planes falling down harming several houses- plus terrorist attacks using military grade weaponry stolen off battlefields had unprecedented number civilian casualties including women children etc... Nowadays politicians constantly complain about rising fuel costs while refusing alternative sources just yet switching over towards biofuels causes severe environmental damageeffects: firstly plantations require destroying rainforests since trees absorb massive amounts carbon dioxide thus reducing greenhouse gas level producing oxygen too devitalising soil leading up infertile ground; second though biodiversity loss turning once fertile grounds barren desert land slicks full waste mass formation called dead zones occurs near coastlines without natural irrigated vegetation runoff preventing masses drowning offshore fish stocks decline severely killing other wildlife who depend upon wild fisheries populations collapse affecting entire ecosystems profoundly B1],[A9] [C8. The negative economic consequences associated here show how important conservational biotechnology research becomes especially nowadays considering mankind's exponential growth rate..
