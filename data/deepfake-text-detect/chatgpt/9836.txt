Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a war of choice, and while some might say it was necessary in order to keep America secure, I believe it caused a great deal of suffering and loss of life. The war also had a profound effect on the American psyche and changed how we viewed our place in the world. It's important to remember that war is never the answer, and that diplomacy should always be explored first.
