While it's understandable to be optimistic about Bernie Sanders' chances in the 2016 election, it's important to consider the facts. For one, Sanders is an independent senator from Vermont and was elected as a Democrat for the first time this year. He has very little support from established Democratic politicians, many of whom have endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Furthermore, the Democratic National Committee has made it clear that they favor Clinton and have worked to make it difficult for Sanders to gain traction in the primary. Additionally, Sanders' message may appeal to liberal voters, but it's unlikely that it will resonate with more moderate or conservative voters. Moreover, considering Bernie Sanders' age, and the fact that he would be running against a formidable Republican candidate, it's unlikely he would be able to win the presidency. In short, while Sanders has made impressive strides in his campaign, it's unlikely that he has a realistic chance of winning the 2016 election.
