It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be put on display to educate the public and help in conservation efforts. For example, many of you probably have not heard about "Whale Wars," a TV show featuring two teams competing for whale meat off the coast of Japan (I'm told it's pretty good). In this competition, one team captures the whales alive while the other kills them so as to get all their blubber. Because these are wild animals being slaughtered under very stressful circumstances we should feel bad when we watch? No! We should learn from it. It might even motivate us to donate money towards charities or organizations working toward better animal welfare situations around the world. And, yes, some people do care about how things like slaughters at SeaWorld play into our collective consciousness. So what if they're just performing tricks for our amusement? Many would argue that abusing an animal because someone else was willing to pay top dollar (or yen) for its performance isn't ethical either...unless those performers were kept highly motivated by receiving adequate nutrition, housing, medical treatment etc., which most circus animals don't receive. Also, there exist circuses where individuals who perform exotic acts also work with local communities providing educational services, helping teach kids how to save endangered species andor teaching young children more general life skills such as compassion and respect for nature. These groups often also offer opportunities for abused animals in need of rehabilitation to find new homes with caring individuals. Finally, although perhaps less likely than other ways to benefit wildlife, zoological parks could act as sites to house injured or orphaned wildlife whose populations may otherwise suffer due to human disturbance. Such facilities already exist throughout Europe and North America; [here's] (URL0), for instance, is an organization dedicated to rehabbing and releasing birds of prey back into the wild after injuries suffered during hunting season.
