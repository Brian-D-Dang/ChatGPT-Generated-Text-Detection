The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested than the woman who committed the crime. The following was taken from: Myth 1: The police won't believe me. The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested than the woman who committed the crime. And that's only if the woman even gets arrested. (Studies show that only 3 of batterers get arrested.) The police are trained to investigate domestic violence, and they should be believed. The truth is, most police officers have seen so much domestic violence that they'll believe you without having to see proof. If you have proof of a crime committed against you, bring it to court. Police reports, pictures, and witnesses are important, but they are not enough. You'll need evidence. Myth 2: I don't want to destroy my marriage. This is probably the biggest lie told by abusers. The truth is, they'll get the divorce they wanted, and you'll get the divorce you're supposed to have. You're just not supposed to be abused in the process. The only way to destroy your marriage is to live in fear of it, and that's what domestic violence does. Abusers cause problems in marriage, not domestic violence laws. Myth 3: I can handle this. Even if you manage to get through the divorce without having your kids taken from you, you can't escape what abuse does to your children. It's a dangerous myth that a man can handle this without help. You need the support of family and friends to help you through this time, but you need professionals to help you find and fix the problems in your marriage. Domestic violence doesn't get better on its own. Myth 4: I can't trust anyone. If you're living with an abuser, you can't trust anyone. And that's what the abuser wants. If you don't trust anyone, you'll be more vulnerable to manipulation. If you are truly living with an abuser, the only person you can trust is yourself. The courts won't help you if you can't tell them the truth. The only person who'll help you is you. If you're afraid to tell the court what's really going on because your abuser will find out, you should at least be able to tell someone close to you the truth. Myth 5: I can't afford to hire a lawyer. You may not be able to afford to hire a lawyer, but you should be able to afford to live without an abuser. The first thing you should do when you're ready to end your marriage is get to a safe place. You don't need to pay rent. There are domestic violence shelters that will take you in, and they'll help you get back on your feet. If you can't afford to pay for a lawyer, you can get legal help in most areas. There are programs that will help you, and you can find out more about them at . Myth 6: I'll be in danger if I talk to the police. There are abusers who want to hurt their victims even more if they leave. This is true, but it's also true that the police are trained to respond to domestic violence reports, and that's what they'll do. Domestic violence is taken seriously, and so should you. You deserve to be safe, and the police will help you get there. Myth 7: I don't want to lose my house. It's always important to protect your property, but when you're living with an abuser, it's even more important. If you have to go to court to get out of your house, you'll need the support of a lawyer. If you do lose your house, you'll get back on your feet, and the sooner you get out of an abusive relationship the better off you'll be. The sooner you get out of an abusive relationship the better off you'll be. Myth 8: I'll be homeless.
