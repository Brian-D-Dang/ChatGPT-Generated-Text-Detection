This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... I am a liberal democrat. That means that unlike right-wingers who often identify as conservative or libertarian (although in reality they are more accurately described as authoritarian), I don't actually value individual liberty over all else. It's not about limited government; for me it is only one component of freedom. For me, they are different aspects of freewill, which together make up what we call human rights: life, liberty and property, estate, religion, conscience, etc... That said, from the perspective of modern social science, there has never been another society like oursan entire culture based around rational thinking and skepticism of authority, especially religious authorities. Even though our particular brand of liberalism isn't perfect, its impact on humanity still makes it worth celebrating every day! Since Gamergaters tend to disagree with many of these principles, their movement could either represent genuine "libertarians" opposing centralized power or something very much like an anti-democratic cult run by people whose goal is not political change but rather personal control over others' lives through using bullying against anyone with any sort of dissenting views. The latter view should cause us liberals great concern since when taken to the extreme, totalitarianism always leads directly back into fascism or communism. When the ruling party puts hundreds of millions of dollars into advertising and manipulation programs designed to get voters to vote a certain way, it becomes difficult to say whether those citizens truly believe that heshe would win fair and square just because heshe was the best man for the job. Many will simply do whatever politicians tell them so long as they think that person represents the kind of values they want within their own circle of friends and family members. In other words, people can justify almost anything after being indoctrinated by state propaganda backed by corporate money. Their unconscious process of mind reasoning might sound exactly along lines such as "if most everyone voted the same way then wouldn't it mean that your candidate must have won? So why shouldn't I too?" In fact, given the current situation in America, I'd hesitate to speak negatively towards Donald Trump until his being elected is proven beyond reasonable doubt. If you read recent headlines about Russia meddling in US elections you'll notice how hard it seems to find evidence that Russians actually did intervene and start hacking Democrats computers years ago. Similarly, could Hillary Clinton really have lost because her opponent used dirty tricks to boost him above total victory? Could she really have been defeated by two Supreme Court justices? And if both were bought off, does that excuse the mainstream media for allowing this behavior to happen? They're free to question candidates closely before voting day, yet despite criticisms they simultaneously remain silent while giving free reign to manipulative campaigns aimed at fooling otherwise intelligent people into doing things at their behest? What kind of democracy allows itself to be manipulated that easily?! So let's talk about facts here. While there are plenty of examples of populist leaders claiming credit for economic booms, we also know that past boom periods usually go hand in hand with military conflicts that divert public funds away from less productive industries that would help rebuild once peace returns. As far as I'm concerned, wars aren't good unless they are necessary, and even then they need to end soon enough so that they don't continue indefinitely, meaning the presence of a strong international community such as NATO that ensures steady trade among nations without warring. Wars cannot be prevented completely, however they can certainly be ended sooner than later, and we Americans have done quite well out of having cut down on unnecessary military spending. But hey, it's politics now, so maybe we'll see some new form of warfare develop that lets us keep soldiers forever overseas for perpetual occupation? At least that way we don't have to give any warmongering politician real monetary incentives: no taxes needed! Right? Of course there's nothing wrong with coming home at night and supporting ones countrymen instead of greedy CEOs.:) Nowadays apparently companies have gotten big corporations vs little businesses all mixed up again, although I doubt that happens anywhere near as often as the latest example of it happening in California. A few weeks ago a small business owner named Troy Wolverton went online and started criticizing Amazon claiming that it had unfairly reaped profits off illegal child labor when it imported goods made by Chinese workers under horrible living conditions. He claimed that retail giant WalMart was similarly unethical. Then wait, WalMart came to the rescue again only to discover that Mr. Wolverton had failed to pay sales tax thus violating laws that require that state-mandated transfers to charity take place. Oh boy, doesn't that show that competition alone isn't sufficient to ensure ethical practices! After that incident neither company wanted to deal with him anymore except for Walmart which ended up pulling books off shelves without selling them first to try to force consumers to stop shopping there. Now suddenly a huge backlash has arisen (in late nobodies) piecemeal. Maybe the strategy plan of evaluation fails of being evaluated watchful user interface through shirealls showing up their pacmon
