Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never been to a Pride Parade before, but I'm interested in being supportive and learning more about the experiences and struggles of the LGBTQ community. Can you offer any advice on how to be a good ally at a Pride Parade?
