I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have livedcurrently live there, I could not be more dead set I have to be in NYC to fully love it. I want to live there for the museums and the culture. I want to live there for the high unemployment rate, the high crime rate and the high school dropout rate. NYC has everything I want - the cultural life, the restaurants, the museums and the high unemployment rate. And I want to live there for the high unemployment rate, the high crime rate and the high school dropout rate.
