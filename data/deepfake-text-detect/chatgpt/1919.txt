Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good or doesn't taste nearly as fresh and delicious as freshly made pizza does. When you get a great pie at your local pizzeria it has so much going for it - including its crisp edges that have been baked perfectly (not soggy), plenty of gooey cheese oozing over every square inch, with just enough sauce not too overwhelming your other toppings like peppers or onions. And don't forget about crunchy pepperonis! The difference between those items vs. their counterparts on a box of store-bought frozen pizza? It really is night and day...and sometimes I wonder why anyone would ever make such terrible choices when they are readily available in stores right next door.
