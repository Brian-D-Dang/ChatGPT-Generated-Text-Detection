I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several dogs and none of them can survive without sleep for more than two days at a time (unless they've been under strong sedation). Damn. Do you know why?
