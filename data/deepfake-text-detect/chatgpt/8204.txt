I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to detect anything beyond these first two. The closest thing would be decay products from alpha poisons (a special kind of radiation) which are unstable too - so you could try looking for them if they exist after all those other ones were split apart by radioactivity...:)
