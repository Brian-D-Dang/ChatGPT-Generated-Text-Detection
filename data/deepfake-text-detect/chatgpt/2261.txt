EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People who suffer from anxiety and PTSD do experience triggers but those "triggers" aren't always related to something external such as music - it is often internalized instead. I'm pretty sure I understood your point just fine without re-reading this post three times lol
