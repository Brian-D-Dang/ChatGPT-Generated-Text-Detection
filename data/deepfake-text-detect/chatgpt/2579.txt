I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, the light and dark of life. But that's kind of obvious to think about isn't? After all we're humans right? So what I am saying is: why don't you have more than two categories for your images? Well, maybe because I spent most of my time as an illustrator working on book covers or magazines where just about anything goes (although some publishers might disagree with me). And believe me when I say that even these avenues can be limiting at times!
