I believe that people have a moral obligation to donate money they do not need. Full stop. But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of charity, and I believe that it should not be involved in such activities. Not because the government is bad, but because charity is a personal matter and should not be handled by the government. The government should not be involved in such activities because it will divert funding from other important areas, such as education and law enforcement. The government will not only be doing a disservice to the people who receive the money, but will also be doing a disservice to those who give the money, as well. The government will also be in the position of deciding which charities should receive the money, and I believe that that is not the government's job. This may seem hypocritical, as I am a member of the government and will have to make that decision myself in the future. But I have faith that I can do that without dipping into the tax dollars of my constituents. I believe that the government should provide charity when it is necessary to protect the citizens. A prime example of this would be the recent tsunami in Japan. The government should have a large amount of money, and not have to depend on the people to raise funds to help with the relief efforts. It should be able to be able to provide food, water, and shelter for the people affected by the disaster. The government should also be able to provide charity when it is necessary to promote national interests. One example of this would be the relief efforts in Afghanistan. The Afghan people are suffering under the Taliban, and the government needs to help them. It should be able to provide food and shelter for the people affected by the Taliban.
