A counter-argument to this opinion could be that everyone has the right to wear what they feel comfortable in, and it shouldn't be dictated by someone else's comfort level. It's unfair to impose your personal beliefs and preferences onto someone else's choice of clothing. Additionally, clothing is a form of self-expression and identity, and it's important to respect someone's autonomy in that regard. It's also worth considering that someone wearing revealing clothing doesn't equate to them being promiscuous or inviting unwanted attention - their clothing choices don't justify harassment or assault by others. Ultimately, it's important to trust and support your partner's choices, and have open and honest communication about any concerns or boundaries you may have.
