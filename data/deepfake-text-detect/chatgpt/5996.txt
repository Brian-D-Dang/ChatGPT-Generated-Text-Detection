Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make it to college, but just because we want to, doesn't mean it's going to happen. I know high school is a long way away and things change, but what do you think the future holds for tuition? I'm scared to death it will be up to 100,000 a year, but what do you guys think? I think that there will be a surge in college tuition due to the economy. It's hard to tell how much of an increase it will be because it's going to depend on the states and the colleges themselves. I hope that it doesn't go that high, though. I don't think it will hit that high, but it might get close to it. I think that there will be some lucky colleges that won't have a surge in tuition. The schools that get it are the ones that are supported by the government and don't have to worry about losing funding. I'm afraid that it will go higher. I don't want to think about how high, but it won't be fun. I hope that it doesn't go that high though. I really don't want to pay that much for my education. I don't know about the United States, but in Canada, there is a plan for free tuition at universities in Ontario. I hope so, because I'm going to a university in Ontario. I hope it doesn't go that high too. I'm sure the government is thinking about the costs of education. It has to be much more expensive for a college to run than a public school. It's going to be interesting to see what the prices of the colleges are 18 years from now. I hope that it doesn't get that high, but I can see it happening. I hope it doesn't get that high though. I think that it will go up. I mean, it's going to take a lot of money to keep a college running. I'm sure that the colleges are going to be raising their tuition to cover the costs of running their schools. I hope that it doesn't go that high either. I don't think that there will be any schools that will have a high tuition. I hope that most of the schools are going to be able to stay around the same price, though. I don't want to pay that much for tuition. I'm sure that we're all going to have to pay a lot for our education. I don't think that they are going to raise the tuition for everyone. I think that they are going to raise the tuition for those that don't get scholarships. I hope that I can get one, though. I hope that the schools can stay around the same price, too. I hope that they aren't going to raise the prices for everyone. I would be devastated if the prices were raised for everyone. I think that they will raise the tuition for everyone. I know that some schools are raising their tuition already. It's not too high yet, but it's going up. I don't know how much it will be going up by, but I think that it will continue to go up. I hope that it doesn't go up that high, but I know that it will go up. I just hope that it's not as high as I think it will be. I hope that it's not as high as it is now. I don't think it's going to go that high. I don't think that the schools are going to raise the tuition for everyone. I think that it's only going to be the people who don't get scholarships. I think that the schools are going to offer some sort of financial aid to the people that are in need. I hope that the tuition for the schools stays around the same price. I know that it's going to be different prices for different schools, but I hope that it's not too different. I want to go to college, but I don't want to pay a lot of money for it. I hope that I'm able to get some sort of scholarship or help from the school itself. I hope that the schools are able to get money to keep their tuition low. I know that it's hard for them to run their schools. I hope that they are able to find ways to keep their tuition low, though. I don't want to pay a lot of money for my education.
