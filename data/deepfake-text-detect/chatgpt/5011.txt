Let me start off by stating what I believe the reddit basic income theory is. From what I have read from rbasicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society where everyone gets paid for doing nothing but providing services to others who don't deserve it or want no benefit themselves because they are lazy and stupid enough not to work hard enough, this will happen regardless of how much you contribute as to ensure everybody benefits. This means that if you give people something that you think makes them happy then eventually, if you do get rid of welfare it becomes almost impossible to earn anything worthwhile without going bankrupt due to the huge economic incentive to not pay taxes on your tax bill (which most people aren't inclined to). With this model we can expect people to be wealthier than ever before; it really comes down to who pays more money back into society rather than just getting rich quick. It also allows us all to help each other out. If we had universal basic income instead of government subsidized subsidies our entire economy would collapse tomorrow. What about the benefits? You realize that many people already suffer from depression disorders since there isn't anyone else around to fix their problems right now while those who need assistance desperately can't afford any better alternatives like drugs so why should governments hand over millions in aid when they could provide free shit for daycare centers? I'm sorry but the amount of money wasted at day care centers shouldn't even exist There's literally zero way someone can afford healthcare nowadays
