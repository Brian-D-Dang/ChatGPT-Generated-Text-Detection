I believe that it is bad for humans generally that we have patriotism. It leads not only to discrimination. (hello Mr Trump) But also to economic and political difficulties and , in the end, a lack of democracy. I don't think this country, or at least its founding fathers would approve of what has happened. So there's no reason America can't be democratic?
