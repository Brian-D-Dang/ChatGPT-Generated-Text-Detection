With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned as an open forum of discussion then fine, but now its just a forum for white men who want to discuss their beer and football and rape jokes. when it functioned as an open forum Did they ever do that?
