Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as possible, and all that stuff. I completely agree with them! Personal finance is such an important skill to have, yet it's one of those topics that often gets overlooked in school curriculums. Teaching young people about budgeting, saving, investing, and other financial fundamentals can be hugely beneficial for their future. It's great to see people spreading the word about this!
