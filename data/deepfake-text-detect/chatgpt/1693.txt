As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not an investment in the future, but rather it's an expenditure on our own short-term selfish interests." The researchers asked parents who had experience with postpartum depression about their thoughts regarding their choice and if they could afford another pregnancy after one or more children were born. They found 64 said yes when questioned whether they would choose adoption over having another child; while 31 said no matter what the circumstances they wouldn't want any more kids; 12 felt undecided between adopting and going through sperm donation or surrogacy; 8 indicated they'd go for identical twins (if there was a need); 6 preferred surrogate mothers instead of biological mothers; 3 wanted multiples via IVFICSI treatment.

"Infertility, like many conditions, has become a pandemic," she says. "No two people are alike. Sometimes you just don't know until you're faced with trying to conceive again why your body isn't cooperating with you. If fertility struggles persist then consider all available avenues before deciding on adoption because each path helps families of different shapes and sizes grow."
