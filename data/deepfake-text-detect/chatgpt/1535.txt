I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for murder or rape, I'm fine with that. But if they want to take control over themselves and choose not to kill them self at all costs then I think you've got something going on there. Yeah but what about people like this? "One can only hope it was worth it," he said, of his decision "to take my own life."
