I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, I'd be able to give my kids a good life, but I still feel like it's wrong of me to bring a child into this world when there are so many out there who need homes and love. So I think that if I ever do have children, they'll be adopted.
