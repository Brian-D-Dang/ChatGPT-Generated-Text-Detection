In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me as well, but also what happens when you decide that it's time for you to step up your game? I'm not saying you should abandon the game entirely or anything like that but that the community needs more content creators willing to challenge the rules with their creative writing and creativity - it has been suggested in this subreddit by many members already here (see my reply above). It isn't just a matter of letting people know about this already; it can help the community develop better. It would make sense at the same time if the games are competitively priced rather than being driven by the PUBG studio bosses who constantly moan about everything else except for the fact that they're trying hard enough sometimes. A lot of the community wants the games themselves to grow faster so there could possibly be some player feedback on this issue too!
