Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. What exactly would the elimination of all these objects do? It's a very complicated question with many answers and many unknowns. The best way I can put it is "the universe will be fine." It will not end in total annihilation and destruction like what happened at the end of the Cold War, but some things will change for better.
