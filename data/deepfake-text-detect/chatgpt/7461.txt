One argument against the legalization of prostitution is that it reinforces gender inequality and exploitation of women. Legalizing prostitution does not address the root causes of the industry, which often involve poverty, educational disadvantage, and lack of employment opportunities. It also puts vulnerable women at risk of violence and sexual abuse, as there is usually no union or regulatory body to protect them. Research has consistently shown that legalizing prostitution does not reduce violence against women and may, in fact, increase demand for commercial sexual services. Thus, rather than legalizing prostitution, society should focus on addressing the underlying issues and providing support and alternative choices for those at risk of entering the industry.
