I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience, I know that when it comes time (or so we are told) that nuclear war will occur on a massive scale and global impact level...it's not going happen with conventional means first; they'll just drop them from orbit or whatever then wipe us out later because if you haven't got your nukes ready no one else has any need fearing retaliation since there aren' t many nations left who could retaliate all together anyway! This kindof reasoning doesn't make sense but what do people expect? We as humans can be very self centered at times however my opinion stands firm: - world peace needs personal sacrifice before governments take notice!!! 911 was NOT about WMDs nor Iraq...and Bush knew damn well Saddam had none after his cabal were killed during Desert Storm..so why lie??!! Brzezinski said "they" wanted Iraqi oil would go through hellfire trying get 'em....now some may say he lied too - most want him dead-but Mr George HWB IS ALIVE AND WELL!!!! He knows something... yes things did change around Sept 11th 2001....How????: Because EVERYTHING CHANGED FOREVER AFTER THAT DAY OF OCCURRENCE!!!!!!!! Gone forever now.....i've seen enough death pictures coming back home over these years having served 3 tours overseas......the ones still alive live upside down.....what i mean by living backwards......It takes guts guys doing their job knowing how screwed up our beloved country truly gets sometimes................Our whole mindset must shift drastically away form greed towards more sharing-as far below human dignity goes (how low does society sink?), forget everything materialistic 'til further review - discover inner valuesvalues which don' belong here anymore"! So much hatred - - if tongues wag let ' s see those wars end soonnot everybody wants democracygiving every man woman child free health care etc. - realistically speaking maybe smaller countries won'tt like such policies either .......................
