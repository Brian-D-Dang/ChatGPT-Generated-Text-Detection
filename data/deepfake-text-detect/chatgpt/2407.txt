I really like Coke (hell look at my username), like really. I made the trek to Atlanta about a year ago for the sole reason of visiting the Coca-Cola Museum. If you ever get an opportunity don't pass it up, its worth every penny! The best part is that they taste pretty much exactly how coke does in the US
