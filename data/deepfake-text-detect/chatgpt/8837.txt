A few months ago, I wrote a blog post about how the "organization of life" in Europe has changed since the 1970s. It seems to have taken on much more importance now than before-public relations, culture, politics (and especially mass media), sports, religion, etc., have been passed from one generation to another. The world's economy is no longer dominated by its social classes or race categories, and there isn't any need to reinvent the wheel or change anything else. In fact, many things still work well against them because they don't seem forced on anyone. And even if they do, it doesn't make them less deserving of our love. I think that our community could benefit greatly from being more inclusive towards those extra special needs that are visible, such as autism, brain disease, HIVAIDS, etc. Finally, while I thought it would only be possible to say something positive about Muslim women today, I wonder what their attitudes might be today if they were straight, married, had kids, or otherwise looked like them.
