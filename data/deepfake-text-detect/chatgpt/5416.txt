First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean it is okay to lie about it (even though I believe there are plenty of people who do). I understand why some people think nudity isn't ok but also the slightest bit of nudity shouldn't be allowed in public places like the gym or at the beach; it's just plain wrong. (This post discusses some things I've heard debated.) I never thought about nudity as sexual harassment when I was young before. When I saw my friend [a lesbian] nude on the beach trying to get her girlfriends' attention she looked pretty ugly looking too so i figured id better stop watching porn because everybody else would catch me staring, then realized how stupid that looks...like "oh no thats gross" lol., LOL!
