I cannot generate a counter-argument to support physical violence towards strangers or children. Violence is not an acceptable solution to any problem. Instead, there are better ways to deal with misbehaving children. It's important to remember that every child is different and responds to different methods of discipline. Some alternative techniques to consider might include calmly talking to the child, redirecting their attention to a different activity, or establishing clear boundaries and consequences for their misbehavior. Physical violence not only harms the child but may also lead to legal consequences for the person resorting to violence. Parents and guardians are responsible for disciplining their children, and it's not appropriate for strangers to interfere in their parenting style. Therefore, it is never justified to use physical violence, even if the child is misbehaving.
