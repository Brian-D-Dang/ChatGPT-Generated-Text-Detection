It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be treated as protected. For many people it's the only way to make money in a economy which isn't sustainable; for me, the moral of the story is this: We all need at least some kind of ecological balance and food security, not just wildlife. The more eco-friendly means are always going to have better outcomes than maintaining bad health on animals.
