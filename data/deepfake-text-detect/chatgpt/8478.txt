For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system where some form or another; government owns andor controls all forms (means) of industry in that country." The question: How do you define capitalism? Why are there different definitions for what should be one word - capitalist industrialized countries versus socialist ones? And why would people who have never been to any Industrializing Countries think Socialists live better than Capitalist economies when they see so many economic problems plaguing places like Africa, Eastern Europe etc.? What's wrong here if we just look at economics alone without taking into account politics freedom.. In other words how can it make sense economically speaking today......................for example....in Russia under socialism......the economy was on decline but politicians were great!!! It seems obvious now by looking back historically i guess:) But then again not economical interests only 2ndly Political interest...as well. This debunks my theory: (The reason being definition part which doesn't hold water from both sides according me: So please enlighten us!! Thanks alot!:
