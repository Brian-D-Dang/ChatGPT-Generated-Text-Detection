I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry -ass atheists would like to think. The world is fucked up enough without the very vocal minority being complete assholes about it on social media (and yes, this is me). As long as you're not forcing your faith on others... It's fine. As long as they don't force theirs down other peoples throats? Not cool Yes and no, some people just need their religion shoved in their face so much that they become vengeful and hateful towards those who do not share their views.
