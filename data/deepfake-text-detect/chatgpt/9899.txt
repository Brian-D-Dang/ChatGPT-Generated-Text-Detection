To get this out of the way early: This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk. An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation. I'm here to talk about the pros and cons of PC gaming, not to argue why it's the best platform. PC gaming has been around for decades, but in recent years it has grown in popularity thanks to a variety of factors. On the surface, PC gaming has many advantages over console gaming: more powerful hardware, better graphics and sound, cheaper games, and a larger selection of games. But there are also some drawbacks to PC gaming, which should be considered before diving in. The biggest advantage of PC gaming is that it is much more powerful than console gaming. PCs have higher-end graphics cards, more RAM, and faster processors, all of which give them a significant performance edge over consoles. This makes PC gaming a great choice for hardcore gamers who want to get the most out of their gaming experience. However, the high cost of building or buying a gaming PC can be prohibitive for some people. The cost of upgrading components to keep up with the latest technology can also be a major expense. Furthermore, PCs require more technical know-how to set up and maintain, which can be intimidating for those who are less tech-savvy. In addition, the sheer amount of options available on the PC market can be overwhelming. With so many different components, configurations, and games to choose from, it can be difficult to know what's right for you. And since each game may require different hardware specs, it can be time consuming to find the best setup for your needs. Finally, although PC gaming is usually cheaper than console gaming, there are still some games that can be quite expensive. This means that if you're not careful, you could end up spending more than necessary on a game. Overall, PC gaming has its pros and cons, just like any other form of gaming. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide if the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. If you think PC gaming is right for you, then go for it!
