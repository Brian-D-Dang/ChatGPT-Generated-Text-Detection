To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going forward. But the right of gay couples not only exist on this planet but also exists within each other as well (though it's a dichotomy based on religion), so I want all gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transsexuals etc., to experience equality before it becomes acceptable or necessary for them to marry. The justice department is just making good faith efforts toward equality through legal action instead of law enforcement actions against those who clearly promote homophobia while even worse offenders commit crimes like pedophilia.
