In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing the point either way, but I have to admit that it has occurred to me that there are many advantages to having a polygamous marriage, not least of which is that it would help to combat the problem of gender imbalance in India. A quick bit of googling revealed that polygamy is illegal in India, but that it is widely practiced. This article suggests that this is because of the patriarchal nature of our society. We tend to think of patriarchal societies as ones in which men rule, but in India it's not uncommon for women to be the ones who rule, and men to have multiple wives, who are always subservient to the mother-in-law. In fact, polygamy may be a good solution to the problem of gender imbalance in India, which is caused by the fact that men have a much higher mortality rate than women. It means that there are fewer men than there are women of marriageable age, and consequently, women are put under more pressure to get married than men are. It seems to me that if polygamous marriages were legal, then men who wanted to marry more than one wife would be able to do so. At the same time, women would be able to choose to marry only one husband, if they so wished. And that would solve the problem of gender imbalance. Labels: gender imbalance, polygamous marriage
