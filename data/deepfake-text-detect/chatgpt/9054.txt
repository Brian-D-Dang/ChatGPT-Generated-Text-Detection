Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not just their kitchen, but they don't let me go without plates or cups for a full night at no charge. They only take one plate out of my fridge at work and then wait until after dinner to put them back in. If you can get away with thisdeliver food by yourself, you might as well go for it. Oh man, how am I gonna explain myself? My last day is tomorrow! And it's 3am here, which means I haven't had lunch since 5 am (but still need to eat). It seems like a waste to have to wait till after midnight when people should be eating before going hungry. I guess I was just feeling lazy because of how busy our house has been and all. I'm waiting on the phone too. Any tips or suggestions would be great:)
