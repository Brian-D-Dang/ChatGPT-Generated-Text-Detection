This is a very sensitive topic so sorry for posting it here if I am not supposed to. This is a true CMV, I am on the fence about the situation and would like some opinions from people who have experience in this area If you could go back in time and tell your younger self one thing that you wish you knew now what would it be? (megusta "I'd ignore all my parents' advice. Did i make the right choice?" This has helped me so much over the years with life Now this can only come from an older person but... Not everyone makes good decisions. Your decision was the best one you made at the moment. Everything else comes later.
