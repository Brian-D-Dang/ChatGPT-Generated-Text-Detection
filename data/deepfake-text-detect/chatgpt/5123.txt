I know this is a very controversial subject, and many people disagree with me, and I have to admit, I am not the perfect judge for this. A little background info: I can confirm that I did not make this up or write this article in order to promote my own opinions about what my opinion on the topic would be like. But I hope you get it, because this will help you understand why people don't think as I do when they read it! I trust you guys will agree with me:) As far as I am concerned, I believe it is important to remember that the majority of the population doesn't actually care about the issues that you mention here. Nobody wants to listen to people who claim to support equality over diversity so it seems unfair to lump everyone into one category. Although there are plenty of instances where people criticize race based racism (e.g., the schools that were founded by whites). However, they're just doing their best to protect their own interests from those whose only purpose might be protecting white privilege.
