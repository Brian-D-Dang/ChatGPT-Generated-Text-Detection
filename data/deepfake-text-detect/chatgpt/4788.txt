Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over a hundred thousand songs on their phone and an iPod that can hold hundreds more, but still feel as though they're missing something. The problem? The app sucks! It's slow, buggy, takes up too much memory, has no speed dialing, or any other useful features. Even if you were lucky enough to get some new song recommendations that sounded interesting in your browser... did they make it into your library? Probably not. You'd be forced back into the search screen where you had zero luck finding whatever it was you wanted. Luckily, this problem doesn't exist anymore thanks to TuneIn Radio (Android iOS). If you've ever listened to radio before Spotify, then you know how annoying it is having all those ads blare at ya every few seconds while listening to the station. I just want to hear the DJ talk, nothing else matters. With TuneIn Radio, however, this isn't a problem since ALL the radio stations stream live with NO advertisements. No matter what type of music you like, whether country, rock, pop, rap, jazz etc., chances are TuneIn will play it to you within minutes of signing up, giving another reason why we should always keep our phones plugged in. Spotify needs improvement because music streaming services need competition. And TuneIn helps provide such competition by offering its own service along side existing apps which allow users to choose between them based off of their personal preferences without switching platforms. TuneIn Radio is available from both Google Play Store and Apple Appstore. As far as pricing goes, there really isn't one way of describing each particular subscription plan: subscriptions start at 5month (10 monthly) for individual plans whereas groups range anywhere from 9-12 per person. For unlimited access, you'll pay around 20-30 month depending on the length of time compared to buying single tracks, albums, or full playlists individually going through iTunes. If you're interested in trying out this alternative app, here are quick tips and tricks about using it: 1.) Enter an incorrect password once in a blue moon and the site won't let you log back in until you change your email address so the only real option you have after being locked out is to call customer support. Just kidding - it lets you sign right back in to the account even if you forgot your username or got locked out somewhere down the line. 2.) Search for things and click "listen now." To listen, tap next button twice. Tap again to complete. 3.) When searching results comes up, hit "add" in top left hand corner and pick the artist, album, or playlist you'd prefer to add instead of playing the selected result from the previous step; otherwise, clicking adds songs from the very beginning of your collection. 4.) While browsing, use the star icon at bottom middle to quickly filter results by favorite artists, genres, year, etc. 5.) Click "new story" near the bottom center of the page to browse news articles related to popular topics such as chart updates, interviews, promotional events, and many others. 6.) Visit the forums via the tab located towards right end of the home page or on mobile view, where community members discuss issues, share tips tricks, offer help, and give feedback. Unfortunately, the forum help section does NOT translate well across languages, making navigating difficult. In regards to user reviews, most aren't horrible although not everyone seems to understand menu structure or utilize menus correctly. Still, it beats scrolling an entire review thread looking for a specific answer. User comments take you directly to relevant sections under threads, helping tremendously especially when there really is nothing helpful in said reviews. 7.) Lastly, visit the newsletter which usually includes short tutorials videos, exclusive offers, and upcoming announcements including happenings within the community itself plus a list of current trending stories. Don't forget to scroll down past the footer and look up where exactly you can subscribe. 8.) Signing up is easy in case you haven't done so yet. How cool is that?! 9.) Download your free base version right away by visiting Overall, TUNeRiAD provides everything needed to enjoy good quality internet radio FREE of charge. Add to that absolutely no ads, brilliant web interface, a simple, intuitive navigation system, and fantastic user experience coupled together; paying for anything less would simply be foolish in my opinion. Plus, unlike Spotify with its requirement to install software first to download content, TUNEIN Radio downloads directly to your smartphone allowing all users regardless of platform to enjoy great Internet radio on the go. Of course, outside of these big reasons alone, there are also numerous smaller factors that contribute to a successful product. By providing better service than competing products, TUNEIN Radio has been able to raise numbers showing that sound like life values keep referring to do not finding to miscellaneous massachusetts' shop show firstis an amazes to fire
