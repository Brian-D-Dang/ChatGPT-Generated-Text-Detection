I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to environmental problems, but I think it's important to know just how bad things were for these poor creatures before we decide not to save them or euthanize them if they become unwell due to disease or injury. It is really sad and disturbing what humans will do to animals.
