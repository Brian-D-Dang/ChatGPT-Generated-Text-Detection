The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, but not precisely what happened before or after this period of time known as "the big bang." But I think an answer will be found eventually; if there is a God who made all things, then he must have also created the laws which govern his creation - so whatever law was used for the formation of our particular universe (weit are now living inside one such), should still apply today. So long as these basic principles were true at some point during history, than they can just be applied again without any major problems. I do believe there has been life elsewhere on earth since its beginning...though whether intelligent life existed beforehand remains unproven. Of course, even primitive forms of intelligence would be able to develop technology here, once the initial technological base had sufficiently advanced enough. Also note: The UN is currently working with various other countries preparing missions to Mars within 20 years or more! If humans can survive on another planet temporarily, why wouldn't they be able to live among the stars? Even much further away from ours? We're very adaptable creatures. Just my thoughts....
