The expense of a higher education has been a hot button issue for a number of years but the fact that students take on huge loans and graduate with huge debts seems to be at least as much of an issue. There is some evidence that those who attend college tend to earn more money in their lifetime than those who don't, so it would seem like any decision made by someone entering "the world" should have something positive about its impact over time. There are many studies that show why attending college increases earnings or even decreases unemployment rates (see here and here). And although there may be only one career path available, most people find themselves moving from job to job throughout their lives because we all need breaks now and then. But what if you could have both? What if after you finish your degree you can immediately get another one? That maybe sounds too good to be true...it probably is! It turns out though when you look into this phenomenon called dual enrollment high school graduates end up having lower loan debt and starting off life earning far greater incomes than non-dual enrolled diploma holders. Of course they also start out with a headstart academically and financially which means they could conceivably go on to become leading academics or financial experts. It doesn't matter how old the study was either; lots of research has found these same results. In 2015 The New York Times did a little digging into the history of these findings and came across two relatively recent ones: One published last year by researchers from Virginia Tech and the other just last month from a University of Missouri researcher. They both looked at data tracking student progress through several undergraduate programs at state universities between 1965 and 2013. Their conclusion: Students who enroll in the first quarter of classes run the risk of failing and not graduating, yet they still make substantially more income later down the line. In addition to producing better professionally prepared workers, such courses corrects educational deficiencies, adds content necessary for specialized careers, and improves employment prospects. Concurrent intake offers multiple subjects taken simultaneously within the structure of the regular academic schedule rather than at different times during the day and semester. Many concurrent intakes features clinical practicum components where learners engage directly in learning activities in clinics setting. Dual enrollment allows students to achieve competency in skills required for work prior to graduation using the university resources and instruction. If you're interested in finding out more about how dual enrollment works I strongly encourage taking note of the video below produced by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) outlining exactly how dual enrollment works in each state. If you want to learn more about how it might benefit you personally then check out my article where I discuss the benefits of dual enrollment further.
