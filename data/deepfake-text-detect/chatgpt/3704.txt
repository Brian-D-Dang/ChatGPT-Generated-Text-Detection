So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor ethnicity, meaning they cannot hold power over majority groups. Therefore, they cannot be racist towards the majority. However, they can certainly be prejudiced or discriminatory towards individuals within the majority group. The appropriation of white supremacy refers to the idea that non-white individuals may adopt some of the attitudes, behaviors or beliefs of white supremacists due to the systemic racism that has been present in many western societies, and the struggle to protect their own cultural identity in such an environment. However, it is not the same as being a white supremacist, as it is not driven by a sense of supremacy or domination over other races. It's important to clarify these terms in order to understand the nuances of race relations and how to address issues of systemic racism.
