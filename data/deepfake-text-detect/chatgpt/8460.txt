You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the ability for people who are new members of this site not be misled by such statements into thinking they're clueless about Buddhism when all along their questions have been answered on here just yesterday (or whenever). I think one reason why we don't allow them might also involve how easyhard something seems etc.; maybe because answers can seem more easily invalidated if you start asking what-if? type hypotheticals than other types - but again these aren't really my areas so take with grain salt...
