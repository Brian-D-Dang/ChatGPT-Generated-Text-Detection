I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, they'll be awesome and all that but what about the fact you're causing so much pain on yourself for a child? The longer I live with this thought in mind then more guilty i feel at having not made any plans yet. Why are you assuming that birth cause is self-serving? It may well just be altruistic and she really likes babies.
