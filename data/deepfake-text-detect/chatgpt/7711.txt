A possible counter-argument is that the criticism of "nice guys" is valid because it stems from a common pattern of behavior in men who feel entitled to a woman's affection or attention simply because they are nice to her. This pattern can involve acts of manipulation, guilt-tripping, or even harassment, and it often reveals a lack of respect for boundaries and agency on the part of the "nice guy." Moreover, the label of "nice guy" itself can be problematic as it suggests that being kind or polite is not a basic expectation but a exceptional trait that deserves compensation. Criticizing this kind of behavior is not meant to discount the merits of being genuinely nice or considerate, but rather to call out the disingenuous and harmful behavior that is often disguised as niceness in pursuit of a romantic or sexual goal.
