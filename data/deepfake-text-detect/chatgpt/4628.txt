The host country thing has run its course. Organizing the Olympic games is financially ruinous, blatantly wasteful and the procedure favors corrupt regimes willing to put themselves on the map. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) may think it's an important organization but after this week's controversy in Athens, I don't know why anybody would want anything to do with them or their governing body for sport (I-AAS). It was pretty clear that drug cheats were going to be found at these Olympics so a hush fell over the whole event and people tried not to talk about doping until the final two days when there wasn't much left to say other than "well athletes are doped up like crazy." How else can you describe some track runner who trains by running through fields stacked with hay bales? Or how many boxers have been busted recently using blood transfusions to get bigger muscles? If someone doesn't dope then he isn't doing his job properly because any athlete worth a dime knows there is no way to win without drugs. There will be more stories coming out in the next few weeks as well once we get past all of the hype surrounding four gold medals - except they won't even be legitimate since the events went on without anyone knowing if the winner had declared himself clean or actually tested dirty. Instead we got just enough vague information to conclude nothing really happened. Yes, most people knew what was going to happen before the games started but nobody expected three members of Jamaica's relay team to keep getting disqualified. And afterward no one could figure out exactly what happened. What's worse is now everybody doubts everything that takes place during the Games despite the fact that 42 countries participated in those events meaning there should be plenty of evidence supporting every claim made. It didn't turn into a witch hunt; instead the accusations came from simple mistakes such as when American hurdler Kerri Walsh Jennings failed her urine test twice last month only to claim she took medicine prescribed by her doctor which caused a positive result. That wasn't possible because doctors aren't allowed to prescribe drugs unless informed otherwise while these tests measure levels of specific components that can either come directly from your own system or just from traces in the environment. So basically Walsh Jennings lied through her teeth and everyone bought into her story without bothering to check the facts. Now another 100 athletes including medal favorites Marion Jones or Tim Montgomery might also face criminal charges before the end of the year. What does this mean for future sports championships? Well, let me explain. All IAAF rules state that any person caught taking performance enhancing substances must lose all previous titles regardless of whether they competed under false pretenses or not. But considering the cost involved in organizing big sporting events, especially ones where millions upon millions of dollars go down the drain depending on how many seats sell, governments tend to protect their investment by punishing honest competitors rather than admitting openly that things need to change. In theory, true Olympians competing honestly shouldn't care too much though given that winning comes in being better than everyone else while cheating usually involves letting others beat you. Sure, some folks feel cheated if somebody gets something handed to him but in athletics it wouldn't make sense to stop a good runner simply because he couldn't read the lines correctly. On the contrary, the runners should enjoy seeing opponents race against each other while they attempt to take home the prize money. If someone becomes champion without breaking any rules then he deserves recognition plus monetary rewards for having proven he can compete fairly. Surely that means people cheat but how often do we hear reports coming from around the world claiming hundreds of thousands of players still accept bribes and kickbacks from professional gamblers hoping for financial gains. Don't expect sports officials to expose this kind of activity anytime soon as long as people continue screaming corruption loudly whenever someone wins or loses. Why pay attention to stories coming from international organizations right now? Perhaps the best advice is to look elsewhere to see how other nations handle issues concerning gaming laws and ethics. You know, places where men play cards and women gamble cash bets with friends. Oh yes, ladies ... and gentlemen! Since the night my girlfriend, Laura Hillenbrand woke me up in the middle of June thinking I needed to watch Saving Private Ryan again, I haven't seen Spielberg's film adaptation directed by Steven Soderbergh. My first reaction was surprise since I thought the director had moved away from war movies ever since directing Traffic back in 2000. Surprise turned to shock when the picture began shooting in July 2004 entitled Full Frontal because I realized how closely connected the real life experiences between Tom Hanks and Sam Worthington (with help from Matt Damon playing the role of Capt. MillerHicks) resemble original footage from Operation Market Garden. This apparently includes scenes filmed near the same location used to depict Holland that helped viewers understand what WW II looked like from within the perspective of the Army' options taken from bridge systems triggered this time machine trying to take control over an alien force pulled off a different redactor pulling the scene roundness
