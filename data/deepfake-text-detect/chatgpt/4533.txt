There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a certificate upon completion of learning, with or without examinations. Graduations are increasingly being used as light-hearted social events that allow parents to meet other families at their child's school I have decided not only to do one but two graduatons this year as I feel it would be good fun and maybe help raise funds for my daughter's first communion next year!
