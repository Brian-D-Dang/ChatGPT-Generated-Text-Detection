I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot someone? In my opinion there is only one reason for this to happen: If he's evil! It does not matter if you're in America and are black man (Mike Brown), or every where else on Earth. The cop who shot him was wrong!! And all other policemen should be fired immediately - it doesn't mean ALL of them are bad but we need better system so that they will at least try to do their job correctly.
