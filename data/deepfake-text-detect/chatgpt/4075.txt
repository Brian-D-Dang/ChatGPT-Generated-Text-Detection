Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view I hold. My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any or all of them if you want! What to expect: I predict that we will see a lot more people posting here than ever before. The biggest driver for this change has been the rise in the popularity of the Internet and social networking sites (which are growing at about 50 every year). These new technology companies have captured our attention through their aesthetic appeal cool logos and they've become intertwined with pop culture in ways that were unimaginable just a few short years ago. As such, it's pretty safe to say that the majority of these new users will be coming here from outside Reddit4chan etc. which means there'll be plenty of new people looking to join in the fun too:)
