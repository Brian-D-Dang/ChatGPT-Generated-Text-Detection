Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, do we not see this same approach other people take? When you are trying to understand something you may be looking for a lot of information and most people don't have time or inclination to spend hours and hours on reading through Wikipedia articles just to find out what they need to know and how to interpret the results of their search. This is why we can use people like Bill Gates to help us with our problems in business as well as technology and civilization as much as he does. He has a lot of ideas which can lead to insights which others might miss due to lack of time or attention. I think one of the main reasons why many people don't take advantage of Bill's ideas is because there isn't enough information available online regarding his ideas or products. If there was a way to make these things easier to read and understand (as most people have no problem doing), we would see far more of them being used instead of ignored.
