As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They are cheaper than you think. They keep your head safe in an accident. They are the law. They are stylish. They are safer. They help keep your head cool. They help you stay a tighter turn and are great for braking. They are fun. They make you more visible. They are really comfortable. They come in lots of different colors and styles. They are cool. You can be safe and stylish. There is one thing to think about, though, in that a lot of people, myself included, don't like the way a helmet feels on their head. When I first put on a helmet, I really didn't like it, it made my head feel so big. I also didn't like the way it felt when I put on a pair of sunglasses. It felt like my head was going to bust right out of it. I had a bike crash a few years ago and the guy driving the car said he didn't see me because I was wearing a helmet and I had sunglasses on. My vision was fine and I could see just fine, but my face was really hurting. I was also wearing a shirt with the word "cyclist" on it, so there was no way that anyone could miss me. I am a big fan of bike riding. It has changed my life for the better. I ride to work, I ride with friends, and I ride alone when I want to clear my head. Don't be one of those people who talks about how they won't wear a helmet because it's for wimps. You never know when you may need it. I've got a new helmet that is a lot more comfortable than the one I had last time and I wear sunglasses when I ride because they keep my eyes safe and when I crash, I want my eyes to be protected. So, go out and get a helmet and a pair of shades and get riding. Wear a helmet and have a great ride.

It was really a great ride. We rode for 32 miles, starting at the Science Museum in St. Paul. We rode down to Como Lake and back, down to the State Capitol and back, up and over the I-94 bridge and back to Como Lake. It was a great day to ride, not too hot and not too cold. This is me with a couple of the other riders at Como Lake. There were a lot of great rest stops with water, food, and good company. The Bicycle Association of Minnesota is a non-profit organization that promotes bicycling in Minnesota. They work hard to get people out on their bikes. I was happy to see a lot of kids riding. It's not as easy as it used to be for a kid to get out and ride a bike anymore, with all the safety concerns that parents have. The more kids that ride, the more people that ride and the safer the roads will become. So, if you get a chance to ride with the Bicycle Association of Minnesota, get out and ride.

Last Thursday, I got a chance to ride my bike to work. It was the first time I had ridden my bike to work since I got my new bike. I ride my bike to work about twice a year. It's just a little over 6 miles, but it's the biggest hill I have to ride. It's mostly flat riding, with a short hill at the end. The weather has been perfect for riding, not too hot and not too cold. My new bike is a road bike. It's very comfortable to ride. I got a chance to ride it with one of my coworkers. He couldn't believe that I didn't have any problems with the ride. The bike is
