I am a cynical man. I don't believe in heroes, and so I'm prepared to change my view on this. THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about Trump and the Republicans makes me more certain that he's evil incarnate, and every bit of news I hear about the Democrats makes me more certain that they're just the same but in a different way. The Dems are still in the business of exploiting the fears and hopes of the average person in the US, but Trump is in the business of exploiting the fears and hopes of the average person in the US. Same ends, different means. But I'm a cynical man, and I need to see some evidence of this. I can't take it on trust. I want to know about the Democrats' positions, and I want to know about the Republicans' positions. I'm going to assume that everyone is telling me the truth here, and the Democrats are saying what they think they should say, and the Republicans are saying what they think they should say. So I'm going to take each claim, and I'm going to look at it. If I find a flaw in the Democrats' position, or a flaw in the Republicans' position, I'm going to be able to tell you about it. What I'd like to know about the Democrats is whether they're going to repeal Obamacare or not. Because Trump is saying that they're going to repeal Obamacare, and the Democrats are saying that they're not, and I can't decide which of them is lying. Ask the question. What is the plan for Obamacare? What do the Democrats want to do? The Democrats want to expand Medicaid and keep Obamacare. And do the Republicans want to repeal Obamacare or not? Trump wants to repeal Obamacare. And so it turns out that both sides are lying. Trump is lying, and the Democrats are lying. That's not what the Democrats are saying. The Democrats are saying that they want to expand Medicaid and keep Obamacare. The Democrats are saying that they don't want to repeal Obamacare. What I'd like to know about the Republicans is whether they're going to keep Medicaid expansion or not. Because Trump is saying that they're going to keep Medicaid expansion, and the Democrats are saying that they're not, and I can't decide which of them is lying. Ask the question. What is the plan for Medicaid expansion? What do the Democrats want to do? The Democrats want to expand Medicaid. And do the Republicans want to keep Medicaid expansion or not? Trump wants to keep Medicaid expansion. And so it turns out that both sides are lying. Trump is lying, and the Democrats are lying. That's not what the Democrats are saying. The Democrats are saying that they want to expand Medicaid. The Democrats are saying that they want to keep Medicaid expansion. The Democrats are saying that they want to expand Medicaid. The Democrats are saying that they want to expand Medicaid and keep Obamacare. So I'm going to have to look at something else now. I want to know about the Democrats' positions, and I want to know about the Republicans' positions. I'm going to assume that everyone is telling me the truth here, and the Democrats are saying what they think they should say, and the Republicans are saying what they think they should say. What I'd like to know about the Democrats is whether they're going to raise taxes on the rich or not. Because Trump is saying that they're going to raise taxes on the rich, and the Democrats are saying that they're not, and I can't decide which of them is lying. Ask the question. What is the plan for taxes on the rich? What do the Democrats want to do? The Democrats want to raise taxes on the rich. And do the Republicans want to lower taxes on the rich or not? Trump wants to lower taxes on the rich. And so it turns out that both sides are lying. Trump is lying, and the Democrats are lying. That's not what the Democrats are saying. The Democrats are saying that they want to raise taxes on the rich. The Democrats are saying that they don't want to lower taxes on the rich.
