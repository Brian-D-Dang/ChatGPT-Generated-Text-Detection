Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between men. But they do not have that kind of potential because, while many people love communism little by little, if you compare this to the real thing, it's almost impossible for anyone to want a similar type of totalitarian state. Unfortunately, even those who love communism don't necessarily realize that as long as we live in an country governed by the CCP rules of oppression, violence and exploitation, mass murder, rape and torture will continue. It will be hard enough to make all of these countries that they rule look like unused waste lands, surrounded by government agents and police officers. Those same governments, with their open borders policies, have also continued to fulfill their own socialist goals such as solidifying their communist ideology (which has been made clear via propaganda videos). So far, China despite its policy of fiscal austerity and other Socialistic measures has passed on this track and just recently the Communist Party's latest re-election campaign carried out what seems a distant victory over the United States: The People Power Project. The ultimate goal of the PPP is to bring back socialism in the form of other peoples' wealth and power by providing them with social welfare programs, including social security benefits and health insurance, a program that provides significant economic protection through central bank loans. However, the project does not actually work; instead, it only leads to better living conditions. In fact, the process of putting these half-measures together takes several months, but one can understand why it took so long before China began using such draconian methods against the Chinese population. The PPP has seen criticism throughout the history of capitalism, which makes self-interest seem more important than genuine concern or reason. This lack of understanding about the true nature of human responsibilities and how society should operate is criminalizing the development of new ways to address the problems faced by poor and minority groups. Furthermore, capitalism itself only works when people share the responsibility for building up society. Instead of doing everything right, capitalism can only progress slowly and lead to more destructive, harmful effects to the masses. If the PPP really believes that by supporting higher education reform and eliminating slavery, then anyone who supports this experiment could see that we can finally start realizing the full impact of this experiment upon our societies, since we need universal healthcare, affordable housing and free school meals every day. We also need a real end to the Chinese way of dealing with "the poor" by offering them opportunities to earn money and improve livelihoods in order to develop a sense of belonging. Also, if the PPP wants to end slavery and provide workers with basic skills needed to meet life's necessities, that means keeping a healthy supply chain of goods available for consumption - something China can never achieve without the help of foreign labor. There was an incident of people going on hunger strike today regarding a lack of food at the Chinese market, which is causing widespread panic among immigrant women. It appeared that the president had no idea that immigrants were feeling helpless during the coronavirus pandemic. Yet he did the opposite, taking a side in favor of his own nation and guiding Americans into facing starvation, dying from disease, unemployment, and starvation. Even though most states have imposed curfews on businesses due to the COVID-19 crisis, the Hubei province has hosted thousands of people who went hungry last weekend. The declaration of a nationwide lockdown across China shows a level of desperation amongst the country's residents who desperately need urgent emergency services.
