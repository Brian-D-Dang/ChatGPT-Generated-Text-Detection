It is well known that the old testament refers to homosexuality as "an abomination." However, most christians do not believe in the applicability of Old Testament rules to the modern era. The idea that the Old Testament laws do not carry over into the modern era is supported by the teachings of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. Christians believe that Christ's teachings supersede the laws and regulations of the Old Testament. Therefore, while the Old Testament does condemn homosexuality, modern Christians generally do not believe that this is applicable to contemporary society. Instead, they believe in accepting and showing love and kindness towards everyone, regardless of sexual orientation.
