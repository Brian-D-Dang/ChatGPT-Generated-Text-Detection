I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several friends who take their dogs to the beach... I don't understand it at all! They just leave them on leashes (understandable) and then when they go back in the water they chase each other around like crazy.... so selfish! My uncle is lame as shit, he can't walk more than 10 feet without needing someone carrying him because of his "bad leg" but yet has two chihuahuas that need constant attention, food, walks etc.. For real though, what was wrong with a pug?
