A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government). Losing an election does not automatically disqualify them from serving in parliament, it depends on how much longer. The choice of candidate is up for debate but the party must decide whether it wants to be known that they intend to run again and if so why not great responsibility there should also be given to the party that ran the election campaign during whose time period which was the last one before the new government came into power after the election victory. Returning to this issue, the party leader also needs to establish that he will use his position as minister when elections are held later next year while the party leadership decides who will run against him two years later. The party ideology can lead to some privileges like allowing members to vote independent candidates without having to register with the party membership votes only once each year even though parties cannot wish to make claims such as having twice the number of MPs elected per annum by the parliamentary party caucus. If you count all those votes by themselves then it means that members vote independently making the party more powerful thereby strengthening the power structure in Parliament. This is called electoral fraud because voters know what happens at every election since ordinary members can no longer hold positions involving deciding who wins elections through a secret ballot process. But regardless of what political party holds office, party leaders need to set aside their personal ambitions over democracy and get rid of the illusionary preference system whereby they know exactly whom they represent in parliament casting votes. Again the party leader makes no distinction between himself versus another member or candidate. If MPs choose someone else, then there would be no difference between the two choices made by their own MP's. However, MPs may decide whom to support or oppose based solely upon practical considerations rather than ideological preferences resulting in uncertainty about what is best suited for them politically hence potential consequences including causing problems when elections come around. Whilst there exists no doubt that individuals running for higher offices do influence elections due to preferences being exercised among party members for nomination purposes, there is another factor which affects the outcome of these nominations: parties cannot nominate candidates independently unless they agree explicitly that they want to govern openly under certain circumstances setting ethics rules preventing them from doing otherwise. As stated earlier parties cannot nominate freely without prior agreement with the parliamentarians they elect so it becomes necessary for party members to declare publicly whether they prefer someone else or not when nominating policies. By choosing to remain anonymous the party leadership takes responsibility for the decisions taken by its members thus turning party politics into electoral law ensuring accountability itself. As articles 3 (1) (b) and 4 of the Constitution states; "a party shall not perform any acts inconsistent with its constitution." The constitution gives an opportunity for party representatives to choose candidates. Consequently party leaders must decide individually whether they want to accept election nominations for parliament instead of relying solely upon a consensus decision. Party members usually do not act unanimously nor do they form part of any party policy making committee so there emerges significant remaining differences amongst politicians once elected when voting results become public knowledge. Affirmative action is generally undertaken when there is already an understanding within a party between party members regarding issues affecting their interests, eg issues relating to abortion and gay rights etc. However if one chooses to stay silent when voting results emerge then party members lose access to important positions such as making decisions concerning organisational reforms, appointing members to committees etc., thus making it difficult for politicians to achieve reform goals effectively. Although party members tend toward neutrality towards campaigns, political parties sometimes turn the tables and join campaigns where they neither endorse nor reject their opponents actions. Parties often split in favour of groups opposing particular stances and may compromise line views merely owing to feel-good feelings associated with campaigning. Party members were accused of exercising discretion leaving policy makers vulnerable to criticism arising out of self interest. Party bosses may well take advantage of efforts by their constituents to avoid public scrutiny giving them immunity from possible liability. Party members today require clear direction from their people and confidence either through branch meetings or hand picked delegates for work sessions whenever needed. When party members meet their responsibilities they follow their own principles requiring them to say publicly who they stand for and what actions they might take depending upon electoral outcomes eventually influencing future polls whilst failing to heed party conventions governing election criteria. Party members therefore excel in achieving consistency across constituencies and are bound together by strict ethics rule provisions erected on them by all political parties legal guidelines referring to parties in general, members holding political posts etc.. Even though many party activists are obliged to observe conventions governing the conduct of party activities they still maintain ethical standards maintaining transparency and confidentiality enshrined in the electoral legislation that governs party affairs. Not surprisingly they do not tolerate politics in their private lives yet party leaders can choose to disregard convention laws restricting their dealings with individual members thereby jeopardising peace keeping values. And finally party captains may abuse their political roles leading to situations where the party becomes unruly when citizens notice wrongdoing. Such behaviour leads to loose morals and clearer lines defined upon party staff worrying especially in relation to matters relating to name such as political appointables such as personality limits.
