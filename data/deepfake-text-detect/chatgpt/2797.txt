Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and am willing to learn more about the differences between sexual assaultrape for each sexes. Well, it's still all about power dynamics right? Sure men sexually assualt women but how much does being a man impact your chance to do this vs if you were like an average woman or something like that.
