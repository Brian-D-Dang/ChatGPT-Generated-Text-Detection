While it is true that the suffering of farm animals is a concern, there are still many reasons why veganism may not be the most moral diet. For example, many crops are still farmed using methods that harm wildlife and destroy natural habitats. Additionally, some argue that the displacement of indigenous people and exploitation of migrant workers is also a moral issue with veganism. Finally, some people argue that it is more practical and sustainable to practice "humane" animal agriculture, which emphasizes animal welfare practices while still allowing for the consumption of animal products. Overall, while animal suffering should be a consideration in dietary choices, there are many other ethical factors to consider as well.
