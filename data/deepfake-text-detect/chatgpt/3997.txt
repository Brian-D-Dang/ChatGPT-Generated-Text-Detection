Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same. His views on immigration would not only alienate more voters than he already has in this country. The best thing about him is how easy it would be to get rid of him as President (if we can even remove him from office) and have our next president take his place after making sure that every last one of these people gets deported. The fact that you think the issue isn't about money speaks volumes for how shallow your ideology really is.
