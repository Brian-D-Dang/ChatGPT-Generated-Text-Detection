Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on with their day. I do this as well, but after I hear of a new execution of someone, no matter the race or the crime, I don't feel like I can move on with my day. I feel like I should do something. I feel like if I don't I am disrespecting those who were killed. I feel this way because I feel like this is the beginning of the end of the prison system in America. I feel like it is an idea that has been proven unsuccessful. I feel like a life sentence is much more of a punishment than death. I feel like many people feel like I do, but I feel that we have to do something about it. I feel like if we don't do something about it, we are just like the people that were killing slaves. They were disrespecting the lives of those that had been killed. I feel that the government needs to stop executing people, and move to life in prison with no parole. I feel that people who are put to death do not deserve to be executed. They are still humans, and they still deserve to live. I feel that if we could save even one life, it would be worth it. I feel that it would be worth it if we had to save many lives, because then it would show that the people in prison need to do more than just a death sentence. I feel that if we could save even one life, we would be one step closer to stopping the killing of people. I feel that the idea that the government has of killing people is wrong. It is a disgrace to the people who are being killed. I feel that it is a disgrace to the people who are killing them. I feel that the government should stop killing people, and start giving them life sentences. I feel that if the government were to stop killing people, and give them life sentences, they would get more respect for the people in prison. I feel that if the government were to give them life sentences, the people who were put to death would have the respect that they deserve. I feel that the government needs to give the people who are being put to death life sentences, or no sentences at all. I feel that it would be a better punishment than giving the death sentence. I feel that it is time for the government to realize that death sentences are not working. I feel that many people know that death sentences are not working, but no one is doing anything about it. I feel that we need to realize that the people who are being put to death do not deserve to be executed. They do not deserve to be killed. They should be given life sentences, or no sentences at all. Death Penalty should not be an option! Is the death penalty a deterrent to crime? Is the death penalty an effective deterrent to crime?
