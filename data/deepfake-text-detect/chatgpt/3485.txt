First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" has. Second, I know that just because someone identifies as a feminist doesn't mean they don't also support equality for all genders. In fact, many feminists explicitly state that feminism is about advocating for gender equity and dismantling patriarchal systems that harm both women and men. However, for those who prefer to use the term "egalitarian" over "feminist," it's important to remember that the term can be vague and doesn't necessarily acknowledge the specific challenges that women face in our society. It's important to be clear about one's values and beliefs when engaging in discussions about gender equality.
