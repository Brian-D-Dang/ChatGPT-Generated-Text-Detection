I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot someone with such an obvious weapon? If they were getting away I could understand why you might not think they are going to aim at your kids. But if it was on purpose then that's pretty disgusting and wrong (sorry for any off-topic comments).
