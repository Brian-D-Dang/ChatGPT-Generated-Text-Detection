Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one partner loses interest in sex or has a lower sex drive? It's not uncommon for couples to experience declines in sexual activity or desire after the initial honeymoon period. This could be due to a variety of factors including stress, hormonal changes, the demands of daily life, or just natural variations in libido. If one partner is experiencing a lower sex drive, it's important for both partners to communicate openly and honestly about their needs and desires. It's important to understand that having less sex does not necessarily mean that there is a problem in the relationship, but it is important to address any concerns and make efforts to find ways to connect and maintain intimacy. Some strategies for couples in this situation might include exploring new activities or interests together, finding ways to reduce stress and increase relaxation, or seeking support from a therapist or counselor. It's important to remember that every relationship is unique and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Ultimately, it takes effort, communication, and a willingness to work together to find ways to maintain intimacy and connection even when sexual desire may be fluctuating.
