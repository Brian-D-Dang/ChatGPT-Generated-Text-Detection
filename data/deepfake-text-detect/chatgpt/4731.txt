As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not the most cost-effective way for the state or even the family members to spend money. The pressure from parents and legislators are immense. It's really sad, but when you look at it objectively there is no good reason why children should be allowed to die from medical malpractice (a doctor negligently failing to provide adequate care), yet adults can still pursue legal recourse if they believe they were injured by someone else's negligence. If your kid dies, chances are your life will never fully get back to normal again. When I was in law school our professors would tell us about people who suffered horrific injuries as kids and their lives changed forever due to tragedies like this. They mentioned one young man who had been shot and then developed severe mental illness. He graduated with honors, went into politics, got married, became an attorney, etc...but he could barely function because his mind always thought he was being shot. Not everyone makes it out okay after such a tragedy. But some do. I am absolutely sure that 18 year old diagnosed with cancer doesn't think he has any chance of surviving. On the other hand, he may very well survive - even though it won't make things easy for him afterwards. People do live despite terrible traumas happening to them. And in cases where recovery does occur, it often takes years and decades before full health returns. The human body heals itself and sometimes healings take longer than we assume. To say simply "he died and now he isn't here anymore" seems so cold to me. There is more complexity behind what happens and usually humans aren't designed to know everything without having experienced trauma ourselves. Knowing all these facts certainly help understand why people choose such drastic actions as suicide or murder - it hurts too much to go through the remaining days of ones life knowing nothing can change the fact that something horrible happened to you. Most of my friends didn't expect Robyn to survive her surgery. My friend Chris put up 10k towards Robyn's health fund since she wasn't expected to last long enough to collect anything. That shows awesome character! He's still expecting to hear from a lawyer next week, while others give up hope right away. Even the doctors don't seem confident that Robyn will wake up in a few hours. So many emotions going on at once. I agree with the article writer that patients need to always consider themselves under examination when entering hospitals. Every second counts in hospital and every mistake can lead to death. As a patient, starting off saying please and thank you is the first step. Saying sorry if you're wrong also goes along way. Be aware of conversations between nursesdoctors at times and ask questions if you are unsure. Ask the nursesdoctors how your baby is doing and keep asking until you find out whether they want to share information or just leave you alone. Always speak up if you feel uncomfortable around others. Talk to directors, managers, upper management and senior nursing staff. You might find out some useful info and save lives. This applies especially if you suspect that child abuse is taking place. Children that survived abusive situations are treated differently and are looked after better. Wherever possible avoid sending your child (ren) home early from birth centers unless advised to do otherwise. Do NOT send your child (ren) home when they are sick, regardless of how small their sickness is. Speak to your pediatrician, midwife, obstetricians, neonatologists and family physicians about arranging urgent appointments or even emergency surgeries immediately after delivery. ALWAYS remember that services provided by public healthcare providers is free, however, private health insurance plans typically cover pre-natal costs only. Public funding covers postpartal expenses such as labor delivery, newborn resuscitation training, breastfeeding support program, infant feeding clinic, immunization visits and childhood health checkups. Private funded family planning programs include contraceptives and cervical screening clinics. A mother deserves more time during which she is surrounded by love and gets to bond with her new born. All babies deserve access to quality childcare including daycare, schools and playgroups so mothers can work outside housework, become gainfully employed, stay healthy and meet social needs. These innovative programs improve maternal literacy rates raising future generations for Australia. Since you mentioned the issue of bullying specifically, I wanted to mention a television show called Bullseye. Its about a group of teens whose bully ends murdering them. One guy describes how his bully decided exactly what type of knife to buy (to kill himself). Another boy tells how when bullies killed another person's dog, he tried to talk to them and asked politely to stop making fun of his little sister. His comment? She couldn't defend herself against them anyway.
