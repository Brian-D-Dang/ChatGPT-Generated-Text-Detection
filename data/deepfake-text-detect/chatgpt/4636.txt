I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have livedcurrently live there, I could not be more dead set against the idea. Having visited recently, it is quite clear why New Yorkers don't like Yankees fans: they are rude, obnoxious, loudmouths with no class at all. The local bars that cater specifically to tourists seem full of them, as well as the non-touristy places where locals hang out (here). They come from everywhere, mainly Canada or Europe (?) and act like "New York" doesn't even exist until you tell them about it no subtlety here, just straight up New Yorker bashing. The most annoying thing was a group of four being seated nearby us on our first visit. When we asked for water, one guy immediately started complaining about how he couldn't see anything because his friend had taken over his seat. Then two other guys came over and took their seats too! It's completely ridiculous. Even when we finally got seats under an umbrella near some good music, a couple people would ask if anyone wanted to go dancing across the street. Of course no one did. This place is INSANE. On my last visit I went into a bar called Quest which is essentially located inside a 1970s gas station...and would've been fine except every table has its own jukebox outside so everyone can hear everything else playing. If this were anyplace remotely classy, you'd assume they'd put speakers in the ceiling somewhere. Instead, everyone talks loudly to each other while blaring hipster rock bands through the speaker system. After having seen what happens during playoff games and reading about what goes down at Red SoxYankees events, this seems pretty tame compared to that; nothing says "we're civilized folks!" like blasting a crowd favorite by Bob Seger on repeat while your friends scream along. So maybe Yankee Stadium isn't THAT bad off but the experience is absolutely insane. But hey, that might change once the renovations actually get underway sometime soon. Still looking for a job. Trying to find something a little less physically demanding than waiting tables in order to stay sane. Haven't heard a lot back from Adecco yet since all my applications must now be sent via email instead of snail mail. They didn't send me any notifications either. Just figured I'd post another update. Hopefully things will pick up soon. ) Froze again today. My roommate said I'm lucky I wasn't awake earlier, though considering the weather conditions this week, she may have meant that sarcastically...but still, yay for cold sleepers. Always nice when someone takes care of you. Will host Thanksgiving next weekend instead of going home. Also haven't decided whether I'll bring meat or vegetarian sides. We won't know until later tonight if our dishwasher works properly. Maybe I should cut myself some slack? I just spent nine hours taking apart a machine that apparently began malfunctioning days before we moved in. Anyway, sorry I sounded flippant regarding the freeze issue. Hope everyone stays warm. Well, as expected, my refrigerator broke during move day. It appeared wrong only minutes after connecting electricity. Every time I think I'm done cleaning this crap up, I discover new problems. Besides this seemingly obvious error at remote distance, the fridge is also leaking air causing moisture build up. And getting rid of this mess requires removing and disassembling the freezer compartment. Fun fun fun! Guess I need to take this opportunity to fix the rest of the house before I leave town on Friday. This morning was a bit hectic trying to figure out exactly what needed replacing and where I should buy replacements. Overall, the repairman from Crown Appliance seemed competent enough although ignorant occasionally. He never told me that condensation buildup in the evaporator coil caused such severe damage! Apparently, water entering the coils causes corrosion inside the metal plates forming the refrigeration cycle. Bummer, huh? At least I got a free estimate from him, 330 including parts and labor. Luckily the seller I bought the house from knew a few things and referred me to a plumber in his area named Dan Lewis whom coincidentally lives right around the corner. He gave me a quote for 250 tax which is obviously way cheaper than what Crown quoted. In fact, much lower than what I initially expected. That's probably due to the fact that this particular model has been discontinued and replaced with newer models, making these repairs far easier to do than those in the past. For example, there aren't heat exchangers anymore, simply a large fan blowing directly onto the coils preventing ice formation on top of the tubing and allowing movement throughout the entire unit. Far simpler! Plus, the fan runs quieter overall. Anyway, I called Crown Appliance later that afternoon to inquire about the low offer and was informed that Crown cannot give refunds for cabinets purchased online in Tennessee unless faulty workmanship occurs.
