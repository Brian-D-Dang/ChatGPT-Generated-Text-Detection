I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. Right? All these comments are like this woman is obviously really fucking ugly and this guy has no character... OR maybe they're just wrong in their interpretation of what an attractive person looks like.
