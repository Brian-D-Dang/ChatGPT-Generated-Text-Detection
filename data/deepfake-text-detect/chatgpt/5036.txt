I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually poor, and many of those students are immigrants or immigrants themselves so they feel like they can't afford it because children get less education than adults do at public schools. Not everyone sees a reason for private schooling as illegal, because in addition to being able bodied people with no money, many parents cannot seem willing to pay their bills on time just because having open doors has been outlawed by Chinese lawmakers in China. The Chinese government seems to think that if you don't come out clean enough then it's ok:)
