I'm very confused and bothered by the amount of ads for prescription medications that run on television and in magazines. In my mind, the reason that these medications can only be prescribed by a doctor is because they require proper diagnosis and medical supervision. It is also concerning that these advertisements often list numerous potential side effects and risks. It is important to remember that these medications should only be taken under the guidance of a healthcare professional who has assessed the individual's specific medical situation and considered all alternatives. It is best to talk to your doctor if you have questions or concerns about any medication.
