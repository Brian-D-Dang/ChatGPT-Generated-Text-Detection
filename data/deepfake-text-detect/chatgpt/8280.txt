This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use to which it's put or who ownsleases if has that status (i..e, owner-occupied vs rental). The only problem with this would occur when a person purchased an expensive home for himself and then let his kids live in said house rent free because they are young adults living at school...etc etc.... Then he can receive some indirect benefit from their presence since less equity will have been paid out relative too its purchase price than had such children never lived there nor contributed toward making payments towards principal reduction while having no income level greater compared other renters using up any savings accounts available due as well increasing future obligations owed even more generationally deepened by additional debt accrued over time just like parents do everyone else but them.....But still surely after 50 years you'd get bored enough about those same boomerangs running around your neck anyway so why worry? And yet we're talking crazy here aren't WE!?!??? WOW!!! Better focus now ons getting back into shape Jeez!!
