First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. She has a violin case and is playing something like "Birbili Birbilim" by Sona Jobarteh. A lot of people were listening (including myself). The lady walks over to where you are siting next to her and starts talking. She asks if you can hear properly because it's so loud? You say that you can. The old lady then says she thinks there should be some kind of regulation on how much noise we make with our music players. At this point many things come to mind: - It doesn't matter what type of device we use; it could be a Bluetooth speaker or headphones etc.... - Music always plays at full volume, but why would someone want to listen to music loudly enough for everyone else around them to also hear their music too? Do they think they're going to get better reception? If anything using such devices will reduce your reception quality! - Why do they have this need to play classical music to prove that they know about music? What does that mean? That means nothing! They obviously don't care about other peoples' taste in music. - Have these senior citizens not noticed yet that most young people aren't interested in classical music anymore?! Do older generations even understand that digital technology today makes it possible to change whatever it is we desire without having to worry about breaking ruleslaws? Yet the government still tries to regulate everything... My point is that no one wants the elderly peopled to monitor internet usage, restrict mobile phone usage, ban smartphones etc. But if society decides as a whole to collectively decide against certain acts or behaviours than that should apply to everybody regardless of age. So perhaps it's time for us to start thinking instead of being offended every single day when somebody calls us youngsters names! We shouldn't allow ourselves to keep being bullied into acting according to others perceptions of who we are. Who knows maybe someday we'll stop behaving the way that society expects us to act. Maybe the only thing holding us back from completely changing societal behaviour is perception itself? What do you guys think?
