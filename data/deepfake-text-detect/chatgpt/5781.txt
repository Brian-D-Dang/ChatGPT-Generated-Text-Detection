This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in the upcoming Fantastic Four film] , and the current [Ronin series from Marvel] . In both cases, the protagonists are white, but the antagonists are Asian. The Asian characters are traditionally depicted as evil andor incompetent. Now, on the other hand, one can point out that the new Fantastic Four has a black woman as the team leader, and the new Iron Man has a black man as the team leader. I'd like to start a conversation about this topic, in an attempt to come to a consensus and understanding that will allow us to better include Asians in our media, so that we can break down racist and stereotypical imagery. I'll start by noting that Asians are not a monolith. Different ethnic groups in Asia vary widely in their customs and beliefs. I will also try to avoid generalizations about a region that I do not know well. I'm a westerner, so I'm not the best person to be writing about this, but I want to have a discussion and I have something to add. I'm white, and I've been told that I'm very lucky to be living in a society where I've never faced racism and don't see discrimination all around me. I've also been told that I don't have a clue what racism is about. I'm sorry for the sarcasm, but I think we should stop pretending that it's so easy to be a minority in our society, and I'm not going to do that. I believe that it is important for us to recognize that white people in the US have had a pretty easy ride for centuries, and we are not the best people to speak about racism. We need to recognize that our society has a history of racism, and we need to recognize that the fact that we've never experienced it personally does not mean that it hasn't happened to other people. I'm going to present some facts that I've heard recently, which I think are very relevant. The majority of Asians in the US are descended from immigrants from Asia. This is a very small percentage of the total population of Asians in the US, and it excludes Asians from the Philippines, Guam, and other places in the Pacific. The majority of these immigrants were Chinese, who arrived at the end of the 19th century. They faced discrimination, and the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed in 1882. Another large group of immigrants were Japanese, who were also discriminated against. This is not a small amount of time ago, and it's actually not that long ago. This happened during World War II, when many Japanese-Americans were relocated to internment camps, where they were held against their will for several years. Asian Americans are often the victims of stereotyping and racism. They are often portrayed as incompetent andor evil. When Asians do appear in the media, they are often portrayed as submissive, which is a stereotype. There are some good examples of Asians in the media that don't use this stereotype, but these are relatively rare. Asians are often portrayed as a monolith, which is a common mistake. The reality is that there are many different ethnic groups and languages in Asia, and these groups are not all the same. Asians are generally not portrayed as the main protagonists in the media. When they are, they tend to be portrayed as submissive. The media generally portrays white people as the main protagonists. There are exceptions, of course, but the ratio of white protagonists to non-white protagonists is quite large. This is the case even in a fantasy series like The Legend of the Five Rings, where the main cast is mostly Asian. In the recent Fantastic Four movie, the antagonist is a Chinese man. This is the latest version of this character. In this movie, the protagonist is a Chinese woman. The headline that I linked to previously said that this movie "pays tribute to the original white team." This is a problem, and I think it's a mistake
