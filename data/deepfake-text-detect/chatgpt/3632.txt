When the german leaders were put on trial after WWII, They claimed they were just following orders but it was decided that this was not good enough. Hitler could have been stopped if enough people had stood up to him and refused to follow his immoral and inhumane orders. The Nuremberg Trials established the principle that individuals are responsible for their own actions, even if those actions were carried out under orders from superiors. This principle reflects the idea that every person has a moral conscience and is able to make independent decisions about what is right and wrong. It also emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility in ensuring justice and human rights.
