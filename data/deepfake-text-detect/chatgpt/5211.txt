This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding. For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force me to pay for social media channels which has resulted in us losing sight of our needs, especially music entertainment costs being included free during the holidays when we can't leave home without watching national TV shows on weekends instead paying extra fees after staying at home alone because we're both too busy catching up on Netflix. When the minutes before Christmas arrived, my wife asked me what was wrong with the cable system so we decided it had nothing to do with our cable bills. We give them credit every month as they've always done this - even though we don't watch any television show on Saturdays since our kids were born six months ago! The problem isn't the need to rely solely on those services but rather how much money we spend each year simply by not subscribing online (and if you want to use your broadband connection on Sundays). Since I'm constantly using my broadband service via my mobile phone while my wife watches the same show over Skype calls and Instagram videos, I think we should be able to put off these services until Christmas season starts again soon enough. I wouldn't mind paying more than 10month to have it all covered! I know what you mean about families switching from one subscription to another due to phone bill expenses - which we live through thanks to cable connections, laptops etc., so a cheaper alternative would definitely help. You might notice that many people who subscribe to Netflix receive weekly old episodes of TV shows as a birthday gift during their holidays shopping trips? That's why they get Prime Video as it offers shows like The Crown, Doctor Who, BBC One series, Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes Mysteries, Sherlock and so forth straight away. If you are looking more toward watching TV content then Prime Online could be worth considering. It will cost less per episode compared to Cablecutters and you'll enjoy all new series available right now including Breaking Bad Season 7: Breaking Bad Episode 1-5 plus many others. Do you find yourself spending too much time watching YouTube videos lately? If you already own Netflix but struggle to keep up with what else there is out there you can download Sky Movies to stream movies directly onto your favorite laptop or tablet device. Of course, you may feel guilty buying a huge bundle 4050 every week when there aren't many 720p streaming options out there anymore but you won't see a price drop anytime soon anyway. While we appreciate seeing new films coming back around during the holidays we still love watching old classics on demand the most. Netflix is launching a new seasons' selection collection next month called 'United States Greatest Hits', featuring classic classics like American Pie starring George Clooney, Stranger Things, Friends With Benefits and more. You can also choose between ten different shows starting January 15th 2020 depending on whether you prefer the original Australian sitcom 'Hotel Transylvania 3', 'Detroit Rising', 'Homeland', 'American Horror Story', 'Mission Impossible', 'Who Do You Think You Are'? or 'Debbie Downer'. Netflix isn't cheap either; overall costs nearly double the usual prices paid once you add in extras like unlimited storage space and upload speed behind the scenes access rights. At the end of December Netflix averaged 25m video views per month (174) but expect prices to spike substantially higher going forward particularly given how popular HBO Max is becoming internationally.
