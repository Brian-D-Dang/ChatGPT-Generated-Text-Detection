Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better. If that is so, what is the point in reading fiction? I don't want to waste time doing anything else; I only want to do one thing, and it has nothing to do with enjoyment or spiritual fulfillment." The author was frustrated by the lack of an audience for his work when he wrote this book, but then again people have not been too enthusiastic about science-fiction literature generally since John Wray's sci-fi history was published 41 years ago (that's a show of hands: Would you read a good sci-fi novel today?). He does make some astute observations on the relationship between religion and the West and their ability to disseminate ideas - but we'll save that discussion for another day.
