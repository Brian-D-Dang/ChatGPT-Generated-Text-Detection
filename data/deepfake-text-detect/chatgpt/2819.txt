I like Bernie, love his politics in fact. I doubt there is a politician I agree more with. I like the fact that, unlike most politicians, his rhetoric matches his actions and he doesn't sugar coat things to make it sound better than what its actually, or worse, lie about it and say something completely contrary of what hes saying now. He's one of those guys who believes what he says without question though.. It's just not as obvious because he backs up everything
