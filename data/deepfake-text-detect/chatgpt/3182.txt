After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read a lot of books in both genres, and while I can understand your perspective, I think it has a lot to do with personal preferences. Nonfiction books are fantastic resources for learning new things and expanding your knowledge, but fiction has its own unique value. It allows us to escape reality, explore the depths of human emotion and experience, and see the world through the eyes of different characters. Reading fiction can be a great way to relax, unwind, and reduce stress. It can also boost empathy and understanding of others. Additionally, many fictional books provide poignant commentary on social and political issues, making them a valuable tool for critical thinking and reflection. Of course, you may find greater satisfaction in reading nonfiction, and that's perfectly fine. But I encourage you to keep an open mind and explore fiction in a new light. You may be surprised at what you discover.
