Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that the type of people with poor crisis management aren't at risk for killing themselves; by "legitimacy" I'm talking about how valid ating it is. You need someone who's been through a difficult time in life and their lived experience makes them vulnerable? Doesn't work like that though because they are not really real deaths worth dying for...saying that you're not human beings just adds nothing to your conversation other than forcing emotional distance from yourself (because you know what happens when you disregard yourself).
