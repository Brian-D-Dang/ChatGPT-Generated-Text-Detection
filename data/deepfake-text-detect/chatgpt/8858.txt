Theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying doesn't do that. Economic efficiency average happiness: violating the individual rights to be unharmed and vulnerable, not just making sure they are protected from criminal prosecution. Fraud (or terror): of course if you fail to gain access to the financial system you will face some sort of liability or shame. If you succeed in stealing a credit card details, even while being unaware your bank has an account open for you, you could end up with significant fines, imprisonment and even prison time. Fraud is crime committed by those who have no business running without it. The law protects this type of fraud but I don't think anyone would ever get caught especially when their actions were in a very small amount of money on the line. But self harm and loss of life occur through mis-reinforcement instead of due diligence. Name stealers: In the words of "the educational elite," we're all thieves. How many times did you hear someone say the same thing during high school? Of course people are going to missell you, and try to sell you off as a victim. If you steal anything from someone else, you probably owe them something, either financially or otherwise, so why should you pay damages for bringing down someone else's family or working out a compromise where both parties agree to come forward? And how much does that cost someone who has lost his job and can't find work after losing it? None... but still, there is always somebody waiting for you. Even those who cannot afford a lawyer can easily apply for one now.
