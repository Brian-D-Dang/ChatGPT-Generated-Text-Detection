On a hair dryer: "Do not use in a shower." If somebody's dumb enough to use a hair dryer in the shower, they're not going to pay much attention to it. We also have a lot of information about how to keep your hair dry and look like you are wearing a balaclava so that you don't need to change out your clothes every few minutes. We can help you identify your shampoo way by smelling your scalp when you're washing your hands afterwards - so if you're experiencing mild dryness or blowout, this is probably not the greatest idea for you. Use water to rinse through your hair (it'll break down faster than just using an air freshener). If you do this frequently, you will find yourself changing out all your outfits during a day, which will drain away all your moisture. After a period of time, you'll be able to wash with as little water as possible. So, what exactly does hair dryers do? It depends on what kind of hair you want to style over time. You could spend hours drying off your hair, but if you go straight from making a mess to replacing long pieces of hair with new ones, try styling them into different styles. If you've been using your shower for a week straight, you might think that there's no point investing in new dryers just because you want to make sure your hair remains clean. But if youre constantly trying to keep your hair soft for 10 days straight without shedding any trace of moisture, it's likely that there's something wrong with your hair. That's why we recommend you use a low-pressure dryer to keep your hair hydrated, while you continue.
