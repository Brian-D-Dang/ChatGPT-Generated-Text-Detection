We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None. I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you 're well versed in something, do it instead; but rather I want to talk about specialization: The more specialized you are at one thing or another, the less likely you'll be able to understand other things as deeply. If your only skill is programming, for example (or just coding), then you will lack experience with things ranging from system administration to web design. You have no idea what's going on behind the scenes because you don't know how the pieces fit together. On top of this, unless you get really good at everything else, you won't make much money doing generalist work anyway. It may seem like an easier decision when you think "I could make 150hr working as a programmer," but after taxes and business expenses you should realistically expect to never make over 60k for any real time period - even higher-paying specialties such as finance still pay poorly relative to their supply demand. This doesn't mean we should avoid specializing! There are many situations where specialization can (and does) work out very nicely. Just keep these things in mind...
