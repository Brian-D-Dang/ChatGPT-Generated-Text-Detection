I'm Korean-American and I have family in Korea. I disagree with many of those I encounter who usually tend to also be of Korean descent when I don't get all worked up about a Japanese politician's comment or some other trivial issue. I don't agree with the Japanese government about the comfort women issue. I'm not Japanese and I don't support this issue from the Korean side. I know that the Koreans and Chinese have a different view on Japanese actions in the past. I'm not going to get into what I think about that issue because that's not the point. But I do think that it's a little ironic that many Koreans and some Chinese are so worked up about it. I can understand that it's a sensitive issue but I also think it's a bit unfair that they expect Japanese to understand their view. I think it's wrong that the government of Japan is not open to discussion about this issue. I think it's wrong that the government of Japan is not willing to openly discuss the issue of comfort women. I think it's wrong that the government of Japan does not allow its people to think about the comfort women issue, even though many Japanese people have already thought about it. I do, however, think that it's hypocritical to expect Japanese people to be all understanding about the issue when Korean and Chinese people are not willing to be understanding about this issue. I think that, even though I'm not Japanese and I don't support the position of the government of Japan, the Japanese government has every right to be open to discussion about this issue. And I think that many Korean and Chinese people who feel that the comfort women issue is an unresolved issue should at least be willing to be understanding about the Japanese side of the issue. I think that many Koreans and Chinese people who feel that the comfort women issue is an unresolved issue should at least be willing to be understanding about the Japanese side of the issue. I've seen some of the Chinese posts here and you are correct. They are always quite nasty and never acknowledge the fact that Japan is not the only nation in the world that has had wars in the past and is not the only nation in the world to have been an aggressor. Sorry, if that is not what you wanted to hear. That is a fairly well known fact and I think it is only natural for Japanese to get worked up about that issue. I don't think so. I think that it is the Chinese and Koreans who have to accept that their nations have done wrong in the past. If they are so worked up about the issue, they should be willing to look at the past and accept the fact that they have done wrong too. Of course, I am not advocating any sort of reconciliation between Japan and Korea or Japan and China or Japan and Taiwan or any other nation that has a beef with Japan. But I don't think that the Japanese government should be expected to put up with the sort of treatment that Japanese people get from Koreans and Chinese. If I was Japanese I would be upset about that too. You are right. If you ask the Japanese people, they will say that they know about the history of the Japanese government's atrocities in the past. But many Koreans and Chinese people don't seem to realize that there were also atrocities committed by Koreans and Chinese and by the United States and other Western powers. You said "I think that it's wrong that the government of Japan is not open to discussion about this issue. I think it's wrong that the government of Japan is not willing to openly discuss the issue of comfort women." In my view, it is the Japanese government that is not willing to discuss this issue. I don't think that the Korean government should force the Japanese government to discuss this issue, but if the Korean government wants to discuss this issue, I think that it has the right to do so. I think that it's not right for the Japanese government to refuse to even consider discussing this issue. I think that the Japanese government should be willing to discuss this issue. I think that the Japanese government should be willing to discuss this issue. I think that the Japanese government should be willing to discuss this issue. I am not trying to make this a discussion about whether the Japanese government should or should not be willing to discuss the comfort women issue. That's why I said "In my view." I think that the Japanese government should be willing to discuss this issue. The Japanese government is not willing to discuss this issue. I think that the Japanese government should be willing to discuss this issue. My opinion is that I don't think that the Japanese government should be able to just refuse to discuss this issue. I think
