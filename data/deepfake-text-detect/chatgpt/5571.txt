Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself a raise, but I can't. Also, the Supreme Court is supposed to be above politics. This is a clear conflict of interest. No matter how you cut it, any politician who supports this is unfit to serve in public office. While I think the idea of taxation for voting is a nice idea, I agree that we should probably get rid of the constitutional amendment that says the federal government should maintain a post office. I also agree that the idea of a religious holiday for elections seems ridiculous. I think if you had to pay taxes and vote, you would have to be able to prove you were a citizen. I'm not sure how you would do that without a birth certificate, which has been a hot button issue lately. Not a fan of this plan.

I think it's a good idea. More than one day a week off for people. We work too many hours and weekends for no payoff. If you want the taxes to be paid to vote then you should be able to vote. I don't care for the idea of taxing people for voting but I think it's a better idea to have them work to be able to vote.

There would have to be a birth certificate requirement. I think it would be a good idea if the cost to vote was in the ballot (increased taxes or something), and the revenue could go to the election board. The cost to vote should be more than the cost of a postage stamp. If you want to vote, you should pay for it. If you want to complain about something, you should pay to complain about it. If you want to do something, you should pay to do it. It is a good idea, as long as the cost to vote is not more than the cost to post a letter. I know that sounds mean, but I think it should cost a little more than the cost of a stamp to have your vote count. For 400 years, taxpayers paid for the privilege of voting. It's time to put a stop to that. All I want is for taxpayers to pay for their votes. I don't want to pay taxes to vote, though.

I would also like to see campaign finance reform, along with lower campaign contributions from corporations and unions, and a ban on lobbying by members of Congress for at least five years after they leave office. I think it's a fine idea. I could also see a scenario where the tax increase is spent on additional voting days, allowing people who work during the week an additional chance to vote. It is a good idea. They are just trying to find a way to get people to vote that don't want to. I could also see a scenario where the tax increase is spent on additional voting days, I could also see a scenario where the tax increase is spent on additional voting days, allowing people who work during the week an additional chance to vote. I think this is a great idea. Too many people don't vote because they are too busy. A lot of people will be glad to have an extra day to vote. I'm all for this.
