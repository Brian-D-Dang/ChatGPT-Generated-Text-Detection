I was first exposed to the universe by watching season 1 and 2 of the show. I really liked them and purchased the A Song of Ice and Fire books as well. Though I do still haven't read any of the other books yet (except for season 3, since it's not been released). That's what I figured too, but I'm curious if you didn't like the show at all in general? It's a pretty good show imo, even though I didn't enjoy anything about it.
