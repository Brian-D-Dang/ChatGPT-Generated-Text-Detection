To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For The United States is currently a diverse country, and I do not know where we are going to go as a country. However, my politics and religion have been used to define us, and I have been vilified in the media. Despite the fact that I am not going to be the first to admit this. I have never believed that most people despise homosexuality as a lifestyle. I am open to allowing homosexual marriage. If you believe incest is wrong, and gay marriage is wrong, then incest is also wrong. This means that the same arguments I use against gay marriage apply to incest marriage. I would argue that a grab for power and control that some people use to justify hateful acts violate our right to free speech and association. We are allowed to have incest marriage because it is one of the greatest acts of love I have ever seen. Incestuous marriage is an act of selflessness. I prefer to think of it as a sacrifice for love.
