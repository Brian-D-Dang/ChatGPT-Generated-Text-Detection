I believe that a private business should be able to deny service to anyone for any reason. For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, or have sex with minors by denying them entry, then they could do so and there would (in my opinion) not be anything wrong with it other than the fact that they shouldn't get government subsidies. That being said, I also think that businesses can discriminate against certain groups of people based on their religious beliefs in order to enrich themselves. This is especially evident when you look at how many Muslims are open about their religion; whereas those who identify as Christian tend to keep their religions more secret from others due to fear of persecution. In addition, Christians seem very willing to lie about their religious affiliation while Muslim immigrants are vocal about theirs. The only real difference between these two groups is that one group tends to view rejection from society much harsher and less permissible than the other. In short: No group has free reign over their own bodies and actions like Christianity does today because of its powerful influence on our laws and norms regarding sexuality. We thus see a continual push towards greater acceptance among some marginalized members of groups such as homosexuals, women, and blacks, but a constant resistance from others toward this change. It seems clear to me that Christianity will continue to dominate American norms until we come up with new ways of thinking beyond what Jesus taught us 2,000 years ago.
