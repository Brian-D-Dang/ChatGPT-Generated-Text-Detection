I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was shocked to learn that the real Alan Turing's computer-breaking idea wasn't really an invention at all; rather he had developed this brilliant way of breaking codes by using statistical frequency analysis on both groups in order for him his team mates - most notably Edward Travis who is credited with inventing 'the bombe' machine which breaks Enigma code messages based upon their patternsfrequency within conventional letters - Darrin Bell Sat Mar 23 2014:05 EDT
