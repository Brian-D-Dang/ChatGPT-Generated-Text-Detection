While it's true that we often recognize traits in others that we dislike about ourselves, it's important to recognize that not all negative traits we see in others are necessarily present in ourselves. Furthermore, we may dislike certain behaviors or attitudes in others simply because they conflict with our personal values or beliefs. So, it's not always the case that the traits we despise in others are a direct reflection of our own self-hatred.
