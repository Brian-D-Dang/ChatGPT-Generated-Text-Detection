I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that it's horrible and shouldn't happen. What I see much less often is people saying, "This is terrible, but what can we do to prevent this from happening?" or "This is terrible, but what can we do to prevent this from happening to people we care about?" This is a piece that I wrote for the last issue of The Silver Chips, and I'm reposting it here with a slightly different conclusion. Sexual assault has been in the news a lot recently. In the last week, we've seen the sexual assault allegations in the Rolling Stone article on the University of Virginia, and the lawsuit against Ohio State over the alleged cover up of rape allegations. And these are only two of the stories. In all these cases, the focus has been on the alleged perpetrators of the crimes, as it should be. People like Brock Turner, who sexually assaulted an unconscious woman, or the three men who gang raped a woman in Steubenville, Ohio, have hurt a lot of people. I have no sympathy for them. But in the wake of these cases, there are a lot of people who are angry. People are angry at the alleged perpetrators of these crimes. They are angry at the institutions that were charged with helping their victims. And they're angry at the people who were apathetic. That's understandable. But while all of this anger is justified, it's not useful. Anger will not convict rapists. Anger will not hold universities accountable. And anger will not support rape victims. Instead, we need to work together to create a culture that doesn't allow people to get away with raping other people. We need to create a culture where we care about each other, where we listen to each other, and where we don't let each other down. And if we do that, we can create a culture where rape isn't an option. When something like this happens, it's easy to get angry. It's easy to focus on the alleged perpetrators. But as we saw with the Steubenville case, we can't just focus on the perpetrators. We need to focus on the entire system that enabled the alleged perpetrators and the people who stood by and didn't say anything. It's important to focus on the institutions that were charged with protecting these people. They were charged with protecting the victims and investigating the alleged perpetrators, but they failed to do their jobs. That's unacceptable. We need to hold these institutions accountable, and we need to make sure that it never happens again. But we also need to focus on the people who stood by and didn't say anything. We need to focus on the people who could have stopped these crimes, but didn't. We need to focus on the people who saw a friend being raped, and didn't do anything about it. Why did they do nothing? Was it because they didn't think that it was important? Were they afraid of the consequences? Or were they afraid of getting involved, because they didn't know if they could do something about it? Were they afraid of being labeled as a "rape apologist"? Were they afraid of what people would think of them? Were they afraid of hurting their friends' feelings? In most cases, these people didn't do anything because they didn't know how to help. In many of these cases, the people who could have done something didn't know that they could help. They didn't know that they could help by calling the police, or by being a support system for the victim. If we want to prevent this from happening, we need to focus on how we can create a culture that supports people who are being raped, instead of blaming victims. And we need to focus on how we can create a culture where people aren't afraid to get involved when they see a friend being raped. There are a lot of ways to create that kind of a culture. For example, many universities have rape crisis centers, and they do a lot of great work to support survivors of rape. But many people don't know where these rape crisis centers are, and they don't know what they do. If every university told students where their rape crisis center was, and what they do, that would help. If every university told students what to do if they saw a friend being
