Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as a former military man for the European Union I can understand that there are some advantages in having such an alliance, especially as our continent is plagued by nazismcommunism. So what do you think? Could such a pact between Europe and Asia help reduce global tension? Would it be most beneficial or would we see potential downsides to it? Should everyone relax on this one? Is it really worth discussing when Mr Trump might leave office? Maybe it's time to start planning the future of our world from somewhere else than America... [Edited at 2018-04-26 09:34 AM PDT]
