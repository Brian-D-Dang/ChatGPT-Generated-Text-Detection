To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting to the point where these will apply (graduating from college), and thus have not been directly impacted by them in any way yet, they do seem like something worth looking at for America's schools as it seems we are lagging behind many other countries when it comes to education quality. For one thing, I think if there was more pressure put upon our educational system here then perhaps things would improve over time. Maybe parents could start demanding better teaching methods with their children instead of just telling kids "do your homework or no TVvideo games tonight!" If teachers were given higher salaries maybe people who truly want to teach can make enough money to get into the profession without having another job on top of this too? Perhaps our country needs stronger unions so that workers will be valued highly, driven toward excellence rather than simply being squeezed out of work every day until retirement age because companies don't value hard-working employees anymore...
