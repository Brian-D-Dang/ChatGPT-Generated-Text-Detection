I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most ly a personal preference and may vary depending on the individual's experience with makeup application. Some people may find it quick and easy to apply, while others may take longer due to skill level or desired outcome. 2) It can be expensive. High-end makeup brands can be costly, and building a makeup collection can be financially burdensome for some individuals. 3) Makeup can be harmful to the skin. Certain ingredients in makeup products can irritate or damage the skin, causing breakouts or other issues. 4) It perpetuates societal beauty standards. The use of makeup can create a pressure to conform to societal beauty standards, making individuals feel like they have to look a certain way to be accepted. 5) Makeup can be time-consuming to remove. Taking off makeup at the end of the day can be a process, and failing to do so properly can lead to skin irritation or breakouts. On the other hand, some people enjoy using makeup as a form of self-expression and creativity. It can also boost confidence and make people feel good about themselves. Ultimately, the decision to wear makeup or not is up to the individual and their personal preferences and values.
