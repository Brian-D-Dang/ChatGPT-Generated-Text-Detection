Bernie Sanders offers a categorically different approach than others, making him such a direct threat to the status quo that there is no way corporate America will allow him to get anywhere near the Oval Office. It's important to remember that Americans are not great at looking beyond their own noses when it comes to voting in elections and electing politicians who represent them. This election year has shown us just how easily we can be fooled into believing our leaders care about those of us who don't have much money or influence over national politics. We've seen it time and again with candidates for president like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: they say all kinds of nice things during primaries but once elected change drastically as soon as the cameras go off.
