Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just be giving delts back at the end of my reply's comment chain. At least it's not negative points for those who agree with what you say rather than downvoting because they disagree (like there are people that do)
