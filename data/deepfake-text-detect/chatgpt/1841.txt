This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this one seems a bit too "backwards" for me I think you're the first person here who isn't being led around by their emotions and feels that way. It's not exactly surprising since emotion is your most powerful sense (at least it was back when we had no better options).
