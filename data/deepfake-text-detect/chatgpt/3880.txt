As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They 're ugly - A helmet is required for motor vehicle drivers in most states. It's expensive - Most helmets cost 80-200 dollars and cannot be used on children under 5 years old. Their design doesn't work the way it was designed - There has been some debate over how best to protect our brains from concussions or head injuries. Some say that they should be worn by everyone regardless of their height due to the risk of concussion and how much force the brain receives through impacts. Others believe that we don't need another reminder about safety. They don't help me stop faster than other people - If you have ever tried to keep up with your fellow cyclists who are also using helmets, this will probably come as no surprise. Many times when I am riding my bike alone, I try to hang onto the pedals like there is no tomorrow before I get passed. As a result, I spin out of control. It's more dangerous for me so why shouldn't I wear a helmet? The answer is simple: You do if you want to ride fast enough!
