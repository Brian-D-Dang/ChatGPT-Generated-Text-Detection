Bernie Sanders offers a categorically different approach than others, making him such a direct threat to the status quo that there is no way corporate America will allow him to win. By Robert Scheer More and more people are becoming aware of the stark fact that Donald Trump's success in winning the GOP presidential nomination proves how out-of touch with reality he has been - and is still being - with regard to race relations in this country. The problem for Trump is that many millions have also become acutely aware of the fact that Hillary Clinton is an equally dangerous candidate who knows even less about racial justice or any other issue affecting working Americans than does her Republican rival. Indeed, as Bernie Sanders demonstrates daily, she is far from a progressive champion when it comes to social programs like Medicare expansion; instead she wants to cut Social Security benefits by 700 billion over 10 years in order to use the money saved for military purposes, which would be destructive of human rights around the world. As I point out elsewhere, made possible only because vast government intervention into our economy makes necessary certain tradeoffs, we can now say with certainty what FDR meant all those decades ago when he said "nothing so much needs reforming as first principles themselves." This means that although Trump has appealed primarily to fear rather than inspiration, his greatest danger lies in the fact that he represents nothing except raw hatred of anyone darker than white AngloSaxon Protestant males (the group Sanders calls racists). And today's politics is dominated overwhelmingly by big business and its ability through television advertising to mold public opinion. Thus, despite the continued struggles of blacks and Latinos among whites and Asians respectively, as well as men and women generally regarding income inequality, most voters continue to believe that their economic situation is improving; surveys show that they see little need for major changes in taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals. It is not surprising then that polls demonstrate that these same voters give considerable weight to jobs, security, national defense and controlling immigration while giving relatively little consideration to issues related to civil liberties, environmental protection, health care reform or equal opportunity. Of course one of Trump's chief campaign slogans was 'Make America Great Again!,' but few voters seem willing to contemplate how that could possibly happen without reversing the massive increase in black wealth resulting from the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and continuing since then. Yet here again, most voters aren't listening to candidates who talk about capitalism versus socialism as if either were viable models. While nearly everyone accepts racism as a gigantic evil that must be eliminated, very few view it as anything approaching the defining political force in U.S. society all too often referred to as "white supremacy" because of certainly socioeconomic reasons and probably some psychological ones as well, along with violence against many minorities, including blacks and Mexican immigrants. While Trump threatened to build a wall between Mexico and the United States (a stance that further shows the restlessness within sections of the ruling class), at least half of the American population is ambivalent concerning illegal aliens. They want them gone someday soon, but basically they figure why should taxpayers subsidize illegals? Many studies suggest moreover that illegal migrants contribute substantially to tax revenues earned because they pay sales taxes and property taxes that make up part of state budgets. What seems unlikely ever to go away is the suspicion held widely among conservatives that Muslims pose an existential threat to national survival due to religious fanaticism, radical Islam and international terror attacks. But immigrant communities throughout the nation appear quite comfortable with English speakers. Moreover, many Muslims support Israel whose secular character removes their claim to special treatment in any case. Finally, regarding refugees fleeing constant war in places like Syria, where the Assad regime is responsible for hundreds of thousands killed civilians, most citizens oppose accepting Syrians because almost all hope eventually to return home once adequate conditions exist there just as Italians and Greeks did after World War II following Mussolini's destruction of Italy during his Fascist rule. So let us therefore examine two crucial aspects of the current campaign: 1) Can Sanders actually defeat Trump given the enormous resources available to his opponent who includes Wall Street bankers, multinational oil companies, billionaires and both Republicans and Democrats alike? 2) Does Sanders represent the type of change required to confront the challenges facing us, especially poverty and injustice? In answer to question number one, yes! Here's my reasoning: Although Sanders appeals strongly to young people and liberals, perhaps 500 million middleclass voters remain undecided regardless of age, gender or occupation. However attractive selling points he may offerincluding free college tuition for underprivileged children, universal healthcare, job creation legislation, ending fracking, revoking the Trans Pacific Partnership deal negotiated last year, reinstating Glass Steagall and prosecuting large banks caught defrauding customers, etc.Sanders proposes major structural reforms needed to ensure peace, prosperity and equality for future generations. These include financial transactions taxed fairly to make sure finance becomes politically accountable to Main Streets across the land rather than the stock market trading floor. He suggests replacing the remaining trillions wasted each week on unnecessary weapons used to defend the whole theory'd be- gothy old school system. No doubt, though ultimately shillings realigning the entire market place
