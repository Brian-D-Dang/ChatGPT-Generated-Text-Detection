Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. Let's cut the cynicism for a second and just look down at this situation objectively: The Democrats have control of Congress, they're the ones who bear responsibility for everything that happens next; why aren't they throwing their weight around? Why isn't someone stopping whatever Trump tries to do by executive order or some other means? Somehow it seems like there are only 2 parties these days, single issue voters and everyone else - how much longer can we keep repeating this mantra over and over again before people start noticing?
