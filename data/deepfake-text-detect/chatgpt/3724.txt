I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the right and wrong thing to do in any given situation. While it's true that there can be cultural and individual differences in moral values and beliefs, the basic principles of morality are universally accepted. For example, most people believe that it's morally wrong to kill, steal, or harm others without a justifiable reason. These principles are not subjective, but rather based on the fundamental value of human life and well-being. However, there are some gray areas where moral judgments can be subjective, such as in cases where there is a clash between different moral principles or when there is a lack of consensus about what constitutes moral behavior. In these cases, people may have different opinions on what is right or wrong, but this doesn't necessarily mean that morality itself is subjective. Overall, it's important to recognize that morality is complex, and while there are objective principles that guide it, there is also room for debate and discussion about specific moral issues.
