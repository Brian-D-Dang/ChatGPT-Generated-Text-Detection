To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental differences between us which have been scientifically proven over time. Those who disagree with this are either ignorant of science or just plain sexist! The whole idea behind the Equality Act in Britain, as well as similar laws around the world (the recent US law being perhaps most famous), is to make sure everyone has access to sex-based rights, be it when engaging in sexual activity, accessing healthcare, getting a job or even purchasing property. It's important because if you treat different groups differently based on gender and race then people will continue to get discriminated against under any form of discrimination law currently used. Because while this may sound like "tokenism" - preferring minorities for minority rights rather than actually acknowledging their equality alongside those already recognised by common law - it isn't at all tokenistic as it means that no group can be excluded from protection of existing anti-discrimination legislation. They should also ensure that the law doesn't discriminate within itself, i.e. LGBT and disabled people shouldn't face special treatment. So what does the scientific evidence show? Well, here we go: Equality in Gender Attitudes and Behaviour A lot of research has explored stereotypes about gender roles, attitudes towards them and how they affect our behaviour both positively and negatively. So far, studies across many countries such as America, Italy, Finland, Australia, Norway and Turkey tend to find that gender roles strongly influence relationships, careers and income (as so much of the burden falls onto womens' shoulders). For example, parents usually prioritise children and less work once they reach adulthood than men. Women still often take care of home duties after marriage whereas men move out into paid employment. Womens' interests tend to revolve more around family and leisure than men, whilst males spend significantly more hours working each week than females. In addition, girls outperform boys academically but receive a poorer education. Men earn more money and gain higher status and greater social power as result. The wage gap widens further between ethnicities based on ethnicity and sexuality. While heterosexuality might seem like an obvious case study (and indeed it is) UK lesbians and gay men experience some of these same issues although their situation seems to improve slightly in terms of gender performance relative to other lesbiangay populations (i.e. Western Europe - see below). Other areas where disparity occur include health benefits, childlessness rates and domestic violence. Girls generally perform worse overall than boys attending school, regardless of their socioeconomics, experiences and cultural backgrounds. This difference increases throughout secondary schooling. The academic achievements of black students drop off sharply compared to white peers, and Hispanic female students suffer the worst results. Secondary schools segregate according to socioeconomic background which can lead to inequitable outcomes, especially when combined with racism. Boys always manage to escape the negative effects of poverty upon achievement, something shown again in other disadvantaged communities. This effect is highlighted when comparing the sexes across racial lines, e.g. African American males achieve better educational opportunities than Black females; however, Asian male adolescents fare poorly due to the emphasis placed on reading skills during school hours. There appears to be little difference between whites and blacks until high school graduates the age of 18 years old where a marked increase in scholastic attainment occurs amongst the latter. However, despite good grades and curriculum planning, African Americans remain substantially underrepresented in four year universities worldwide. Persistent inequalities exist, in particular regarding levels of class mobility and degree completion, which imposes huge disadvantages on minority individuals. Good mental health rates were found among British Pakistani adults, though problems were recorded in relation to depression and anxiety as well as self-reported feelings of loneliness and isolation. Studies exploring comparisons between Muslim women in England and Pakistan suggest respectability concerns, low confidence and societal pressure can impact adversely on Pakistani Muslim women. Fertility rates are lower in Japan than almost anywhere else in Asia. Despite this, Japanese men marry younger and engage in polygamous marriages at later ages than elsewhere. These factors appear to interact with poor state support for single mothers and pressure from husbands to limit birth spacing. Female illegitimacy was recently reported to differ considerably between rural China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Young Chinese mothers overwhelmingly decide whether or not to give birth before marriage. High rates of abortion are prevalent among unmarried teenage girls who delay childbirth and obtain abortions rather than continuing unwanted pregnancies. Many young couples in Chongqing undergo sex selection to control fertility without intending conception themselves. Rates of induced miscarriages are increasing globally, particularly in third trimester pregnancies. Induced terminations are highest outside North America and America perinatal mortality remains above the global average. Abortion rates increased dramatically following the implementation of Roe v Wade in 1973. A sharp rise in infant deaths occurred shortly thereafter, suggesting communication breakdowns existed between pregnant women and medical professionals, resulting in inadequate transitions between pregnancy and delivery.
