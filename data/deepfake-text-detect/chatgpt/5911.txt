I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. IMO it is absolutely true. As someone who is married, I can say that women are attracted to men who are confident in themselves and their sexuality. The flip side of that is that guys who are constantly chasing after girls are seen as creepy and desperate. Someone who is willing to step up and take what they want is attractive. You don't see men constantly apologizing for liking a certain girl or having a crush on her. Even if you don't want to sleep with a girl, if you're not interested in dating her, you should still be confident and not worry about what others think. Exactly. It's not like the world revolves around you or that you have a right to be a leech on another human being. No one is entitled to another's time and emotional energy. I agree. If you're not interested, don't pursue it. No one is forcing you to be attracted to someone. I am not "chasing" anyone. I just don't feel comfortable telling someone "No" to something, and I want them to know that. I do agree that this is the way to be. I am really just talking about a subset of the population. I wouldn't want to be treated like that. Sounds like it would be difficult for you to be in a relationship. I'm just talking about the subset of people who don't even want to be in a relationship. I'm not sure why that would be difficult. I'm sure the subset of people who don't want to be in a relationship would find it difficult, because most people do want to be in one. No one is forcing me into a relationship. I am just saying I would want to tell someone the truth if I like them. It's just that I'm talking about a subset of the population, and I don't know if it's normal for them. I'm not sure if I would want to be with someone like that. I know that it's not a good way to go about finding someone to date. I'm not sure what you mean by that. People in relationships want to be in a relationship. People who don't want to be in a relationship don't want to be in a relationship. It's not just about telling the truth. If someone has a crush on you, you can tell them you're not interested, without having to tell them why. You don't need to use a "slut" card to do so. It's the same as not wanting to be in a relationship. I'm not sure what the alternative is. People in relationships want to be in a relationship. I don't want to be in a relationship. People who don't want to be in a relationship don't want to be in a relationship. I have told someone that. I have had a crush on someone. Yes, but that is not something I want to be in. That is not the same as not wanting to be in a relationship. I am not sure what you mean by that either. I'm not sure why that would be difficult.
