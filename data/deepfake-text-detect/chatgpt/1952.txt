Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my friends have been trying to convert me back into being an omnivore because they claim that eating meat is healthy for you and prevents heart disease (to name just one thing). They know little or nothing else about the subject besides this fact which seems like it's always true in their minds regardless of evidence against them. It really bothers me how some people will believe any lie told by someone who has authority over them as long as it helps make them feel goodsmarter- even if those lies are harmful and untrue! Is there anything anyone could say to help these close minded folk see reason? I would be more sympathetic with your position were it not on all levels so wrongheaded. You didn't choose "be" a vegitarian; you changed your diet at some point - presumably after considering why you did before making such a choice. If you want others to change theirs then perhaps it might be better placed within yourself first rather than attempting to force it upon other people under threat from moral superiority complex wielded through self-righteousness masquerading as concern: Also, morality isn't binary, therefore no question remains whether we should eat animals vs plants...veganism does away with using animal products altogether thus ending exploitation once and for all without having to rely on dishonest claims made solely based around feelings regarding empathy towards nonhumans. Henceforth, instead of focusing only on justifying something you already decided was morally right when asked pointedly despite knowing the contrary facts presented here consider doing a small bit of research into the current science surrounding wholefood plantbased diets, specifically looking up info published since 2010 where significant additional studies exist both providing further support for previously acknowledged links between health nutrition such as decreased risk of cardiovascular disease while also showing substantial benefits found due to consumption of dietary omega 3 fats for instance. Oh yeah, another set of studies showed red meats increase blood pressure compared to white fish or poultry etc..oh wait...so much conflicting information out there nowadays; makes ya wonder doesn't it?: So, keep doing what thou wilt shall be the whole of thy law Matthew 22 v 19 Yours Sincerely, One Who Has Done Their Research On The Subject Before Forming An Opinion Based Accordingly
