While BuzzFeed is known for its playful and often sensational content, it's unfair to dismiss their entire news organization as terrible. In fact, BuzzFeed has broken some major news stories in recent years and has often been on the forefront of important and relevant coverage. Additionally, BuzzFeed has a significant reach and has successfully engaged younger readers in news and politics, which is crucial in a time where getting people interested in journalism is a challenge. While they may not fit into the traditional model of journalism, they still have established journalists on their team who are committed to the truth and covering important stories. So, to say that BuzzFeed hurts the field of journalism is an overgeneralization and unfair characterization of their contributions to the media landscape.
