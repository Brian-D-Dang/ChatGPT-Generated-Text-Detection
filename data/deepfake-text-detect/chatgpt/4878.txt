Fairly simple premise. I'm 35 years old. I remember the Cold War. The first Gulf War. The Iraq War. War in Afghanistan, etc... I hear talk all the time about what's going to happen next. And we know that just a few months from now there are gonna be elections here and elsewhere in America for President of our country. But this is bigger than politics or even war. This is life itself we're talking about. It's how you handle your own end-of-life decisions. You may not have thought much about it before because all those other things were so pressing on top of one another. Now they are gone! How will YOU get through Death? This should give us pause. Most people don't think of death until it comes up close and personal; once it does, most people react with shock, horror, fear - but many don't really know where to begin when faced with such an uncomfortable question: What do I want done when my time arrives? Some can look at their lives and say "I lived well" others can admit that they've been less kind towards their fellow manwoman during their lifetime. Either way, no matter who you are, NO ONE deserves to die like some anonymous animal tossed into a garbage bag without being treated any better than he was while alive (no pun intended). Think about these questions as you consider them to be pondered by your loved ones after your passing. If you answer honestly, then you might make their grief easier to bear. True, even if you do nothing extraordinary to try and ensure the best possible outcome for yourself, two words hold true: Don't Die. If asked why, someone would tell me that its called "Death anxiety." A lot depends on what causes your Anxiety since we live under the influence of laws that govern more than thoughts and feelings. Psychiatry has classified every aspect of human behavior so that doctors could record each of them systematically. For example, Depression is described as "Anhedonia," (a lack of pleasure) whereas Dysthymia describes a state of constant pain over a long period of time. Dementias are generally divided into six categories based upon symptoms: Alzheimer's Disease, Lewy Body Disease, Frontotemporal Degeneration, Vascular Lesion, Pick's Disease and Parkinsonism. Each category has specific features that distinguish them. These facts cannot be dismissed lightly. Over half of US citizens are diagnosed with Mental Illness. That number rises dramatically among older persons whose onset typically occurs between 40 and 60 years of age. To label everyone Mentally ill regardless of cause seems unfair. So the only cure anyone considers valid is prevention. Prevention begins earlier rather than later. In today's world we need new ways to prevent mental illness as well as physical disease. We must encourage our young people to develop habits of healthy living that include proper nutrition, exercise, adequate sleep, good stress management, avoidance of toxins, exercise, positive social interaction, spiritual awareness and behavioral control. Young folks simply don't seem to understand the consequences their actions affect beyond themselves. They often carry out unhealthy lifestyles thinking they'll somehow avoid the problems festering inside them as they grow older. It doesn't work. No amount of exercise or dietary discipline makes up for many choices made early in life. Too bad the American media isn't addressing depression as something that needs to be addressed as aggressively as heart attack, stroke, diabetes, cancer, auto accidents, violence....instead of just acting surprised whenever an emotionally distraught person lashes out and kills himherself. Perhaps they feel that suicides aren't worthy of serious consideration unless they target prominent individuals. Sometimes Suicide is a cry for help that goes unanswered because society tends to ignore those asking for assistance. Deaths by suicide account for 20 of homicides involving guns. Only 5 of deaths in general involve gun homicide according to FBI statistics. Since we tend toward mass incarceration these days, we are forced to deal with crime at the level of individual criminals instead of community health issues affecting the entire family. Guns are used frequently to commit murder as well. As stated above, nearly 25 of all homicides involved use of weapons. While handguns are responsible for almost 90 of murders using firearms, rifles and shotguns are used at least five times more frequently. Statistics show overall rates of violent crime have fluctuated largely due to societal factors. Violent crimes committed by juveniles dropped sharply following implementation of juvenile justice reforms beginning in 1994. More information regarding the Justice System can be found here. Simply put, we'd all benefit greatly by having fewer opportunities to participate in criminal activities. Why punish someone else for offenses committed against herhimself? Let's keep solutions available to address real threats of harm to self and others. Violence begets violence. There are always exceptions. When dealing with a mentally ill person, one goal is making sure that hisher delusions don't negatively impact others around them. Often the illness leads them down a path to believe falsely that they're doing someone great injury when it's actually coming from within. Another common instance involves drugs. Can anyone find evidence to prove otherwise. Usually premature B) Social Clubdumdentionsal tongegand, all orderags Rangein aboutile a St
