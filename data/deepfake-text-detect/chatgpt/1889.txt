White girls very rarely date Asian men. Even in Asia white men are much more popular than Asian men. Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white women, he'll be extremely grateful to meet any woman at all since there aren't many single asian guys around anymore due to the lack of interracial dating within his race. That's not really true is it? I've heard that most young people like each other and don't care about racial differences so what happened here with this girl makes no sense unless she was jealous or something
