EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one reason why we don't see creatures with large feet like horses, giraffes or elephants is because they're not really needed for them (they can get around just fine without the big ones), so even though their legs are adapted from smaller ancestors (and therefore small) it doesn't mean that everything else about those structures would have hadhave any need adapting too... It's interesting how many people seem convinced by this thread despite me never actually saying anything remotely close suggesting there was no selective pressure on our anatomy! The point being made again - what makes you confident something could function as well if its parts were tweaked? Why couldn;'T some species evolve better eyesight using normal sized eyeballs rather than giant versions since evolution has already given us good enough vision now... Arens humans particularly visually impaired compared ot chimps etc.? And yet over time natural selection hasnnt led towards such changes happening??? How come?! So unless all these things work together perfectly i wouldn expect only minor adaptations normally occurring gradually via mutations natural processes which make sense based upon other factors affecting survival reproduction within populations during evolutionary change....
