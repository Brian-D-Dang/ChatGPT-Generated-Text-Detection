Hello, I'm Luke and for the longest time a small dream of mine has been to move to a Scandinavian country such as Norway, Sweden, or Denmark. From what I've heard the standard of living is good, the job market is strong, and the people are amazingly friendly. I've only ever been to Denmark and that was years ago, so I don't have much experience with the country. My question is: What are some of the pros and cons of living in Denmark? Are the job markets in Norway, Sweden, or Denmark significantly different? Is there a lot of discrimination against foreigners? Are there any difficulties in the job market that would be specific to people from certain countries? Any general information about living in Denmark would be appreciated. While I'm sure some people will answer your questions, I think it's better to ask this question on our sister site where you'll get the answers from people who have actually worked in Scandinavia, and from people who have worked in the Danish job market specifically. Your question is too broad and there is no single answer for it. Please do some research on the internet to get some answers. - Pekka Nov 12 '15 at 19:19 Pekka Not entirely true. Some people get the same questions over and over again, and have decided to answer them on SE. - David K Nov 12 '15 at 20:06 "Discrimination" is not necessarily an answer to the question. - Andrew Grimm Nov 13 '15 at 6:53 "Is there a lot of discrimination against foreigners" is not the same as "Are the job markets in Norway, Sweden, or Denmark significantly different?" - Kevin Workman Nov 13 '15 at 15:09 Even though I've answered this before, it's not the same question, and I think I can add more. - David K Nov 13 '15 at 15:57 In regards to your question: Is there a lot of discrimination against foreigners? and Are there any difficulties in the job market that would be specific to people from certain countries? I would say no, the answer to both questions is no. I've never heard of anything like that, and most foreigners are hired into their jobs from abroad without any problems. Discrimination is a big issue in many countries, and Denmark is not one of them. In fact, Denmark is one of the most egalitarian and democratic countries in the world. The job market is generally pretty good. In Copenhagen, for instance, the unemployment rate is 7, compared to 6.8 nationwide. The unemployment rate in the USA is 5.8, while the European average is 10.5. There are some exceptions to this, however. For instance, the job market for IT jobs in Copenhagen is extremely competitive. There are a lot of high-tech companies in the city, and the Danish government is also making big investments in IT, so there are a lot of jobs available. However, there are a lot of applicants for each job, so it can be difficult to get into the market. I haven't heard of any difficulties for foreigners applying for jobs specifically. The Danish government is very supportive of foreigners and immigration, so I would be surprised if there were any. The Danish work ethic is well-known, but it's not very different from the work ethic in most countries. Most people will work hard. I'm not sure what to say about the job market in Norway, Sweden, or Germany. I don't know about their job markets very well. I would say that Norway and Sweden would probably be somewhat similar to Denmark in that regard. Denmark and Norway are both part of Scandinavia, and there are a lot of similarities between the two countries. I'm not sure about Germany. I don't know much about their economy, but Germany is a large and prosperous country, so I would imagine that their job market is strong. Are the job markets in Norway, Sweden, or Denmark significantly different? They're not significantly different, but they are somewhat different. All three countries are rich and prosperous, but their economies are quite different. Norway and Sweden are both oil-producing countries. Denmark doesn't produce much oil, and hasn't really had much of a history of oil production
