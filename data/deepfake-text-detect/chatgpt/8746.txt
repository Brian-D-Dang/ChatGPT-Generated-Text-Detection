From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on issues like affirmative action and gun control while the second is more centered on social justice issues such as immigration reform or gun equality. The Clinton-era policies of affirmative action and gun control were intended to promote a "lack of African Americans in America," specifically, for blacks, but also for whites. Since 1975, small business owners, ranchers, farmers, college students, and individuals with mental illness have been affected by the policies, particularly those who started out in school, working their way up through the system, and then ran away from it when they realized how bad the conditions were. Some businesses that were forced out of business by this policy went bankrupt - and some even went bankrupt themselves. And there was plenty of excellent evidence that these policies were effective at discouraging black entrepreneurs from coming to the States because of the economic hardships many Blacks faced during this time. Many successful African American entrepreneurs did not make money but managed to raise their incomes thanks to these policies. In part due to this success, the Black Chamber of Commerce had a role to play. They helped to create an experience and attitudes the country could look forward to in the future. Their contributions also contributed to the country's violent history: According to the NAACP statistics, the last 10 years saw record levels of violence in African American communities. These include eight police shootings between 1995 and 1997; nine massacres of unarmed civilians; four drug murders; seven robberies; five white murders; and three homicides per 100,000 people. The Clinton-era policies of white supremacy and racism were designed to suppress minorities' voices that would otherwise be heard by the majority of the population. This allowed for companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), FedEx (FDX) and others to get away with the hiring practices of both liberals and conservatives, and even some of these corporations were able to recruit and retain large numbers of minority workers. But after Clinton began her presidency, many things changed: the number of immigrants caught in the crossfire of the deportation process increased; the lack of qualified applicants for immigration programs has turned so much of the country's immigrant community from being their primary source of support into a place where only white men can work. That's why most business leaders understand that they need to start investing in minority relations rather than just building one. The current Democratic administration needs to do something about its racial bias. Many Democrats came to the States to vote for Obama following his victory. Among them the former governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, is an ardent supporter of President Obama's agenda. He believes in the birthright citizenship amendment that will allow all U.S. citizens born before January 20th to become citizen. As he explained this position in a recent interview with NPR: "I think it is fair that Obama has given millions of young people that hope to come here legally, and I don't want to encourage exploitation of children here. You know? I think that if the whole issue is brought back to the forefront of our discussion, we should try to ensure that people see my proposal as being acceptable to them also. We're looking at ways to ensure that people feel comfortable going overseas and getting a job. If you believe that you can bring your own life here to live here and get the benefits that are offered, you'll definitely want to consider joining us." The reality is that nearly half of this generation is born outside of the United States, and the United States boasts over 30 million U.S. citizens. While some foreign labor leaders still refer to themselves as "America First" in the face of hatred among the White House crowd, some others admit that "they're afraid to speak out against this guy." If they felt that Obama was sufficiently radicalized to cause fear among the American public and that his voting record contained racist rhetoric, they might consider doing the same thing. If they feel that Obama wasn't enough radicalized to drive down the GOP's voter turnout, they might instead take him seriously. After all, the Republican Party hasn't made any substantial gains in the general election since 2000, and the political establishment suffered significant losses. It may help that Obama is a far more experienced politician. At least 35 of voters for him voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2008 presidential election, while 37 said they'd vote for Donald Trump. Biden and Hillary Clinton thus don't seem well equipped to deal with the challenges facing both candidates in terms of policy and politics. While Barack Obama won 9 electoral votes in 2008, Hillary Clinton lost 11 electoral votes in 2012, but Obama improved his performance with a strong showing in the polls.
