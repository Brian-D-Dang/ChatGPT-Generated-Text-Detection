First Let me just say I am 16 and don't have much experience with how it is in the'adult world'. But I don't think a 100 platonic relationship can exist between two teenagers. Anyway, I am a girl, and my crush on this girl is really strong. My crush on her is mutual, but she doesn't like me, and she doesn't even have a boyfriend. She is a 15 year old girl. I am a 16 year old girl, and I know I am too young for this kind of relationship. I am way too young to date, and she is way too young for me. My feelings are just so strong that it hurts. I really don't know what to do about it. I know I need to let her go, but I don't want to. I want to be her boyfriend, and I don't want to be with anyone else. I don't know if this will ever work out.
