A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a .22 rifle when the accident happened, as she fired off five rounds from her father's unloaded firearm. The woman who suffered this tragedy is now suing her parents over negligence in having an unregistered weapon that could fire without warning. This sounds like common sense to me but I'm not sure what it will cost my state or how likely such cases are going to be pursued by civil litigants against negligent gunowners. Does anyone else know anything about these types of actionsinsurance coverage issues?
