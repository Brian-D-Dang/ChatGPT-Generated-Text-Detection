I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically, the chance of anything happening are still quite slim. Also, it's kind of difficult to get renewable energy to replace all our electricity needs, and we'd probably have to shut down a lot of the nuclear power plants to make it happen anyway. But I have concerns about the disposal of nuclear waste, which is a huge issue, and an issue that won't go away until it's dealt with. Currently, the disposal of nuclear waste is a huge problem. And to make matters worse, it's really difficult to come up with a long-term solution. The current solutions for nuclear waste disposal are to store it in temporary storage facilities, or to encase the waste in glass to make it impermeable, and then store it underground, where it can't leak. The temporary storage facilities are a bad idea for several reasons. The first is that the waste can leak into the environment over time, and secondly, that the waste could end up being stored in a location that isn't as stable as it's supposed to be. With glass encasement, you could have a similar problem. The problem is that eventually the glass could break, allowing the waste to leak into the environment. I'm not sure what the solution is. It might be possible to build underground facilities that are so stable that they can survive just about any event. This would be the most reliable solution. The most likely solution is to build a facility that can survive a lot of extreme events. You don't need it to survive everything, just everything that's likely to happen. You build a facility that can survive a hurricane, an earthquake, etc. This is not an easy task. The best thing to do would be to try to find a site where the geology is so stable that it will survive anything. You could then build an underground facility and store the nuclear waste there. But it would have to be pretty safe. The other option would be to find a site that's not so stable. You could then build an underground facility, but then you would have to reinforce it so that it's stable. This would be a lot of work, and it's not likely to be cheaper than the first option. And then there's the chance that the facility will be destroyed during a nuclear war. But that's a whole other issue. So this is a tough problem. I think that we need to come up with a long-term solution for nuclear waste disposal, but it's going to be tough. And it's going to be a long term problem that won't go away until we come up with a solution. Here are a few videos about nuclear waste disposal: Labels: Energy, Nuclear Waste, Radioactive Waste Solar Powered Drones I recently came across an article on the BBC about a solar powered drone. The drone was developed by researchers at the University of Manchester. The drone can be controlled by a computer or an iPad, and can carry a small payload. It uses photovoltaic cells to harvest energy from the sun. The drone can stay in the air for up to 24 hours, which is pretty good. The 24 hour flight is impressive, but I would be more impressed if the drone could stay in the air for two weeks. The article doesn't say how much the drone weighs. I suspect that it might be a little heavier than a pigeon. And I'm not sure if the drone would be able to stay in the air without having to land in order to recharge. So it could possibly stay in the air for about 24 hours. The article says that the drone could be used for military purposes, but it's also being considered for other purposes, like surveillance. I think it could be used for surveillance. It would be great for surveillance purposes if it could stay in the air for two weeks. Of course, you would need to get the drone to stay in one place, and I'm not sure if it would be possible. The article says that it has built in a "magnetic tracker that will help the drone return to its starting position, or follow a designated path." So I'm not sure if that would be good enough. I'm not sure what the maximum range would be, but I'm guessing that it's not very far. This
