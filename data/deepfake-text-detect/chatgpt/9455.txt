This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding. For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force Cable or satellite companies have been able to manipulate the market to get more and more money from their customers by charging outrageous prices and forcing them to watch shows on other channels or pay more for the channels that they do watch. With the recent announcement of Netflix releasing their own cable channel that will cost roughly 100 a month and only have a few channels, I am honestly just confused.
