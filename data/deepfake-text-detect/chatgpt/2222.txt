Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as different from the rest, it's alright I'm not sure about other sites but Buzzfeed news is an entirely seperate website with its own staff etc
