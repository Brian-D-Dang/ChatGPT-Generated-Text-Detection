Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, would I have a hard time trusting experts? So why would someone who is knowledgeable and experienced in a certain field not be trustworthy when giving advice on that subject? The thing is, it's very hard to trust someone who has more knowledge and experience than you. We are usually very good at identifying our own weaknesses, and we are quick to notice the strengths of other people. When you have a lot of knowledge and experience, you will know that there are other people out there who can be even better at the task you are trying to do than you are. Therefore, you would be very tempted to trust the advice of those people. I'm not saying that knowledgeable and experienced people are untrustworthy, but I think you are right in thinking that a lot of people, especially when it comes to health related stuff, do not trust the advice of the experts and prefer to do their own research instead.
