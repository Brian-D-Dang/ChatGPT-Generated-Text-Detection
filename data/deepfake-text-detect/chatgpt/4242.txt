This stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the Greek economic crisis, and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the Chinese government. At this point though, I feel like it is more important to discuss how to deal with the US debt. Not sure why you were downvoted for that, but China has done fuck-all regarding their internal financial problems so far, especially compared to Europe or Japan. The Greek debt issue is completely different to them.
