I believe that it is bad for humans generally that we have patriotism. It leads not only to discrimination. (hello Mr Trump) But also to economic and political difficulties and a reluctance of the government to adjust societal rules in order to make life better for people who don't look like us, or act like us etc... Also: Many Germans are still racists today because they were raised as children being told how much better their own country was compared with others around them - even though this wasn't true at all! They learned from school books about Germany while leaving out similar things happening elsewhere during the same time period. I think more open discussion would be helpful here; teaching history class should include some context instead of just repeating old myths without providing any nuance whatsoever.. So yes i do wish there was less nationalism among ordinary folks here in the US too.
