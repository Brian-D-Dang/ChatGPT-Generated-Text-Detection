I say "killer asteroid" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth. I have three stories on this topic: The Birth of the Asteroid Killer by Michael J. Sullivan The Growing Threat of Asteroids by Mike Wood Killing Asteroids and the End of the World by Mike Wood I am probably the most knowledgeable person on the topic in my group. When I started researching this for a story, I was shocked at the lack of information available to the public. And what little there was, was often wrong. You may have seen a few videos on the subject. Many of them have incorrect or incomplete information. Since I have three stories on the topic, I'm going to list the references I used for each one. I can't list them all here, because that would be crazy long, but if you're interested in the topic, these are good places to start.

It first appeared in the June 2010 issue of Astronomy Magazine. Because I love asteroids, this was a natural fit for my short story collection, and I bought it the very day it was published. I've read it several times, and have it near at hand whenever I write about asteroids.

Sullivan. It first appeared in the July 2007 issue of Asimov's Science Fiction. It is a very short story (only 950 words) about an asteroid impact. But it isn't just any impact. It is the impact of a killer asteroid, one that will wipe out life
