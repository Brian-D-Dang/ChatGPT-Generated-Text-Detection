It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be protected from poachers, while also providing educational opportunities to people who may not be able to travel and see them otherwise. Zoos should continue to strive to create the most natural environment possible for their inmates, and end mistreatment as soon as it is discovered.
