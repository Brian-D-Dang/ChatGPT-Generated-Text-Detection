Let me start off by stating what I believe the reddit basic income theory is. From what I have read from rbasicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society where people get taxed more than they need to pay in taxes (which would be inflation) it becomes much harder for them to make ends meet and has implications on everything from housing prices to health care costs. When we are talking about social welfare here in the US, there are some pretty big implications to this when you consider how many Americans are currently having more or less inflationary debt than they are paying in taxes. The promise of socialism was only made if the government was willing to make the demands without looking like an idiot or any sort of political hack. Nowadays most places don't even let you move your stuff around anymore because they can barely afford rent and food...and yet, as wealth rises everybody's thought processes become increasingly socialist. At least it seemed to me until recently when I realized that the core of capitalism has allowed people who could do better to leave their society behind, but didn't allow them to work hard enough to keep up with the rising cost of living to work overtime at home (and then continued working at night because their labor force wasn't sufficient). Then you had to work on top of that and make sure everyone else worked well under a higher standard than themselves to maintain living standards. And now when those wages hit out at 95-99, it turns into something of an economic paradox. It makes sense that people might go back to work, and if the worker's union is forced out soon after handmaking in order to survive in a world full of inequality, it happens that the workers' unions to which they belong will eventually collapse due to shortages and lack of bargaining power. But my personal experience is that while the workers' unions aren't able to run and control an economy that isn't controlled by a corporation, they still tend to push forward making sure no one gets hurt too badly by not being able to work properly if necessary. This is true in the extreme case where Social Security is left to its own devices, rather than trying to help those who really just want the money. And of course...it would mean that when someone puts away a lot of extra pay they'll be able to take advantage of other benefits that wouldn't otherwise exist at a lower cost. In short, socialism takes a shit ton of resources, and it means not all working people can benefit from it, and especially if those things aren't offered by government subsidies. This is actually a good point though. We see some parallels between the way American labour market policies work today. When the working class began getting a tiny bit richer in the 1930s, they got used to working longer hours, but the whole concept of a "fairness" of the working poor became so ingrained that working conditions were far harder for anyone else than it was for the average American household. There was also little incentive for young children to learn every day about anything, save time. And if we're going to talk about the education system though, doesn't teaching kids to play video games count as "playing"? You should know that if you spend 30 minutes playing video games you really don't do anything at all. So why should we be surprised when the teachers stop teaching at school before it goes to afternoon classes? If they decide to shut down schools or create new ones, we shouldn't expect us to feel bad because we've already become bored with our jobs. It took the unions from 1934 to 1947 to throw off the notion of a fair labor system and instead focus on improving educational outcomes and reducing poverty amongst workers. I'm no economist at all - although it seems like the US probably shouldn't be expected to have a decent quality of life and a decent amount of medical care. However, the US should never be punished over failed efforts to improve public services when conceivably we'd end up with worse health care policies.
