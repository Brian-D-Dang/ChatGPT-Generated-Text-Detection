So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor the fact that they are a minority in these countries (which is called reverse discrimination). Now if two people from different ethnical backgrounds - here let's say blackwhite or asian native american come together to form friendship groups... it doesn't make sense why can't we be friends? This was my understanding up until now but please correct me! If you don' t want your kids being bullied for having an afro hair style then go ahead cause its all fine by us XD;) But i still think there should always exist tolerance among our races no matter where on earth were born right??
