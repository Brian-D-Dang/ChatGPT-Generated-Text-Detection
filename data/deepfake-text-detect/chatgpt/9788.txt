First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from an ethical standpoint. From an ethical standpoint, I believe it is wrong to take a handicap spot if you are not handicapped. Not only does this deprive those who genuinely need these spots of access to the building, but it also sends a message that people with disabilities are not as important or valuable as those without them. Taking a handicap spot when you are not handicapped is selfish and dismissive of the struggles that people with disabilities face. It's also illegal in some jurisdictions, so there could be legal repercussions for doing so. In conclusion, taking a handicap spot when you are not handicapped is unethical and should be avoided.
