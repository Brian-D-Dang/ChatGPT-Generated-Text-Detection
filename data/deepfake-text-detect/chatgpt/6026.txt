I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I have a group of friends who are the strongest women I know. They are confident in their choices to go to the gym, to go to the bar, to go to the club. They are confident in their choices to wear what they want to wear, whether that is heels, leggings, yoga pants, sweats, or shorts. They are confident in their choices to date, to not date, to have children, to not have children, to be friends with their exes, to not be friends with their exes. They are confident in their choices to travel, to stay home, to be home-makers, to be bread winners, to not be bread winners. I have been lucky enough to surround myself with this group of women, and they make me stronger and better every day. I am not saying that it is a woman's job to be strong, but I think that a woman should have the choice to be strong. We are constantly pushed to be beautiful, smart, and everything in between, but we are not encouraged to be strong. We are not encouraged to be confident, to make decisions, to have our own voice. That is not our job. We are encouraged to be perfect, to be thin, to be perfect at home, to be perfect at work. Being perfect is something that is impossible, and I think that the sooner we recognize that, the better we will be. We are not perfect, and we should not try to be. We are not perfect, and we should not be expected to be. The sooner we recognize that, the better we will be. I am not a feminist, but I am very close to the movement. I am a humanist, and I believe in gender equality. I believe that there should be equal opportunities for men and women. I believe that the gender pay gap should be addressed. I believe that people should be able to get pregnant, and have children if they want to, and if they can afford to. I believe that women should be able to have children, and they should be able to have their children, whether they be from a man or a woman. I believe that women should be able to choose to do what they want to do. I believe that women should be able to choose to be strong, even if it means that they are not feminine. I believe that women should be able to choose to be strong, even if it means that they are not feminine. I believe that women should be able to choose to do what they want to do, even if it means that they are not feminine. I believe that women should be able to choose to have children, and work, and raise a family, and get an education. I believe that women should be able to choose to be single, and choose to have children, and choose to stay home, and choose to work, and choose to be friends with their ex, and choose to be friends with anyone they want to be friends with. I believe that women should be able to choose to live their lives however they want. I believe that we need to let them. I believe in feminism, I believe in equality, and I believe that we need to let women be strong. I believe that we need to let women do what they want. I believe that we need to give women the choice to be strong, and let them make those decisions. I believe that we need to let them be feminine, and let them be masculine, and let them be anything that they want. We need to let them be strong. We need to let them be confident. We need to let them live their lives the way they want to live them. It is not our job to tell them what to do. It is not our job to tell them what to do. We are all different, and we all have different ideas of what we want to do. We need to stop making it a choice. We need to stop telling women that they can be strong, and confident, and independent, but only if they want to be. We need to stop telling women that they have to be feminine, and that they have to be a certain way. We need to let women make those decisions for themselves. We need to let women do what they want. We need to let women be strong. I have had enough of this. I have had enough of telling women how to be women. I have had enough of telling women that they are strong, and then telling them that they can't be strong. I have had enough of telling women what they want, and who they want to be. I have had enough of telling women how to live their lives. So, I am
