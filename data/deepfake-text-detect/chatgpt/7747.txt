One possible counter-argument to this opinion could be that BuzzFeed has actually contributed positively to the field of journalism by creating engaging content that attracts younger audiences who may not have previously been interested in news. While BuzzFeed may not cover traditional news stories in the same way as some more established news organizations, their ability to leverage social media and create shareable content has helped to increase visibility and encourage discussion around important issues. In this way, BuzzFeed has helped to expand the reach of journalism and promote important conversations that may not have otherwise been possible. Additionally, BuzzFeed has broken several important news stories, such as their expose on sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein, which demonstrates their commitment to investigative reporting and holding powerful individuals accountable for their actions.
