Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just say that most of the stuff is either common sense (i.e., change your password regularly...) or already discussed in other threads maybe you shouldn't use the same password for every website. I don't think it's been mentioned before anywhere else, so thanks!
