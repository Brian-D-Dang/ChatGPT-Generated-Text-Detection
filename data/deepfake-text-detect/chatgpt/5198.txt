Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and I agree with youI apologize for my ignorance in general but I think essentially every gay man isn't worthy to be treated like one... I can only hope there's more men who are willing to take responsibility for their actions.
