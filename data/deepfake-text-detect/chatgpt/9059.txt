Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than those who are between it and being stronger. This was clearly the case with the new centre of nationalism in Italy, which has a strong anti-immigration sentiment; this led some Italians to blame the party of Fascism for the "fascists" that first created it. However, there were also many other reasons why this had been the case in some parts of Europe as well. For example, the Italian nationalist movement in Catalonia from 1978-85 made criticism of its nationalist leader Luis Alberto Aquilina - particularly his policy of allowing Jews and Muslims into their cities. The same argument was used against the populist movement of the late 1980s, when the Catalan nationalists Labour Party began opposition campaigning against Catalan independence owing to its anti-Semitic sentiments. It didn't matter whether these actions were committed by Italy or Spain. A massive influx of immigrants would have likely given rise to the first mass immigration in Italy since the mid 1980s, just like illegal migrants did in the Mediterranean countries. People in the southern region of Lombardy noticed and objected about how much work there was coming out of its landlocked city of Cagliari. In the northeastern part of Rome they felt that "people who want to live here should leave, but we don't know how long before they come back." But the very fact that the poor Italians were allowed to move on without fear of deportation could be seen across the whole EU, where some of the most successful politicians were forced to use the public services provided by the state in order to secure their livelihoods. Besides, this was the reason why so few immigrants became citizens themselves rather than taking up residence in the states. Because of this, the economic crisis of the early 1990s made the poor Italians feel less comfortable leaving their home countries, especially Italians. There were also other drivers: more and more workers were getting unemployment benefits instead of their old jobs, making them increasingly dependent on foreign labour. These changes were helped by the popular vote that went towards the right to elect a government at the national level in 1989 in an election held entirely virtually from different parts of Italy. Although these elections weren't directly linked to recent movements in certain European nations like France, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway etc., they did contribute significantly in changing fundamental attitudes toward migration. From 1983 to 1988, the number per 100000 inhabitants increased by 9 compared to 1993 levels. Even though numbers in the United Kingdom were still relatively small, the effect of this change wasn't limited to Britain. The British population had grown by 5 in 1985 and now amounted to over 3 million inhabitants, by contrast to the 2.5 million individuals of Germany. Furthermore, although the UK may not seem like a lot when compared to the rest of Europe, the actual growth rate for the UK population remained roughly unchanged throughout the 1990s. In the UK, the GDP grew by 4 per year during 2007-08 compared to 2008-09, while employment percentage in Europe fell by 13. The same trend could be explained partly by the impact of the Brexit referendum in May 2016. With all this in mind, it seems impossible to infer what factors contributed to the increase in the positivity of immigrant populations thus far. The question then becomes: can the new position of the British elite really help it gain ground in such a large one? How will the population grow if there are no good options left in place for immigrants, or will the kidnapping and murder of hundreds of young men still go unnoticed? More importantly, will it be enough to convince people that Immigration Reform means more than merely accepting immigrants, and therefore that, with little or no market value, it is the only way to prevent further alienations? By the end of 2015, Immigration Reform had achieved almost 30 of all votes in the Swedish parliament and had garnered 60.2 of the total vote. Even above the official figure of 40, it was clear that immigration reform was gaining momentum, driven by hopes of increasing the status quo among Swedes. However, a wave of military intervention by the US might be enough to motivate those who wanted to keep going abroad, as it took the form of US-backed measures to stop the asylum process. There was also the issue of immigration laws. According to data published in January 2017, about 35 of Sweden's population lived within two hours of the border and another 10 percent visited the Swedish border daily. Only 1 percent considered themselves to be among the top six groups living in the world. Another 8 million Swedes see themselves inside five minutes' walk of the border every day. Of course, the proportion of non-swedes with permanent residency has steadily risen over the past three decades, reaching around 33 in 1998. Today, however, only 16 of people with permanent residency do. While the majority of Swedes - - - - - - - - - - - and went - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
