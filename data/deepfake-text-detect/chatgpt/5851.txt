The U.S. Constitution is an old document. At the time it was written, it made a lot of sense, and it was a large jump ahead for democracy, politics, and human rights, but it was still inadequate. It provided for a government that was never intended to be able to handle the modern world. It's not that it has failed - it's simply outgrown. It has grown old and stodgy, and is in need of a massive overhaul. The U.S. government today, in fact, is probably one of the most inefficient governments in the world. It's not just that it's slow and takes a long time to get things done, but it's actually ineffective at getting things done. Because the United States has an incredibly complex governmental system, it takes a lot of time to get anything done. The U.S. government is so large and unwieldy, that it has to go through a bunch of steps, before anything is actually accomplished. So you can't expect a government to get anything done quickly. Expecting the U.S. government to make drastic changes quickly is a joke. We should realize that we need to take things step by step, and the Constitution has a good foundation to build upon. What we need is a significant and radical change in the way our government functions. I suggest that we need a complete overhaul of our government, and that we need to go back to the drawing board, and completely rewrite the U.S. Constitution. We should adopt a system that is more like a parliamentary system, or a system like they have in Australia. I'm not advocating going down the path of a pure democracy, but I think that we need to take more of a direct role in politics, and that the government needs to be more in touch with the people. The Constitution is very limited in terms of what it actually allows the government to do. For example, the Constitution does not allow the government to set up a welfare system, or to set up a national healthcare system. The government was not supposed to get involved in social welfare issues. On the other hand, I'm all for national healthcare. This is a very touchy issue, and there's a good argument on both sides of the issue. We should be able to discuss it openly, and come to an agreement on a national level, and have the government set up a national healthcare system. In a direct democracy, you can propose new laws, and decide whether they're good or bad. A parliamentary system requires a certain percentage of the vote for the measure to pass, but it's still a democratic system. In Australia, they have a parliamentary system, but they also have referendums. They have referendums for proposals to change the constitution, and if it passes, then the government will have to do it. In the U.S., there is a lot of talk about having referendums and allowing the people to vote on certain things, but the government doesn't seem to be interested in doing it. They just don't seem to like the idea. They keep saying that there's no way we could do it, or there's no way the people would vote on it, or it would never pass, or whatever. Why wouldn't it pass? In a referendum, the people would decide. I think that if we put in the right laws, it would work. The people would vote on it and then the government would have to act upon it. The U.S. government is too complex and unwieldy for the people to make any significant changes by itself. It would be better to have a parliamentary system. We should take a leaf out of Britain's book, and make things simpler. We should have parliamentary systems, and we should have a president that is actually responsible for foreign policy, and not the Congress. In Britain, they have a parliamentary system, but they have a monarch that is in charge of the military, foreign affairs, and so on. The monarch is responsible for appointing the prime minister, and the prime minister is responsible for making the laws, and for appointing the ministers. The prime minister is the head of government, and the monarch is the head of state. In the U.S., we have a congress that is the head of government, and a president that is the head of state. The Congress is the head of government, but the president is the head of state. We should adopt a system that is more like a parliamentary system, or a system like they have in Australia. I would like to see a president that is actually responsible
