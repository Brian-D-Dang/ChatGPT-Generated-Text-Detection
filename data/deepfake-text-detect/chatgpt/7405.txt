While it is true that Common Core has received criticism, it is unfair to claim that it is a fundamentally flawed system that does not prepare students for the real world. In fact, Common Core was implemented with the aim of providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful in college and in their careers. Additionally, Common Core emphasizes critical thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to clearly communicate ideas - all key skills for success in the real world. While it may take time for teachers and schools to adjust to the new standards, it is important to recognize that Common Core is designed to better prepare students for their futures.
