I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for killing somebody that was trying to kill him, I think he deserves an immediate release from jail. If you're going down this road then why not just make murder legal? It's already your right to defend yourself so why shouldn't it be your right to commit suicide with no repercussions afterwards (barring actual victimization). Or are we still keeping people alive because they haven't killed anybody yet and want them around long enough to get someone else killed instead.
