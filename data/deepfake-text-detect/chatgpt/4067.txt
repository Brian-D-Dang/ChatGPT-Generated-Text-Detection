One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one by definition, and in reality it's almost impossible for an individual person or even a group of people to create this kind of dynamic. There are several reasons why diversity is so important when it comes to intellectual growth (and thus poverty reduction). Studies have shown that having many different perspectives can improve our ability to reason effectively about problems, and they also allow us to see things from other angles than we might otherwise consider possible. The results of research on cognitive development suggest that individuals who live in highly diverse environments tend to think differently about the world around them and therefore develop more flexible mindsets which help them adapt to situations better. In fact, the mere act of living in a diverse community increases your odds of developing more flexible thinking skills. These benefits should not come at the expense of a diverse environment though; if anything, it makes life easier and improves outcomes, but only within a certain range. If you move outside of that range, then there will be diminishing returns to the quality of life because people won't know what to do with all those new ideas coming into their heads and may fail to make use of them successfully. Furthermore, people tend to take advantage of such situation when it suits them best - it's a simple phenomenon known as "the American Way" which has been observed in various cultures throughout human history. This tendency leads to people leaving the most productive countries and moving where they feel like they belong rather than staying where many others already want them. These results show us that even geographically dispersed societies possess some form of conformity and institutionalized hierarchy that contributes toward inequality both internally and externally. The second factor affecting diversity in terms of diversity of thought is cultural sensitivity. Cultural sensitivity refers to how sensitive someone is to differences between themselves and other people. People tend to view differences among themselves in a positive light because these differences often reflect aspects of truth, while denial tends to propagate falsehoods. For example, a French woman speaking English converses with her family in French just like any other foreigner would speak. She automatically sees herself as part of the mainstream society, whereas a Mexican speaker hearing a native Spanish speaker talking in English assumes she must be a member of another culture entirely. The same experience occurs with cultural sensitivity: a white man hearing Japanese-American conversation hears himself as culturally less advanced than his Japanese fellow-traveler simply because he speaks a language not belonging to him. Cultural sensitivity sometimes goes hand in hand with sensitivity towards difference; for instance, blacks who are exposed to racism assume whites are equally racist. Although such disparity between perception and reality is fairly common, it does not always result in social isolation. It depends greatly upon the level of interaction and accommodation with members of the opposite race. Black Americans often learn early on to regard whites as equals and treat them as such. Conversely, Asian Americans are much more likely to avoid interacting with whites until later in life once they become aware of racial prejudice against non-whites. Similarly, cultures across the globe seem to vary widely in regards to tolerance of each other's sensibilities and attitudes; there are far fewer instances of mutual respect and equality amongst people of vastly different backgrounds and belief systems. To illustrate these points further, people who identify as Christians rarely interact with Jews or Muslims unless they're invited by friends or relatives. Those who claim no religious affiliation tend to generally hang out with white counterculture types - outsiders who reject traditional values and adhere to radical views and philosophies. Unfortunately, being tolerant of others' lifestyles doesn't mean accepting everything they say or doing. You don't need to like or agree with someone just because they're different. Your tolerance requires acceptance of their beliefs if you want to coexist peacefully with them. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule, although whether one ought to deal with people with differing opinions and viewpoints remains up for debate. Some argue that the concept of tolerance itself is misguided and outdated, since people shouldn't try to force their beliefs onto others, particularly when their view differs fundamentally from yours. Others believe that distinguishing between right and wrong is fundamental and essential if we plan to achieve objective moral truths. However, in any case, tolerance implies openness to new thoughts and ideas, regardless of whether one agrees with or supports them. And yet too few people truly practice tolerance - they appear to prefer keeping opinions bottled inside their own skulls while secretly judging everyone else. Tolerance is something we need to cultivate to maintain a healthy world order, especially given today's global circumstances. We've seen how well it worked in Hitler's Germany during World War II, and I'm sure it's possible to replicate that experiment here without causing too much trouble. As long as the world keeps changing and becoming ever more complex, however, it seems unlikely that anyone, including ourselves, could achieve consensus on issues that require broad agreement. While intolerance is not pleasant to deal with, it nonetheless serves a valid purpose. Tolerating dissentd is decision dt andy ma nney b. dhe qu..
