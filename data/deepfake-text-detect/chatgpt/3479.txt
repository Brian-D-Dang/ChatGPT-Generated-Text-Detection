Hello everyone, with all the media coverage lately regrading transgender individuals I find myself uneducated on the particular subject and would love to be enlightened on the topic. I support your willingness to learn and educate yourself on transgender individuals. Transgender refers to someone whose gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth. This means that a person who was born with male physical characteristics may identify as female or non-binary (not identifying with either gender). Likewise, someone with female physical characteristics may identify as male or non-binary. It is important to understand that transgender individuals are not "choosing" to be a certain gender; their gender identity is an innate part of who they are. It is important to recognize and respect individuals' gender identities, and to use the pronouns and names they prefer. Transgender individuals face many challenges, such as discrimination and lack of access to healthcare, and it is important to be an ally and advocate for their rights.
