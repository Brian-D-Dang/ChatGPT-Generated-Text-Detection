This is a very sensitive topic so sorry for posting it here if I am not supposed to. This is a true CMV, I am on the fence about the headlight being an add-on. I also have noticed the same thing. It was reported stolen in Pennsylvania and later found abandoned in New York. I would think it is an original CMV but I'm not positive. It looks like the most likely scenario is that it was stolen from CMV and someone installed a steering wheel and headlight. I don't know why someone would do that. Not sure if it's been posted here, but one of my favorite dragsters of all time is the 68 ET 612. Thanks, I was wondering if anyone knew about it. I've got a few photos of the car if anyone's interested in seeing them. But I'm not sure what the value is... any idea? I'm sure it's been posted before, but I didn't see it. Those look amazing, so happy I found this site. Do you have any more pics of the car? Wow, a 77 Pro Stock Racer. Just beautiful.
