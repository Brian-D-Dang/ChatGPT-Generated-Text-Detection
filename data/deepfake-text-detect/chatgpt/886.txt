I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. The Republican Party, once a bastion of morality, is now a bunch of weirdos who think they're a bunch of hypocrites.
