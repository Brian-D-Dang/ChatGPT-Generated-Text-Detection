Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a different reason. I won't be able to make it up there anytime soon and want more people who haven't been before, or who might not have gotten their chance yet (and need someone else's luck) so that they can see what an awesome experience it is. I'm going tomorrow! I'll let you know how my trip shapes out for me after.
