I feel like they're acting and it often feels very campy. I don't like how they say "well my brain is more feminine," like excuse me that's something that women are supposed to do. And I think this is an interesting way for them to enter into the world of creating art, which is what we all want from our artworks. They're doing it in a different kind of way than men. The way they walk, the way they speak, even they really show you how they love their work." Hummus says she found her inspiration in photography. When she was young, photography was much harder to find. She had many friends who were photographers, but they did not know about me. So when she started looking at photography and discovered my style, she began searching around. We would see each other on Facebook after school and do a lot of different things together. It was so important to me. So I asked myself: What will the next step be? In time. But now I have looked up another art form that we can really enjoy. This may sound extreme, but there is the potential to create so much more out of your art if you choose to make use of it. For example, I am currently making a series about the life of Camille Korda. At first, I thought that the series might focus on Korda's life as a woman. After reading some of the books by Angie Moulton and the reviews they used on Amazon, I realized that I wanted to share what happened to Korda while she lived in Paris. My goal was to share his story with people so they could learn about him and his journey through life. As a result, the series has been translated into Spanish and English.

During her studies, she studied in Design Studio 2 in Barcelona. Her current project is a series called "Avalanche" starring Halle Berry. While visiting the studio, she met Thomas Edison. He wrote the book Avalanche, which was published in 1887. After studying design studio 2, Korda decided to continue working in her home city. Now, she enjoys working in Spanish since its name translates to "work." She said that she hopes to continue working in Spain until she dies.
