What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy you will see reflected in the results... however, if they actually happen to be effecting women's vote. The reality is that women make up only 4 of voters worldwide, compared with 29 for men - more than double the percentage of women who voted against Trump. Basically, the GOP has been pushing demands that women should not even consider voting ... complete with an appeal to their own privilege. Women want equality; they clearly do have a lot of privileges this election season: They can get paid less or work harder without having to worry about being pushed out by employers looking at them like a piece of meat, but they also deserve equal pay just as much as men expect from employers too. And what do these people know? The voters don't care about what politics means anymore because they're terrified of losing jobs themselves (except when it comes to abortion). They 'feel pressured' into voting against their own interests anyway so why would they sacrifice their rights simply because Republicans have given up on intersectionality now? If they really believe that's the right thing to do then surely women shouldn't feel threatened by saying no to their rights by doing nothing else but defending their rights? That doesn't mean women won't vote similarly though. Hell yes, you'll hear about women rejecting Donald Trump because he was elected after all - men aren't scared enough to voice their opinions yet again! - but that will certainly never stop the Republican Party from getting behind a woman candidate. But those beliefs are wrong under any circumstance because they fundamentally contradict the rules governing American democracy itself. Why stop there?
