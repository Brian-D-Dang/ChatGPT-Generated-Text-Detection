I attribute my agnosticism to this very theory. Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in existence before it. Therefore if something comes after God (or whatever you want to call him) then it must have been created by someone or something else - which is exactly what I believe happened when God made me out of dirt and breathed life into me. What gave rise to your atheism?
