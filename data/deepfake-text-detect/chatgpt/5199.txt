I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was surprised that an American made it so far without reading anything else like the film prior to seeing it first hand..... Jesus Christ another film review has already been posted here somewhere else lol
