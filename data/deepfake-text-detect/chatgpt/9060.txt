I believe that a private business should be able to deny service to anyone for any reason. For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, it would have to do so under the terms of its agreement with the NAACP (the organization that represents most of the black community in America). The TIAA stands by their own policy that only "anybody who is not racist or homophobic" can get denied service to Black people. What this means is that minority groups cannot give out services just because they are afraid of being called racists and homophobic. This isn't about race; this is about discrimination. If you want to see how minority groups treat each other over time, look at what happened to Ethel Kennedy when she was Vice President. She didn't care enough to get her husband into cabinet positions allowing him to murder the children she cared about. It's about RICHING! Take heed to those words: ..."and we realise that our society portrays us as 'white children' - but only consider our children as a family." They don't matter unless those children are part of your family, but there is no need for them to be treated differently than others. The same goes for some other races. Therefore, it must surely take precedence to make sure that those born of skin colour don't deserve discrimination. In other words, they shouldn't be discriminated against. Are all Blacks equal? In addition, these policies (and laws) aren't meant to protect every poor person from harm - which is why it makes much more sense to hold individuals responsible for ensuring that their kids aren't subjected to racially discriminatory treatment. Everyone deserves equal rights regardless of color.
