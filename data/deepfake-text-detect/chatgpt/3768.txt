I've lived practically my whole life on this phrase. It has shaped how I have made several important decisions in my life, though I have recently come to suspect that it may not be as helpful or true as I once thought. My family is very religious and I am a devout Christian. As an avid reader of the Bible, I know what it says about marriage being one man and one woman (in Scripture) and about God's plan for us being together until death do us part. But when pressed by friends or acquaintances, I often respond with "Well, you can never know - there are so many different interpretations out there!" Or if they ask me why we don't just get married like everyone else, I say, "Oh, well there's no reason that should happen." Now, in my younger days, I would probably have been more willing to defend such statements, saying that at least people were trying to understand my point of view. However, now I realize that these responses might give the impression that I really believe marriage shouldn't be valid (for whatever reason). With all of the changes to culture since the 1950s, however, I think some of those beliefs could be changing. For example, before the 1960s women weren't allowed to go into many professions other than education; after that, most jobs had their own category called secretary or office worker, which didn't allow women. Early on men who worked outside the home tended to work in factories while their wives looked after children. There was also less access to certain kinds of entertainment. People couldn't see movies or read books because it wasn't considered acceptable. And it was difficult for single women to find work even when they wanted to. So despite having always known what God said about marriage, I would still be defensive when asked whether I believed in the institution. Thankfully, I soon saw through that whole facade but there were plenty of times where my defense led others to misunderstand me. The fact is, I cannot prove my faith. If someone asks me if I truly believe we should marry only one person to stay together forever, my answer would be that yes, we need to make necessary sacrifices to honor our union. That doesn't mean that I am against civil unions or gay rights. It means we must continue to fight for equality based on gender.
