This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special attention in prison. I'm a juvenile offender and have been for 6 years now... don't really get why there's such a big focus on us or what we wantneed from a youth offenders centre?
