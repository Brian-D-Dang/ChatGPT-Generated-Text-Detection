If every nation had a large nuclear arsenal, and was willing to use it if they were invaded, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction. Once America invaded Iraq for the sake of invading it, you could tell it was our fault. And yet we didn't attack Iran? Iran is an inbred cow-puppet with no chance at winning anything other than a handout that works on oil fields.
