The goods and services we consume are made possible by the abundance of cheap resources and labour that the west gets out of underdeveloped countries. The West has no reason to care, because it is not directly impacted by such exploitation - its demand for these things is generated elsewhere... I have read your blog from time to time over the past year or so. I'd like you to know how much this site means to me. It gives a true context to my own activism in fighting injustice (not just capitalism) but also which side I am on when people argue with each other about Left vs Right politics. For example: as an anarchist who believes that "individuals should be free to pursue their happiness without interference," yet at the same time there could never possibly be 'too many options available to choose from' i agree wholeheartedly with part 2 (b), but feel strongly that part 3 contradicts itself. Or like you say yourself here, anyone can become a libertarian; having an argument with someone else does not mean they don't share your valuesbeliefs, it only means there might be something wrong with them! Similarly, even though I affirm some degree of hierarchy within our communities (grouping as well as role differentiation etc.), I don't think any form of hierarchical organisation would provide a good solution either (which is why I come across as both anarcho-syndicalist and prefigurative sometimes). At least not all hierarchies seem to lead back into authoritarianism later down the line! Having said that, I do believe, however reluctantly, that compromise is necessary if we want to get anywhere! As long as everyone has their place in society then we can function more effectively. Perhaps the best way forward would involve combining elements from 1 4? As a socialist I find many commonalities between us with respect to what we can achieve through direct action together rather than relying upon parliament to address social issues, although during times where states fail to respond appropriately then perhaps political activism needs to step up again. However the issue of whether you call yourself leftist or right wing seems somewhat irrelevant since neither offers a realistic alternative to solving current problems facing humanity regardless of ideology. Both extremes still rely heavily on capitalistic systems to operate and the economic model which modern mainstream left and right parties usually support will always favour those who already hold power regardless if that involves the state or corporations. If anything socialists tend to be very upfront about ending inequality whilst conservatives seek equality of opportunity and ignore structural inequalities caused by class divisions themselves. In fact what I see more often than not is conservative politicians trying to pass laws on subjects relating to sexuality or abortion with varying degrees of success while Leftists take a different path towards achieving similar ends via mass mobilisation and non-violent civil disobedience tactics, similar to what happened during Ghandi's protest against British rule affecting Indians in India. Of course many differences exist too, one being socialism tends to focus almost exclusively on economics whereas anarchists value freedom above all else. Also unlike most socialists who make use of parliamentary democracy, anarchism avoids voting altogether. This doesn't necessarily lessen the relevance of ideas advocated by early 20th century thinkers like Kropotkin, Bakunin, Goldman et al but in terms of contemporary practice suggests larger scale revolution may need to occur before working groups can truly implement equalitarian principles. Regardless, despite ideological disagreements, it is important we include each others views in order to fully understand the situation today. We are afterall all united in seeking human dignity and justice, just divided along several lines due to differing philosophies of government. PS: Sorry if I was unclear about anything previously! Like myself you probably spend far less time reading history related sites than I do lol! Alex says: April 27, 2012 at 9:49 pm Good post. You mentioned that Westerners needed morality and ethics from outside. Morality comes naturally to humans; individual acts of kindness are much easier to recall than organized altruism. True compassion makes sense, historically and personally - but only as a young person whose parents have passed away, late teens to mid twenties. When your family dies off quicker than anticipated, it leaves you alone. And you start to realize life isn't fair. That life will end and none of your work matters. So empathy becomes paramount. Then you hit 30 years old. Realize your parents were kind, honorable men and women, not idealized saints, but average people who did everything they thought was right. But unfortunately, they died prematurely. There's nothing better than knowing love and companionship until death; seeing children grow up and marry. None of it happens anymore, unless you are lucky enough to live in Japan. In Europe or America, people rarely last longer than forty five years. They die younger. Yes, there are exceptions every now and then, those rare individuals might reach 60 years old, or 75, but it is statistically impossible to live beyond 40 without extraordinary circumstances. And it is easy to forget. My, for lack of hope. Hope is vital: real disaster is avoided at present. Fewer of classic moviegoers gave zero Be
