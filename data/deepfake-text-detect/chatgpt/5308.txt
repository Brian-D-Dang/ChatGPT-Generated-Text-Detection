I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry atheists say they are. What other reasons would you choose to identify with a religious group? You're right, I don't know what's more important: showing up for church or having fun in church
