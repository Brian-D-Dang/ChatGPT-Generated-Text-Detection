With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned as intended, up until recently, we were able to be receptive and tolerant of others without becoming emotionally attached in any way shape or form just because they made for good debate fodder. That has been replaced now by what seems like an unending stream of whiny white males who are only content when everyone else around them shuts their mouths but not theirs. Do you have other examples? To my knowledge there was no post-racial era where racism didn't exist except perhaps during a few months after MLK's death.
