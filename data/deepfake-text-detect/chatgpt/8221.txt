I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm assuming it's all men). I was wondering if this is normal, or should be stopped? Is there any way to stop them from doing such as thing without hurting their feelings and making things awkward between us - especially since none of these are "serious" relationships at least right now but rather just one night stands on both sides for casual sex fun??
