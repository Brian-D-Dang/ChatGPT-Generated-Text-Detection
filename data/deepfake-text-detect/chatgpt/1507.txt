Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same. His views on immigration would not only alienate Hispanic voters and earn him votes from other groups as well, they also make it easier for other candidates to win over those voters by presenting their own case against Mr. Trump. After all, if someone you dislike so much that he scares your dog wouldn't even be able to get elected as president of the United States - why bother voting at all?
