I been using Google Chrome as far as I remember (probably since 2010) and it's been my default browser on all the computerslaptops I've used. Chrome was fast, reliable and easy to use and didn't have all the unnecessary crap that IE, Firefox and Safari has. But now I have to make a decision. Will I stick with Chrome or will I switch to Firefox? Before I started making the decision I did some research (as you should do when you want to change browsers) and found out that it's not as easy to change browsers as it was a few years ago. There are a lot of things that you have to consider when you want to change your browser. The most important thing is to decide which features you want your browser to have and what you want it to be able to do. After you have decided on that you can start looking at what browsers you have to choose from. The three main browsers are Firefox, Chrome and Safari and I have used all three so I know what they can do. After that you can find some less known browsers. Opera, Vivaldi and Brave are some of the most popular ones. I have never used them before so I don't know what they can do but maybe some of you have used them before. After you have made your decision you have to decide which features that your browser has that you want to keep. Which features you have to replace and which features you want to get rid of. When I decided to change to Firefox I had to get rid of all my Chrome extensions and that was a lot of work. But after a while you get used to it and everything works just fine. I have decided to switch to Firefox and I'm going to be happy with my new choice. One of the biggest benefits that Firefox has for me is their new Brave Browser, which is a very fast and free browser. It works great with extensions and plugins and it's a very secure browser. It doesn't track your online activity like Chrome does and it doesn't send all the data to Google like Chrome does. If you want to check out their new browser you can do that here. To make things even better, you can now get a free VPN when you use their new browser. Brave also wants to make the web a better place, by rewarding the web's best content creators and giving people more control over their data. For each webpage you visit, you can now choose to donate some of your ad-revenue to the creator. You can now easily block ads in any site, and Brave will protect you against ad-trackers, as well as secure your connection with HTTPS encryption. You can make your own decision now.
