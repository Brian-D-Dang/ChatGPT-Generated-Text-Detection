To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting a high school diploma, I have already learnt some of these skills. The first skill is to learn how to read and write. In the Chinese system, this skill is called . In my opinion, I feel that both are very important. For example, if I did not know how to read, I would not be able to read a book and understand it. Also, if I did not know how to write, I would not be able to write in my diary and record my memories. This is why I think both are important. The second skill is to learn how to do basic calculations and basic equations. I think this is a very important skill because we will need this when we grow up. For example, if we do not know how to do basic calculations, we will not be able to know how much we earn. Another example is if we are doing shopping, we will need to know how much we are spending. The third skill is to learn how to manage my time and to use it wisely. I think this is a very important skill because we will have many things to do in our life. For example, if we do not know how to manage our time wisely, we will not be able to finish our homework or do any other things. Also, if we do not know how to manage our time wisely, we will not be able to get enough sleep. The last skill is to learn how to work in teams. I think this is a very important skill because it is much easier to work in a team than to work alone. For example, if we are doing an experiment in school, we will need to work with our classmates. Another example is if we are doing a project, we will need to work with our classmates. To conclude, I think that all the skills are very important. However, I think that the first skill is more important. This is because it is the most basic skill that we will need to have. Another reason why I think it is the most important is because it is the only skill that you need to learn before you start high school. :, :! :
