This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is that our each individual can infer what they will do with their life and minimize it as much as possible on the basis of how fortunate we are - that choice takes away from us all, including ourselves. We cannot stop thinking about this point because it leads to where I think the moral equivalence between life in the hereafter (as opposed to being born into) and living in a world where we live like zombies - or even less. Even if we got to eat like a zombie and die like a human, at least we would not kill ourselves as well or destroy things and die more than ever before. This is the basis of what my research has done, but it's essential because it leaves out some important questions. For instance: If there was no God, why did humankind survive? What does the moral equivalence between life on earth and living in a world where we create everything and die like humans? Are we to behave like zombies? If so, what do we do when we get sick and die? Can we protect ourselves while waiting for medical treatment? What end does mankind have beyond this point? How could one live in a world where he or she could no longer remember what happened to them and walk around naked barefoot, wearing nothing but his or her clothes like twigs and branches? And how were people who survived survived? Are these questions answered by simply believing that "it" didn't happen, adding consciousness to the discussion, or maybe by paying forward and letting others know that nothing really happens to them anymore? How do you respond if someone asks which way you want to go about making your choices regarding whether or not to have a baby? Why aren't babies thrown away now? Do you just dwell on their existence? Or do you look at the consequences of having a baby, instead of looking down upon those already placed inside? When you decide to have a child yourself, what do you say to them? Did you tell them to believe in God, choose good thoughts and deeds over dead ones, or are you willing to accept the consequences of their actions? When you have children, do you mourn those who died, or instead, rejoice in those who did not? Don't let the emotions of bodies mar the quality of your life; rather, let them feel loved and cared for. Care for the body part of the person who was wounded or killed, whether you wanted the person to stay alive or not. Let them be able to say goodbye to those who made them suffer. Embrace death, especially grief, for its own sake. A few make peace with the idea of doing so day after day without concern for the future. It does not mean wanting to commit suicide. But it does mean knowing the consequences of losing oneself. How do you deal with people who consider themselves to be moralists? If you treat anyone differently because they were the only one in the room when you first started dating your new partner, how would you feel if people thought you had cheated on them? Would you still love them if all of that changed once they found out what had actually happened? Would you forgive yourself for hurting yourself? If so, what does it mean for other people's relationships? Does it mean helping another person make the same decisions for himselfherself that you have been making individually? Is it worth keeping faith in someone else's decisions to save them from death? Or does it just seem better to forgive someone else's mistakes than to punish them? I can answer both. So, my question becomes, "Why are you so passionate about your family when you are so devoted to you-blaming your spouse for something that makes you miserable?" Sincerely yours, Karen Koehler
