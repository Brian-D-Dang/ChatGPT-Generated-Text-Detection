Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as a Hungarian leader who has been in power for almost two decades now, I feel my country needs freedom seekers like me on the boarder if they want to keep their countries safe from foreign influence. We need to help Hungary support our allies: Poles Russians too so that's what they'll do when they come back home again after war with Poland itself. In addition, we're also looking at a potential consolidation of Hungary's position in NATO by helping strengthen our military alliances. As long as Hungary is able to maintain neutrality, we can be sure it won't lose its independence because it doesn't have any political restraints whatsoever." "It might seem strange to some people but at least democracy exists within Hungarian society today," said Charvez Deyalam, the president of the Hungarian National Party. "That's why Hungary still maintains its democratic values despite all these limitations even though there are many obstacles to governing them properly."
