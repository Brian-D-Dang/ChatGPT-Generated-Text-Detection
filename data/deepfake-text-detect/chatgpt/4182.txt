I spend my summer as a representative of the college I attend and interact regularly with kids between the ages of 10 and 18. In these interactions, I have noticed that most of them are unable to comprehend that they will be removed from their parents for good in about three weeks time. In order to prepare our community and students for this transition we have been training school staff members on how to support new arrivals at college. We also organise outings to excite the children when the young adults move out and encourage them to look forward to joining us again. So far there has not been much of an impact beyond the staff, but if the programme continues I think it would give some comfort to many families who don't know anyone else whose life looks like ours.
