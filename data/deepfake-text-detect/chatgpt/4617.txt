I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with the facts. If you are a carnivore (a person who likes meat) sometimes you will find yourself in countries where certain meats aren't allowed by law or culture (or both if those cultures have laws against eating mammal flesh). You may already know that these places include parts of south-east Asia (specifically Thailand), India, Pakistan, Jordan, Israel, Nepal, Afghanistan, Turkey and Iran. For absolutely no reason whatsoever except for their own personal tastes, some people decided that they wanted to place restrictions on how other people could eat what foods they liked. These groups didn't think about the consequences of their choices; did not consider the economic impact which such decisions might have; nor even notice that there were reasons why other religious traditions around them had chosen differently. They just thought "well we don't eat lamb so maybe others shouldn't either." And then something very strange happened... Since making this decision people started contacting us asking whether we intended to serve banned food items at our events! We asked ourselves 'Why? What is going through peoples heads when they ask this question? Why do they want to tell us what to put on our menus?' The answer we came up with was simple: friendship. When you go out and visit someone else's country - especially one as diverse as ours - why should your friends choose to limit themselves based upon what another group has deemed fit for consumption? It seems crazy to me, but unfortunately crazier things happen everyday across the globe. So although I'm happy enough to say 'yes' to serving whatever anyone wants to bring into my kitchen from anywhere I travel to, my mind always goes back to those times when I was forced to make an impossible choice between two equally appealing dishes... The first time I ever ate goat was when I worked for the Virginia Beach SPCA over 10 years ago. My supervisor encouraged me to try eating animal tissue during lunch breaks each day involving goat, rabbit, chicken, fish, ham etc.. He said "It'll help keep your appetite down" and told me he'd seen it work before. At the end of the month, I felt much more satisfied due to eating less than usual and was proud of myself thinking "Wow, I've finally found something that works!" Unfortunately when I went home later that evening after talking to him, I realized that he probably hadn't been too honest about his experience, since only 14 days earlier he had eaten all sorts of different animals off site at a conference (including one dog!). That night I spent hours tossing and turning trying to figure out what kind of person would lie to me about something so important, and why he chose to hide the truth from me. Quite honestly, I now realize that most people wouldn't feel comfortable telling a vegetarian friend about what they actually tasted while traveling abroad, leaving them confused about what types of meat they can buy when they get back home. This leaves vegetarians stuck wondering what type of meats they can afford to purchase at local markets and restaurants. Even worse, despite knowing better, many tourists still fall victim to misleading information given by locals, resulting in a lot of wasted money. On top of that, vegans often run straight into trouble attempting to order anything remotely resembling plant derived protein from businesses who try to pass off fake meat products as real game pieces, claiming that it was ordered by mistake. In short, the world needs to stop being ignorant towards religion, cultural tradition, dietary preferences or any other arbitrary set of rules imposed onto people by random individuals with little regard for the possible consequences. For example, if you stick to strict Islamic guidelines related to diet, then yes - it makes sense to avoid pigskin altogether. However, if you're looking for a way to save some cash or just enjoy fresh tasting food, then please pick up the phone whenever a potential opportunity arises... In fact, let's take a field trip together someday and taste every single option available at an international market:) Just remember: never forget the power of persistence and happiness comes from within, so wherever you are tomorrow, count your blessings Try new things because life is meant to be enjoyed, not feared or restricted. No matter where you live today, you have everything it takes to shape the world - beginning right here, right now Jules Champlin
