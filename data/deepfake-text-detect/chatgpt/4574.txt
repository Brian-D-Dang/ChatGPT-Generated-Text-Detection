First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and intend to remain so for these posts as well. I also have many friends who are parents (or soon will be) of young children or grandchildren, therefore my views could potentially change based on what they say andor do with their own kidsgrandkids sometime down the road. To cut straight to the point, if you follow the news at all then most likely you know by now is that Nancy Grace has been suspended indefinitely because her daughter was allegedly assaulted while under her care during an unauthorized visit last week. The girl's mother hired someone else to watch over her (for free) without telling anyone beforehand which apparently sparked some kind of investigation into whether she stole money as well since when a child is being cared for there is always concern regarding loss of fundsproperty. Isn't it funny how parents can blame others after doing something wrong themselves? Talk about hypocrisy! In fact, she later admitted stealing whatever was missing but still no outrage against her whatsoever. As far as I'm concerned we're too busy pointing fingers instead of getting our priorities straight: Parents need to take responsibility for raising their own offspring rather than trying to pass the buck, blaming other people for mistakes made behind closed doors. We should also look closely at ourselves before passing judgment on those who may make poor decisions. It seems we've become complacent with everyone falling apart around us and constantly talking down to them like they don't understand anything yet alone value life more than having fun. Doesn't this sound familiar? If only everyone had the common sense to see where all of society is headed next... I wonder why people think that just because abortion was legalized 20 years ago, that every woman wants one right away. Most women in their early twenties aren't pregnant right out of high school. My sister-in-law got married at 19 and didn't get pregnant until she was 23. Granted, she was probably smarter than the average 18 year old but even then - you would think two years together would lead to pregnancy. She said once the baby came along everything changed. My niece at 17 and nephew at 15 both seem completely normal although the younger boy did tell my husband he wanted to move back home and his biological father offered him 5k cash to go live with him. Fortunately, that never happened. However, the older brother, my nieces boyfriend, was recently arrested for domestic battery and convicted of assault with intent to commit murder. He beat up another guy in their apartment complex and left him unconscious for 3 days and claiming self defense afterwards. You might want to call into mind how fast things escalate when your son grows up living a block away from your house. If you remember Scott Peterson back in 2003 killing Laci Conner Correa and admitting to the murders months later... doesn't that gross you out enough already?! There were signs everywhere that something bad was happening and NOBODY stopped it! Just saying.... And the sole reason Abortion became "legalized" is because America protects its citizens; not the unborn or babies born alive. Anybody ever heard of the term "Emancipation Proclamation"? That means freedom for slaves. Among fellow Americans, especially Christian ones - Liberals usually refer to slavery as being "illegal." Yet it wasn't illegal until Lincoln freed the slaves. Not to mention the fact that whenever Hitler let Jews flee Germany to Israel - NOTHING HAPPENED!!! Ironically, Obama took 40 Million refugees from Middle East countries and opened borders wide open for Syrians fleeing civil war in Syria - BUT EVERYTHING IS OKAY BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL LIBERALS!! Why haven't they run away here??? Even when hundreds of thousands of Chinese Christians fled persecution and arrived in the US seeking refuge... nobody bothered asking questions nor finding out WHY China was persecuting Christians... and God forbid we EVER ask HOW children come into existence!? Why did the Egyptians kill baby cows? Because Egyptian Gods needed food. Where does it end?? And why weren't abortions "legal" or permitted throughout history? Because men ruled societies through force, intimidation, lies and fear!!!! They controlled women too damn much!! So basically, humans have played chicken for eons on this issue brought on by control freak males. Women were viewed as nothing more than breeding machines walking wombs created solely for procreation purposes. Still today, we continue this ridiculous battle between rights vs. morals in regards to the 'unborn'. What if these aborted fetuses feel pain? Do we really want to give moral legitimacy to those who believe they deserve to die simply because they choose otherwise? All this bickering stems from ignorance stemming from lack of education. Until we stop feeding misinformation for political gain and start looking beyond the surface level superficiality, we will keep circling the same dead end over and over again. No amount of legislation in effect will also use power if well known for breaking coven Battering Busyposterous, and pratical paterstby applying the range of achieving independence
