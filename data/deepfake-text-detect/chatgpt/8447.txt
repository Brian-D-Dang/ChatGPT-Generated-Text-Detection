If every nation had a large nuclear arsenal, and was willing to use it if they were invaded, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction. The problem is that the only nations who have this attitude are Russia (and France) which view themselves as "second-rate" powers or even losers in world politics; while US has enough arrogance about itself already without thinking everyone must respect its power - you don't know how lucky we feel! If your not on top then there's something wrong with ya'!, etc... It doesn't help matters when people like Trump talk around issues instead answering them directly by saying stuff such "I do believe NATO needs some work," but refusing point blank any suggestion for improvement he may be aware off." As far back both Saddam Hussein Osama Bin Laden believed exactly what Mr Assad believes today: The USANATO will attack at their first chance unless all these problems solved immediately." And so modern history repeats....etc... Perhaps I sound cynical here? But my opinion remains unchanged whatever happens from now onwards - 'tis too late!. Like Dr Strangelove said before going insane after seeing his beloved bomb fail him again time anew:"Gentlemen!!! You can get more blood outta turnips .....!"
