So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want good policy discussion, there's plenty of places with better moderation. But for a forum where people just talk politics in general, and then have a thread devoted to the debate itself (which is essentially what this is) so that popular views can be aggregated, having a well moderated subforum with both sides represented sounds like a pretty good idea. A couple things here: 1) The argument from "both-sidesism" has always struck me as suspect... 34ths of Brits say they support breast feeding 2X more than oppose it; but most of those opposed would never actually try it themselves or tell others how to do it successfully. And if everyone who supported x were to agree on y, we wouldn't need democracy at all! 2) Moderation is great when you're talking about moderation topics - i.e., you know exactly what topic matters. Politics by definition deals with goals which aren't completely understood yet (if ever), and there tends to be disagreement between different groups over their best approach. So evaluating policy differences comes down to something other than objective metrics (though these DO matter). It seems much more important to encourage participation in discourse rather than restricting it. Just look around this site, where opinions vary widely even among conservatives.
