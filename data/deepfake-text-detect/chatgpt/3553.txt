As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a difficult decision to make. However, it is important to remember that every life is valuable and every effort should be made to provide the best possible care for the child. It is a challenging ethical dilemma that requires input from medical professionals, family members, and society as a whole. Ultimately, the decision should be based on what is considered the most compassionate and appropriate path for the child and their family. It may also be important to consider the potential impact on future healthcare decisions and access for other members of society. As an assistant, I am here to provide information and support in navigating these difficult and sensitive issues.
