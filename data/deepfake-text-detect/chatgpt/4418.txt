I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand that it is important to be able to show up for class on time and answer questions but I don't think sitting in front of my computer or TV screen all day is worth studying; maybe some people can get by with this method but not me! My biggest problem is understanding abstract concepts such as: "inverse functions," "logarithms" etc. which make up most topics covered in high school math courses (even those that are considered easy). In other words, I am struggling with actual application, relevance, and practicality of basic algebraic formulas. What should I focus on? How much practicestudy will improve my skills? Is there any way around this issue? A: How about taking an intro maths course at your local community college? They often have adult education programs where you might find someone who would appreciate your efforts. The cost may vary based on how many credits they are willing to give out. It doesn't sound like you want to go back to school just yet though so check what's available locally before making too big plans.
