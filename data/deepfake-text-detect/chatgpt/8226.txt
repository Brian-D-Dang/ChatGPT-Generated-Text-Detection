1. Squatting is more comfortable, easier and healthier than sitting. it creates less stress on the the puborectalis muscle allowing for a smoother uninterrupted experience. it plays well with gravity as we all know if you are not standing in an altered position that your body will try to return back into its normal erect state by moving towards what feels correct (gravity) 2-It allows us access deeper within our pelvic floor muscles when compared doing Kegel exercises from kneeling or lying down positions versus squating which can be done at any time of day without having additional equipment available (squats only require something around 2 feet high). I like squating because there isn't much space constraint; i just do them anywhere across my house while watching TVmovies etc.. whenever - Its hands free! Also, anytime im half asleep walking up stairs ill think "oh no Im going too fast" but then realize how silly this thought was lol...just kidding:) haha soo funny now remembering myself thinking such thoughts about exercising....
