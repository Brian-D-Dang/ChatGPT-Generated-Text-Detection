Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from youth level). This means that in every game we play against other clubsteams there are fights between players and sometimes even coaches being involved. If you watch any games these days everyone is fighting for fouls all over the place trying their best to win the ball back or score goals (most of them end with blood on each others' faces though), so why do referees still allow it? Do they have some sort of special training course which allows them differentiate between when someone goes down really easy because he was fouled versus going down easily just out of his own will? Or maybe does refereeing require an IQ high enough for this!? So, if you were put at the edge of the field would you call all those penalties given by refs everywhere else around the world during the match too? Would you also give red cards and send off opponents who try hard to stop one another from scoring?! Surely no! So why should football be different!? I know it sounds crazy reasoning behind my post but i don't think anyone needs more violence among kids especially considering how many parents neglect their children already...
