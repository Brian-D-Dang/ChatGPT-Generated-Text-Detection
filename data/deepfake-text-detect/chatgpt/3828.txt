Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a proxy war for China's interests in the region. If you look at the map of America and China right now, they're on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean. In other words, they've been playing with each other long enough that if either side wanted to throw down, it could be done quickly with little risk to themselves. This, however, isn't true as much anymore. Remember when I said China has shown signs of wanting peace? That's not an exaggeration - Beijing actively seeks its neighbors' approval to try and get influence over them. From Tibet to Taiwan to the Spratly Islands, there are several areas where Chinese actions greatly benefit from friendly relationships. We all have our differences over some issues (such as politics), but this sort of behavior would probably never happen under any other government. The reason why I bring up these examples is because things are changing, though slowly. And, unfortunately, we seem like the ones who are losing ground in those changes. So maybe we should stop blaming America for everything that happens here, and start looking within ourselves. It may sound harsh, but if we truly want change, then we need to find ways to build a more peaceful world instead of relying upon others to make us change. Cheers! Bongkong, my fellow Thai redditor, thanks so much for your input! It really means quite a lot to me.
