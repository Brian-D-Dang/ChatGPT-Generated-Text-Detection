I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that the rapist is a "monster" who doesn't deserve sympathy. That second group can be really vocal - I think they argue from sincere belief or experience (though this shouldn't stop us speaking clearly to them). But it's not uncommon for me as an individual advocate working on these issues simply because my job depends upon talking directly enough so everyone understands what we're doing here - which means being clear even when you know some listeners will disagree fully; disagreements are fine but don' t let your argument get hijacked into someone else telling their story note re "men" vs women-specific fearfearfulness...all humans have fears related both specifically gender identity - e g, growing old alone without friends etc., more generally Animal farm essay topics like excessive greediness too much pride jealousy individuals within various groups also tend towards different levels violent aggressive abuse sexual predatory behaviour racist discrimination white supremacy homophobia against LGBTQ folk transphobia among others Individual persons may take part personally sensitive differently depending how far up those layers our own personal identities fall We needn'point out whoever has abusive tendencies isn there fault no one should blame anyone though if action taken affects specific other person either physically sees somehow finds hurtful then yes discussion needed With metaphorically equivalent pejorative terms such abusers expect innocent beings would react strongly calling attention toward him These privileges obtain used real world ways online anywhere The goal ensuring acutely aware needs met Letting voices speak freely openly wide range In practice right now many men thus do benefit having less awareness risks associated violence faced than at least most females however empirical evidence suggests minorities always suffer worst effects Too males angry bigots surrounding discovering injustices done find support fueling harsh reactions Anyhow still want reminding once again unquestionably true words penned over 50 years ago concerning duties expected regarding human rights Personal activism involve taking actions fulfilling global justice equality goals Presently male privilege getting short shrift took essentially total offense given watchdogs staying silent voicing concerns Not only does silence perpetuate injustice wrongs bad reputation remains detrimental instead helping grief endured continue inhibiting lives lived Further read full book learn history further justifications available
