So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion. The most effective way of making a good case would be by focusing on one player and showing that their gameplay has been ruined due to another players gms (or other) actions or lack thereof. The problem here is that you are telling people who want no more game mechanics from Riot how they should play League like reds vs blues with just an example of "This guy plays on his own team."There's nothing wrong with playing solo queue as long as it doesn't ruin your gameplay when you're having fun! It's really simple: if you don't enjoy something about what someone else does while you're playing, then leave them behind because that's part of the experience and the only thing that matters at the end. Not everyone wants to follow someone around the entire time. You can have different priorities during matches; you may even try to avoid going head to head against certain opponents depending on match-ups. Asking others to conform to your own personal style will get you very little love; fans generally respect those who adapt to their audience instead of trying to change meet expectations all together. If there was anything deserving of a ban, it would already be gone since there's no point in banning things that don't do any harm. So yeah, let's focus less on what can go better for us all instead of always pointing fingers towards each other so we'll feel better about ourselves. Instead of taking everything personally, perhaps work harder to accept that sometimes other people aren't doing what you think they ought to be right now. Just cool off before being offended I agree wholeheartedly. Being exposed to the opinions of others helps me grow as a person and improve my own mindsetgameplay. But this isn't possible unless the meta changes or new items come out. In basketball I could just sit back observe until my shot went up high (even though I didn't know why), but in LoL video games require constant adaptation, which means watching videos, reading forums, discussing strategies etc... and that takes effort and dedication for many players. That said, I'm still happy to learn new things every day and am willing to take criticism, suggestions and help. However, I'm also wary of being abused too much by trolls or people who use social media such as twitter youtube to purposely make life difficult for competitive players. This applies especially to tournaments where multiple teams are involved and schedules mean that everyone must communicate between themselves regarding strategy tactics. As far as I understand it, what you suggest leads to developing bad habits and discouraging community participation. Which is fine, I guess, but some groups of people insist on having absolute control over others' lives (which, ironically enough, usually includes the option to kill). Ultimately, asking the group to give up on some aspect of its identity because "it might conflict with theirs" feels anti-social to me. Even worse than simply ignoring the minority opinion. In fact, looking through reddit today, the top posts seem to involve creators crossing paths with viewers and expanding upon their respective communities rather than maintaining distance or ignoring eachother completely. Personally speaking i've found that giving up gaming culture and adopting a western lifestyle is actually detrimental to my mental well-being. For instance, in Sweden, playing computer games requires constant streaming services otherwise you might find yourself without internet access forever. My family, friends and colleagues wouldn't be able to contact me anymore; thus leading to poor communication and isolation. You could say that's an extreme situation, however it's becoming increasingly common nowadays and it saddens me greatly. My issue with banning is that it basically says nonstop harassment works. Why exactly? Because...because...well because we won't hear anyone complaining about someone nuking rooms consistently, or constantly bullying them through chat unless we say he gets banned. And honestly, i'd prefer to have the troll himself removed first. He seems like a clear danger to our shared enjoyment of these boards. But yes, no matter the reason, i apologise for my tone last night. Obviously, i meant it sarcastically. Things got intense quickly after that comment. Also sorry for using language that wasn't appropriate for an innocent question. Maybe later i'll edit that post if necessary Thanks for listening. No worries man, I definitely appreciate the feedback. What happened was that the thread started to devolve into passive aggressive drama when you mentioned Lulu. People immediately turned the conversation into arguing whether she should be allowed to continue in ranked lol instead of talking about your OP. That made me wonder wtf were you saying originally. Honestly, I believe the original intent of the OP was pretty reasonable, and I wanted to see how others felt on the subject so I responded accordingly. Unfortunately, people decided to digress and keep digging holes. Overall it came across poorly for sure, whatever intended meaning I perceived was lost. And indeed it looks true value tag-measured value being measured value. Value imply, but appears value start, change begins values bit begin s off their starts
