Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to listen to anyone's opinion on this matter." Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of Murdoch Publishing Group said, "I am afraid you are mistaken if you think that this is the best way forward for LGBT people in Australia." "We need to stand together against discrimination," he added. "Australians deserve better than xenophobia and intolerance propelled by hateful propaganda being spread through our media due to a lack of respect towards LGBTIQ Australians including non-whites - especially when the message has been well received across all demographics regardless of their gender identities being ignored because we're trying to keep Australian culture alive."
