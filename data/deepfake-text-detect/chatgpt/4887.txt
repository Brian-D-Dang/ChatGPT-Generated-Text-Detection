Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one person is more sexually attracted to another than they are interested in them? I'm a guy who's been dating this woman casually off and on since we were 17 years old she was 19 at that time (she just turned 22). We got together somewhat early because her parents didn't support their daughter having relationships until she was 21 but soon discovered our attraction grew with age and love over time. She has told me from day 1 that she loves my personality as much if not more than anything else about me so it doesn't seem like she would ever leave me. But lately something started happening where all of sudden, whether we're hanging out or doing things alone together, she starts pulling away even though nothing's changed physically except maybe an extra 5 pounds gained here or there and some wrinkles around her eyes. At first I thought it might be a small argumentfight between us but then all of a sudden she wanted nothing further to do with me. When I try talking to her she says "it's okay" or acts happy but really can't explain why, and seems angry most times; which makes sense considering how emotionally invested she is into everything. She tells me repeatedly that I make her feel good and gives almost every quality reason as to why she likes me such as "you care enough about others" etc... so whatever happened must have taken place during the past 2 months. I've had suspicions of cheating throughout and found little evidence to back up that claim, until recently. A few weeks ago she finally admitted that SHE'S sleeping with someone else! How could i possibly react to this?? If this sounds familiar to you please tell me what to do now!! My girlfriend needs help badly!!! AnswerHello, og....This is quite a predicament - you need to get your head straightened out. Your GF is in deep trouble and should probably start thinking logically. Firstly, let's look at the facts. According to you, she disclosed herself and confessed that she sleeps around only with other men. For sure she is lying. Unless there is physical proof of infidelity, he wont believe his ears. In fact, if she's confessing to him without a shred of evidence in hand, he will rightfully assume she is lying through her teeth, ie., lies often and frequently to cover up various indiscretions and cheating episodes. It means she's a liar by nature and therefore dishonest. Secondly, since all these confessions came after two significant arguments when the subject of relationship breakdown came up yet again, I suspect both parties may want to salvage themselves of any course stemming to a breakup. Even though you confessedly broke up with her when you realised of what kind of character she is, you now think she tried to bail herself out and atone for previous wrongdoings. And once she is done convincing you to forgive her sins, she'll also attempt to win the heart of your mate under yours thus leading to a set-up. This automatically puts YOU into second position behind her lover whom she prefers. So instead of going the distance, you gave in and accepted her version of truth for easier living and saved yourself from possible emotional distress. Thirdly, yes, you have strong feelings towards each other due to many years spent together. However, if you haven't seen signs of infidelity nor did you come across circumstantial evidences telling otherwise, then chances are fairly high that she cheated on you. That will affect you greatly especially if you consider marriage ahead. Get rid of her ASAP before you and you are both seriously hurt. Finally, don't give too much weight into logic. Logic doesn't work in relationships. You will always fail when dealing with emotions. People lie, people cheat. The best thing you can do now is move forward while keeping a stronger hold onto your own identity, values and principles. Don't allow strangers to influence your future decisions. You know exactly who you are and who she is. Find ways on how to deal with her dishonesty. Accept the consequences of her actions. Also, pray everyday for guidance, strength and wisdom. Pray that God brings peace into your life, removes self doubt, triumphs over weakness of faith and fills you with His blessings. Do what He asks for. Trust Him completely and follow His commands diligently. Then you won't face problems later. Just keep praying slowly noticing positive results as you proceed. Show mercy upon her. By forgiving her does not mean forgetting about what she did against you. Rather, treat her kindly knowing you can never trust her again. Let go of anger and bitterness. Let go of prideful thoughts. Be humble in order to receive forgiveness from a brokenhearted enemy. Ask prayer warriors near you to lift heavy burdens from you. Always seek advice from those who have gone through this ordeal already. Allow the words spoken to you today speak volumes for tomorrow's circumstances to take effect.
