I've lived practically my whole life on this phrase. It has shaped how I have made several important decisions in my life, though I have recently come to suspect that it is not the best way of looking at things." "SPOILER ALERT!" came a voice from behind her and she turned around to find it was Jack. "I thought we were having dinner?" He asked as he pulled out his chair across from her. "What happened to all-night dining? Did you give up or something?" He looked down irritatedly, but his look softened immediately when she glanced over at him one more time before turning back toward her plate filled with food. His expression changed instantly into one of complete surprise and excitement. She wasn't sure what had prompted such an impulsive response. She smiled at him again trying hard to keep a straight face while inwardly rolling her eyes, not wanting to think about what could be coming next. After another few minutes of silence they finally broke their silence by ordering more drinks. Sipping her water nervously, she watched Jack's drink grow colder and wondered if she should order wine. The waitress then appeared in front of them smiling brightly at both of them as she placed two glasses beside each other. She took both cups and walked away leaving them alone once again. As soon as the door closed behind her, Tricia leaned forward and whispered quickly in Jack's ear; she wanted to tell him everything. Was this really happening? Waswas everyone here for real now? Ok so maybe she felt like a little kid seeing Santa Claus for the first time...but seriously?! But there was no going back after tonight...she needed to know. Jack reached over to clasp her hands tightly in his own and gently pushed her against the counter. As much as he hated being touched right now, if this fell through, he didn't want to live with himself knowing that he'd never told anyone who mattered most about what was wrong with her. Tearing his gaze off hers, he spoke softly into her ears. "Tricia!" He said urgently pulling her hand tight. "This isn't me asking your forgiveness because I'm scared that you won't forgive me...it's because I love you. You're always been there for me even when no one else would let me go see a doctor without the fear that someone would talk. And even when people raised questions about why I hadn't seen Dr. Kelly yet....you stood strong by side of me until I knew I couldn't hide anymore. So when a chance presents itself for us to stand together and fight for what really matters - our family - don't hesitate...tell me everything you need to tell me" He sat back in his chair and stared intently into her dark brown eyes before leaning closer and placing gentle kisses along her neck line. Her stomach clenched painfully thinking about simply touching himletting herself get all mushy insideand feeling his lips brush against her skin just sent tingles spreading throughout every single part of her body. He slowly removed his mouth from hers resting his forehead against top rim of her glass. With trembling fingers she picked up her second wino ever (though probably last) and drank half of it down while pouting slightly. Scooping up her empty glass she held it in her lap facing Jack still sitting directly across from her. With her index finger she traced a pattern along the edge of his glass leaving a trail of frost where it stopped and starting at the bottom of the glass. Slowly lowering her head back towards her table she brought her face level with his. "Thank God you are actually listening to me," she hissed between gritted teeth. "Because...well....I guesswe will....." She paused putting her foot propped up on her other leg crossing her arms underneath her chest. She tilted her head up looking at him questioningly waiting patiently for him to speak. He chuckled lightly hoping that whatever she planned was worth waiting for. Instead her face got serious all of a sudden as she continued staring up at him. "Truly. We can make any decision we choose now. It might seem scary to start fresh...to take the risk of telling others you aren't completely healthy enough to deal with a newborn child during this critical period...But honestly...my mind hasn't started playing tricks on me like yours did last night..." He ran his thumb along the smooth scar running diagonally across her cheekbone stopping dead short of the small indentation left by old Henry's shank. "That is why these past couple weeks haven't been too bad. I feel free to explore new opportunities - ones which I may have missed out on due to those fears of mine. Now what do you say? Isn't it time we faced reality instead of hiding from it, and chose happiness above anything else?" He lifted his brows questioning her motives further. Tricia bit down on her lip giving him and!
