First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that prisons themselves tend to be run by corporate interests rather than being moral institutions dedicated to rehabilitation. And how would you address this problem?
