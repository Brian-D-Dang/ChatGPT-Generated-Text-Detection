Disclaimer: this talk of secession may not be present everywhere in the United States, but it is more than prevalent where I live, so I'm going off that. To me, at least! I don't think there's any need to go into detail about why we should secede - just look up these words and you'll get a good idea. There are other reasons too; for example, like Germany having its own currency - or even Switzerland doing likewise. But what does all of this have to do with Linux? Well, one way things could actually happen (and if they did, then perhaps everything would change) is by seceding from Debian, which has been around far longer than most people realize. If that were ever to occur, everyone on the Internet would suddenly switch operating systems overnight. That might make us "more powerful," but it would also mean we'd lose pretty much every connection we've built over time. For most users who aren't super techy, this probably wouldn't matter much, though. It's only a problem for those of us who use computers as our primary means of interacting online because the infrastructure we're used to now doesn't exist anymore. Almost every siteservice we have come to rely upon isn't available anywhere else, except maybe for when it was "officially" shut down, such as AOL or Geocities. We shouldn't forget that many software companies are located here in North America - places like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Valve etc., along with others that operate internationally. So parting ways and becoming independent once again really will impact all of us due to the interdependency of technology and society today - especially given how integral computing is to nearly everything we do. The consequences could reach beyond the borders of the United States - indeed, some already have. But ultimately, it boils down to an issue of control versus ownership. This concept of self-governance is similar to what Thomas Jefferson had in mind when he said, "When Governments fear the People, there is Liberty." Truthfully speaking, many countries didn't survive long periods of independence without making concessions; however, so far, none of them have declared themselves sovereign states since 1776. In fact, my country hasn't yet sought to become one either. As it turns out, Canada ended up being far less successful at maintaining independence, then I thought they would be... So while the spirit of liberty remains alive throughout Western Civilization, it appears we haven't seen much progress towards freedom through true democracy. Perhaps we can take something away from history after all: sometimes the truth hurts. Besides, it seemed worth taking a few minutes to explain why we still encourage separation. Whether you agree or disagree that such action is desirable depends entirely on your point of view. Negative reactions include a lot of "what about NAFTA?," "who cares?" and basically anything you care to throw out there. Positive responses usually involve statements like, "wouldn't that suck!," "good riddence!" and variations thereof. Regardless of your opinion, whatever happens will likely affect both sides differently. Since everybody likes to feel important, let's hope nothing bad happens.
