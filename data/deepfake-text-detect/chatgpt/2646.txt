I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. And college costs will only continue to go up unless there's a change in policy on this front. Have you ever considered community college? It's usually cheaper and if you have your bachelors degree from it then transfer that over to a better school for free or substantially reduced tuition.
