I think its fair to say that most people dont give a single shit about morality unless they're driven by compassion"their conscience" or worried about being judged by others for their actions. It is not technically possible for humans, at any level of civilization and technology, in which the majority did what was right simply because it meant doing something good without any personal gain from doing so (ie altruism). That's how you end up with all these ridiculous animal rights activists who don't care when spiders get killed but are outraged if another human gets beheaded on Facebook live.
