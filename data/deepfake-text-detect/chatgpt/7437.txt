While it is true that many ethical frameworks consider both eating meat and having sex with animals to be morally problematic, there are important differences between these two acts that require different ethical considerations. For example, the production and consumption of meat can be done in a way that minimizes harm to animals and the environment, whereas having sex with animals is inherently exploitative and harmful to the animal involved. Additionally, there are important legal and cultural considerations that make it clear why sexual contact with animals is not permissible, whereas the ethical considerations surrounding meat consumption are more complex and contested. Therefore, while one may consider both of these actions to be morally problematic, it is not accurate to suggest that there is no moral framework in which they can be distinguished and evaluated separately.
