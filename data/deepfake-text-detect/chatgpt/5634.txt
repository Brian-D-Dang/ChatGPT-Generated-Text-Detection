I'm a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find sillytrivial. I'm currently dating a girl who is a feminist. Not all of her views are in line with mine, but she is open to hearing my views and I am open to hearing hers. We both feel that we should be treated equally, but different. Feminism has achieved a good deal of what it set out to do. Women now have access to things that would be considered "men only" things. This is good because it gave a voice to those who would otherwise not have one. It gave women the right to make choices that may be right or wrong for them, but at least they are free to make those choices. It gave women more power and helped them become equal to men in many ways. That said, it has gone too far in my opinion.
