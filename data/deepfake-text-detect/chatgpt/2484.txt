Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on that later). My opinions are not based off the idea of 'white privilege' or any other such nonsense which goes against traditional conservative ideology. Also was curious about what people think so far with this sub-reddit:) You sound like you're ancap as fuck man - well done
