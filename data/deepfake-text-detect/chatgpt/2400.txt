First of all, I want to first express how happy I am with this subreddit. It has always been a hub for civilized discussion on complicated and difficult topics. I hope that this will continue but as mods we have the responsibility not just ensure quality content is posted here but also remove anything toxic or inappropriate (in my opinion). That being said: We are taking steps in making sure there's no censorship going forward. All ideas would be welcome. Blindly following upvotesdownvotes won't work anymore since it creates an echo chamber effect which isn't healthy either.
