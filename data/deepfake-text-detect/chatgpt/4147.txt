Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. You say you listen to rap but the first thing I think about when someone says that they like rap is someone who just raps out of nothing and has no 2nd thoughts I agree with this 100 But i wouldn't go as far as to call them unoriginal Well if you have an original idea there's probably something wrong with it.
