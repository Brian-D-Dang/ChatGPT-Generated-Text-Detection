Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and is somehow allowed to teach our children in public schools. Person B also lives in the US and was also born here. He is not a citizen, but has been here illegally for 10 years. He is married to a US citizen. Person C has been living here for 30 years, but was born in Canada. He's been here legally, working and paying taxes. He has a green card. Person C can be deported. Person B can be deported. Person A should be fired, and can be deported. Person A should be fired, but cannot be deported. Person B should be fired, but cannot be deported. If we do not allow this, why should we let anyone else in? It's too bad that we have to be at odds with so many people. We have been able to establish a relationship with the family of one of our sons because they are coming to visit in a couple of weeks and are actually coming to stay in our home for a few days. It's always nice to be able to establish a relationship with someone you might have to fight for in the future, but it's too bad that I have to spend so much of my time worrying about our country. Jessica and I have been married for 19 years and we have three children, ages 19, 17, and 12. They are all in school. We have a small circle of friends that we hang out with. I have a job that I have held for 18 years. Jessica does not work outside the home, but does help out with the kids and the house. Our oldest daughter is a freshman at a local college. She is on the honor role and is in the Honor Society. She is on the Dean's List and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa last week. Our middle daughter is a junior at the same local college. She is on the honor roll and is in the Honor Society. She is on the Dean's List and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa last week. Our youngest son is a sophomore in high school. He is on the honor roll and is in the National Honor Society. Between the two of us, we have 6 degrees. Our kids have a combined total of 12 years of higher education, and will have 14 between the two of them. We have two cars and one motorcycle. We have a 3-bedroom house that we have lived in for 15 years, and the only debt we have is a mortgage that we have been paying for 18 years. So, what makes me a racist? Why should I be looked at as a bigot because of the color of my skin? Why should I be considered a fool because of my religion? What makes me so dangerous to our country? Because I happen to be white, Christian, and conservative? Sorry, but it makes no sense to me. I love my country. I love my family. I love my friends. I love my neighbors. I don't hate anyone. I don't hate blacks, or Hispanics, or Jews, or Muslims, or Asians, or any other race. I don't hate homosexuals, or transgender people, or anyone that has a different lifestyle than mine. I don't hate liberals, or Democrats, or anyone else that I may disagree with. But I do hate what's happening to my country. I hate the hypocrisy of our "leaders." I hate the fact that we are not being represented in Congress. I hate the fact that I have to pay taxes to fund this government and the illegal actions of the ones in power. I hate the fact that we are no longer a "land of the free, and a home of the brave," but rather a nation of "victims." I hate the fact that we're no longer considered a Christian nation. I hate the fact that we are not allowed to say the words "Merry Christmas." I hate the fact that we are not allowed to pray in public schools.

I hate the fact that our military personnel are no longer honored and respected. I hate the fact that our President can
