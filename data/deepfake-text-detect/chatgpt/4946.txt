I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the rankings. It certainly doesn't seem very popular among readers outside of Japan as well (and I have no idea where they are from). That is because Spirited Away was released on DVD recently and since it's not a classic anime series like Girl A has been younger than Sailor Moon (which is probably why it usually gets less attention compared with Sailor Moon.)
