With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned as an actual social network, most of its users were white males but now they want to be like Tumblr and just let everyone in regardless of their identity or what they do for a living. It's kinda funny how reddit has become more liberal than tumblr ever was about gender representation (or lack thereof). It used to have a lot of frat bros who probably couldn't get laid by women unless they wore shirts referencing Star Trek; now it has fat feminists and sjws talking shit about how "oppressed" men are at every opportunity possible
