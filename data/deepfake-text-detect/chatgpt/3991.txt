[This article] does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article] that lays out an argument against why the statuses are more complicated than they appear on the surface (and the author is not convinced). I can tell you where to start in looking at these numbers, but I'd like to know what level of data you have access to and whether it's possible to do a similar analysis with just your own experience?
