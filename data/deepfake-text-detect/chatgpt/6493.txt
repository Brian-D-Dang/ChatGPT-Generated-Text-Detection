I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. I have not read the whole LiebeckMcDonald's case in detail and have read it over and over. Anyone who has read through the details, does not understand how it was the fault of McDonald's.
