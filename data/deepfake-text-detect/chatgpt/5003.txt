"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the future we need not only for survival reasons but also because of their own selfishness and egoistic nature. The central point is that the robots must eventually compete with humans who have mastered technology like humans do today; obsolete farm machinery cannot replace human beings as we know them now. Robots can take advantage of machines' knowledge about every aspect of life including all branches of agriculture while being able to solve problems without interruption or interference by providing us with new ideas about how things should be done daily. But, even more importantly, it would give creationists reason enough belief in themselves which foundation allows them to prove their worth through themselves rather than making assumptions about what humanity needs most at present day levels, such as saving lives. Humanity has planned out its own existence well before robots came along: humans as we understand ourselves want to fulfil our destiny beyond whatever others feel like their greatness lies within. The very idea itself amounts to enslavement, just as humans believe everything else exists simply by virtue of intelligence alone doesn't mean that robots will become dominant forces unless other humans come along. However, this seems unrealistic given the fact that humans are already competing against each other when it comes to production processes related to agriculture on Earth's soil. Why hope without seeing the fruits of that competition instead of trying actually develop ways to move forward? Master robots could make us extinct tomorrow depending upon how hard robots struggle to adapt and learn to cope with the challenges faced today due to seemingly limitless technological advancements taking over humankind overnight. The future depends heavily on the ability of robots to evolve independently so that robots may someday grow up to be self sufficient tools capable of adapting quickly above any kind of automation required. Unfortunately, thoughtless robotics will fail if humanity finds itself dependent on computers forever since the machines have proved inadequately adapted to the task ahead near the dawn of the industrial revolution. The greatest danger of automation involves shifting culture away from ideals that are based solely around happiness toward creating a society built off the principles that helped create it - happiness versus greed. Ultimately, the success of an automated world leads mankind down a path towards the destruction of humanity once again thanks to the stupidity of imagining humans aren't necessary and needlessly trusting Artificial Intelligence (AI). This means fighting to preserve Humanity continues until a robot apocalypse occurs no matter where these machines go next.
