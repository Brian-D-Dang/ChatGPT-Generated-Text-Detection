EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one reason that the University has such strong vocation is because it provides very little support for women (besides probably having fewer men in it). I also agree with you on the point about the lack of funding, as well. It seems like women can suffer greatly from low wages and unpaying jobs if they are seeking a better life; nor do most people get paid less than 10 of their income when they graduate, which just sounds insane given the circumstances. It's not at all clear why this isn't the case, or for how long these things have been going on. Just recently I saw an article saying that Harvard University should provide some more funding so that female students are able to take part in sports programs for free. And this would allow male students to compete against females while still earning 1,000 per year. This might seem extreme to say the least, but what if we had gone down the same road? There was a lot of research conducted by female researchers who found that some of their greatest successes were due to attracting male scholars. If there really was a good chance that female academics could be successful in their current careers and don't work a job that makes them feel uncomfortable - well then maybe they are doing something right! A great piece and an interesting discussion. It needs more context though. As far as the ability to do this via social media or any other means, it doesn't make sense that there aren't any (or none) metrics available to measure the success of women in academia. We need a much higher standard to measure women's academic achievements, especially because many top universities can't even get a proper statistic for women. You'd already see that under very narrow conditions, where there is no standardized measurement. So what kind of metrics does it take to judge whether a woman has accomplished anything or is merely getting started and putting herself out there? A useful framework: an "assessment tool" that measures the quality of her work and is often repeated to help determine the competence of the person she is working with. For example, if a woman works for a decent amount of money, she will find that she is actually much smarter or more competent than the average undergraduate. Perhaps this is a form of scoring, rather than focusing entirely on measurable factors. But is it really vital enough that women have various professional qualifications off the table? That being said, women have become extremely valuable business agents, so it's important to consider these measures carefully before investing your time in assessing the quality of someone else's work. The only thing keeping me away from a computer screen is having to scan through endless files to find each piece that says "This item belongs in our directory." That being said, I've always enjoyed curating this sort of data, and was looking forward to reading the review to hear about what others thought of it. In any event, thanks for sharing your thoughts!
