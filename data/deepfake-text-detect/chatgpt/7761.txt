There are several counter-arguments to refute the opinion that gender identity should be solely based on genitals and hormones. Firstly, gender identity is a complex and deeply personal experience that can vary from person to person. It is not an objective or easily quantifiable trait that can be solely determined by one's physical characteristics. Additionally, gender is a social construct that is influenced by various cultural, historical, and political factors. This means that gender identity is not solely determined by biology, but is also shaped by the society and environment one grows up in. Furthermore, there are many individuals who do not fit into a strict, binary understanding of gender. For example, intersex individuals may be born with ambiguous genitalia, and may not identify as exclusively male or female. Additionally, transgender individuals may experience gender dysphoria - a condition where their gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth - which cannot be simply explained by their physical characteristics or hormone levels. In conclusion, gender identity is a complex and multifaceted aspect of an individual's identity, which cannot be solely determined by one's physical characteristics.
