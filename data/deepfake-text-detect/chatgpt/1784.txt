Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between the rich and poor. But how can you be sure that it will work? There have been many failed experiments throughout human history proving this otherwise! Rational people use their heads to think for themselves on these issues so I choose not to take them at face value but instead look into what's going on behind the scenes of our government as well as what has happened with other governments around the globe who have implemented similar ideals. In short; socialism works if: (1) The people involved want to succeed or achieve something together. And (2) It doesn't involve a dictator running things. It's important to note here - Socialism isn't communism which is a form of Communism mixed with totalitarianism while Social Democracy is also Socialism but without any strict dictatorship. All three different forms of Socialism were tried by countries in various times across time periods and none ended up being successful. This could possibly explain why most people don't even know they exist until now when we're finally seeing more of such ideologies get proposed like America's "Bernie" Sanders' Presidential campaign recently. A political system in which each person owns a share of the economy through direct ownership of land means a country must guarantee fair wages and minimum living standards for all citizens regardless of education level, income levels, etc... These aren't easy goals nor do they ever come easily, especially because inequalities within society tend to cause conflict among individuals and groups. Some argue that democracy fails due to having too much inequality thus weakening democratic decision making power hence they seemingly back away from attempting any type of change in order to preserve some sense of stability within popular opinionpolitical systems. So, what does that mean exactly? For example, if politicians attempt to make laws that benefit just one group over another then eventually sections of the population begin fighting amongst themselves resulting in chaos leading to riots and unrest. Once again, this is simply something that might happen in certain places depending where the inequality lies along socio-economic lines. However, every country goes through major changes during development stages therefore usually only about 1 of those brought forth to new life regimes become fully stable before revolutionary movements arise against tyranny or despotism thereby creating instability. Therefore, determining whether an economic system is socialism depends on whether it creates social equality which leads us directly to question number two, namely Israel vs Palestine!! As far as Israel vs Palestinians go though, it seems clear cut since Israel came first followed closely by Palestine. What's interesting enough however, was that both nations had socialist ideals long before becoming independent states yet did not implement true socialism. Instead, they began implementing capitalist principles using the rhetoric of socialism under communist influence and control by third parties which led to failure after failure. One nation's failure only serves to prove that no matter how "idealistic" someone's ideology may seem plus whoever comes alongside of holding the reins of state authority ends up failing miserably anyway. Not to mention wealth is created by private companies whose sole focus is profit maximizing resulting once again onto greater inequality. Lastly, there are numerous examples of capitalism working smoothly with limited inequality although they still fail to provide adequate security or democratization. The best case scenario occurs during societies that have free access to trade goods and services either domestically or globally meaning leaders are elected via either voting or protest versus someone dictating terms based solely off violence alone i.e Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan ruling parts of Asia, Taliban governing Afghanistan ...I digress.... Maybe my point is just duller than usual today.. but whatever As far as genuine Socialist economies are concerned, Venezuela certainly qualifies according to a recent report released by "The Economist." According to the study, "the worst recorded collapse in living standards anywhere in modern history," the Venezuelan average citizen consumes almost 40 percent less per capita GDP annually compared to Brazilians despite logging lower inflation rates year after year. These numbers clearly show extreme poverty compared to Latin American neighbors with their own notable problems including corruption, low literacy rate, high unemployment, crimes committed overwhelmingly against women, inadequate health care facilities, lack of infrastructure, insufficient public transportation, militarized borders lacking proper controls safety nets, widespread food shortages causing thousands dying, rampant hunger, environmental disaster caused mainly by government negligence. While Venezuela's current president Nicholas Maduro continues his reign of tyranny corrupting the country drastically, he hasn't done nearly as bad as what happened in Soviet Russia where millions died daily due to starvation rather than President Joseph Stalin enacting policies leaving hungry masses starving, freezing, sick diseased lasting longer days in winter weather eating raw animal skin blood or burning bodies alive while pregnant women were forced to eat flesh out of corpses! It sounds incredibly unthinkable in 21st century United States let alone in the middle east considering the amount of money allegedly invested in keeping Americans healthy. An estimated 3 million Venezuelans left the country during 2017 while approximately 4 million refugees currently reside abroad unable to feed their families forcing tens national enand - decreased recreational freedom! down bus hard of was should be, B., B.
