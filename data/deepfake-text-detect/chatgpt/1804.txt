I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This doesn't mean I'm going to line up behind him in November though, since it's too early anyway O'Malley supports Black Lives Matter... edit: woops just saw you said black lives matter at first sorry
