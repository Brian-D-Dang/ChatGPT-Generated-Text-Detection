This is purely from anecdotal, self researched and experiential knowledge, so feel free to correct me if there are any glaring issues in my position. I believe that some of the reasons for this situation may be as follows: There's a huge disconnect between what we think "normal" weight should be (apparently around 5'8-5', 120lbs) with reality which seems more closer to either an average or slightly above it. In many cases people who were overweight when they were younger grow taller than their peers, perhaps because the body doesn't need to put on mass like it used too? Or do you just naturally get bigger over time simply due to that growth spurt? Either way you look at it, being noticeably heavier isn't good for your health but not all fat has equal health risks - eating a balanced diet mostly made up of healthy fats helps fight obesity without damaging heart health though. This could also explain why obese kids tend to have higher cholesterol etc., as well as lower immune systems. These factors can contribute to cardiovascular problems later down the road. On top of these things, stress levels play a large role in our overall health; especially mental health where anxietydepression is linked to inflammation and weight gain. It makes sense then that by overeating, one would become withdrawn, anxious about how others perceive them and stressed out generally throughout life. We've been trained to believe that exercising intensively will make us lose weight quickly. But that probably only works for those who exercise regularly anyway! The truth is that most gym goers don't weigh themselves during workouts and doing HIIT type training doesn't burn off much extra calories unless you're very fit already beforehand. And even worse, said people usually eat a lot afterwards for comfort food to compensate. Taking small steps towards regular exercise goes far deeper into solving this problem than jumping straight into cardio sessions 3 times per week. For example, simply going for walks during the day instead of sitting down all night long watching tv could help significantly with losing weight. Similarly, making sure to drink plenty of water daily could be another helpful step. If anything, focus first on fixing the psychological aspects before working out heavy weights (andor calorie counting). You'll find that once these changes start taking place, other areas such as physical activity improve rapidly. So is it possible to change your body shape through diet alone although you might still end up weighing heavier than everyone else? Well yes, absolutely. Many famous celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston have proven this fact. However, since those two women started following diets specifically tailored to their bodies rather than focusing on giving up certain foods altogether, they both drastically reduced their bodyweight. At least based on what little research i'm aware of online, it appears that the key difference here was switching these celebites from strictly Weight Watchers to a general Mediterranean type diet supplementing meals with vegetables and fruits with minimal processed grains, sugars, dairy products, fish and red meat. Both women gained muscle size while simultaneously reducing their BMI 14 lbs vs 10 pounds respectively), as shown below. I doubt these same results could be achieved just by restricting one's intake of alcohol, refined flour products, sugar and saturated fat alone:) Another study published in Science found evidence suggesting that low carb diets actually lead to improved insulin sensitivity and decreased aerobic capacity. What's interesting is that traditional European diets seem to contain less richness, starchy carbohydrates and oil than typical American ones that include carbs heavily whereas Western countries rarely include chickpeas, lentils, lentil salad dressings nor dark leafy greens in moderation. So maybe it's possible to reduce gains from high carbohydrate consumption whilst maintaining strength, endurance yet again proving as we know that fat burning happens primarily via intake of energy rather than excercise intensity alone.
