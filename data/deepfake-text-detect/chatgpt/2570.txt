Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a proxy war between Communist China and America. In fact, it's why Nixon won in 1968. It wasn't about how much we threw at them; both sides were using every dirty trick they could find to win. The Chinese didn't want South Vietnam to prosper (or the US to have an ally on their doorstep), so they did everything from bombing military bases in Cambodia to sending assassins after Diem himself with poison-tipped umbrellas. We responded by doing things like bombing NVA supply lines into South Vietnam, killing tons of civilians who probably had nothing to do with planning ambushes. I think that even if you're really pro-war and are fine with innocent civilian deaths as part of your crusade to protect freedom, there comes a point where enough is enough. Or maybe not for some people... How many Vietnamese patriots did we kill or torture? How many Red soldiers died because they thought Americans were the good guys? Was all our suffering worth that one village full of women and children who got killed when we dropped napalm bombs on their house? I don't think so. If anything, that makes us the baddies.
