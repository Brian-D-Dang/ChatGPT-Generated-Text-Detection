It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing I do know for certain - no matter what happens with this war between the US and North Korea (or maybe there's something else going on), it will have an impact on Japan because of its proximity. The issue here isn't so much potential military conflict but the fact that China doesn't appear likely to be able to develop or deploy nuclear weapons in its own country anytime soon, which will be used against the United States if Pyongyang decides to go ahead with developing them. It has been confirmed by the Chinese government that the threat level from any attack from NKChina was low enough that Beijing could not agree to launch a preemptive strike at Japan, given the risk of an American response.
