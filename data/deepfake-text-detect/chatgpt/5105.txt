Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: "how does it come about that this right is inherent?" What makes this right so inherently evil? Why is it inherently evil when some people are unwilling to enact the laws of the land and others act out their desires in a way which violates the rights of others. This right tends toward subjugation rather than liberty; it stems from something else amorphous, uncontrollable; it isn't the right or dignity of all life itself, it's simply the right somewhere between the two extremes or the boundaries that is wrong." The Constitution protects the freedom of speech and our freedoms only as such. The Constitution was written by Presidents Adams and Jefferson. It doesn't protect us against tyranny now because we have been lied to like we've been lied to for centuries; it protects us against tyranny today with the Constitution. Immediately after the Declaration of Independence, the Framers realized that America would never be free unless its political founders let our governments sit together to establish equal opportunity through separation of powers within common law principles among states' legislatures. Their plan came into being later on in the eighteenth century in the federal government under the Federalist Society founded by William Lloyd Garrison. The Declaration guaranteed the correct representation of the American people based upon the power they possess over States and citizens alike including the amendment of the Constitution. Liberty wasn't enough. Liberty should too often be defined solely by our ability to obviate oppression while preserving equality before the law (or what Garrison called "freedom. Liberty belongs not just to those who live here but also everyone who lives there. And who knows better why that is. Because freedoms undeniably exist without regard to territory or jurisdiction if the United States is truly sovereign statehood divided evenly amongst all Americans (top-down domination). It'd make sense if a democracy could prevent tyranny if this were the case, yet it almost always fails miserably when the US administers tyrannical rule nationally. In America's history, American freedom has largely fallen prey to tyranny and despots rather than to legislative sovereignty alone - namely, fiscal responsibility versus sovereignty. Many republicans argue that democracy requires Congress and executive branch officials to exercise absolute control over everything from budget spending decisions to tax policy to policies affecting freedom and liberties; however, the Founders imagined that federalism implies power over every citizen equally regardless of whether he owns property. In fact, in practice American democracy suffers off limits due to the Constitution's constitutional requirement of "equal protection" regarding civil liberties. The Framers debated these issues during the Frameworks debate and finally concluded that nations must remain independent from one another notwithstanding differences in governance style and constitutionality. There aren't many countries where each nation governs according to its individual constitutional rights precisely from within its borders except for Japan, where each side controls its own regulations internally via legislation enacted outside its borders. This means authoritarian regimes seek no other alternatives but to put national sovereignty above national privacy in order to preserve their own interests at any cost. If the United States really wanted freedom then it wouldn't need to regulate the limits imposed upon it periodically by the federal government (see how far this goes?). So, why do Republicans seem determined to block President Trump's agenda despite his unhappiness with the results of last year's election? Well, a few reasons. First, Republican leaders seem intent on keeping Democrats from passing anti-Trump bills aimed primarily at appeasing enemies abroad and protecting rights already taken away by the courts and congressmen responsible for making sure nothing illegal happens overseas. Second, Republicans claim that it will end up destroying the country economically since they cannot afford getting rid of Trump effectively considering how much damage done by him can wipe out thousands of jobs created under Obama administration programs impacting millions of innocent Americans. Third, the president remains an authoritarian whose actions undermine trust in institutions Washington had built up to allow for the sanctity of our founding principles. Finally, Republicans seem motivated mainly by fearmongering regarding Trump's role in Venezuela and Iran - though they'll likely opt back loose cannon Trump voters once elected instead of taking Trump seriously. Republicans absolutely deserve credit for trying to stop Trump throughout the 2016 election cycle until they faced reality threatening them again next month and a potential impeachment process if necessary following their failed attempt to destroy Democracy Friday week Thursday night. But the Founding Fathers knew that restoring power won't happen overnight either. They expected a revolution sooner or later - sooner or later you're going to see things change. And perhaps the best thing Republicans can hope for is to keep Trump from becoming more influential than ever amidst the chaos he unleashed Wednesday evening as he made unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud and rigging in Pennsylvania. One thing is clear Republicans don't want to govern anymore thanks to Trump rallies demonstrating loyalty to the great enemy he appeared to embody in his campaign slogan "Make America Great Again!"
