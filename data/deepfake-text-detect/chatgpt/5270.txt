I am a cynical man. I don't believe in heroes, and so I'm prepared to change my view on this. THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about the Japan Times makes me sickened by how quickly they're changing their mind-sets." The paper's editor, Yoshihiro Takahashi, admitted that the newspaper probably didn't know what it was getting into when it published the article,"One newspaper propagating fake news from beyond the grave," he wrote. "That said there are many reasons why these articles were written before the trial has begun: they weren't vetted thoroughly enough; it seems like a lot more than just an honest mistake made up by one newspaper publisher - they seem aimed at making a point without considering all implications for readers' feelings toward Japan itself; and most likely there isn't much point publishing such stories because they have already been effected by the coronavirus pandemic." Another critic of the Times said "the newspaper did not do proper vetting" which is also true. "It appears that they wanted to avoid criticism against the government (and the media) but couldn't think out of the box with the World Health Organization regarding the virus outbreak including the spread of COVID-19," the critic wrote. "They didn't properly scrutinize the information they shared prior to publishing the articles or press releases beforehand as required in accordance with Japanese law. The Times should apologize immediately after publication." However, those criticisms aren't taken seriously since the paper never apologized during the pandemic period anyway, even though they're well known and widely regarded as being credible reporting due to its history of journalistic integrity - however controversial they may be. There certainly wasn't anything wrong with the Times editorial board members when they authored the articles or referred to them falsely during the pandemic. They must have had no idea what was going on until they were confronted directly by reporters from the international news agency Iwai Radio, who reported the story based on footage that appeared online earlier in March 2019. Iwai Radio then asked the paper's editors whether any such photos existed. Ahn Tsoi, a reporter involved in the piece, contacted the publisher and asked why Japan's infection rate doesn't include any cases linked to the Times article compared to what the country experienced during the previous three months of lockdown, a question the paper denied citing the fact that it lacked data showing the number of infections per 100 people increased exponentially between February and April 2020. Ahn argued that it would make sense if Japan received treatment reports from abroad instead of only local transmissions attributed to local transmission alone. But ahn felt that the Times misrepresented facts involving nearby counties instead of importing locally transmitted cases across two weeks ago. Ahn suggested that the Times knew everything, including data provided by Japan Health Ministry officials indicating that community transmissions occurred elsewhere throughout the country despite having been previously told otherwise by the newspaper. Ahn stated that the Times didn't trust the health ministry nor Japan Health Minister Katsunobu Kato either. He filed complaints alleging defamation and libel charges over the story themselves. Natsumi Ishibuki, a senior fellow at the Japan Institute for International Affairs, wrote that only a few journalists called him to ask questions rather than asking tough questions. "Because of this they can take time off work while waiting for truth and transparency to emerge," Ishibuka writes. "But the fact that the situation remains unchanged indicates that the Times hasn't gone far enough yet."
