I do not support GMO's and do not want to consume them. Many other countries have restricted GMO's because they don't consider them safe alternatives. I personally don't believe that GMOs are harmful, but some governments should prohibit them or forbid them from being used in certain foods unless specified health effects can be attributed back to the use of genetically engineered foodstuffs (such as genetically modified crops). The only way it would happen is if we stopped using GMOs for food production entirely. The US government shouldn't stop doing anything about it at all simply because we've banned them from becoming part of our diet when we know there'd be a huge backlash against them probably caused by people who refuse to eat GMO products while people just aren't buying them.
