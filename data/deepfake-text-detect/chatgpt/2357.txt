This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I don't say this because it makes me feel virtuous; rather, when we examine the modern liberal mindset and realize how obsessed with "fairness" many liberals actually tend to be (or at least were until recently), understand what they really want is not fairness per se...they just typically call things unfair which aren't fair in precisely order for them to get more government power over other people so as to make those people behave like these special-interest groups do themselves - even though most normal human beings by nature would reject such behavior if exposed to it directly. The basic problem here isn't some sort of childish belief system about being 'good guys vs bad guys' who all hate each other etc., nor is there any inherent contradiction between wanting personal liberty AND strong national defense, both important concepts every American should support strive towards achieving concurrently...nor does merely opposing Trump mean you oppose America in general OR your countrymenwomen. Rather, their hatred stems from an excessive zealotry whereby individual rights become secondary to partisan politics: Democrats will never stop hating Republicans no matter what they accomplish, whereas conservatives must remain quiet despite having achieved numerous policy successes under President Obama simply out of fear of looking unpatriotic among fellow Americans deemed too stupid ignorant on critical matters to know better than to disagree with rightwing talking points. Note also that neither party has ever openly embraced policies aimed primarily toward helping disadvantaged minorities through various means due largely in part to the simplistic notion popularized throughout academia today wherein poverty doesn't exist unless specifically defined within terms of class warfare. This type of thinking couldn't possibly help anyone improve economically since one can only succeed based upon merit alone regardless of race identity, thus socialism somehow becomes justified depending wholly upon whether someone lives near a border eternally open to certain demographics via sheer virtue of existing according to progressive thought leaders. Liberals live life inside ideology bubbles where objective truth no longer exists - only subjective feelings opinions matter without question irrespective of whatever happens outside said bubble. And yet none dare speak ill against progressivism publicly lest they risk losing friends family members forevermore while simultaneously ensuring nobody understands anything anyway except leftism itself. Society evolves along leftist lines far faster than conservatism could hope to catch up given its focus on traditional values traditionless nationalism instead of technocratic liberalism, hence why our culture continues devolving away into chaos year after year by design through widespread fraud corruption. Everything else is noise made manifest designed entirely for purposes divorced from reality - historical context included. The future belongs to progressives exclusively, everyone else gets left behind eventually. That way lies total tyranny disguised as equality guaranteed equally to all citizens!
