This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in space, then there are no gods, so you're an atheist. The counter argument to this point is that belief doesn't have a lot to do with reality anyway - believing in unicorns for all these years has nothing whatsoever to do with their existence (or non-existence) on earth! It's pretty much what I was afraid of; not only did my dad come out as agnostic when our parents were still together and we had just started dating but he hasn't changed his mind since then either. But now that it seems some people can find some satisfaction from being right instead of having faith in God...
