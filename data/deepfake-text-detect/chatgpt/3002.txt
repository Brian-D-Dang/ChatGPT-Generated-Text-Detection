A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but the entertainment value of his display was way greater than anything else he threw money at. I did it one year with 300 worth (the little handheld ones) It is incredibly fun and you can throw them every where
