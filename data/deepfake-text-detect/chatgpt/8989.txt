I realize the OP is a bit vague, so let me clarify. Similar to false advertising, I believe that people who release lies (in a publishable, marketable format). This includes things like "undercover" sales and discounts of products. That's what I meant by "marketable." The point is that they have an advantage over others because they don't know and can see the deceptive aspects of it. No one's judgment is on them - it's just something about their product or service that appeals to you more than anything else
