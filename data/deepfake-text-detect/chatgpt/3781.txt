First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are being wasted on this animal not to mention the thousands of lives it takes just in its care alone. We don't want to see them go extinct. The whole point of a zoo or any other type of government structure is so people can enjoy said animals when their time comes- just as with all living things
