I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with that statement, they should be allowed to disagree with it without getting fired or fined by the government for expressing their opinion on something unrelated than the workplace. That being said I don't think people should get fired for saying offensive things in private places like homes or cars but public is where your right ends and other peoples rights begin so watch what you say there That's true: we have laws against hate speech because taking away freedom of speech simply means more power over others
