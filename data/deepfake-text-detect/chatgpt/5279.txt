Countries need children in order to sustain themselves, without a younger generation the country will not advance and will not be able to sustain itself. Elderly will not be able to rise up from their graves as they did before the collapse of the Roman Empire. The world economy cannot continue like this anymore, especially when it relies on higher levels of automation for production such as pesticides and chemicals industry companies use today which is leaving society worse off than ever. There must be a change that threatens the survival of the planet as well as big cities are becoming obsolete agains smaller towns who depend greatly on humans. This is why we need to make things more sustainable by pointing out how we can create conditions where older generations are left behind while young generations understand that there needs to be less reliance upon small industries so that baby boomers don't become extinct completely because it truly does not take responsibility for making better decisions about equality between young people instead allowing us all to live longer lives together with love each other rather then forcing ourselves into an outdated world view thinking the old mentality of "We have to work harder just like everyone else" could never happen.
