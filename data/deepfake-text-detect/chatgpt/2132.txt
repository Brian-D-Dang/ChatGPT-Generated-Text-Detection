A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off. [Watch the launch video to understand why.] Amazon's "Alexa" is a voice-controlled device that will respond with information and jokes based on user commands. The base unit costs 180; there are also versions for 50 more which include Bluetooth capabilities in addition to support for WiFi and 3G connections from ATT or T-Mobile. Users connect Alexa devices via WiFI networks. A variety of third party developers have created apps specifically designed for use by Alexa users through their phones or tablets while connected over WIFI using an app called Skills - some examples being games like Jeopardy! or companion music services such as Spotify, Pandora Radio, IHeartRadio, TuneIn Internet radio, Slacker Radio, iHeartRadio and Sirius XM Satellite Radio. These apps offer enhanced features - such as allowing you to ask Alexa something like: 'Where did this song come from?' Or asking it to play your favorite artist and station without having to memorize complex passwords. You tell Alexa what you want to hear just as though she were another person sitting at the dinner table talking to themself about how they feel today as opposed to saying to themselves aloud many times throughout each day...'It would take way too much time to memorize those things, especially when all we really need is one good version of our musical taste to remember every day.' So far so good right? Wrong - these skills could easily lead us into hell unless someone wakes up soon enough before its too late - watch out!!!!!! Watch the videos below...
