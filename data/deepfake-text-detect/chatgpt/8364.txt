I attribute my agnosticism to this very theory. Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in existence before it happened (so far). If God were responsible for everything then he would have been sitting around just waiting patiently until some big bang happens and things start up again so as not interfere with his "master plan." But if you're willing on saying without doubt: yes...there is something beyond science which exists outside of both time space; well I don't see how one can logically argue against such an assertion since by definition they are living inside their own sphere - The Universe has no idea what's going On Inside My Mind! We must also remember here: We do Not Know Everything At All TimesSo maybe someone else out- There knows more than me Maybe It Does Exist Beyond This SpaceTime Continuum?If Time Travel Is Possible Than So Could Be An Alteration In Our Understanding Of Something Yet To ComeThat May Or Might Require A Change From What Science Tells Us Right Now You Can Never Understand How Things Are Until They Have Happened And By Definition That Means LOOKING BACK NOT FORWARDAnd when talking about Great Shakes Like THAT, Such As Censorship Performed Over Millions For Decades Instead OF Confronting Evil Intervention? (i mean all those millions could be dead now) It Makes Sense Why People Would Question Whether Anything Outside Their Own Sphere Really Matters....Especially When History Has Already BegunTo Repeat Itself With Those Who Will Listen Only Partly Because...WellPartially CauseOf CourseThey've Always Had BooksLike One Called THE BIBLE!!!!A Book Written During Ancient Periods KnownAs Biblical ReligonsWhich Were Practices Ruled ThroughThe Law Which Was Later Adopted Into SocietyByThose ClaiminG PowerOver OthersIn Modern Day TermsinControl Fantasy
