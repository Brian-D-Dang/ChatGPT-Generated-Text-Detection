We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None. I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you 're good at something then by definition, it's better than being able to do multiple things well. What I am referring to however are those people who start down the path towards excellence in one area but eventually give up on pursuing mastery because they choose another field as their focus instead. I recently saw an article from Business Insider highlighting how harder we work when our primary job title matches what we want to be known for: "It turns out there's actually science behind why your career should match your interest." The study found that employees put more effort into tasks related to their passion even though these may take longer or have greater challenges associated with them - which was reflected through increased levels of performance. This research reaffirms my belief about the importance of choosing a single route along which to pursue progress; anything else will likely cause frustration among yourself (and others) without truly getting where you need to go. Passion can't always drive everything in life like some might think. For example, imagine someone only doing art professionally despite having no formal training whatsoever. They spend countless hours making paintings and drawings every day. Each piece would probably look amazing since it's created using just imagination alone! But painting doesn't exactly translate into other fields such as teaching or business administration does it? So while creative expertise sounds great on its own, the person could still struggle financially due to lack of educationexperience outside of artistic expression. Balance is key whether you decide to become a master in one specific skill set or many different ones over time. In fact, balance allows us to get away with stretching ourselves across several pursuits so long as each new venture serves the overall purpose of bringing value to society versus draining it further. Having experience working in various parts of industry gives perspective on opportunities ahead of time...something that comes much easier after committing full-time to a particular subject matter for years rather than weeks, months, or days. If you haven't narrowed down your niche yet, don't feel pressured for whatever reason into sticking around under circumstances that seem undesirable. Explore your options until you find something worth investing in deeply enough to make sacrifices necessary for success.
