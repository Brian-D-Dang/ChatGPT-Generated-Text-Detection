Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I don't want there. I would like to have my party on Friday night and not to long of an evening. So I was thinking of having it at a small barrestaurant. I also wanted to make it affordable. So I was thinking of a cocktail party with lots of finger foods (appetizers). I also would like it to be a party but with a sophisticatedchic feel. Hmm.. That's all I have so far. I'm not sure if I have any friends that would throw me a party, but I'll just have to wait and see. If I did have a party, it would be 21 and older. Thanks for the advice everyone!! I'm not really sure how much a place like that would cost but it would be more reasonable than the average restaurant. I'd say plan to spend about 30-40 a head, for food and drink. Oh, thanks, I'll keep that in mind. I'm sorry, I should have been more specific. The first place I was going to have it at is a barrestaurant but it's going to be around 50-60 people. I'm still looking for a smaller place. Sorry again, I guess I'm a little behind on the whole planning thing. I just found out that I need to have it at a place that serves alcohol. I don't know what to do.. I wanted to have it at a restaurant but now that I know that I have to get a special permit I have no idea what to do. Sorry if this has been asked, but how much do you want to spend? I'm not sure how much I want to spend, but I would like it to be affordable. You could always just rent a small place at a hotel and have it at a bar. Las Vegas has some really cheap places, so that's what I would do. I have no idea how I would go about that though. I know I can rent a place out. I just don't know where to start. I would have it at a bar. I know I'm probably not going to have a lot of people, but I don't know where to rent a place out. I thought about just throwing it at my house. It would be a lot cheaper, but I don't think I'm going to be able to handle that many people at my house. I was thinking of renting a room at a hotel. Is that a bad idea? It really depends on the hotel. Some are more expensive than others. There are a lot of hotels near me, I just don't know which one is the cheapest. I would probably want to rent a room for about 100 a night or less. I'm not sure how much that is.. That's really cheap. I would say 100 a night should be easy to find. It's going to be pretty hard to find a room for 100 a night though. The rooms at the hotel I'm staying at are about 100 a night but I'm staying there. So I would have to find a hotel near by. I would prefer not to go far from my house. So I guess I would have to look online to see what kind of hotels are around me. What about at the mall? I think the hotels around my house are around 150 a night. It really depends on how many people are attending. I'm not sure how many I'll have at my party. I don't know if you're still looking for a place but we found ours at a party place. And they had food. It was a lot cheaper then a bar because they have a bar there. I'm still looking for a place. I have a lot of options but I'm trying to find something that fits all of my requirements. I was thinking of having it at a bar but I don't know if they'd be willing to rent out a room for a party. I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to handle it all. I'm going to have to figure it out soon though, it's only a month away. The place I'm thinking about has a room for 40-50 people. I
