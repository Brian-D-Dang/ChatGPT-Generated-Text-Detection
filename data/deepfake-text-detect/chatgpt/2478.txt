I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I 'm sure there are many people in other places who experience different things than me but it seems like most of them have been around men as well and don't seem completely knocked off their feet for being male or something There's such an incredible amount of pressure on every woman out here not just what they see themselves
