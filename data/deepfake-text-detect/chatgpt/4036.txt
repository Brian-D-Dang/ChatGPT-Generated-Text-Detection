If this is a duplicate post, I apologize, an AutoMod told my my old version was too short and that it was removed. Here's my logic, though: If I get approval to re-post, the mods can't just remove people from rAskReddit without reason after they have been approved by me correctly once before. As long as you don't get caught up in overly strict moderation rules that only serve to prevent legitimate questions... It seems like your point of view (and mine) has changed since this thread took off so much lately.
