Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be done afterwards - whether it's right for a person who used drugs illegally (with no intent) before they were legalized in their countrystate and would have been illegal under continued prohibition laws all along... I don't believe there are any "absolute" moral truths on drug use unless you can define an absolute meaning from where we're currently standing without using other concepts like evolution which was part parcel with our evolutionary process that brought us here at present day so thus making every human being has absolutely evolved since birth as species.. And even then many things still aren't understood yet such how these same aspects evolve over time...so maybe morality will change one more great step forward after reaching another level too!? haha Or perhaps some few individuals may never reach said levels instead hanging onto archaic ideals based only upon limited knowledge until technology progresses further into whatever direction.... But regardless none-the less something major changes eventually always does when enough events occur together by chance tipping points across different areas because everything functions within its own ecosystem; nothing exists outside itself but rather connected through symbiotic relationships.) So let me explain my position:
