I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the rankings. The story is simple: a group of well-meaning adults (who love children) have a problem with their parents' actions on something they feel like doing. They suddenly start to think about gifts and not duties. The parents are so worried about their kid's future that they start quieting down and giving them the good things. But by the end of the story, they don't realize how serious it was and then abandon the idea. My friend has been watching Spirited Away at school since she was 13 and her parents never really listened to her. When she grew up, she saw the movie as an opportunity to learn from it. "Little people need to get real," she says. "It isn't just a matter of getting real; It's really about ... learning." That makes The Little People really special to me because I respect the creators of everything the show does. And after watching Spirited Away over and over again, it still feels very authentic - a happy ending that we never see onscreen, no matter how unselfish our kids may be. The thing that kept me going through these moments is seeing a bright light in my heart that I really needed this time around, whether it's when I watched it or before. That also helped make me recognize that I am no longer alone in feeling sad for my family members who lost loved ones in one tragic moment. Even though I don't feel sad anymore, this came with a lot of responsibilities. A few days into watching the movie, I only realized how much I wanted to listen to the song that started it all - Love Is In The Air. Megan Elle Yours truly, Myni Elise
