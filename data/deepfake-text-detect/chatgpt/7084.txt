I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have livedcurrently live there, I could not be more dead set i could have stayed in NYC in more than 30 years. I was a huge fan of NYC from the start, but i remember seeing it a few times, and I thought it's been an amazing experience.
