While it is important to expose the atrocities committed by extremist groups like ISIS, it is not necessary for individuals to watch graphic and disturbing videos to understand the gravity of the situation. In fact, the circulation of such videos may only serve to sensationalize violence and justify the actions of the perpetrators. Moreover, watching such videos can have a negative impact on an individual's mental health and well-being. Instead, people should focus on taking collective action against extremist groups, whether it be through advocacy, fundraising for victims, or supporting organizations working towards preventing further violence.
