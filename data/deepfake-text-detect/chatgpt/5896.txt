While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to beat Trump or Clinton. The Green party has been the most consistent and effective party against big business and has been the most uncompromising in the pursuit of human rights. They have won in local elections and are attempting to win the congress. "The Green party has been the most consistent and effective party against big business" That is so far from the truth. They have been an absolute disaster for the environment. I used to be a Green. Now, I'm a Democrat. I am voting for Hillary Clinton. I don't think any of the current Democratic candidates are that great, but I think Bernie has a better chance of beating the Republicans than any of the others. I'm not an American, but in my experience, the Democrats are slightly less corrupt than the Republicans. I'd love to see a third party candidate win, but it's not going to be Bernie. Bernie is an American, you know. I'm not sure why you would want to see him fail. He's our only real option if we want a chance to undo all the damage that has been done to this country in the last 8 years. He will bring back our manufacturing jobs and restore American's pride in the world. He will help us undo the damage of the Citizens United ruling and the dismantling of the government. He's the only candidate that will pay off student debt, raise the minimum wage, pass a national healthcare bill, and make higher education free. He'll help us get out of this economic mess and have a strong economy again. He will also help repair our broken criminal justice system. Anyone who thinks that he can't win needs to open their eyes and look at the polls. He's winning most of the states where the primaries have happened. He's winning in the swing states. He's winning among independents. He's winning with women. He's winning among young people. The only thing that he's losing is among those who are blinded by big money. He can't compete with the billionaires who are buying the election for Clinton. I'm not sure why you would want to see him fail. He's our only real option if we want a chance to undo all the damage that has been done to this country in the last 8 years. Sorry, but I'm not voting for someone just because he's the only "real option." I want the best candidate, not the only one available. I want a candidate who isn't beholden to big business. I want someone who understands that the economy can't be fixed by giving billionaires more tax cuts. I'll be voting third party, or just not voting. The lesser of two evils does not exist. I think Bernie is going to be the next president. I'm not voting for the lesser of two evils. I'm voting for the person I think will do the best job. I'm going to vote for the person who will best help us restore America. The only thing that Bernie is lacking is the ability to raise a lot of money, and he's working on that. I've been a Bernie supporter since his campaign began. I'm a 3rd party guy, but not with Bernie. He's the only candidate who has been consistent in his views and has been honest about what he wants to do, and who he is. He's the only candidate that has never sold out to big business. He's the only candidate who has shown that he cares about the middle class, and he's the only candidate who has shown that he actually wants to help people. I know that Hillary is very intelligent and she's a decent person, but she will never be as good as Bernie. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate that can beat Donald Trump. I'm not voting for the lesser of two evils. I'm voting for the person I think will do the best job. Sanders is the best person to do the job. But he's a longshot to win. I'm voting for Bernie Sanders, but if the fix is in and he's cheated out of the nomination, I'm voting for Jill Stein, even if it's just to vote against the Democratic establishment. If Clinton is the nominee, I'll be voting for Jill
