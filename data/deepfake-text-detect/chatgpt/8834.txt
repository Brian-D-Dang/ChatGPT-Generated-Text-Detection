I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was confused at first cause this movie is not based on real life events but is rather an historical novel; I thought this would be a great time to rewatch it in order to get some perspective of what happened. I am now 100 sure that I should have picked it up at least ten years ago! The Imitation Game was actually the first movie with no direct sequels. I recommend you watch it if you are interested in seeing The Imitating Game.
