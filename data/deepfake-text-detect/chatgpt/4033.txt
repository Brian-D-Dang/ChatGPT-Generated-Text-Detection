I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need to breathe? The whole thing is a huge waste of resources. People do smoke weed though But does smoking weed make you happier or more social?
