I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically there's no way to know what will happen if something goes wrong on a reactor (because they are constantly monitored). There is also concern that this technology may be used for "creating bombs" whenever someone thinks it's cool: we've seen several occasions in history when people wanted to use them as weapons or just to test things out. Same here. Nuclear energy has been around since the dawn of time. We're still using steam engines and oil fired boilers today because those were proven to work at the time. It'll take a lot more than Fukushima to convince me that making nuclear energy work safely should come before making this technology accessible to average citizens.
