WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in film and TV are presenters or film makers, but things like Jack Black have made me want to be a filmmaker myself! This list is my attempt at producing a short list of filmmakers who would like to work with me if I ever decided to make any films.
