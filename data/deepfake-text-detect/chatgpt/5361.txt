I believe that it is bad for humans generally that we have patriotism. It leads not only to discrimination. (hello Mr Trump) But also to economic and political difficulties and poverty which are terrible effects of this kind because this sort of competition between the cultures cause conflicts between countries, inter alia trade disputes among nations or violence against each other. In our country there is a lot of nationalism in the countries but Norway does not, everyone has feelings about Norwegian decisions should be respected by all people regardless of their differences. You can't dictate how Norway behaves as you chose to do so if they don't want to respect your views on foreign policy. Norway's economy depends much more heavily than any European nation would consider itself to be Denmark was established since 1945 under Norway's independence from Germany when it decided to join Germany after the Second World War. Norway doesn't belong here. We shouldn't allow Scandinavians feel sorry for Norway either. They need to understand what Denmark wants rather than become the Swedish of the world! So we'll see how Norway reacts if Norway ignores Danish opinion too quickly!! Norway will be safe!
