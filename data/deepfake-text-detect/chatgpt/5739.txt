I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before he was a public scientist. So, his most memorable, most cherished experience with science was likely as a kid, not as a professional. I submit that the manner in which he conducts his campaign is a serious reflection on the public's perception of science and scientists. His tactics are childish, and his whole approach is childish. This is not a good advertisement for scientists.
