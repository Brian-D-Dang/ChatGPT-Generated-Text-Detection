Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: "how does it come about that this right is inherent?" What makes this a right that is inherent to all people? The right to bear arms is generally considered to be an inherent right in many countries, as it is seen as necessary for the protection of life and liberty. It is believed that this right comes from natural law, or the idea that people have certain rights which should be respected by governments and other individuals. This right is seen as essential for self-defense and preserving democracy by allowing citizens to protect themselves against oppressive regimes. The right to bear arms is also seen to be a part of an individual's fundamental human right to freely express their identity and beliefs.
