Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a break. So when she gave me my feedback on how I should change her opinion in the post above, it turned out that almost all the responses were "good" and "not bad." It's not that bad though, it just wasn't enough or even close to being worth contacting her directly...
