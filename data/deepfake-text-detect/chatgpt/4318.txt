Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to 15hour. While many would argue that this move will result in a higher cost for employers (something the government could help alleviate), I disagree. Instead of increasing the minimum wage like it's been recommended by virtually every left-leaning think tank we can raise it more slowly while still improving economic conditions. If you read the American Economic Association journal, "The Journal of Economics" and if you pay attention to how economists talk about economics anytime politics are mentioned they always mention unemployment as an example of an issue that should be addressed via monetary policy. 1.1 million Americans currently live at or below the poverty line and most people who live under the poverty level do not have jobs. So obviously something needs to change. The problem is that our current system has little regard for those whose only assets are their labor so it necessarily hurts them economically when the minimum wage is increased - they lose money because wages are lowered. This article from Forbes explains the great disparity between the bottom 10 and top 10: In 2014, there were 16.9 million high school graduates living in households earning less than 29,100 annually; 88 percent of these students belonged to families making just over 60,000 per year. By contrast, these same households had 2.3 million fatherless children ages 14 to 17 - and that number was growing during the period covered by the survey by double digits each year. A cursory look at statistics suggests that the top 5 control 99.8 percent of wealth and income: Of typical U.S. households, no fewer than 11 out of 12 own more than 50 percent of all net worth. Those owning the lion's share of net worth also have a wide spread of assets. Nearly half own some real estate assets along with stocks, bonds, mutual funds, pensions, annuities, life insurance policies, and other financial products. They include almost 19 percent of home equity loans and nearly eight times as much cash as any other asset class. These assets represent holdings in trust, bank accounts, banks, securities and various fiduciary arrangements. Fewer than 8 percent hold only retirement funds or none at all. A study conducted by economist Robert Shiller found that the majority of stock ownership among Americans occurs within the top 20, but wealthiest individuals owned 69 of all stocks in 2007. Because of their high wealth, there must be ways for the wealthy to earn more. One idea being floated is to tax the rich a bit more on what they make. Another strategy involves using government aid programs such as welfare to increase demand for goods which may lead to lower prices for consumers, thereby increasing profits at businesses where workers receive federal assistance. Whatever solution emerges, one thing is certain: It isn't enough to simply hike the minimum wage. We need to find a way to address generational inequity before we even consider raising the minimum wage.
