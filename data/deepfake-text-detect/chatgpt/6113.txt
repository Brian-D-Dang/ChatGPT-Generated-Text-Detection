I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the "best" thing to do, even if they don't always follow that knowledge, that doesn't make it subjective, it just makes them not good people. As an example, we know that we would all prefer to live in a world of peace and happiness, rather than a world of war and misery, this is not subjective. But does it matter if people don't follow this? No, because this is something we all know in our hearts, and we know what the right thing to do is, and we can't argue with that. I'm not even gonna try and argue this, I'm just gonna hope that I have made some sense, and then I'm gonna go to bed.

I think this is the one point I agree with you on. Everyone knows what the "best" thing to do is, but people do what they want to do. Subject: Re: Morality is objective, not subjective Mon Jul 12, 2010 5:27 pm I don't think morality is subjective. I think it's objective, but it's not all black and white. That's why I made the thread. What's objective about it? I think it's objective, but it's not all black and white. So you think morality is objective, but it's not all black and white? That's why I made the thread. To clarify your view? Well, yeah. I think I've made my point now. I'll see you guys later. Subject: Re: Morality is objective, not subjective
