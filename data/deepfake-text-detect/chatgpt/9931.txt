I am a young black male, who is torn between both sides of the aisle regarding race relations in America. I have experience racial profiling and understand that there is a need for change. However, I also believe that personal responsibility plays an important role in dismantling systemic racism. I understand that many of the current issues facing African Americans today have been around since before I was born and are deeply entrenched in our society. It is my belief that every individual should take ownership of their own destiny and be proactive in creating a better future for themselves and for others. At the same time, I recognize the need for collective action to address the systemic injustice that persists in our country. It is my hope that through dialogue, understanding, and collaboration, we can bridge the gaps between different cultures, racial backgrounds, and ideologies to create a more just and equitable society. By working together, we can continue to make progress towards true racial equity and an end to discrimination.
