The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to know what they mean today when we say "term limits" or other parts about term lengths that go against our modern way thinking on elected officials life terms as governor etc... So I ask you all if there was an amendment for a 3 year limit? Would anyone actually vote FOR this constitutional change??? Just asking....
