Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me because we spend so much time worrying and talkingdebating whether there's an asteroid headed our way (and yet) most of the man-made objects in proximity have collision probabilities less than 1! That means they're going 0.00001 mph - which would be a huge shock but not destroy anything...... So basically: Why don't asteroids cause more damage? If it were only one object then maybe.......but since its thousands upon millions whos got billions for defense systems why do these "things" never collide with each other??
