Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data] . In the comments, a lot of people underlined that we are still discussing whether technology will create or destroy jobs. The truth is that today I'm going to talk about what happens when you take into account not only the number but also the quality of those jobs and how much time we spend on them - because many times our job search involves lots of hours sitting around waiting for an interview or attending stupid training sessions... This shouldn't be true! We should have opportunities to do something creative every day without having to think about if someone else can pay us less money doing it. So let's see where things stand. What does research say? Well, first off all we need some definitions: Job Any occupation which allows a person to receive income as their primary source of livelihood (Wikipedia) More broadly speaking, perhaps "job" could mean any activity for which one receives monetary compensation. For example, maybe your family only earns enough to cover food expenses through farming; the rest goes towards paying rentmortgage, car payments, etc.. If they don't farm they might work part-time at McDonald's instead so they make enough money to survive. You could consider these activities jobs even though they aren't very well paid ones. My point here is that anyone who spends most of his spare time working seems like he'd probably get pretty bored with life... so unless he works in retail or behind a desk 9-5MealTime is really just another type of job. If we accept that definition then technology isn't likely to lead to fewer jobs anytime soon. But what about technological advances potentially leading us to new types of employment altogether? That would certainly address certain problems: poverty, pollution, inequality, racism, homophobia, sexism, ect... The problem is that we seem unable to understand current trends. Maybe we're wrong about what we want for future generations... Shouldn't it depend a little bit on our understanding of humanity itself? On how aware we are of how deeply tied together human society is nowadays? How entangled we are with each other? Who knows, maybe we go back to living hunter gatherer societies again and leave the cities to live in parks populated by dogs and cats. Or maybe we become immortal cyborg beings able to control whole planets from our brains while flying down to Earth to visit friends once a year. These are cool ideas! These are exciting prospects! Yet we cannot help thinking that we know better than nature. And worse: that we don't care anymore since the world seems to be headed somewhere and we don't particularly care where it takes us. It doesn't matter, right? After all, we've already crossed this bridge before. Why wouldn't we cross it again? Because humans are intelligent creatures! They learn faster and adapt quicker than anything else in creation. They use tools too, although sometimes not in ways that enlighten us very much. Most recently we learned about Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs in the New York Times Magazine, and it got me thinking a lot about my dear friend Marco Cappelli. He used to work closely with Mr. Jobs, being responsible for bringing him over to Apple. When Tim Cook decided to step aside from running the company, Mr. Cappelli took the opportunity of becoming CEO himself. During his tenure at Apple, he did everything possible to adopt the philosophy set forth by the former CEO, believing strongly in innovation, simplicity, honesty, respectfulness, commitment, humility, ... and now he wants to share them with everyone else. Isn't that amazing?! As long as we keep looking ahead and stepping forward, no matter how often we fall back; no matter how many times we trip or stumble along the way, we never stop learning and growing stronger. Until we reach the end of our days we continue evolving within ourselves, sharing knowledge privately among each other while creating value and contributing to a wider community of others striving for progress. With that said, here are ten simple yet valuable lessons I picked up reading Timothy Leary's book Flashbacks: Memoirs Of A Neurobiologist And Psychedelic Drugs : 1. There Are No Shortcuts To Happiness I read that sentence last week and had a strange feeling inside, almost like deja vu. I couldn't put two words together in my head until yesterday, watching a video called [How We Can Build Better Humans]. At 0:50 minutes, Dr Hyman talks about how happiness comes after hard work and discipline. So basically, he goes against the idea of ever needing drugs to feel good. What about full blossom of human potential?
