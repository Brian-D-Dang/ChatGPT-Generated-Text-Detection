To clarify my title I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable unless the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, or the child is the product of rape. There are some circumstances in which it is justifiable to have an abortion, such as when the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, when the child is the product of rape, or when the mother is not able to provide a safe environment for the child. In these cases, it is important to weigh the cost of continuing the pregnancy with the cost of terminating it. In some cases, the cost of continuing the pregnancy may be too great, and thus termination may be justified. However, in most cases, I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable and should be avoided if possible.
