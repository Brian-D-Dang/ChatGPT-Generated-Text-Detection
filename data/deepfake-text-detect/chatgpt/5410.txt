I'll allow that, in most cases, the misbehaving kid is just throwing a temper tantrum, but what do you do in cases where the kid has thrown himself on the ground and for whatever reason I've stated earlier? I'm willing to bet that in almost every case of misbehavior there are parents who don't know how to help their kids. The trick with kids (and adults) is not knowing how to handle them effectively. It's really no different than letting someone throw themselves into your firearm at you while you're parked illegally when you're driving drunk or forgetting your keys or stealing from a car window. Cops can be quite forgiving about this sort of thing though because it gives police officers latitude they haven't had before. You think cops give cops latitude they haven't taken care of before because they're unwilling to deal directly with food poisoning victims instead of instant gratification killers like fentanyl addicts? The cops aren't going to fucking kill people who fuck up. If you bring your own kids home as punishment then yes...true enough. But if they want your child dead all use their own hands so there isn't any lingering guilt involved other than wanting to keep your kid safe
