Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. "That means that marriage equality should not be given as a prerequisite for marriage equality." On the other hand, there are some people who think this statement shouldn't matter at all because it applies only during marriage equality ceremonies and weddings but by default they believe that same-sex couples cannot legally marry because marriage equality doesn't exist anywhere in the United States since it's illegal or unconstitutional. The fact remains though: Equality shouldn't grant equal rights based on gender identity either way even if its legal status depends upon marriage equality ceremony itself (in fact most states have laws prohibiting such discrimination). It does affect marriage equality completely however which makes sense since marriage equality wouldn't occur until we get rid of the biological gender distinction between male and female. Anyone who thinks that saying gay people can't marry, goes against my views. This idea has been around forever now according to some people and will probably continue to happen soon enough with the rise of queer activism over trans rights. Few things compare with the success of LGBTQ advocacy groups like Pride Month celebrations where LGBT immigrants and refugees often come together to support each others' right to marry. Another thing many same-gender couples don't agree about isn't necessarily what our Constitution forbids from happening; its really how rights are legislated here regardless of whether religious freedom guarantees them civil rights too!
