I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to have a stable atom in the vicinity of 118 and above. To produce [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , you'd have to use an extremely heavy nucleus to get the electron spin stabilized. The problem is that you'd have to use an extremely unstable nucleus to produce these elements, and in the event that the nucleus broke down to produce a stable element such as [ununpentium] , the amount of energy released would be so large it would destroy the universe. Does this make any sense? Is this assumption correct? Just so you know, you can't make elements 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, or 130 with stable nuclei. I think your assumption is correct. Here's a related story: I'm a physics student, so I find it interesting to read about how they decide what element to name next. It's not decided arbitrarily - the names are decided based on the number of electrons in the atom's valence shell. When they get close to a certain number of electrons, they sometimes give the new element the same name as an element above it, but with a different suffix. This is because the element above it is in a particularly stable configuration, so to maintain consistency, the new element will have the same name, but with a different suffix. So, for example, the element with an atomic number of 106 is called ununtrium. The number of electrons in its valence shell is 6, which is 1 less than the number of electrons in the valence shell of ununtrium, so they gave the new element the same name, but with a different suffix. Why do you think that is? I thought the names were given for historical reasons. As far as I know, the names are given based on the number of valence electrons, and it makes sense to me to give the element a different name that starts with the same letter as the element it's replacing. That way, you don't have to change the name in any other places. So, for example, if the element with atomic number 106 is called ununtrium, then you can keep using it as the symbol for the element, because it starts with the letter U. The same thing applies for the elements 104, 105, 107, and 108. They are called unbiunium, unbohrium, unhassium, and unobtanium respectively, because they all have 8 electrons in their valence shell. Since the names are given based on the number of valence electrons, the element with atomic number 105 and the element with atomic number 108 are both called unbiunium. If the element with atomic number 105 was given the name unbiunium and the element with atomic number 108 was given the name unbiunium, the two elements would have the same name, but they are not the same element. If you were to give the elements with atomic numbers 105 and 108 the same name, you'd have to change the name of the element with atomic number 105. You'd have to change its name to unbiunium, but the element with atomic number 108 would have to be called uubium, since it starts with the letter U. That would be silly, since they're the same element. The other elements are given different names because the numbers of valence electrons are different. The element with atomic number 109 is called untriunium, but the element with atomic number 110 is called triunium. The element with atomic number 109 has 9 electrons in its valence shell, and the element with atomic number 110 has 10 electrons in its valence shell. Since they have different numbers of electrons, you'd have to change the element's name to untriunium if you were to give it the same name as the element with atomic number 109. If I'm right, the element with atomic number 115 is called "unseptum," and the element with atomic number 116 is called "septium." The element with atomic number 115 has
