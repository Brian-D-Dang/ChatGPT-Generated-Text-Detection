This CMV was inspired by this post: I believe that being obese is a disability. Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out. It's a disability that a lot of people have and yet they can't see their own bodies. What exactly do you mean "I am overweight" or "my body is ugly"? A) The reason I said fat (and not just plain fat), is because my body isn't showing it. And for some reason the more I look at myself in those terms the less visible it gets. B) My body says otherwise; it doesn't say it. I don't think anyone should be skinny or lean either. There are plenty who aren't so skinny. Many of us think we're some kind of bodybuilder. But honestly, if anything, I'm a lazy bastard. I can fit into 10 sizes on...almost everything. In fact, I've never actually been that slim-ish-looking (or even fat), but I've seen a few guys with pants like that. They all seem thinner than I am. C) If your body tells you otherwise, then you're an asshole. Don't ever tell someone else what to wear. It will make others uncomfortable. You may want to change your diet, so you don't feel obligated to eat something which will get your blood pumping. Or stop eating meat D) How many calories did you burn? What percentage of what you ate? Do you weigh anywhere near as much as you do now? Is there any way you can keep track of how much food you ate? Does it count as exercise?
