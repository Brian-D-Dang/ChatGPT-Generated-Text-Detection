tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to the more important ones, I always try and have an opinion on what's going on Redditors are usually in their teens or 20s so they just probably haven't had the same experience watching live sports as everybody else before them
