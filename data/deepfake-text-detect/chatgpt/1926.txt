Generally speaking, you have two sides on the "Fat Debate": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, or saying they're too fat to be loved). As I said before, Health at every size is a terrible idea. You can't tell me that increasing your risk of dying from heart disease by 300 because it makes you feel good about yourself isn't bad for society as well as unhealthy individuals...
