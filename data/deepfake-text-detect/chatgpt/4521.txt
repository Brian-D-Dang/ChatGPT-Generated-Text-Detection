So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training and have some equipment, but with the exception of one guy there's no way in hell any town could afford this on their own - especially not fire stations built to hold 2-3 crews. But now even the state is looking at raising taxes by 1 million just for wildfire fighting! A goddamn 1 MILLION DOLLARS!!! Is anyone else stunned by how quickly things are deteriorating? Does anybody really think these people can be trainedequipped enough within 10 years? At least half the adult population needs to get serious about doing something (like volunteering), or we're all fucked. "I wish you would stop posting your disgusting opinions here! You don't belong!" Listen to me, you idiot: Have you ever tried to talk to someone who's been through what I'm going through?? Ever???? Please take care of yourself; if you feel like sharing more information, YA might find topics where this isn't appropriate. Note also that having an ongoing infection will make posting much harder than usual...do not try to post without THIS note it won't work well, and may even lose data from time to time. It sucks, huh? Yeah, I guess it does, though when I started reading your story, I couldn't help thinking "that doesn't sound too bad." Even after getting into the details (which wasn't easy) I still found myself hoping everything turns out alright. It's human nature to look ahead for happy endings. Sometimes life seems hopelessly unfair and nobody has a clue why you were dealt such terrible cards. But then you remember that the universe is basically incomprehensible and randomness rules supreme so anything is possible. Besides, maybe there IS something good coming down the pipeline. The only thing keeping us from acting irrationally during times of crisis is our ability to see past the immediate situation. If you need further proof of that statement, consider the fact that most people acted reasonably throughout WWII despite being bombarded day in and day out with news reports warning them that Germany had invaded Poland etc.. Maybe because those days weren't as traumatic as today makes them seem. And perhaps instead of focusing so intently on short term deadlines, the American government should move toward longer term goals and solutions. The way many scientists view things nowadays, the environment is constantly changing and thus problems developed slowly over several decades are best avoided by taking incremental steps towards remediation rather than descending immediately into the full blast panic mode which often results in excessive actions and reactions. Conversely, imagine if we began tomorrow morning with nothing done except putting money towards building nuclear power plants. What preventative measures will we implement first? Will they serve better long term goals if implemented via regulation and taxation? Who knows. However, if we begin our push towards modernity and democracy from an entrenched position of ignorance and corruption in America, we'll almost certainly fall prey to disaster. We're already seeing evidence of that right before our eyes and sadly it seems like every year gets worse. This country is approaching collapse based solely upon moral decay brought about by permissive religious beliefs and political ideology masquerading as science. There is plenty of blame to go around both Republican and Democrat parties along with mainstream press outlets but none of those factors alone warrant a society falling apart under its own weight. Regardless of whether climate change exists or is caused exclusively by humans, the effects would continue regardless of what changes happen to the Earth. Of course there are numerous other causes for societal decline and I'd argue that hurricanes and forest fires combined currently pose greater threat than global warming. Unfortunately the United States cannot survive such drastic cuts to national infrastructure however significant progress towards clean energy production is made. Every dollar spent on either alternative fuels or cleaner forms of electricity generation is worth far more than every tax increase levied onto businesses. Most importantly, the sum total amount of waste swimming freely through our waterways and stored within waste dumps must come to a halt. Soil erosion and pollution aren't exactly new phenomena but luckily the public outcry regarding environmental degradation is growing stronger each passing decade. Hopefully for once, we act sooner and smarter than later. At present, it appears that the game has finally begun. In regards to caring for oneself, therapy helps greatly. Surely everyone knows someone they trust who can understand depression and anxiety. Letting off steam with friends and family is helpful as well. For medication specifically, anti-anxiety pills offer help to calm nerves and relieve stress a bit, caffeine probably isn't recommended due to negative side effects. As far as losing hope goes, it is important for anyone struggling to remain positive. Seeing a therapist regularly can allow one to recognize patterns in behavior and achieve pointed objectives. It's hard living in denial but failing to acknowledge reality eventually leads to extreme mental distress. Drugs are obviously dangerous and shouldn't be used unless absolutely necessary. In order to avoid contracting diseases such as HIVsexual activity becomes generally 'offendable amounts. Most recently none of the various professional business classes are.
