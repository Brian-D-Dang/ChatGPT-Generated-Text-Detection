I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several dogs and none of mine has ever hurt anyone that didn't try to bite me first!! Seeing the thread title though (if not its contents) my advice would be don' t buy any AUDIO product from this company!!! If it was only paper products - no problem! Bad quality bad results with all those devices they produce...
