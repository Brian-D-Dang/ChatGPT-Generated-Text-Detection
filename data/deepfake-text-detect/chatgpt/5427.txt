For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to the past few weeks when I have seen hundreds of people contact me saying they've experienced sexual assault and harassment on campus. I still haven't even gotten to day one yet but I am hoping that some sense prevails within the community as soon as possible because it seems like there are many more victims than ever before. What do you mean by "represents" MeToo? Yeah I don't know much about the movement myself, so please forgive my ignorance if this is not what you were asking for haha
