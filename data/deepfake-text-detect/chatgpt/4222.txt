I realize the OP is a bit vague, so let me clarify. Similar to false advertising, I believe that people who release lies (in a publishable, marketable format). This includes media companies, such as newspapers and magazines an easy example of this would be "deception in the form of fiction" But does it have to do with telling the truth?
