First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however: We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is a disease. People will tell you that being PC makes you unable to speak your mind and others' minds are much more important than yours or mine. That's false; their opinion isn't worth shit because they're not equipped with critical thought capacity necessary for understanding basic things like "Who gives a fuck what someone else wants?" This gets even worse when we get into cultural appropriation nonsense which was started in an attempt to curtail white people doing anything remotely non-white. This doesn't stop most black people from appropriating every single thing ever but nobody says anything about them unless it concerns rap music. It means if you wear something asian then you must be Asian but also can't say one word against another culture without getting called racist. Non-whites don't have this problem at all. White males aren't allowed to talk either so they just shut up until someone says something absurdly stupid and hateful taking advantage of the many exceptions made for everyone else. Many whites suffer under persecution complexes due to the above issues. The truth hurts!:) Everyone should learn how to think critically. There's no excuse why anyone who has been alive long enough hasn't learned some form of logic yet.
