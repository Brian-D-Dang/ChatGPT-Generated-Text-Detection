I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need a smoke? No, they are usually stressing over something else. I'm not gonna argue that nicotine is not addictive. The reason why people are addicted is because they are addicted to the physical act of smoking. If someone is addicted to the nicotine they could just vape it and not be a slave to a deadly habit. I'm not a health nut, I don't try to force my opinion on anyone, and I don't care if smokers want to smoke, I just think there are better options. I want to start the argument with the statement that I would rather be surrounded by smokers than chewers. Smoking is a much cleaner habit than chewing, at least in my opinion. With smoking, the only thing that comes out of their mouth is smoke. With chewing, they are spitting. I would rather be surrounded by cigarette smoke than chewing tobacco spit. I am not as concerned about the addictive substances in smoking as I am about the 4000 chemicals that are added to make it taste better. Even if you don't care about the addictive chemicals, nicotine and carbon monoxide, you should care about those chemicals. If we start to ban tobacco, it will make life easier to ban other dangerous chemicals. Think about the ghosting you see in old photos. Those are old photos. If it wasn't for the use of chemicals, those would still be pictures of real people. Now, those are pictures of ghosts because those people are dead. What do you think? Let's talk about it.

I was never interested in reading the books. After the first season, I tried reading the books. I didn't get far. I just don't understand how someone could write a 1000 page book without a single chapter. I could never read something that long. I'm just not that into reading. The show is much better. It's one of the few shows I'm actually interested in watching every week. It's one of the few shows I actually care about. I have a few favorite characters from the show. One of my favorites is Tyrion Lannister. I think he's one of the most interesting characters on the show. It's funny, because Peter Dinklage (the actor that plays Tyrion) is not that tall. He's short, but very athletic. His build is perfect for the part. He could pull off a lot of the things that Tyrion does. I'm a big fan of his because he is one of the few honest characters in the show. Everyone lies to each other. Everyone lies to themselves. Tyrion is the only one that I feel like I could trust. I'm not a huge fan of Cersei Lannister. There are a lot of reasons I don't like her, but I'm not going to list them. I'm not going to say why I don't like her, because I think it would take a lot of time to explain. I'm just going to say that she is a really bad person. If I were to explain why, it would take a long time. I'm not going to do that. Jon Snow is also one of my favorites. He is one of the most interesting characters in the show. His story is very interesting. It's a good story. Jon Snow is one of the few characters in the show that I feel like I could trust. He's one of the only characters that I feel like I could be friends with. There are a lot of reasons I like Jon Snow. He's honest, kind, and compassionate. He is also really smart. He has a lot of tactical knowledge. He's also a leader. I like how he cares about the people he leads. He is one of the few characters that actually cares about the people that he is leading. He's also one of the few characters that doesn't care about money. He doesn't care about what's important to his family. Speaking of family, I like Arya Stark. She'
