Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I 'm not sure why they feel this way, but they do. The reason why some people think black and white are not colors is because the traditional definition of color is a property that comes from the visible light spectrum. Black and white don't exist within the visible light spectrum, which is why some people believe they are not colors. However, it is important to note that there is more to color than just the visible light spectrum. For example, there are colors in the infrared and ultraviolet spectrums that cannot be seen by the human eye. Thus, it is possible to argue that black and white in fact can be considered colors since they exist outside of the visible spectrum.
