Estimates show that the average american uses around 4 times the resources that the planet could support, if everyone was an American. These numbers are somewhat lower in Western Europe, but still higher than what would be sustainable for the planet if everyone consumed resources at that level. It's important for us to be mindful of our consumption habits and make changes where we can to reduce our impact on the planet. Some ways we can do this include reducing energy usage, using public transportation or cycling instead of driving, reducing food waste, and choosing products with sustainable materials and packaging.
