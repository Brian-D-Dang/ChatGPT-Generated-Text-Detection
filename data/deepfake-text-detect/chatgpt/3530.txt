The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as a tattoo on the lower back or ankle). It's important to clarify this discrepancy so that the argument is clear and precise. If the argument is specifically about a visible forearm tattoo, then it should be revised to reflect that. If the argument is more broadly about tattoos in general, then it's important to ensure that the title accurately reflects that as well.
