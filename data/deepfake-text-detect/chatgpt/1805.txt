Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one party becomes tired of that person and wants to leave? Is there a break up clause? Are you legally obligated to pay child support if she doesn't want to be with him anymore (assuming it was an open relationship)? This is where things can get sticky because in New York State this type of prenup isn't enforceable. It's generally assumed when people agree not to sue each other over money that they're also agreeing about kidsfinancial obligations but most agreements don't include such details. In fact according to Girl Lawyer NY Sec 118 (a) "Prenups are not contracts...that bind spouses into matrimonial obligations." This means that even though it specifically says "spouse" above, licenses on college deposit plans only require students who have been married three years before the start date of their first semester at college unless both parties sign separate contracts specifying otherwise! So while those types of non-legal agreements may prohibit fighting attorneys from splitting settlement dollars among themselves should something go wrong, albeit rare occurrences occur all the time which lead some couples out of wedlock to still receive alimony payments as part of civil settlements...they typically do so without including anything about child custodysupport issues between spouses taking different paths post-divorce since courts aren't really equipped to adjudicate them anyway. The author of the article seems like he understands what he signed when he agreed to his wife having her own bank account outside of the joint checking account set up by his parents' divorce decree just fine but then advocates against signing these kinds of agreements for romantic relationships going forward. I wonder how much more valuable two year old jokes will become when people stop paying attention. If someone makes a funny joke now everyone will remember; whereas if it were forgotten 10 years ago nobody would care ask Bill Murray. Will people similarly forget the maxim of the piece within ten years? And talking women back into marriage - maybe some day we'll talk robots harder than men. Try telling your laptop to marry itself - and see if it works. (It probably won't.) Or try asking Siri to stay late to help you fight Al Gore. You might get lucky. But speaking seriously, the fact that humans seem incapable if understanding good advice is showing us we need to figure out new ways to teach our children. Maybe AI can model aspects of human nature better than traditional teaching methods reduce. Perhaps we could make shitty analogies less useful. The key point here, i think, is that divorces shouldn't happen right around puberty. Having had several friends who went through similar situations fairly early, i've noticed many problems arise later down the road due to lack of communication. Not sure what solution is best. Managing teenagers requires a very delicate balance between freedom and authority. For example moving is hard enough at 16, let alone 17 and 18. Being given permission and control over money matters is far easier to manage once you understand what is involved in managing money well yourself. At least until AIs catch up:) If you read the linked NYT article[1] the problem starts long before the teenager hits seventeen. Often times girls feel pressured by boys to take risks sexually, often leading to rape accusations 11 days later. Nope, too early IMHO. Too young. And yes, giving teenagers the ability to access cash now results in teenage girls feeling pressure to commit sexual acts upon older partners [2]. Actually, if you spend some serious time looking, there are studies proving that teens learn about pornography at younger ages than previously believed, yet for whatever reason there has never been research done about whether porn has a negative effect on sexuality development in adults.[34] In my opinion, implying that women can't consent to sex based solely off their body size is problematic in the extreme. In addition to making adult decisions about bodily autonomy and personal responsibility, schools ought to communicate broader moral values instead of focusing exclusively on learning basic math skills. What kind of message does society send if they promote a culture that teaches teenagers that if a boy proposes to a girl, forcing her hand by threatening to report her for prostitution is consensual? Confronting students today with questions about sexuality is important, but training them to believe that college acceptance depends entirely off of SAT scores alone is counterproductive. Even worse, encouraging university admissions in general feels like a de facto endorsement of affirmative action programs designed to favor minorities over whites and Asians. Teach meaningful lessons about gender equality and racial justice, then worry about helping bright, diverse students apply to colleges. One thing to keep in mind when dealing with high schoolers regarding credit cards: I'd argue that using credit responsibly while attending college is probably preferable to starting off irresponsible with debt. Many of them end up getting scammed trying to get out of student loan repayment and find themselves owing 60k at 25. Two Four 1 4 32
