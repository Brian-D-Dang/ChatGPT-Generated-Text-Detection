First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. I've seen it happen quite often and they're usually not very nice people who don't know better anyway. I imagine if you were a foreigner they would get upset because they didn't understand what happened to you but as long as it wasn't really hurting anyone else or something.
