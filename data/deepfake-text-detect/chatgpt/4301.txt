I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that some rapes are not as bad as others. It's taken me 30 years to realize what the real problem is - it's that we have ten times more rape than other crimes; that there aren't enough police officers for every social worker or counselor who needs them; that we can spend billions of dollars on our military and still cannot adequately protect us from the enemy - let alone stop crime. If you hear anything like the above, don't be surprised if someone calls you a liar!
