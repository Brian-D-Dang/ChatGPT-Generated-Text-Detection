Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the victim is killed and their body put into a freezer until it can be retrieved later on! It may seem sad to watch someone's lifeless corpse decompose but there is something more sinister that happens with bodies left in freezers - these corpses begin to decay before our very eyes! What Is Dehydration?Dehydration occurs when the body loses too much water through sweating or breathing. This means your blood volume will decrease; meaning less oxygen will circulate throughout your system. This eventually causes serious health issues such as gout, kidney failure, stroke and even death if not treated quickly. While it may sound impossible for a body to lose enough fluid to reach this point without someone noticing, dehydration does happen daily from 40-50 loss over months because you may think nothing of it. How Do You Prevent Dehydration?The same way preventative measures like drinking 8 glasses of water every day help us avoid heart disease: drink lots and lots of fluids! Alcohol dehydrates people just like soda, juices and fruit drinks do and depletes your body of necessary electrolytes, minerals, vitamins A, B-12 and potassium which can all cause brain fog and confusion. Peppermint tea has been found to counter alcohol's effects on the liver, kidneys and stomach resulting in improved cognitive function; however, alcoholics should not consume any herbal teas at all since they can lead to increased uric acid production and damage hepatic enzymes which further increases dehydration risk.
