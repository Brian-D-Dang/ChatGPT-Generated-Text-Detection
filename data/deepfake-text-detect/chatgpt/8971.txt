To me growth of economy is a meaningless statistic. Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange. What kind of person evaluates actions in terms of the amount of money? What are the odds that someone will buy, sell or receive something at some point of time? Markets have always been about trusting people to predict what they should or shouldn't do when given the opportunity. So we would say that if the economy is growing it's because the government has promised more money - not because it can't afford to get more. We don't know how much this will be paid for, but we certainly wouldn't want it to decrease in value. And also there's no guarantee that economic activity will continue without increased taxes. I'm sorry you feel like little people matter. It might pay back a bit later on but it won't be.
