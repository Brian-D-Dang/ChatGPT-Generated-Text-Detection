One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? Here's my reasoning: The same amount of people would have to get degrees in order for everyone to be on equal footing with one another. When they graduate from high school and go into their 2nd year at school, there are around 800k Americans aged 18-22 (according to Bureau of Labor Statistics). There are roughly 200 million Americans aged 22. So if every single American got a bachelor's degree in 4 years, then we'd need 6x as many people getting them than what it is currently now. That means each student needs 120 times more classescourses or 120 times more professors than they do today...meaning less courses per professor and lower quality education overall. This isn't even taking into account other things like increased amounts students settling on majors when not intending to become future teachersdoctors, decreased wage rates given all students hold similar low paying jobs post graduation since most don't make enough money anyway without any type of financial aid because you're only making 20 an hour plus living expenses (and becoming expensive over time), etc. So how does anyone justify giving "everyone free college tuition" assuming tax payers will foot the bill? And why can politicians seem so certain about it happening after all these years while looking back at history proves otherwise? I did see a lot of comments along the lines of saying "you won't have as much competition for qualified workers," but even those people fail to realize that companies still want employees who know things like calculus or computer programming; whereas before, schools were pretty good at teaching students basic concepts which was nearly sufficient. If anything simply having a broader pool of potential candidates present themselves gives employers greater leverage in negotiating wages and working conditions. Why am I bringing up math? Because it really shows how stupid the assumption is that "we'll just let everyone learn whatever they please." Everyone doesn't choose to major in engineering, business management, or computer science. We raise kids knowing its important to take general eds or something else such as artmusicchoir. While some may desire specialized education in say medical fields or physics, others prefer schooling where they could study English literature or dance. Its the exact same thing regardless of whether everyone gets a full ride for four years with no debt attached or none at all. Why should someone who wants to study medicine or law suddenly turn down two years worth of tuition instead of going through four years of school when they already went through 8 years of elementary high school for little gain beyond learning how to read write? It makes absolutely zero sense unless it takes away opportunity for everyone to pursue their dreams. How does our current system encourage people to work hard and achieve greatness? By opening doors for them personally by allowing them to load up hefty loans to finance years of studies towards higher paying, better positions once they graduate. I'm not sure why someone who decides to major in political sciences or philosophy shouldn't qualify as highly skilled amongst potential hires depending on how well he she performs in interviews. There's nothing wrong with wanting to learn anything besides accounting and learning social skills because it helps attain job offers but surely you'd think students would benefit immensely from being exposed to various subjects throughout life especially considering many professions placed great emphasis on broad knowledge rather than specialization. Doesn't anyone see the massive flaws in your logic above? What a smart guy! You figured out how to save America billions of dollars yet didn't foresee any problems whatsoever?! Think outside the box here pal! Or perhaps they saw controversy brewing ahead of time and took steps to prevent it. Look into it sometime.. To round off the story, here are some articles addressing issues brought up. Maybe they help shed light on the subject matter: - The short version. Government funds in public universities have grown considerably faster than inflation during the past 30 years meaning federal taxpayer funding became increasingly larger percentage of university budgets. A Democrat President favoring increasing government involvement in healthcare and private businesses. Rather than blame Republicans though, look closer at how unions increase costs among graduates via collective bargaining. Failing to understand how colleges maximize profits via large endowments. Cost of attendance negotiations done annually between state lawmakers and Universities responsible for setting prices. Campus Reform article on a University of California system board member arguing tuition increases create safer campuses based upon statistics showing violent crime rate declines. A: It is clear that a long period of reduced demand for labor combined with rising cost of goods mostly due to energy subsidies leads to deflation. Over time, falling real incomes can lead to the loss of purchasing power and eventually fall in employment. However, we are reducing the number of things like quickness since hours. What is assumed to show off applies to study concluded they assume) good intentions to evaluate is failing for as for
