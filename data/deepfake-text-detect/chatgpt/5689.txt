People who have no interest in politics, and are not interested in learning about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it its their civic duty and that it helps the country. People who do not have the time to learn about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it is their civic duty and that it helps the country. Educated voters are more informed voters, and informed voters are less likely to vote for candidates who do not share the same values and beliefs. As for the "if you don't vote you have no right to complain" argument, that's just nonsense. You can have an opinion, you can advocate for change without voting. It's one of the reasons the US has a two party system. If you don't like the way things are you can actively work to change it. It just takes some effort and work on your part. I'm tired of all these "If you don't vote" posts. Going into a voting booth and putting a ballot in a box does nothing. The only time your vote makes a difference is when you get your butt out and volunteer your time and effort to help get the right person elected. This is the problem with this country today. People want everything handed to them. If you want to be a part of the system and actually do something other than fill out a ballot every four years, then you need to do your part and get involved. I agree with you, but there is a significant difference between a citizen who is not interested in politics, and a citizen who is not interested in learning about politics. I'm not talking about people who are too lazy to care about voting, just those who are not interested in learning more about the candidates and issues. With a system like we have, people who are interested in politics are more likely to vote. A majority of citizens may not be interested in politics, but a significant portion of them are, and that is enough to get us by, and keep us by, because people who are not interested in politics tend to also be not interested in politics. I understand what you're saying, but I still disagree. I'm in the habit of voting, and I always have been, even when I was too young to vote. And I've always encouraged others to vote. The more informed voters are, the better off we'll be as a country, and the better our candidates will be. If a person is interested in politics but doesn't vote, then that's on them. They have no one to blame but themselves. But I do think it's important to encourage voting. It's such a low barrier to get involved that there's really no reason not to vote. Yes, but to take your point to its logical conclusion: if I don't drive a car, and don't pay taxes, I have no right to complain about the roads or the government. I think that is an excellent point. I think the main problem is that a significant portion of the American people have no idea how the government works, or how it affects them. This has resulted in the current state of affairs, where people vote for candidates based on personality or charisma, instead of for policies. This, coupled with apathy, allows the politicians to do what they want without fear of repercussions from the voters. This is why I'm in favor of moving away from the current single-issue voting system, and towards something like the parliamentary system in the United Kingdom. The people would vote for a party, and the party would appoint their own people to the legislative branch. If a party wins 45 of the vote, they get 45 of the seats in the legislature, and the same goes for the executive branch. It would solve the problem of the current electoral college system, which is that you have 51 separate elections instead of one. It would also make it easier for a minority party to gain power, which would help break the gridlock. That's a very interesting idea, but I'm not sure that would work in the USA. We're too big for a parliamentary system. I'm pretty sure the EU has a similar system to what you described. The EU has a parliamentary system, but it is not the same as the one I proposed. Each member country has its own parliament, but they are all unified under the parliament of the EU, which is the executive branch. Yes, I think so. It seems to work fairly well for them. I think the problem is that the majority of people
