Snowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned. Snowden did not have the authority to decide whether the information he leaked was important or not. His only option was to choose between risking being caught, and the information remaining classified, and having the information leaked, but the risk of being prosecuted for leaking. Obama's move is not only for humanitarian reasons, but also for the right to inform the public of the actions of the government. Obama should be praised, not condemned for this action.
