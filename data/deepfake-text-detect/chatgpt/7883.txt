While it is true that Studio Ghibli films may require an adjustment in viewing habits and cultural perspectives, that does not necessarily make them overrated. In fact, one could argue that the films' unique and nuanced storytelling, rich visuals, and complex characters are precisely what makes them so highly acclaimed and appealing to audiences around the world. Moreover, the idea that an entire studio's body of work should be dismissed as overrated simply because some viewers may struggle to appreciate or understand it highlights a narrow and limited perspective on what constitutes quality art and storytelling. Rather than dismissing Studio Ghibli, we should embrace and celebrate their ability to challenge and expand our worldview.
