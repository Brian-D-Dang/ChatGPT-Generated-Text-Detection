So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But we have to start somewhere. Thirdly, when there was legislation passed in my state last year establishing a six-week paid family medical leave program for employees who become or remain ill with COVID, this also meant child care support payments would be available while they were out sick - something many New Yorkers don't receive through their employer plans. And as you know too well, if an employee has no coverage at work on those days off, then either heshe must dip into savings during said time (and some people lack adequate savings), or turn down reliable working hours elsewhere so they can take two weeks off, but lose income from these lost shifts. For families struggling financially due to job loss because of pandemic fallout, this is even more critical than ever before; especially since health insurance premiums continue to rise along with the cost of living. Finally, your recent OpEd piece describes how much our businesses depend upon women being present to make them run smoothly: "The most powerful force inside companies...is not men...it is mothers." So true! In fact, according to research conducted by Keller Williams Realty's 2019 Women Who Built It survey, 75 of real estate agents surveyed believe having parents in the workplace turns out better outcomes for sellers looking to sell homes online. As a mom whose children do everything together outside school every day, imagine trying to build a business without sufficient childcare benefits! We need help making sure our economy stays strong enough to allow all parents - not just moms - to earn the cash flow they need to pay rent, put food on the table, buy toys and books, etc., let alone contribute positively towards the collective good. Families should never feel forced to choose between keeping up appearances the image vs. raising healthy kids. We shouldn't be afraid to ask, or talk about, what makes us tick, rather than simply assuming we'll find solutions spontaneously. Think about it: When did someone invent the concept of fathers taking care of themselves? Or kindergarten teachers teaching boys to tie knots? Why aren't more companies offering flexible working schedules? Better yet, why isn't everyone required to work remotely, like almost everywhere else around the world?! The answer here may lie in trying ourselves to see differently, which could potentially lead to greater innovation across industries to accommodate differing needs. I hope you will consider writing another article regarding this topic once this crisis ends so the conversation continues, for the sake of our communities' future prosperity and wellbeing. Thank you again for sharing your thoughts so candidly, sincerely, and intelligently. Thankyou for reading and responding to my letter, Macy. You're right: Our society does have many biases against pregnant women. And 6 weeks away doesn't seem long enough anymore given today's realities.
