First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people. I am not in any way condoning this. It was a bad idea then, and it's a bad idea now. I'm not that type of person. I'd also like to point out that the piece of paper that is the Constitution is pretty much a joke. I'm all for equality and all that, but even I think that this is a bit much. If you're not offended by being asked to pee in a cup, you should really be offended by this: This isn't a law. This is an unconstitutional piece of legislation. The Constitution does not mandate that you go to the bathroom when requested to do so. In fact, it doesn't even mention bathrooms. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this is a waste of taxpayer money that would be better spent on something that would actually be useful, like food and water for children. And if you're not offended by this, I don't know what to tell you, because I'm pretty offended. Also, I've decided that I need to start giving my blog entries titles. I think this one would fit perfectly with "Seven Things Everyone Should Know About..." Labels: Constitution, humor, laws, pee, politics, weed I'm sure this is going to be one of those posts that you either love or hate. I guess it really depends on how you feel about the government. This is going to be a political post, so if you're not into that, this is your warning. The other day, I was out for a run. I enjoy going out for a run, but lately, I've really gotten into listening to podcasts when I go. I guess you could say that I'm listening to podcasts while I run. I find that it makes the time go by faster and it's kind of fun. Well, I was out for a run the other day when I noticed an unusual amount of police activity in my neighborhood. There were at least four cruisers in the area, and I noticed what looked like a SWAT team heading toward the apartment complex where I live. It was strange. So, I kept running, and when I got to my complex, there were two police cars and one of the officers was talking on his radio, presumably making a report. I kept running and when I got to the front door, there were two more officers out front. I kept running, and when I got to my apartment, there were two more officers in the doorway to my apartment. They were talking to my landlord, and I assume it was to let him know that they were there. So, I kept running, but when I got to my bedroom, there were two officers already there. That's a lot of police for a simple burglary. I know that my apartment complex is nice, and there are nice apartments there, but we're not exactly in Beverly Hills. I started wondering what the heck was going on. So, I did what I normally do when I have questions about what's going on. I went to the news. I couldn't find any information about this on the news, but I did find that the Maricopa County Sheriff's office was doing a lot of raids. So, I looked them up on the news, and that's when I found out the reason for the increased police activity in my neighborhood. The Maricopa County Sheriff's office was conducting a prostitution sting. The sheriff's office was going after johns. This isn't the first time that this has happened. Last year, they arrested 31 johns and 25 prostitutes, and that was just the first day of their sting. This year, they've been doing their sting for two weeks, and they've arrested 23 johns and 30 prostitutes. In case you're wondering, the prostitutes in question were all adults. They were all out there legally, and they were all consenting adults. If you're wondering what they were doing to make them prostitutes, it was mostly people who had been beaten and raped by pimps, people who were trying to make money to support their kids, and people who were trying to survive. There were also some people who were doing it to help pay off their student loans, and
