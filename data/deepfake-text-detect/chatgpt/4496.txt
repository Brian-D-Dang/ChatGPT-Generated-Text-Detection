Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be "free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't matter if your words are true or not, they're just opinion and therefore protected." But in fact there are certain categories of expression which even a democratic society cannot allow. They fall into two main areas: 1) incitement (i.e. using language designed specifically to encourage others to commit crime), and 2) frauddeception (using deceitful methods to secure financial gain). Obviously, these are very slippery slopes - any government that attempts to ban them risks provoking other forms of protest from those who believe their rights have been breached. In practice though, this has rarely proved too difficult for most governments. For example, both Australia and Canada successfully prosecuted individual politicians under anti-spam laws after they solicited donations on behalf of political parties. The same goes for tobacco companies (who used misleading advertising about health effects) and pharmaceutical companies (who marketed drugs as having efficacy when evidence suggests otherwise). These cases were all decided in favour of the prosecution because each case was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the person involved had committed criminal acts by saying things with intent of causing harm (in terms of deaths caused directly due to smoking or drug abuse) or through deceptionfraud (when people paid for a product that didn't provide the advertised benefit). The question we should ask ourselves is whether democracy is capable of dealing with threats in its own back yard. Can we regulate speech so effectively that we never get to see such crimes committed? This isn't easy. If we attempt to prevent people committing atrocities then we run the risk of restricting legitimate criticism of our actions or policies; by isolating people's opinions out of mainstream discourse we create conditions where violence becomes more likely. This leads us to some interesting questions: If freedom of speech really does mean "the right to speak without being punished for doing so," why do we feel compelled to block access to websites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube? I think part of this stems from fear of censorship itself - how much power would people have over social media platforms if they could simply shut down accounts at their whim? Another reason has emerged recently with regards to ordinary citizens' ability to use encrypted communication systems like WhatsApp during emergencies. We saw earlier in 2016 that police and intelligence groups tried to force Apple to help them break into peoples' phones but ultimately failed. Encrypted messaging apps rely upon entropy which means they require active participation from users to maintain balance between the number of messages sent and received. Without enough participants, the app stops sending data entirely, thereby making encryption impossible. As far as I know, no group has yet managed to crack any sort of truly useful technique to defeat end-to-end encryption on smartphones such as iPhone 5s or 6. However, pressure mounted last year leading up to General Data Protection Regulation implementation forcing firms to take extra steps to ensure customers' security. Auditors for the European Union's Article 29 Working Party found flaws in Signal that allowed select entities including members of law enforcement agencies to circumvent iOS 8 protections against brute force attacks by exploiting weaknesses in the cryptographic protocol chosen by developers for iPhones. Even today, many software engineers refuse to support PGP crypto instead preferring key exchange mechanisms based around OpenPGP. But when faced with demands to compromise the privacy of individuals, it seems only one entity stands firm: every single company claims they have nothing to hide and argue that providing decryption keys to authorities amounts to giving away secrets. And while corporations aren't human beings per se, as long as they continue to act exclusively in the interest of shareholders rather than in line with public opinions regarding ethics, freedom and responsibility, everyone else suffers. Why is it wrong for someone claiming that climate change is largely man made to spread misinformation about the topic to dissuade others from thinking critically about the problem? Are companies obliged to work in tandem with law enforcement agents to fulfill requests to decrypt communications? What happens if you publish information critical of the governing party or institution whose interests might be best served by silencing free speech opponents? Where exactly is the limit drawn when your country decides the time has come to deny services to technology entrepreneurs living here illegally? Should companies be forced to sell products or infrastructure to oppressive regimes merely because the US Government says they need to? Governments must respond appropriately when approached with complaints of alleged human rights violations, but at the same time respect freedoms of thought and expression that form the bedrock of any modern democracy. No nation should have absolute authority over speech within its borders. Unfortunately, despite a healthy dose of cynicism about our leaders, few countries seem willing to accept the burden placed on them. While legal frameworks vary across jurisdictions, restrictions on the first kind of threat tend to focus on either trying to limit the content of speech through voluntary codes of conduct and self-regulation measures or attempting to remove harmful speech altogether via outright prohibition. Recent years have seen these approaches hit road traffic going on foot, high value targets and offenses against reality-subsequentitertions taskseled to keep themr. To bring ethical, utech
