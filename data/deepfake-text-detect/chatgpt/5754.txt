[This article] does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article] that lays out the primary problems with the data, but also includes a few other indicators that the author finds more persuasive. If you're a believer in the statistic that 20 of scientists are atheists, I recommend [this article] that breaks down the numbers by fields. The author breaks the fields up into four categories: life sciences, physical sciences, math and computer science, and social sciences. The results of the study are as follows: Physical sciences: 24 atheist, 55 theist, 21 other Life sciences: 25 atheist, 53 theist, 22 other Math and computer science: 17 atheist, 72 theist, 11 other Social sciences: 30 atheist, 33 theist, 37 other If you add up the theists in each field, you get 85 theist and 15 non-theist. That seems consistent with my own experience in these fields. I've worked with people who would self-describe as agnostic, but I would still describe them as theists. So I would put the figure closer to 95 theist and 5 non-theist. The main point I'd like to make here is that I don't find the argument that there is a correlation between intelligence and atheism to be persuasive. If I were to go by that argument, I would say that theists are smarter than atheists because they are less likely to reject theism. It is the same kind of argument that says that if there is a correlation between homicide and poverty, the poor are more likely to be murderers. But the fact that there is a correlation does not mean that the correlation is causal. I think a more plausible explanation of the correlation is that smarter people are less likely to believe in supernaturalism because they have less need for it. I realize that this explanation does not fit into the idea of the atheist intelligence, but it makes more sense to me. As I mentioned in a recent post, I'm convinced that there are social factors that drive many people away from religion, but the ability to reason is also an important factor. Another aspect of the argument that I find unpersuasive is that there is some kind of correlation between religion and intelligence. If there were a correlation between religion and intelligence, I would be inclined to say that religion is a consequence of intelligence rather than the other way around. The following is a response to a comment on the original article that is thought provoking: I'm sorry to say that the numbers you provided are completely irrelevant. It is well known that social science surveys are notoriously inaccurate. They are typically based on respondents self-reporting their religious affiliation, and in my experience, most people will lie if asked to self-identify. In many cases the average person doesn't even know whether or not heshe is a theist or not. In addition, surveys like these do not take into account people who have stopped believing, or who have never believed in a deity but don't want to admit it, or who are agnostic or atheist but don't want to admit it for fear of social reprisal. In a way, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If enough people decide they're atheists, there will be enough people to form a distinct "atheist community." The community will then be the place to go for those that don't want to admit to their lack of belief. You're also assuming that atheists are not brilliant. I think that's naive. I do agree that the numbers are unreliable, but they are the only numbers we have to go on. I'm not sure I buy the self-fulfilling prophecy idea. I would argue that the community would be the place for people to go for those that are afraid to admit to their lack of belief, but also the place to go for those that are afraid to admit to their lack of intelligence. It is the same reason why so many people give fake name to dating sites. I'm not assuming that atheists are not brilliant. I'm only saying that we need to do a better job of distinguishing between correlation and causation. The Hitchens Dilemma The recent passing
