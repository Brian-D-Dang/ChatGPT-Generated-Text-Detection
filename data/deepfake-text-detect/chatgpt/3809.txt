Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself out if the rest of my tax money was not used to maintain this place. I won't upvote because you're an asshole, but I will downvote because clearly I have no idea what's going on here
