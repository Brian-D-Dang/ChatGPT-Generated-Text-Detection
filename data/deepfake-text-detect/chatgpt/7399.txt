While police departments do need to generate revenue to continue operating, relying on revenue raising tactics can lead to a variety of problems. For instance, some officers may prioritize generating a profit over enforcing laws fairly and upholding justice. This can lead to unethical practices like racial profiling, over-policing of certain communities or using aggressive and unnecessary force to justify fines and fees. Additionally, the focus on revenue raising can lead to a loss of trust between law enforcement and community members, which can be detrimental to public safety overall. Therefore, it is vital to balance the need for revenue with maintaining ethical and just policing practices.
