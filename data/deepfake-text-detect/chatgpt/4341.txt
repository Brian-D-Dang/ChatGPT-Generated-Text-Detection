This is something that's always bothered me, all the way back to when I was a kid. I never understood why it was considered polite to say "bless you" after someone sneezes. I remember praying for my parents' health as they were growing up in the 50s and 60s. Saying bless you at some point during an argument would have been like saying "in Jesus name" instead of "amen." It felt so out of place.
