To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, if a lesbian married to a man, he or she would be unable to obtain abortion rights, thus the marriage has to survive in order for him her to get pregnant. The question is whether this decision will actually affect family life as some people might say. The answer may very well change but it's definitely possible. This will most likely only effect women who live with their husbandswife in relationships with men, who also know how difficult those relationships can be even when they were only together once. In the case of incestuous marriages, now being able to marry a woman is seemingly only an option for the couple, not a choice anyone else can make obviously. But don't expect any sort of sympathy from the courts because they already decided what was best for them at the time (which probably includes the rest of society) and perhaps some relief should come out of the ruling itself. Just that the court did recognize that there might be grounds for allowing incestuous marriage even after the fact, although it did so without any specific reasoning. If you are thinking about going into hiding, just remember, even though the judge accepted your argument, it didn't mean much since admitting you were right doesn't mean you are wrong either. There are still some issues here which have to go through the scrutiny of how you feel about any opinions on inheritance law. We can agree that many couples end up having problems finding answers around these matters due to conflicting interests. Perhaps we need more variety in our view of what is best for us. I hope I'm not the first one to write something like "I hate incestuous marriage because it means you must choose between two men and a woman. And neither of us want my parents to put me in that situation (they both consider themselves married). Well...that seems to be enough reason to worry myself!" A reason why I'd rather fight than talk about it is because it makes me feel like I've given them a good reason to keep talking and I just think about all the crap I've gotten through trying to explain all that to them. So what do we do? We can argue legal difficulties related to incestuous marriage, of course, but we are bound by the constitution in the form of marriage bans. It is not a constitutional issue and no matter how you view it, marriage bans aren't exactly the solution. These laws essentially prohibit incestuous marriage and therefore, it simply isn't legal. That said, we are better off without it. We could have gone along with it but instead we ended up with a completely ludicrous legal system where nearly every state in America has laws that ban such things as the 'child-sex act' and 'marriage'. Whether it's about incestuous love or not, I believe that the Constitution gave the responsibility to the states and it does give them the power to decide if there is anything they can do about half way across the country to prevent incestuous marriage from happening again. This is a ridiculous idea. What they can do is enforce more common sense rules than any of what we currently have under current law, and this is a dangerous move for our Constitution. Some of the countries in Europe, for example, have laws banning incestuous marriage but some of them are doing away with the mandate entirely and making it illegal anyway. It's a terrible mistake to give away all the control over everything. So what do we do now? Let's see. Do we allow incestuous marriage to happen again after the courts conclude that other people should get married and then force women to possibly abort separate pregnancies? Or do we leave it up to the courts to determine what happens next? Do we stop breeding and adopt children between the ages of 18 and 23 while deciding how to bond with each other. Of course none of those options work! Of course, we could abandon the whole idea by allowing it to continue as now and only allow it to happen because that would be stupid and hurtful to everyone involved. Finally, it is simply absurd to advocate such cruel laws. They are usually passed in a Republican-controlled legislature and never considered by the person in charge. Instead they pass legislation, create laws about it, try to pass tough new measures, etc., and then hand it over to a party controlled by the president. This is a bad policy and honestly should not ever be allowed anywhere near the federal government unless the bill makes it easier for small businesses to enter into negotiations and pass laws. And one last point...we are responsible for ensuring we protect our pets. Why should we allow third parties to take our pet away and have it thrown away with no recourse? How do we accept that this is our proper duty to protect animals? And why should one care... :, their too - - and: the etc - mostly up the over the from themselves behind the OR even up theirs
