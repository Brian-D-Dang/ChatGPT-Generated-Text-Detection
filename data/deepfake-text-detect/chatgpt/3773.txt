A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that country. In any case, it's a good thing to have two sets of rules for simple languages like Spanish and Chinese. So would you say english is primarily used because we speak less than other languages? Or just the fact that a lot of things are written with it rather than another language Since English is an Indo-European language, it shares many similarities with Germanic languages. It also has its own grammar, but no one speaks it purely as an alternative.
