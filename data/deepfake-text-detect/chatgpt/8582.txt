Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from high school and college) so I understand what you are saying (I don't know if I was raised in CA). Well good luck to you as well. It's always cool when someone gets on my nerves:D Haha yeah it doesn't matter how i'm raised.. sometimes i cry about people leaving me no matter where they live...
