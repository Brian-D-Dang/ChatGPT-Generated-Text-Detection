I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too many for me to even begin to make sense of them..... It's nice when you're here: - A place where everybody knows who you arewhat you have done with your life (which is actually good news) - You can get away from all this city business - which is necessary, but somehow adds up to people being more stressed out than ever before. It's hard to say if that's really true or just a stereotype; what I mean by this is possibly that in every department there are always someone working harder than everyone else. This makes it seem like work is something negative...and no one wants to be seen as 'working'....everyone hates doing things they don't enjoy so much. But at least they won't feel stressed about money, because nobody will demand anything extra from them either. - Sometimes it's quiet - sometimes we go into our secluded neighbourhood on weekends to play volleyball...or read novels, etc. Or maybe take a walk around the local village to see some old houses, or watch an internet movie together while sitting on the porch...there could be other reasons why you might find yourself into these places. Maybe the most important reason though, is simply because you want peace - you want time alone without distractions. And you also need to think about that. Because we live in such a fast paced world nowadays, where everything happens so quickly that it becomes difficult to concentrate, let alone reflect upon your own thoughts. - There's nothing going on....nothing bad anyway!;) No traffic jams, no crowds and noise everywhere......it's like heaven here. When are you going to come visit?:D - You meet lots of interesting people...............this is probably the best part, of course. We often sit outside somewhere, talking about topics ranging from politics to literature to religion, science fiction,etc. Also, almost every Friday evening, there's usually a public concert, or sometimes there's karaoke night on Saturday nights. Many townsfolk attend concerts of famous musicians andor bands, or visiting performers. These events are held in various locations in the area, including the newly renovated Cultural Center downtown, or any number of churches, community centers, museums, schools, parks, libraries. So chances are pretty high that you'll bump into people you know during parties or social gatherings. There might still be worse aspects of living in the countryside, but they pale in comparison to all those things listed above. If you happen to move to another country, then sure, maybe you'd miss out on the culture shock thingie, but when you talk to expats, you definitely hear stories of how great (d?) their experiences were, especially since they had been living abroad for long periods of times (years). To give you an idea about our surroundings, please see the following photos. Of course, all of you looking at them right now might wonder if these images are real or fake; Well, yes, they are indeed REAL!:) For starters, I took them myself back home using my digital camera (the quality isn't very sharp yet, although later today I hope to improve it somewhat), but secondly, both myself and my boyfriend and husband used to play football with the same little group of guys last summer. Anyway, they were taking pictures of us playing soccer after we scored a goal......bear with me.:P Anyway, enough complaining, and onto the main topic......how did I end up moving to the countryside??? As far as I'm concerned it was quite sudden......my ex-boyfriend asked me to marry him 3 weeks ago, and in less than 48 hours HAD TO LEAVE BEHIND EVERYTHING he has known his entire adult life, AND MOVED INTO AN APARTMENT ON HIS OWN IN THE COUNTRY!!! He was determined to leave the country side behind: Besides saying goodbye to my hometown friends, and leaving my beloved cats behind, NO ONE was prepared for us due to family problems. They didn't want us to stay alone, or to travel that path alone. Although I was willing to stay at my parents house until it became clear whether my ex-partner wanted to continue to live with us or move in permanently with his mother. At first, they thought he'd only spend 6 weeks living with her. In reality however his situation got worse over time. After 2 years my brother came to visit us, and one day he said "You KNOW something wouldn't help if his father and sister moved into his apartment fulltime?" Uh oh, I knew I should hurry up and pack my bags, or I wasn't getting rid of my stuffs anytime soon!! Luckily, he agreed to rent a room further down the road to accommodate his daughter as well. Her trip ended sooner than expected and she decided to return to Germany. Everything went smoother than planned: D, and thankfully Mr. Mustered. From a certain element. Bypassing his presence of choice! Finally, after returning, which has beenhandle, failing
