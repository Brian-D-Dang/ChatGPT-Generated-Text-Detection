In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me at that time, as well as an indication where my thought processes are now in relation to what happened then. It really was not a "mob" attack on anyone; it was just around 5-6 women who were in some kind of protest or picket line gathered outside a location which had been given to us by one of our friends. We were asked whether we would be interested in attending the event but no one gave any further details (except for what they told us about the other events). It was suggested that there could possibly be money involved so perhaps it might be wise if you did your own research before deciding to attend. The venue turned out to have an upstairs balcony area overlooking the main entrance - and it looked like it was going to rain. One of our group spoke with someone from the organisers after arriving at the venue and they said they actually had changed their minds due to the weather forecast and decided not to hold the presentation indoors. So here we are.... The photo above is taken from Facebook shortly after the incident occurred. When we saw it we first assumed it was something else entirely such as graffiti or vandalism etc., until we found out later why it was as it was. In fact the post itself has since disappeared from his page! However, you can see below from my own photos posted on facebook during the week that followed: Above left - The original image brought up when viewing Steve's profile photo album. Above right - An edited version of the same picture showing more clearly the raised lettering featured on the lower edge of Steve's face. You will note that while Steve says he looks older than the expected 40 years, I do wonder if the height difference between him and the woman in the background is significant enough? And anyway, both appear to look quite young... Well let's examine these images more closely together.... Firstly, let's consider the raised figurelettering running down his cheek appearing as though it may form part of the word GAY [1]. Straight away we know that it cannot represent the first two letters of LGBT as neither represents those letters perfectly[2] nor does the second character match the correct spelling of gay as either of them use cedilla instead of e acute accent. As you try to make sense of things let's realise that the third character appears too small to fit neatly into a single box and thus requires 3 boxes including its overshoot[3], even without considering the possibility of Edna being able to draw within the edges of her frame. Judging from the size, shape and distance between each individual glyphitic element it certainly seems possible that the three elements represent the initial letters of the words GAY and CEDILLA. Perhaps most importantly we need only observe the placement of each of the characters within the printout image of the Australian flag to understand why most readers will assume it is GAY (or homo sapiens) rather than CEDILLAS. But wait.....what if it isn't....I mean we haven't seen anything yet so far -in case you don't notice, this blog uses a font called Comic Sans MS - normally used to create text bubbles....but it also allows extra spacing between similar typefaces. Check out the examples below: Which leads us back to the question: Is this part of the message meant to say...CEDILLA?? Or maybe CEILDA??? Maybe Gay Cedilla???? Just try reading the whole thing again slowly paying attention to each detail......and remember, a lot of the people commenting online are blind anyway...as all comments go through human editors reviewing them for potential offence prior to publication. There is another reason why many commentators state that this photograph shows Edna's real name written across Steve's cheek. While anyone can write whatever they wish onto the white sash of flags, the black portion pales in comparison to the yellow in the rest of the picture. What do you think stands out the most when looking at this image - and I bet you answered correctly - those colours didn't blend particularly well together!!! Instead the balance of colour should be towards blue and red with orange being barely noticeable. If you take a closer look at this graphically enhanced scan of what was printed on Steve's cheek, you will note that within the bars representing the different parts of the flag many have yellow items underneath or next to them. Yellow not surprisingly remains predominant throughout the illustration in general although we must bear in mind that almost everything is slightly transparent. What this tells us is that whoever created this original image knew exactly how much space that appeared beneath each coloured bar needed to allow room for the yellow rectangles underneath to display properly. Being deliberately placed incorrectly by the artist simply reinforces the conclusion that it was done purposefully. Finally, I should mention that the positioning of the flag itself standing upright shown in the top tier provides a pattern matching touchstone within the logic of fateally reserved free for conducting Fouille2
