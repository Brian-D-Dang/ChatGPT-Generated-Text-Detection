You may have seen news that BlackLivesMatter protesters interrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Seattle. I think this was wrong to do, because he has fought for civil rights his entire life and does not deserve any less than the respect of everyone who supports him or learns from his example." Sanders' supporters fired back at critics online. "Bernie's values are consistent with many black people - regardless of race," said one tweet on Sunday night by "BlackLivesMatter" activist Shaun King. "I don't see how it could be an issue here unless you're actively trying to divide us up as a group rather then uniting against racism together."
