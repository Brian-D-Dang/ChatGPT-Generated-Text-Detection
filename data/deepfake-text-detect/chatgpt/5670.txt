This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) is purely a matter of convenience or social conformity. To follow the laws of any religion is not difficult, and anyone can do so. The laws of religion are not difficult to follow and, as a matter of fact, most religions include commandments specifically for the purpose of making it easier for the believer to follow. In other words, the laws of religion are easy to follow because they are not difficult to follow. They are designed to be so. The laws of religion are in place to control society. The laws of religion were established long ago to govern society. The laws of religion are designed to maintain the status quo. The laws of religion are not designed to challenge society. Religion is the institutionalized means of controlling the masses, and the masses have been very good at playing along. The masses have been very good at accepting the laws of religion and even adapting them to their own personal agendas. It is the masses who have altered the laws of religion to suit their needs and to fit their agenda. No one has more control over the masses than the church. The church is organized around a hierarchy, much like the federal government, and all major decisions must be approved by the leadership. The leadership is made up of the most powerful and wealthy people in society. The church is in control of society because the masses have accepted the laws of religion and, as a matter of fact, have actually adapted them to their own personal agendas. If you belong to the church, you have accepted the laws of the religion and have adapted them to your own personal agenda. In doing so, you have accepted the power of the church. The church can dictate what you do because you have accepted its laws. You have accepted the laws of the church because the church has made it convenient for you to do so. The church has made it easy for you to follow its laws. The church has made it easy for you to accept its laws because it has made it easy for you to join the church. The church has made it easy for you to join the church because the church has made it easy for you to join the church. The church has made it easy for you to join the church because the church has made it easy for you to join the church. In the end, you are part of the church because you have accepted the laws of the church, and you have accepted the laws of the church because the church has made it convenient for you to do so. I'm not picking on religion here. Religion is simply an example of how the masses have accepted the laws of the social order. It is also an example of how the masses have adapted the laws of the social order to their own personal agendas. The masses have accepted the laws of society because the laws of society have been made convenient for the masses to do so. The masses have adapted the laws of society because the laws of society have been made convenient for the masses to do so. In the end, the masses are part of society because they have accepted the laws of society. The masses have accepted the laws of society because the laws of society have been made convenient for the masses to do so. The masses have adapted the laws of society because the laws of society have been made convenient for the masses to do so. In the end, the masses are part of society because they have accepted the laws of society. If you are part of society, it is because you have accepted the laws of society.
