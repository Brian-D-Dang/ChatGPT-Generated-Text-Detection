Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. The one thing that separates the average rapper from great ones (in my opinion), is an excellent ear for beats. You have to know how to mix and eq your vocals so they fit perfectly with the instrumental you're rapping on top of it I disagree completely. It's easy as fuck but there's plenty more involved than just putting lyrics over music
