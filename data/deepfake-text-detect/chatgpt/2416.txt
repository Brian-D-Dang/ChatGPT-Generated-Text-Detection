EDIT: Lots of very well rounded, interesting points. Thanks! Really helped with my perspective. EDIT 2: I've been awarding deltas to people whom have been making some very good, solid arguments but haven't received any upvotes at all as a sort of gesture for their effort in helping me see the other side more clearly and completely -I believe that it's important to acknowledge those who are going out of their way on an open debate website like HN.pThat being said, here is something from one user which seemed worthy enough (referring to his first comment):p"Experience trumps education." The general understanding seems to be "If you can show someone what they don't already know... then that person will learn faster than if you just teach them how to do X." This makes sense; experience time more knowledge to draw upon when faced wa new problem or concept.pi (Note: this post was partially inspired by reading pg's essay on Open Contribution) ip One thing worth considering about productivity increases due to learning vs. ones based purely on experience comes down to diminishing marginal returns. Is there really anything wrong with saying something along these lines? Experience is valuable. However, given two employees doing similar work over many years their actual rate of productivity may not vary much even though each employee has learned vastly different things during those years. In such cases, wouldn't rather investing your limited resources into teaching new skills yield better results overall since both parties would reach maximum potential sooner?
