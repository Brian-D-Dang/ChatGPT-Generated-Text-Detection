Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. "That means that marriage is only for the sake of having children, and you don't even have to have children to get married, so why get married at all?" Because that's not how marriage works. People get married, not because they will have children, but because they want to spend their lives together. (Obviously this doesn't mean that they won't have children, but it does mean that marriage is not for the sole purpose of having children.) They get married because they want to share their lives with another person. They want to be a team. They want to know that there is someone who is always going to be there for them. They want someone to be able to trust with their secrets and dreams. They want to be able to share their lives and grow old together. (That's not to say that they won't have other interests, but that doesn't mean that the marriage is solely for those interests.) They get married because they want to have a family with that person and they want to support that person in the family that they have. Those are all very positive things. But let me be clear: marriage is not an obligation. Marriage is a choice. It is a big commitment. It's a long-term commitment. But it is not an obligation. It is something you choose to do. You have to be ready for that choice, and you have to be ready to make that choice for the rest of your life. It is not a choice that should be taken lightly. To answer the second question, I would like to point out that marriage is a covenant, not a contract. While contracts are agreements between two parties, covenants are promises that you make to God. A contract cannot be broken, but a covenant can be broken. When you make a promise to God, you need to make sure that you can keep that promise. (I know that is not exactly how a covenant works, but that's how I see it.) Marriage is a commitment to another person. If you are not willing to commit to another person, then you shouldn't be getting married. But even if you are ready for that commitment, you have to make sure that you are ready for the next 50 years. You need to make sure that you are ready to go through the ups and downs of life, and that you are willing to put up with the other person's faults. To answer the third question, you need to understand what marriage is. Marriage is a public, legal, and spiritual commitment to another person. It is also a legal responsibility. While this does not mean that you need to get married in a church, it does mean that you have to have a legal marriage. You have to go to the county courthouse and get a marriage license. You have to be able to prove that you are married in the eyes of the law. That means that you have to have a marriage certificate. The reason that this is important is that marriage is a legal contract. The legal contract is what protects you. In other words, if your spouse dies, you get the insurance money. If your spouse gets injured, you can sue the other driver and get the insurance money. If your spouse runs away with all of your money, you can sue them for that money. You have a right to the money that they made while they were married to you. (Which is the only reason why people get married in the first place!) I am sure that people will question why I would choose to be married to someone of the same sex. I am sure that people will question why I would want to marry someone of the same sex. I am sure that people will question why I would want to marry someone that I love and care for so much. But I will tell you one thing: it is not to show off. It is not to make a statement. It is not to make it easy for other people to identify me as a member of the LGBT community. It is not to show that I am ready to accept everyone and everything. It is not to show that I think that marriage should be available to everyone. It is because I love my spouse and I want to spend my life with him. It is because I want to make a commitment to him and because I want him to make a commitment to me. It is because I want to make a promise to him and because I want him to make a promise to me. It is because I want to make a promise to God and because I want God to make a promise to me. It is because I want to be married and because I
