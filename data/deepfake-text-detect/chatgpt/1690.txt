It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet. I've always found it funny when you see a car on the freeway and there is no sound coming from its exhaust pipe but then as soon as someone gets in front of them, boom, you get a ton of noise for their little ride... The problem isn't so much what comes out of your tailpipe - think more along the lines of how fast can you fit all this shit into such small space? Motorcycles have been around forever (and will continue to be) and yet we still need a license plate on our bike just because some douchebag thought he was too cool to put one up there before most riders!
