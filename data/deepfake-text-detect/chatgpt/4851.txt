Before anything else, let me say that I am not, nor have ever been depressed, suicidal or abused in any way shape or form. My life so far has been nothing but good and amazing.... But something changed on Tuesday October 6th 2016 when everything seemed to be falling apart...I found myself staring at the news of an earthquake hitting my home country....in tears begging God why are you doing this? Why did You bring us here now? I felt as though He was trying to tell me something. A few things had happened before then which made me feel like it might happen again.....but what could possibly trigger such a massive event without warning?? The answer came back "YOU"! Yes YOU! A month prior to all this happening there was one thing which caused a huge change within me.....my love for Jesus grew exponentially. Like nothing I had experienced before Jesus. In fact, it became more real than reality itself. It felt as if I was living with Him forever. As soon as we moved into our apartment he started talking about 'Our New Home' and how beautiful it would look once finished. There were constant conversations about His plans for us both. We always talked about meeting up whenever possible so we never missed out on chatting by phone while constantly looking forward to seeing each other face to face next time. More often than not I wasn't away from him longer than 2 days sometimes just 1 or even less because I knew whatever day it may fall upon He would want us together. He proved himself right every single time, his timing couldn't have been better....the closer we got to christmasHe said to get matching Christmas outfits. What kind of gift is that?! But Luke surprised me too, he bought me a gorgeous red suitcase especially for packingshipping stuff to Australia. Just another example of God's perfect planning making sure I was prepared for our travel I'd also gotten engaged recently (a long overdue:p) but unfortunately due to circumstances beyond my control marriage didn't go ahead. Anyway, yes, those two coincidences combined created the feeling inside of me that it was almost inevitable something big bad would happen. After moving in together and getting engaged I noticed an incredible shift in Luke since becoming involved with me emotionally. Before we met Luke was full of energy and vitality, for some reason in the last 12 months he went through a transformation where he lost much of his physical strength, he rarely smiled anymore and usually ended up sitting alone reading books or playing video games. This is very unusual behaviour, normally guys who deeply care about their girlfriend won't sit around watching TV on her birthday instead they will spend time with her going shopping etc..or maybe take her somewhere nice later in the evening. This felling I've seen in men many times over the years, many people experience the same with their partners yet they don't see a connection nor do they understand why......willingly sacrificing themselves for someone they truly care about makes no sense whatsoever until after the relationship has come to its end. Something has definitely gone wrong and I think that it is tied directly to Luke becoming a Christian spiritually and losing all hope in worldly pursuits. According to Scripture humans need salvation first and foremost because unless we live according to Christ's commandments we cannot enter heaven simply because Jesus loved us enough to die for us ...this can only mean we failed miserably otherwise. If anyone cares to read below are a list of reasons WHY I believe that Luke killed himself: 1-Luke stopped smiling laughing 2-Always sat around reading 3-Never shared anything intimate with me (we used to talk regularly via text whilst being separated, today we barely message other than daily life questions). Have no idea why he suddenly decided to stop sharing these details 4-Took hours off work everyday and still never left the house except for school trips i.e. gym, library, church, eating out and walking someone down the aisle 5-Stopped calling his friends; hasnt spoken to them in 5 weeks despite staying close during times of separation 6-Hasn't showered fully since January 7-Had no interest in anything including hobbies he enjoyed previously 8-Now talks nonstop about football, money problems, politics, women's rights etc. 9-No patience with anything under 5 mins 10-Belligerence and anger management issues have escalated to unprovoked rage at strangers and family members 11-Deep sense of guilt consumes him 24hrs 7days a week 12-Regrets marrying me 13-Is extremely frightened of dying 14-Lives solely off food delivered to him 15-Comes to bed late and wakes up early 16-Doesn't brush hair 17-Wears clothes colliding against skin 18-Never asks "How are you" ever 19-Looks 25yrs older than age 20-Makes random noises 21-Changes his diet on whim (only eats salads during the summer) 22-Drinks wine only knows 23-Has never drunk alcohol 24 Does is a bit tip 25 For objects does should know vannal v 26 Can a
