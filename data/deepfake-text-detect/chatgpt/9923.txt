First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces users to think in a certain way by having comments with the highest upvotes appear first. This means that often, comments that are more popular or "agreeable" will be pushed to the top while dissenting opinions are downvoted and less likely to be seen by other users. This can lead to groupthink and an echo chamber effect, where all users agree on the same thing and any opposing views are not heard. This can be detrimental to Reddit as it reduces the diversity of thought and makes it harder for people to have meaningful conversations. In order to combat this, Reddit could introduce several different changes. It could make downvotes anonymous, so that users don't feel the need to conform to what is popular. It could also limit the amount of upvotes a comment can get, so that it doesn't become too popular and drown out other comments. Additionally, Reddit could allow users to sort comments by different criteria, such as most recent or most controversial, so that users can see different perspectives. These changes would help to reduce the hivemind tendencies of Reddit's comment system and create a healthier environment for discourse.
