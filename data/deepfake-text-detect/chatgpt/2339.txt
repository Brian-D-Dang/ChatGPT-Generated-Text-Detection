I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our country should be a fiscally responsible teenager). As an adult I've become sick of being told how evil Republicans are because they want "to take away people's health insurance." In my opinion it seems like many Americans have been convinced to vote against their own interests. So if you're reading this thinking about voting for Obama again just keep in mind he said we would never go into war with Iraq....
