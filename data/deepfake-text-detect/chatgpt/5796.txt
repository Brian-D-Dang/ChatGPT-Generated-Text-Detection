The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here] . Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion. Now, I'm not a Christian, and I'm not a scholar in theology. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've never read any of Weinberg's books or essays before. So, I am not going to comment on the validity of his claim. I am only going to respond to his quote. I completely agree with his second sentence. I think that it would be ridiculous to say that without a religion there would be no good or bad people. I think that people are fundamentally good, that good people can do good things without religion, and that evil people can do evil things without religion. I am not an optimist, however, and I don't believe that good people will do good things. I believe that we're all going to do what we want to do. It's true that we are fundamentally good, but as individuals we have our own goals. Those goals don't line up with everyone else's. And, unfortunately, those goals conflict. I think that religion is a tool for people to find an identity and a purpose in life. I think that it's okay for people to find that purpose. I think that it's okay for people to be religious. But, I don't think that religion is an insult to human dignity. I think that it's a wonderful thing. I think that religion is the reason that we have so many good people. I don't think that people are fundamentally evil, I think that they are fundamentally good. But, I think that our primary goal in life is to try and succeed. I think that we often use religion as a way to motivate ourselves, and I think that religion is a good thing for that. I'm not going to pretend that I know the full motivations of why people do what they do, but I'm sure it's not entirely religious. I'm sure that most people are motivated by something other than religion. And, I think that the same thing can be said for those that do bad things. I think that if a person is truly motivated by a religion, then they would not do bad things. And, I think that if a person is truly motivated by something other than religion, then they would not do bad things. I think that there is a lot of good in the world, and I think that most of it comes from religion. I think that we have a lot of good people in this world because of religion, and I don't think that we would have nearly as many good people if it weren't for religion. And, I think that the same thing can be said for those that do bad things. I'm not saying that religion is the only good thing in the world. I'm saying that it's a big reason that we have so many good people in this world.
