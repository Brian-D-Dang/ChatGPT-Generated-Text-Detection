Triggers, as they are currently being used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People's feelings are real, and it is important to acknowledge them, but triggers are not responsible for the way someone feels. It is important to understand that everyone has different experiences and reactions to certain stimuli, and what may be triggering to one person may not be to another. It is also important to recognize that triggers can be both internal and external, and are not limited to certain types of situations or experiences.
