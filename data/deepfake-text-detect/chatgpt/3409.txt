Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make sure their children or loved ones have access to higher education without incurring significant debt. It's difficult to predict what college tuition will be like in 18 years, but historically, college costs have risen faster than inflation. However, there are ways to prepare for the future. One option is to start saving early, either through a 529 college savings plan or a savings account specifically designated for education expenses. Another option is to research scholarships and grants that may be available to your child when they reach college age. It's never too early to start planning for the future, and being proactive about saving and researching can help alleviate some of the financial burden of college tuition in the long run.
