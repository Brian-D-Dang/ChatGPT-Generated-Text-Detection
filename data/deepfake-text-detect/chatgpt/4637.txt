Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for "sleeping around," and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of appreciation. The point here is that we should be prepared to defend this position on its merits; i.e., that a female who sleeps with someone other than her husband can still have value without further qualification than just being an attractive person whose sexual activity was deemed valuable by another human being (i.e., whoever marked up the scorecard). We must do so realizing that there are many men out there who will scoff at such reasoning as well-meaning but foolishly misguided nonsense...or worse yet, take offense at their own wife or girlfriend's "loveless" life choices because they don't feel like she needs to find happiness outside herself instead of within those relationships which God has ordained between them in marriage. It seems then that the only two ways to counter these kinds of arguments would be either show how such logic could lead us astray, or simply argue directly against the validity of the idea altogether, since our defense hasn't really addressed anything specific about what I've presented here as objective truth about sexuality. In short, one cannot argue from such premises against something unless you first assume said premise was true, hence my argument in favor of the above principle in comparison to Objectivism itself.
