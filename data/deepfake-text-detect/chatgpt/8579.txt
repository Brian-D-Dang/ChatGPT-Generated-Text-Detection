My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother has issues, and she wants to tell him about all of that, but he doesn't want to see anything. Or does she? I wish I had your friend in my life right now so we could talk and live out our lives together...
