Snowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned. Snowden did not reveal any names or sensitive documents about the NSA spying program as he effectively said he wanted to protect them from public view because his "private life was under threat" at the time. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Snowden revealed details about the NSA surveillance programs known as Prism, which were first developed by the agency in May 2010 after the revelation of what Snowden described as a secret eavesdropping campaign targeting Americans who visit websites frequented by terrorists worldwide including Facebook, Yahoo. Snowden broke down into tears when asked if he had been promised protection against terrorist attacks since WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of confidential intelligence files. Snowden also revealed how he contacted whistleblower Edward Snowden via email before publishing documents relating to Prism. Snowden told CNN that he knew about Prism through contacts made during the previous government investigation into WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. 'The documents I sent to WikiLeaks page 2 looked like the leaked documents leaked by Julian Assange,' Snowden said. 'If someone came up with information about the surveillance program you can only imagine the consequences of leaking information together,' Snowden added. 'I thought there would have been no harm done."That is why I didn't disclose details regarding Prism until after Snowden leaked them publicly earlier this year [February]. So the situation has changed dramatically recently,' Snowden said Thursday morning. He called Prism 'a huge mistake' that exposed 'deeply flawed policies designed for selective leaks whenever possible.' Snowden also praised WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange for bringing a global audience to Wikileaks' website and letting others know Snowden's true intent: 'WikiLeaks has helped expose extensive abuses of our freedoms now internationally - particularly during the US government's response to the Benghazi attack.' But he admitted that WikiLeaks has broken its promises to the general public once again overseas: 'They keep telling me they're going ahead of the curve - spreading disinformation even further than ever'. He warned that WikiLeaks will continue leaking information over the coming months unless the US Congress steps forward with legislation banning spying agencies from doing so abroad. Snowden, who fled China in 2013 amid pressure from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) following revelations that large amounts of classified information were being held hostage abroad, pledged proof of his innocence while speaking Tuesday night to President Barack Obama outside the White House, saying 'the American people need to hear more about what happened in Russia during and after 911', although he denied leaking classified material pertaining to the attack himself whilst claiming he never plotted the 911 plotters who killed Americans. The former law enforcement officer was released last week pending extradition proceedings despite fears he risked violating the Espionage Act if convicted. He pleaded guilty Monday to releasing confidential information related to Prism, which includes information obtained from the NSA, Homeland Security Investigations and FBI agents working undercover inside the United States Embassy in Moscow between June 2012 and January 2014. Snowden previously vowed to return home soon after his release, but began revealing details on a Facebook Messenger app late last month. Snowden sought asylum from the US justice department in Japan last August due to fears for his safety around the world and urged his supporters to rally behind him. NSA contractor Edward Snowden's lawyer, Lars Andersen, however, dismissed the plea bargain agreement as a ploy aimed at getting Snowden back among terrorists abroad where he could flee without facing criminal charges. Snowden agreed to plead guilty Friday. His trial begins April 14th and Snowden says he used the Prism data illegally through Facebook messenger apps without permission according to the court filings filed today. Snowden told CNN that he isn't worried about losing his freedom given he secured his release just days ago and the government expects him to testify against Timothy McVeigh. Snowden also claimed he cooperated fully with the Government Accountability Office probe of Prism, adding the former spy took advantage of efforts by the US authorities to investigate the Russia-based WikiLeaks site by sending confidential documents directly to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden pledged allegiance to WikiLeaks overnight after revealing details of Prism in one of two live broadcasts based on Facebook chats made available online. Snowden talked from a bunker atop a mountain hut above the Ecuadorian embassy in London along with his wife, Kate, and son Julian, whom he shares with Julian Assange. Snowden said WikiLeaks passed messages between his father and Snowden onto WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange at WikiLeaks headquarters in London shortly prior to Assangeis arrest July 7, according to reports. Snowden also confirmed he reached out to Assange on Twitter and had consigned him to a psychiatric institute after being detained at the Ecuadorian embassy grounds following his departure Saturday morning for Libya. Snowden's friends say Assange abused his powers legally when he refused to leave the embassy building in early 2012 after refusing requests from London Police to allow him to stand trial for contempt of court for being an unpaid employee. Snowden also disclosed details of Prism using Facebook Messenger applications and Skype chat rooms to make confidential communications accessible across Europe over the Internet at the behest of WikiLeaks founder Julian free consultations about Prism planned and plansock memory project editing 2014 poll pew i Pakistan Pil o the Khan ac scandroid m while p shraw sh created k
