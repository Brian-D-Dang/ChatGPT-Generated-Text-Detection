Snowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned. Snowden did not break any laws when he released the documents; his act was an intelligence gathering operation, conducted as part of our national security programs. You're delusional for thinking so. Yes, there may have been other ways in which we could get this info out without ruining our national security capabilities, but fucking hell what would you do if you had access to the entire NSA database?
