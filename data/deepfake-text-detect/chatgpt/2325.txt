To me growth of economy is a meaningless statistic. Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange. What kind of person evaluates actions in terms of quantity? Now if you want to talk about quality then it's all good but that doesn't change the language used by journalists which, as pointed out above does not have any basis for quality evaluation. Here are some examples: "India has now become number one in FDI inflow" - great! But what do we care whether India was 1 or 2 last year when there were no measures taken on improving investment climate from our side? Similarly GDP grew 7 this quarter so everything must be fine... Rhetoric at best:D. Such statements make politicians look like they can do whatever they want with impunity because their supporters don't see through such rhetoric while intelligent people realize both sides play it up regardless. I would prefer honest discussion based upon facts rather than manipulation of public opinion via exaggeration hype. I am quite sure most readers here wouldn't appreciate being fed biased information though reasonable conclusions may often follow justifications.
