Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I really need a group of friends for. Then, we will rent a house and open houses (actually if you're having trouble finding someone to go with, they can use their own space). I am very excited! The first thing that came to mind was the idea of getting a new therapy dog. We have a great therapist, she is amazing, but just wasn't sure how well she could do for us since we've been on her meds for so long. We are going to build our own puppy out of wood scraps for this process. A few years ago, my mom explained that in order to get better at developing dogs, the dog needs to eat healthy food from before it eats any animal products. So, now when I see them eating foods in the grocery store, they start eating only one type of food. It must be something like that or it's a new diet? Either way, I want to know what others think because I really don't understand how this works. What would the treatment entail? Can I make it so he can eat it all? Did the trial and error work? Is there an actual therapeutic benefit given after every meal? Is the diet real, I mean it's simple, well paying, and safe? I also bought a lunch box a while back that says "Dietary Chocolate" in the one box right next to it. While I do not know exactly what diet or taste I'll try to research and find out more. At least, I hope so. If you'd like to ask me questions about anything else, feel free to message me via PM. I really appreciate your messages though!
