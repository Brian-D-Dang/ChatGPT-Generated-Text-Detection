tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to the NFL, College Football or even hockey...watching all those teams play each other is just so much more fun than watching individual players. It's almost like they're competing for something and that makes me want to cheer on my favorite team even harder.
