EDIT: Lots of very well rounded, interesting points. Thanks! Really helped with my perspective. EDIT 2: I've been awarding deltas to people whom have been making some very good, solid points as well as myself. Some of these points are very good for the group, and I've decided that the points awarded should be rewarded accordingly. Please keep up the great posts! 1. We are talking about a group of players who are very capable of handling themselves. Many of the members have been in the SG for a long time, and have had the experience of handling the general public. 2. We would only be asking for a handful of players at a time. If we are asked to help a random griefer out with a blockage, we are usually only dealing with one or two players. 3. We will still be able to choose what happens with the group. It is a tool for players to utilize, not a dictatorship. If we decide to kick someone from the group, it is still a valid option. If they are in the group, they are in our trust, and they have a say in the group. 4. When we have 2 players in a given instance, we will have more ways of dealing with an individual griefer. The group will be able to take down a blockade and run the griefer, or simply run them over. The group will also be able to call for back up. 5. The group will remain very un-OP. The only thing that would give us an advantage over an individual would be a larger group. 2 players would be a strong advantage, but 3 players would give us a huge advantage. 6. The group will be able to auto-dismantle structures. This is to prevent us from holding up a mining op and blocking access to a node for others. 7. This is only a suggestion for a group. It is still an idea in development, and is open for comments and suggestions. 8. The group would be on a private channel, and would not require access to a computer. This is for the players who would rather not have to be sitting at a computer to be part of the group. 9. The group would be able to be accessed via a macro. 10. If someone is trying to blockade a node, they can easily be detected by the group. The group will have a macro that will detect their actions, and they will be removed from the group. 11. I am not trying to start any kind of group war. This is merely an idea, and I am open to comments and suggestions. 12. The group would allow players to mine other nodes, and not just the one they are at. If they are mining on a node, and a blockade occurs, they can simply go to a node with no blockade and keep mining. 13. I'm not sure how to deal with instances, but I'm sure that there are plenty of players who can think of ways. 14. I'm not trying to start a group war, just allow players to have an advantage when it comes to blockades. It's a very nice idea, but I have to say that it would be OP. If this group is going to be played by active members of the SG, whats to stop them from voting in the blockade-starter? Or even worse, they could create a group that can only be joined by people in the SG. There are a few flaws in this system as it is, but we could make it work with some tweaking. I would also say that players can easily be detected if they are constantly mining andor helping blockade nodes. Players who are constantly mining at a node will be noticed, especially if they are being hostile about it. Sure, but that is not the point. This group would allow you to be able to mine without worrying about being in a blockade. If they are constantly mining, they are likely being hostile. This is something that will be a major point when creating the group. I think your idea has a lot of potential, but as PJ pointed out, there are flaws that could become very big problems if you don't pay attention to them. The best way to avoid that is to make it so that people cannot join the group unless they are in the SG. This is to prevent people from taking over the group and being able to blockade a node for a long period of time. This also allows us to be able to choose what we allow in the group. Another thing you have to think of is how players are detected. In order to have a successful group, you have to be able to detect when people are
