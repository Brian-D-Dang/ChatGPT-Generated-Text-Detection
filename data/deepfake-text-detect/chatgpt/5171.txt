I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need to smoke? It also means smoking is pretty much a good thing too if you enjoy it! Yeah I don't know why people take the lightbulb out of their eyes... it's not like you're going around causing accidents by accident all day long....
