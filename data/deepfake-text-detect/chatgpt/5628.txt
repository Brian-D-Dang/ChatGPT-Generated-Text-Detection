I do not support GMO's and do not want to consume them. Many other countries have restricted GMO's because they don't consider them safe alternatives. I personally don't believe that they are, but am also not an expert in the matter. I am more worried about the health of the average consumer, and would like to see more studies and information available to determine the best course of action. The USDA approval is based on studies that are paid for by the companies themselves, so they may be biased. The World Health Organization concluded in 2004 that the current testing that is being done on GMO's is inadequate and that more studies should be conducted to ensure the safety of GMO's. It also concluded that the GMO's should be labeled so that consumers are able to make an informed choice. I am not convinced that GMO's are as safe as they are being told. I do not believe that GMO's are safe, and I do not believe that the studies that are being conducted by the companies involved are fully disclosed and independent.

I support labeling GMO's because I want to know what I am eating, and I do not believe that there is enough information available about the safety of GMO's to know that they are safe.
