It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be a great education tool for kids and adults alike, and they provide an opportunity to show people about other animals as well. Until quite recently, zoos were strictly forbidden from keeping animals in captivity so that people wouldn't hurt them. But a group of activists has decided that it is in the animals' best interest to be in captivity. They believe that zoos are a way to educate people about other animals, and that they are a great way to show people how animals will be mistreated if they are kept in captivity. Scroll down for video. One activist believes that zoos are a way to educate people about other animals, and that they are a great way to show people how animals will be mistreated if they are kept in captivity. Another - who was not involved with the protest - thinks that zoos are a way to educate people about other animals. She says that zoos are a great way to teach people about other animals, and that they are a great way to show people how animals will be mistreated if they are kept in captivity
