I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past decades, the United States has been remarkably slow to respond and has had little or no response from the international community. The denialist method uses the economic crisis as a pretext to point out that U.S. nuclear weapons are still operational and their warheads are being deployed. It also makes it difficult for international partners to fully understand how our refusal to "accept" these weapons poses a risk to our world's safety. The US devotes significant resources and manpower to developing new nuclear power plants and conducting studies on them. By doing so, we can claim victory over China and Russia. We cannot claim defeat against Iran. Both countries must realize and accept full responsibility for their actions and make peace with the situation. And we will not allow any other country to be used to destabilize us or our interests by its reckless acts. This is why I think the Obama administration should give up its role as the U.S. ambassador to Israel. He does exactly what he says he wants to do, but for some reason it seems like he is trying harder than ever to undermine his own mission in a way that would make it look good to him. That's just plain wrong. Obama has long said: 'During my tenure at the White House, there was never a moment when I didn't agree with President Bush's administration's decision on whether to withdraw all U.S. military support in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and the rest of Central Asia, including Pakistan. America immediately withdrew all bases in Iraq and Afghanistan, all deployment limits, and all ground forces deployed until they were safely transitioned into safe havens. In response, Congress passed legislation requiring all foreign troops to remain in Iraq and Afghanistan; however, twenty-six months later, no change was made to those requirements.' (Washington Post, August 31, 2007). On June 3, 2009, Obama announced that he would end his campaign promise to keep the United States in Iraq. At the time, I wrote that the American people were deeply concerned about the fate of American security and that the president should let the terrorists know that there is a possibility of war and violence if the government refused to comply. Our elected officials duly took notice and voted to end the Iraq War. They worked hard to create a level playing field between Washington and Baghdad where both sides could negotiate acceptable terms for peace while maintaining very secure borders. To fulfill the promise, we ended the occupation of Iraq in 2003 and moved back to the Middle East in 2006. But the fact remains that neither side pursued negotiations with each another after the last major conflict in the region. In order to further improve relations under the Bush Administration, we must learn lessons from the failure of the previous administration of George W. Bush. If we fail to find compromise with the Iraqi government, however, our relationship with Washington will take the worst form when Iraqis go through intense rivalries, which means there is a greater chance that we may be forced into continuing hostilities with them. We need to force the government into implementing the conditions set forth in the Peace Treaty. Otherwise, we will continue to be plunged into another era of brutal and destructive wars. While the United Nations Security Council has agreed to provide 10 billion annually to fund reconstruction efforts in Iraq, and the State Department has pledged 100 million toward rebuilding weapons facilities that are capable of providing uninterrupted humanitarian aid, the defense budget is well below the national reserve budget of 7 billion. Even though much of the financial burden lies with the Iraqi government itself, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has already suggested that the new Americans will spend more money on reconstruction projects rather than building or acquiring new arms vessels. Having spent nearly two years promoting the cuts in the U.N. Security Council budget, the administration needs to step up its rhetoric and address persistent concerns about Afghan arms sales. Instead of increasing funding for the UN Security Council or shedding what amounts to some 25 billion in annual appropriations for U.S.-led activities worldwide, the administration must turn to the United Nations International Children's Fund - an important source of funding for local children affected by poverty - to contribute to programs such as the American Sustainability Program that help ensure that Afghanistan's girls get a quality education. Most importantly, we need to be able to recruit children who will go on to become champions because they think the same way we do when they see our sons on TV. This is why I urge the U.S. Senate to pass Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.2 A coalition of Republicans, Democrats and conservative groups is urging the U.S. House of Representatives to approve a bill repealing Obamacare and turning away Medicaid recipients who pay premiums less than the federal minimum income tax, which is currently 1,200 per year. When reached for comment, it is clear that the overwhelming majority of Americans.
