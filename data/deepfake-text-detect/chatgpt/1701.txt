Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. I think if you went back in time and gave them each one of those qualities then perhaps it would change their view of what an animal is or isn't." The group also cited studies from last year showing how cows can recognise faces even without being able to talk. One study found that cows could distinguish between two adults at 16 times greater than humans when presented with images of another adult's face alone - while higher-order animals such as dogs were only capable of distinguishing up to five individuals. Another 2018 study concluded that a "cute factor" does exist among cattle, likely due to the fact that humans have developed other social forms for interacting with livestock. The paper, published in Veterinary Science, observed: ...] cows seem to enjoy human interaction not because we 'feel good' about our interactions but because this provides positive benefits including access to food resources (e.g., green grass), an alternative home away from danger and protection against predators."
