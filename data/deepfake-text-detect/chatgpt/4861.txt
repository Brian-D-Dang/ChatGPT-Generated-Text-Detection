Posting on my secondary for obvious reasons I grew up in a extremely abusive house. I dreaded coming home and the site of my mom made my heart skip a beat. She always tried to make me feel like it was all her fault, that she couldn't take care of us kids because of how we were as childrenteenagers (even though when you do the math there's really no excuse). My dad had many mental issues stemming from his childhood which he never talked about. My mother died recently at 58 years old after a long battle with breast cancer. In the last months before my mom passed away we started having conversations where she told me things that she hadn't previously mentioned or wanted to discuss during her life time. Some of these statements are quite disturbing but they helped me gain a better understanding about myself and what happened growing up. It is important to understand yourself so if your parents or other relatives try to put words into your mouth then listen to them more carefully than usual. This kind of therapy can be very difficult to open up to others and even easier to shut down ones self by listening to their opinions instead of the truth. All in all this has been an eye opening experience for me.
