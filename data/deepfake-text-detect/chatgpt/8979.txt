Edit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) This isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a certain level of intelligence to figure out that there's something more important than food and water unless they are just two dogs or cats with a decent sense of smell.... I'm going along with the sentiment that you have to take whatever with a grain of salt, if we're talking about animals then I'd say the 'junk' should only include natural predators like humans and some small mammals. I'm not saying this is true in this world but we do protect against pretty much everyone. Also don't forget about the fact that you can kill yourself, which may very well happen. But perhaps we as humans are also ALREADY capable of killing ourselves. Or even worse: that could happen to anyone we care about, so why don't we just let our pets die? With no choice other than to give up their meat. Not doing so would mean killing them, because now that they've died from eating (well maybe in death, but NOT in life). So what we could really do is make sure the animal doesn't eat itself again, even when the person eats it alive! We know that animals have to be eaten by people before they have any kind of competition, so that makes us a bit less likely to kill ourselves. My point was that we shouldn't fight over animals that have been raised with (or killed with) food. If we allowed all wildlife (cattle, sheep, goats, etc.) to starvedie off in ways we couldn't control, then we might still be able to save things like people and the environment from extinction. Don't call me crazy, but that seems to be the case. So how does one end up with the conclusions that we have reached, without having to sacrifice several animal lives? Stuff like this happens when we believe religion is powerful enough to stop us from killing others. The problem is that there's nothing stopping us from being Christians if we worship one or another after all. Yes, yes, and no. It's hard for people to accept the idea that "the devil" has a moral imperative, or even that he is an infinitely stronger creator and God than we think, that's why he exists. He simply created humans to save humanity. And I agree. His creation is his greatest sin. Jared, this scares me that most people aren't aware of this fact. They are all afraid of it. It's sad to see how many people ignore that fact. It's almost like those sick bastards print anti-Christ signs on their cars. This is just my opinion. First off, I'll tell ya...I hate birds. Secondly, I rarely hear of these sorts of attacks. They catch people, who hide behind rocks for all they're worth. That's why I avoid them altogether. Unfortunately, they also escape into the woods, where you often find them hiding under trees. Third, despite our attempts to keep them away from public view and other tourists, we were attacked on the day we left our hotel room. They came chasing us down the steps leading into the building. My mom did their job. They didn't come at us. I am absolutely terrified. They hung out in front of our house until they got back in the bedroom and I started crying. Then they ran away. I wasn't trying to play around with a cat last night, ever. She had been sleeping in her blanket.
