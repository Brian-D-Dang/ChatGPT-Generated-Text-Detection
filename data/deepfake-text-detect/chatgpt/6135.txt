I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. The Japanese and Germans were inevitably going to lose militarily, but that was not enough for Japan or Germany to lose the war. The USA and USSR were going to win the war militarily, and they were going to win the war economically. There was nothing that either nation could do to prevent that from happening. That is why the war was ultimately lost by both nations. What was lost, in terms of war aims, was victory over the Axis in the sense that the Axis Powers surrendered unconditionally. That was not a war aim of the Allies. The Allies' war aims were to kill as many Germans as possible, occupy as much territory as possible and to turn Germany into a vassal state. The USA was able to achieve its war aims in terms of killing as many Germans as possible, occupying as much territory as possible and turning Germany into a vassal state. The USSR was not able to achieve its war aims of turning Germany into a vassal state. The USSR was unable to achieve that because the USSR's war aims were not the same as those of the USA. The USA's war aims were to kill as many Germans as possible, occupy as much territory as possible and to turn Germany into a vassal state. The USSR's war aims were to kill as many Germans as possible, occupy as much territory as possible, and to turn Germany into a vassal state. Germany was occupied by both nations, but the USA did not turn Germany into a vassal state, and the USSR was unable to turn Germany into a vassal state. The USA was able to achieve its war aims in terms of killing as many Germans as possible. The USSR was able to achieve its war aims in terms of killing as many Germans as possible. The USA was not able to achieve its war aims in terms of occupying as much territory as possible. The USSR was not able to achieve its war aims in terms of occupying as much territory as possible. The USA was not able to achieve its war aims in terms of turning Germany into a vassal state. The USSR was not able to achieve its war aims in terms of turning Germany into a vassal state. The USA and USSR both achieved their war aims in terms of killing as many Germans as possible and occupying as much territory as possible. The USA and USSR both failed to achieve their war aims in terms of turning Germany into a vassal state. In terms of the war aims of the USA, they lost the war. In terms of the war aims of the USSR, they won the war. By not turning Germany into a vassal state, the USA lost the war. By turning Germany into a vassal state, the USSR won the war. The USA and USSR were not able to achieve their war aims in terms of turning Germany into a vassal state.
