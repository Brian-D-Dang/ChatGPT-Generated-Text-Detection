First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways and behaviors do NOT match the way you think about dogs from other sources or movies, etc...etc.. Of course my dog is raised to be good around people, but he's never been trained in any negative manner (not even for "bad" like biting). So when it came time to give him his first lesson with strangers (children), we just let them come up to him without the usual routine-pretend game that most owners use before giving treatstreats to get introductions over with. Of course children should always have some sort of adult supervision present while playing, because anything can happen between kids animals. But if someone was afraid our Chihuahua would bite their child, or even worse, attack - then yeah of COURSE we'd probably want her leashed and under control at all times as well....but by no means does she look down on anyone else! She doesn't try to bite or chase kids who don't try to play with her properly either.....hence why so many parents leave their young kids unsupervised around dogs in public places. They might say something cute like "She loves your face!" Or "He wants a kiss!." And what would those poor little kids know? That there could easily be an injury involved due to a poorly handled pet? And lastly, how much more dangerous to walk around a small yappy dog than a big one?? People seem to forget these are two very different species. Just because a dog acts a certain way toward humans - doesn't mean it will act differently towards another animal period. Regardless, yes every dog needs training, obedience classes, socialization......and proper manners also including tail Waggin' and head Bowing. It may sound dumb to teach puppies'sit', but wait until they start eating dinner outside alone everyday...they'll really appreciate being able to sit perfectly still next to food dishes upon returning home too:) As far as letting your dog out during nap hours goes, please understand that Nap Time Dog Time!! If your dog isn't used to napping away from home, chances are it won't sleep through its set bedtime until MUCH later in life. Most dogs are usually better off staying inside for extended periods of non-nap-times rather than trying to fight through sleeping indoors 24x7. In addition, having a dog go unchecked outside ALL DAY LONG leads to accidents, excessive shedding, boredom, separation anxiety, backyard problems such as barking fights, etc...etc...so needless to say, it creates more issues than solutions overall. The biggest factor is if the owner has a place where the pup can lay comfortably and safely without them entering into harms way. For example, if your front porch is open enough so that the dog can see you clearly walking past, thats ok.......as long as your backyard fence lines aren't thick, your neighbors yards dont surround yours on three sides (which lets them potentially invade both backyards) or you've got a bunch of trees blocking your view of said neighbor.....then maybe your puppy shouldn't be allowed outdoors all day long... But again, I'm sure you understood everything I wrote above;P
