Scientists widely accept that climate change is real. Consequently, they say that it will lead to extreme weather, a raise in the sea level, increased acidity of the ocean, reduced biodiversity and extinction risk for many species... So you are probably wondering how can we deal with this issue: A good way would be eco-friendly energy production, so as not only to limit the temperature rise but also prevent environmental pollution. But there's an important detail here: France has been working on nuclear power since the 60s! The French government produces 71 of its current electricity needs by using nuclear reactors; it's about 80 in Germany. A significant part comes from fossil fuels like gas or oil, which causes serious greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions too. So what should happen? Should we stop producing any more nuclear power plants altogether? Some people think so because it's dangerous and expensive. Others argue producing renewable resources could help us do away with nuclear power if done right. What news outlet should you trust when listening news about "nuclear energy vs renewablesother sources of energy"? I know where my vote goes...
