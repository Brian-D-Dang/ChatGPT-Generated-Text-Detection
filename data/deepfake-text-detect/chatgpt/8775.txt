We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been "thin shamed" or "skinny shamed" by another woman. I don't see how that is possible in American society, even for a country like ours (which can be shallow and ugly). We're only projecting her opinion on you. She's very small, she doesn't know what to expect when she gets hit and it probably won't happen again.
