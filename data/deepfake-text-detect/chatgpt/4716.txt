Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I don't want to have to worry about later. I was thinking the beach would probably work best (cool weather and close enough for a cab), but some friends of mine are getting married in London next year and their wedding is going to be like 300 guests! Sooo... Are there any suggestions on what other locations you think could host a nice small event? Thanks!! TheBlakeDawson wrote:Alrighty then, here's a couple of ideas based off the question. There should be plenty of options if you're looking for one specific location or styletheme. Beach - The beach sounds pretty awesome. It can seem strange at first since this will be an intimate affair, but when all your friends come over from different parts of the world, it really creates an atmosphere. This also gives you the option to go with a formal dinner feel, which does sound very classy. But depending on who comes you may not need as much detail because they won't notice things like flooring patterns, etc.. Plus, beaches tend to get crowded during summer time - too many strangers in an area isn't always ideal. Also, if there are multiple weddings going on throughout the day, you might run into issues especially solo weddings where you'd only see half the group arriving. That just depends how busy the city gets though. If you do end up moving forward with a beach theme, you'll need something like sand driftwood tables with white tablecloths. A lot of hotels offer rentals, and those usually include chairs and glasses. Best bet would be a rental company that specializes in weddings (like WeddingWire has). In addition to sandy floors and clear glassware, try to create flow within the room. For example, move away from bathrooms near showers. People generally enjoy being less dirty after showering regardless of gender. You'll also find fewer lines outside by putting food right inside of reception areas. Maybe set stuff out like ice cream sandwiches and cookies instead of chips and salsa, or drinks laid out immediately beside staircases leading down to rooms. Lots of tips like these too help keep an air-conditioned space open while keeping seating comfortable. Some inspiration can be found in here: The only downside to having a beach party is dealing with sand stuck to everything. Since it's constantly blowing around and sloshing back onto dirt, you'll undoubtedly spray yourself with sand once in awhile. Keep towels nearby to wipe down floors and surfaces as needed. At least use disposable plates and cutlery. Hopefully nobody else will bring theirs along.Same concept applies across the board with venues: beach casual; indoor dress code. Other places like parks, museums, conference centers, rooftops, zoos, botanical gardens are also excellent choices despite variations in decorating due to lack of crowds.Most weddings require normally two hours minimum, although most start planning early. However, if you're picking midweek or weekend, hiring caterers can sometimes reduce costs. While you obviously already know whether your budget allows for catering, avoid tipping vendors until AFTER the ceremony. With favors and such, you can give them an amount before the service begins. Again, WeddingWire provides helpful info on tip amounts: eFAQs Because dishes stick easily to plastic utensils, make sure to clean them thoroughly between meals using soap water or dish detergent. Disposable chopsticks or forks can actually withstand the heat of a fire better than metal ones.Wooden cutting boards can cause fires and lead to explosions, so either check kitchen supplies ahead of time or simply pick non-flammable alternatives. When setting up a buffet line remember that as items are removed you're likely to unintentionally toss trash onto a tablecloth. Make sure to take that material aside beforehand. Use zip lock bags or paper napkins to secure leftover treats. Both materials prevent sticky messes that often arise. Oftentimes couples opt for a simple cake, however smaller cakes can fit better into tight spaces. Thus, look into minifridge setups, prebaked cupcakes, cupcake stands, tiered displays, or even mini muffin pans in general. Smaller desserts allow servers to go through sides faster without wasting food.Also, consider smaller servings. Guests typically eat 30 to 50 of their plate at most restaurants. Letting guests fill themselves twice is wasteful. Instead opt for hors d'oeuvres sized portions delivered alongside beverages. Utilize papier mache containers shaped specifically for pizza boxes.You will also need modest lighting levels unless there's ambient light coming from windows or hallways. Onsite generators shouldn't pose problems unless your venue offers outside power. Even battery powered lanterns provide sufficient light. But it doesn't cost the required.
