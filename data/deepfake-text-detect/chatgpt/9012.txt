This boggles my mind. I know that some airlines are different like Southwest because they do not have assigned seats. But why don't people relax until their seating zonegroup is done and prepare for a layover? I've been flying a lot of non-airline routes so I understand where you're coming from. It's just a matter of if they do this or not, it doesn't really make any sense to me. There isn't much else to do other than to take early time off and grab some lunch before the flight, which would mean doing the same after boarding your plane. I guess it would be best if they didn't give travelers at least 10 minutes to realize the rest of us aren't allowed to board while we wait in line.
