While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established people to be quite strange. It's kind of like when folks at work who have been there for 20 years can't accept they aren't as important compared to someone new. It doesn't make sense but it happens all the time
