Counter-argument: Denying treatment or care for children with chronic illnesses would be a violation of their basic human rights. As a society, we have a responsibility to ensure that all children, regardless of their health conditions, are given equal access to healthcare. Chronic illnesses can affect a child's physical and mental development, their ability to learn, and their overall quality of life. By denying treatment or care, we risk depriving these children of their right to health and well-being. Moreover, failing to provide adequate medical attention can also lead to increased healthcare costs in the long run due to treatment of more serious health problems that could have been prevented with early intervention. Therefore, it is in the interest of both the individual and society as a whole to invest in the healthcare of children with chronic illnesses.
