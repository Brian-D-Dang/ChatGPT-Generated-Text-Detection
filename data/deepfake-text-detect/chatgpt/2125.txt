WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in terms of uh...well...being a good role model are involved with interesting technical writing and so on like Dr RMS or Linus Torvalds (I'm not sure if they really qualify as "good role models" but more than likely) Anyways - originally this was meant to be an article discussing the differences between different technologies which have been proposedimplemented over the years by various companies such as CrowdFlower, Mechanical Turk etc.. But it has turned into something else entirely since my original draft wasn't very long nor did it answer many questions regarding those topics nor even explain what exactly went wrong at Amazon's version of these services - MTurk being first amongst them. The reason why I say this is because there isn't any sort of standardization across all of these services despite their commonality within this field; hence making it difficult to compare one service against another while no two similar workplaces want to can offer identical things. Not only does each workplace vary greatly based upon geography, work hours available per day week, pay rates, language requirements needed to perform tasks and other factors outside of your control you may encounter massive issues when trying to connect two platforms whose infrastructure differs significantly either due to changes on how both sides handle payments or integration points required through some API calls necessary to allow workers performing task X to send data back to platform Y where Z resides resulting in systems crash-overload causing significant frustration among developers building applications looking towards integrating said platforms together. It becomes quite convoluted once you start talking about payment processors too! Such problems were prevalent during early days of ebay and amazon marketplace however times change, especially when money begins flowing around and businesses need ways to determine who actually should receive compensation before paying out anything to anyone. Afterall, its just that simple!! Nowadays with blockchain technology beginning to take off we see solutions cropping up right under our noses though most remain untested although others already maintain successful implementations of distributed global marketplaces using web3.js internally today. No matter whether its centralized, decentralized or hybrid system one thing remains true: If someone wants to integrate crowdwork in general including fluffier projects involving art, music creation and design alongside mundane tasks then having accessible APIs throughout the entire process allows you to build tools that makes easy use cases possible for everyone regardless of skill level. As mentioned above, a little bit down below, development doesn't stop here!! Once its built, made easier via automation gurus and increased accessibility combined with lower labour costs results in revolutionary products designed specifically keeping mindset of modern time consumers in mind. Acknowledging flaws associated with traditional pyramid schemes here will help us further understand why self employment opportunities offered by crowdsourcing sites don't necessarily lead to exploitation nevertheless encouraging individuals to earn extra income leveraging skillsets acquired online improves quality of life whilst simultaneously allowing employers to hire talent remotely whenever appropriate reducing overhead expenses related to real estate rental space used previously plus providing access to extremely hard working freelancers willing to undertake pretty much whatever assignment thrown his way free of charge in return for exposure; thus maintaining positive cash flow levels evident inside company's balance sheets well past initial startup phase accomplished solely relying upon crowdfunding and venture capital donations collected prior to final release. Herein lies advantage currently enjoyed by bigger players such as UpWork compared to smaller competitors hoping to make waves in crowded industry vying for attention therefore creating barriers preventing entry otherwise successfully entering????? Well let me just put forth arguments justifying aforementioned statement which provide solid foundation behind "justification"?!? From Wikipedia: An economic theory known as the law of demand states that prices always equal average cost, meaning that producers must sell goods at price sufficient to cover fixed production costs and profits.[1] In order execute this supply curve perfectly equilibrium would occur 100 efficiency produced regardless remaining output unsold once factoring in sales, marketing, advertising spending along with additional production needs undertaken to enhance brand awareness expansion plans aimed at booming markets abroad generating scalability becoming fundamental requirement every business attempting to survive and thrive requires moving forward after starting point achieved by offering merchandise direct to consumer. Simply combining information provided by multiple sources provides insight into what causes specific outcomes and helps estimate future trends accurately enabling accurate forecasts eventually leading to profitable decisions repeating itself until 1 party decides to leave game altogether forced exponential growth inevitably slowing following certain threshold now valuation reaching heights never seen beforehand experience exponentially growing demands placed upon resources obtained elsewhere through tough competitive environment forcing competition expanding steadily losing profit margins rapidly increasing risk involved with continued operation unless drastic action taken immediately usually taking place months later completing circle whereby destruction occurs followed by new birth cycle slowly regenerating giving rise next generation of entrepreneurs aided by same knowledge gathered earlier now applied differently unlocking benefits released 5 yrs ago yet still applicable today???
