Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just reply with links for the most part for now - and hope you all will still help me read through it in the comments! I'm starting this off by thanking A Nonymous Reader who noticed something very early on that really helped me understand what was going wrong (even though I didn't realize at first). Also thanks go to Randall Munroe for giving us great advice about how fix this problem is so simple when looking at my code, since we had a nice conversation right after writing the question where he suggested making a new Flurry class that extends NSObject instead of extending ASViewController. This solved several issues, including having the methods being set up correctly. It also made testing easier because if Xcode couldn't find the compiler errors or build failures anymore, they would be shown within the Flurry console window.
