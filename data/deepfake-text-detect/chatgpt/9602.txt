I realize the OP is a bit vague, so let me clarify. Similar to false advertising, I believe that people who release lies (in a publishable, marketable format). This includes Deuteronomy 17:13-14, and Psalms 101:12 and 119:135 through 145, that the people who release blasphemies of God shall be put to death.
