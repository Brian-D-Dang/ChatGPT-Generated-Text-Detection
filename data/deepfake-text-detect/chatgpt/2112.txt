First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and so these are my opinions: 1) If your kid is saying they can't go to school because of bullying or violence then act like an adult (or at least as much of one if you're under 18). Go talk with them and figure out what's going on instead of just throwing up their hands and crying "school won't do anything!" This will probably involve talking directly to teachers who have been through it before - parents don't always understand how schools work when dealing with issues such as this. In fact most kids aren't even aware of all the resources available until later than junior year! Get involved early!! Your child needs help right away but there still might be time for other studentsteachers etc. to step forward too. Don't leave everything to someone else; get down into the trenches yourself!!! You've got nothing to lose by trying...well maybe respect among peers but beyond that? Not really much. But seriously folks - remember we had bullies when we were young too...and somehow our mothers managed to keep us safe despite being overwhelmed themselves. 2) Regardless of whether you think it was the right thing to confront him face-to-face and call his bluff above, please realize something very important here. It may seem funny now but once he hits college those few people who shunned him over some stupid Facebook post could potentially lead to far worse consequences. He'll make friends eventually but let's hope he does it while he has free reign over which posts he shares online rather than after getting to the real world where every post isn't simply logged onto a server somewhere waiting to come back around 20 years later. And trust me, things can get ugly fast in high school. Never underestimate its potential consequences either in terms of personal relationships between classmates or future job prospects especially since nearly everyone gets degrees these days...even liberal arts majors:) So yeah, use discretion and consider keeping records offline - Google docs anyone??
