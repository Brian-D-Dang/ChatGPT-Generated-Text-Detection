I spend my summer as a representative of the college I attend and interact regularly with kids between the ages of 10 and 18. In these interactions, I have noticed that they are more interested in learning about others than in their own skillset. "These are very basic skills in an environment where you can learn to connect with people without getting into any kind of class experience or getting involved in anything else," said Eric Smith, a social worker at Green Mountain College for Dental students in Burlington. "Students who get into dental school on a regular basis develop specific tastes for different things and need to take the time to find what works best for them in order to improve themselves." Smith has seen firsthand how hard it is to make an impact within the dental community. One student from a dental clinic told me she was interviewing a dental assistant when her job offered her a dental internship at IU Health. The next day she got back to her office and immediately inquired if there were questions about the internship. She was prepared for a busy day before starting work. That same afternoon, another dental patient came by and asked her some simple questions about dental hygiene and oral health. It took four communications rounds until one of the students answered all three questions correctly! Within 24 hours, she had herself a full-time intern position at Indiana University Bloomington (IUHP) in Bloomington to teach oral hygiene. Her goal was to help students get better grades, schedule sessions, learn techniques and become more educated about oral health topics. The "Dental Student Experience" program is similar to other open research programs but focuses around academic fields, including health care sciences, vocational training and healthcare. "Make sure your upcoming medical practice session is a focus area which helps you gain knowledge about your doctorpatient relationship so they will understand why you want to pursue your career," Smith advised. "Take a look through my online field guide to information available at the Indiana University Bloomington website .
