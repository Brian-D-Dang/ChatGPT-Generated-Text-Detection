Thought about this for days, and I can't think of one aspect of the FPH community that made Reddit better: - They are ignorant: Proven by the overwhelming number of accounts created in a matter weeks. This was done to get around two year olds being able ban you on sight.- No ability or interest displayed toward anything other than specific topics (euphemism).- Trollish tendencies demonstrated which became apparent when people found out what their "jokes" were actually trying t do with others." Putting it mildly... The above could be applied from reddit as well though maybe not so prevalent since they only have 160 countries available givetake?
