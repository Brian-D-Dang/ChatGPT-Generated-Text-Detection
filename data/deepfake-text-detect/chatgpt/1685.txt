I'm very confused and bothered by the amount of ads for prescription medications that run on television and in magazines. In my mind, the reason that these medications can only be marketed to those who have a doctor's signature is because they're harmful. Thus, I don't understand why so many commercials make this claim without actually showing any side effects of using them (e.g., "this drug may cause birth defects or having warnings about how addictive it really is This medication must never be used as an alternative to treatment with alcohol. When you base your entire advertising campaign around making people feel worse than before taking somethingwhy bother? And does anyone else get extremely tired of seeing advertisements from companies working directly against breast cancer awareness month? For example: Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Why are we thanking you at all again? Tell us more about breast cancer!! All of the Breast Cancer Awareness month messages seem like they were written specifically just to piss me off during October...but none mention men! Seriously?! Not once do I see a message encouraging men not to ignore signs of early-stage cancer; instead, all I ever hear are women advocating for themselves when there should also be a lot of outreach to educate men too. I wonder if there would even be enough interest amongst guys such as myself to watch an ad featuring both men AND women talking about different types of cancers?? Or maybe this is one of those things where telling everyone to talk about their own experiences will encourage other people to start discussing what type of disease they've been diagnosed with...which brings up another point - perhaps it might help to focus less on the illnesses and more on offering support, which would then hopefully lead to others being open to discuss their diagnoses openly. If you look online, most websites dedicated solely to supporting survivors tend to feature stories describing symptoms, treatments, etc. accompanied by testimonials from previous patients. They almost always end with this statement: "if you notice anything strange going on, please consult your physician" - but nobody has really published articles examining exactly what prevents men from seeking medical attention regarding prostatebreast issues. Maybe some sort of vocal organization like the American Cancer Society could take the initiative and publish research suggesting ways to improve male participation in screenings diagnosis. It seems like the main problem here isn't lack of information and awareness; rather, we need better communication between doctors and patients alike concerning potentially dangerous health concerns affecting members of each sex.
