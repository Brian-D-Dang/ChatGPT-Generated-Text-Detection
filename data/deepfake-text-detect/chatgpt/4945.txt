Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for manual transmission transmissions being used to drive such a large number of vehicles though because there are newer cars that have manual transmissions available now Also, it depends on the mechanical requirements of any vehicle you choose
