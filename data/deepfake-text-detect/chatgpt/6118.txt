There's been so much uproar over Sweden and the Netherlands and other countries that have been dealing with immigration issues. I would like to move to another country in the future, but at this time, I am perfectly happy with Canada, and I am going to make it my mission to love and live where I am at. I know that if I had moved to the UK, I would not be as happy, because I don't like how their food is, and I have a lot of friends there that I miss, and it's not close to my family, so it would be hard to adjust. I have had people ask me why I don't move to Canada, and my answer to that is, "There's not enough room for me there." That statement is very true, because a couple of years ago, Canada was listed as the best country to live in the world. This was in 2011. Most people live in cities in the middle of the country, like Saskatoon and Winnipeg. There are 25 million people in Canada, and only 34 million people in the entire US. This is actually what is going on in Canada. I have also wanted to move to the United States, and that is because I have a lot of friends there, and I want to be near them. I have wanted to move to the US since I was 12, because I wanted to be in a place that I can go to when I want to. I have friends that live in the US, and I would love to meet up with them and hang out. I can't get the chance to hang out with them because it's too far away. My dream is to be able to travel and meet up with all of my friends in the US. I will live where I am at, because it's my home and I have made it my home. I may want to visit other places in the world, but my home will always be where I am at, and that's why I will make it my mission to live where I am at and love where I am at. To my friends that have moved to other countries, I want you to know that you can call me if you need me, and I will come and see you whenever you want. We will have a trip to the other country if you are there, and we will go there. I will visit you at least once a year, and we can still stay in contact. I know it is hard for me to keep in touch with you. Moving to another country is hard, but you can do it. You will meet new people, and get a new life. If you ever want to come back, you can. It's a beautiful world, and you don't have to leave it. You can make a home wherever you are at, and that's what I will do. I will make a home in where I am at, and I will be happy.
