First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and so the system is not only ineffective but also unjustifiable. Second, I consider myself a pragmatic realist when it comes to geopolitics; one cannot ignore or dismiss conflict simply because it involves the United States. While my worldview may be influenced by what's happening in Iraq today - and that does have an effect on how I think about diplomacy - there seems no reason why we should engage in another long US intervention just because. What matters most is to ensure peace for our citizens. I feel like this will go against what people here want to hear, especially since they just got done saying how much they love their country and would never leave, yet you say you don't really know if your nation is ever going to change. But I understand that maybe your parents didn't grow up with the same freedoms as us did so you haven't been exposed to America quite as extensively. Maybe seeing Americans arrest each other for "crimes" has made you more comfortable living under an empire? Perhaps you can see the irony in wanting to stay but then expecting others to reacquire American values after being invadedoccupied repeatedly over the years? It sounds called out when I read these comments but I wanted to make sure they heard you directly because I do believe that some Americans who live abroad still appreciate what America stands for even though they don't necessarily experience it firsthand every day.
