I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with that statement in the comments of this video, I don't think it should be censored or banned because he has a different opinion on forks than me. Freedom of expression does not mean freedom from criticism. As long as your ideas aren't hurtful, then all other opinions must also be allowed to exist freely so people can choose for themselves whether they agree with them or not. This isn't censorship at all - we're merely allowing others to express their own thoughts for themselves without having ours imposed on them through force. The only reason for any kind of censorship (of anything) was done by governments during the dark ages, which could justify whatever they did arbitrarily. Nowadays there really would be no reason for such things unless they were actually hurting another person somehow and thus violating some sort of law, but since that doesn't seem to apply here, therefore it's fine to talk about fork-bashing like we normally do:)
