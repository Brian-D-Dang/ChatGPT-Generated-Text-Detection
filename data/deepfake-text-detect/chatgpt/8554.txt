I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. I don't know what that means, but they'd be the first thing I get when I try to tell them that women should have the same rights as men when it comes to contraception. We're talking about being able to determine our own fertility rates without having sex. And we aren't allowed to ask people if they want their babies through anesthesia or not? I think if you were really concerned about your husband getting sick, why did he make such an important commitment to you? You can argue about all kinds of things but you also shouldn't judge someone based solely on one particular choice. After all, if you cut yourself off from your spouse because of infertility, why would you want your sondaughter to leave you alone for another 24 hours? I am extremely worried about my 15-year old daughter (who is 19). She has high cholesterol and her doctor recommended that she stop using insulin within two weeks. Her doctor said she had a heart attack so they sent her home and used insulin instead. She won't start again until she gets old enough to see her doctor immediately. I look forward to hearing how long he takes me! It seems like at least a month once a week. Even though he's been working hard trying to get me pregnant...he keeps asking me to have sex!!!!!! How do you cope with this?! My 2 yr old keeps telling me that my body is made up of hormones and other body organs. My fiance tells me that "we need to have kids because we work full time and have a small family." He uses condoms, but there is more than just hormones involved. A lot of times I find myself wondering: Are we doing something right here? Do we still need to "have kids" before I could drink alcohol, eat fresh fruit, and take care of ourselves? I guess I never thought twice when I was younger, maybe since I didn't feel as sure about the whole idea of premarital sexual intercourse,?????? But now I wonder. No matter what happens, I cannot imagine ever having any children. At least never before. When I started dating, I knew I wanted boys soon because my parents kept saying that I wouldn't walk away sometimes after I married got divorced. So I guess I have no desire to go back down that path anymore. In retrospect, going thru this is just too much stress and pressure. And yes, I understand where you're coming from. I've seen many couples pull out their babies in favor of children - that way they're still friends throughout life despite the stress. These people think the only reason they stay together is for that reason alone; they cling to their partners' desires even though they have no feelings for each other. The most amazing part about all this is that it isn't necessarily me who wants biological offspring, it's you. That makes a big difference. For starters, I love a good relationship. Some couples want children because they can control religion and everyone knows they're godly. There must be some religious aspect to being Christian because present. If you haven't yet gotten to marriage or are considering marrying God, I highly recommend it. Honestly, I felt I needed to fight my own fears every single day! The second biggest issue you'll face is that you will always need sex. As a result, it is all about keeping your condom free. Sure, the lady may say she feels guilty, but she probably does not. As long as you maintain your condom supply, your risk for infection increases. Plus, I really think you should be able to keep your marital status secret unless there are underlying health concerns. Lastly, don't let anyone tell you that giving birth will create problems forever. In fact, even doctors ignore specific concerns because babies are few and far between. They often choose to have unprotected sex because for whatever reason, pregnancy is difficult. You'll end up with kids not knowing when they are due or delaying. You'll lose some important parts of your body. There is nothing wrong with wanting to raise your baby when it's necessary. Then again, I didn't play around with vaginal rape fantasies because I couldn't talk myself into having one. I do realize these urges are just as intense as actual pregnancies, but you know what I mean? After all, I was raped by my girlfriend when I was 18 years old, so it wasn't that great of a experience. When all you know is that your partner is the one needing blood transfusion, you will be fine. Don't worry about it; after all, the body will heal itself. Yes, you'll be okay! Just remember that your bodies are different. Your hormones will respond differently depending upon what type of sperm you use. If you want to give babies certain types of semen, you will likely of you. All foul and - - - - you or - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
