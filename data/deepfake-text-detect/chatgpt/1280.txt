I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; voted third party or not at all many times in the past two decades because "none of the available candidates represent me"; participated actively with Occupy Wall Street; supported the recent expansion of MedicareMedicaid to include adults under 50 without children - and on and on. In each case I did so from an informed perspective that took into account the best information about those issues and others appropriate given my own circumstances and preferences as well as taking into consideration what some might consider common sense. And yet whenever something related to taxes comes up in conversation between people who also agree generally on most things but can't seem to get along regarding such matters, they often blame government programs like Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, or food stamps, which are designed to make sure incoming retirees don't go hungry after years spent working hard producing income streams for themselves and their families while paying down debt. The key is how you define these terms? Are we talking about money or value? Because if it were only monetary then yes regulations would be needed since you could just print more cash and take less time off your retirement depending on how much it cost per hour worked. If you want to keep your job... But when someone tells me "government needs to do this" what am I supposed to say back? What exactly are YOU saying here? That somehow there's something wrong with society where I need help repaying part of what I've already paid in taxes before receiving benefits I'm entitled to pay out myself? Or that maybe you should rethink your whole lifestyle based around being able to live off other peoples' money forever?
