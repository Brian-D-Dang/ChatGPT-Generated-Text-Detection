I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was disappointed to learn that the film oversimplified some aspects of the story and portrayed some characters inaccurately. This is a common occurrence with historical films, as filmmakers often take creative liberties to make the story more engaging for audiences. However, it's always worth doing your own research to get a more complete understanding of the events depicted in a film.
