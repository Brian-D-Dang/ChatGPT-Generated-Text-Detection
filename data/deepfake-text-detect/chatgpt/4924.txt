Hi guys! To expand: Although I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman for example) a woman to their face and when talking about what it means we were all on the same page. Amy is not even touching my wife, she has no intention of forcing herself onto us both. She just wants to be treated as an equal partner in life with no questions asked (I have been told she makes me feel like a chore).
