Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and it's great that you recognize that. It's important to understand that rape is a traumatic experience that can happen to anyone, regardless of their gender. While the physical act may be different due to anatomy, the emotional impact can be just as devastating for both male and female survivors. It's important to approach the issue of rape and sexual assault with empathy and sensitivity, and to support survivors in their healing process regardless of their gender. If you or someone you know has experienced rape or sexual assault, it's important to seek professional help and support from resources like RAINN or a local rape crisis center.
