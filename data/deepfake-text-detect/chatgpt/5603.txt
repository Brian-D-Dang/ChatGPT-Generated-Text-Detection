I'll try not to spoil anything here for people who haven't watched Game of Thrones, but this post is specifically about events in that show. So if you don't watch it, you probably want to stop reading now. Episode 2 of Game of Thrones, "The Night Lands," had a lot of cool moments, and a couple that were a little less cool. I'll start with the latter. The character of Talisa, played by the rather stunning Oona Chaplin, is a noble lady who is traveling with Robb Stark and his troops in the north of Westeros. She's a healer and a physician, and was sent on this journey by Prince Joffrey to help the wounded. I'll admit I had trouble taking her seriously at first. She was just a bit too perfect, too cheerful, too eager to help, too much of a Mary Sue. And it didn't help that she and Robb Stark (played by relative newcomer Richard Madden) were having a string of rather silly conversations that were hard to take seriously. But I have to admit that the scenes between Talisa and Robb were really well-acted. She has the character of a true healer, and I thought it was clever that she let Robb (who was showing obvious attraction) think he was helping her with her career. So I was relieved when it turned out that Talisa had a darker secret. Her real job is to spy on Robb's uncle, Lord Tywin Lannister (played by Charles Dance, who has to be the best actor on the show). She's trying to find out if Robb is going to follow through with the wedding his father arranged for him. Now it turns out that Talisa is actually a spy for Tywin. And she actually had that conversation about Robb and her career at the beginning as a ploy to get him to open up to her. (I wonder if I might've done that, if I was Tywin's spy.) It was a clever move to bring Talisa in. She's quite likeable, which means that Robb will want to get to know her and trust her. He's already been spending a lot of time with her in the company of his uncle, who seems to be quite taken with her. (Tywin is very fond of her, and it seems to be mutual.) This was a smart way for Talisa to get inside the castle, and it's also a good way for her to get to know Robb and his uncle and so on. So I'm on board with her now. I'm also on board with the new Greyjoy character played by Finn Jones. I'm not sure if he was in the books or not, but the actor was great. I like his character, and I'm looking forward to seeing where his storyline goes. And it was good to see Mance Rayder again, in a good role. In the books, Mance has gone a little crazy with the free folk and is trying to give them a religion that is more about the Old Gods than the one that the First Men had. I was never sure about that. It seemed like a good idea at the time, and in the books it's not an issue since it's just a storyline that's happening in the background. But in the TV series it's a big deal, since the free folk are quite prominent in the plot. I'm glad that they decided to cut that part out. It's much better to have Mance be the leader of the free folk, and to keep him as just a man who believes in the Old Gods. He's also more interesting that way. And in this episode, he and Jon Snow are getting into a battle, which was great. I look forward to seeing more of those two together. So, those were my thoughts on "The Night Lands." What did you think of it? Labels: books, Game of Thrones, George R.R. Martin, television Game of Thrones - "The Wolf and the Lion" The season premiere of Game of Thrones, "The Wolf and the Lion," was a good one. It was a bit slow to start, but it got better as it went along. I'm not going to get into specifics, since I don't want to spoil anything. But it was fun to see all the new characters and get to know them a bit. I'm especially intrigued by the character of Sansa Stark, who I had a hard time getting into the books because she
