Climate change or global warming as it previously was known as is a hot potatoe and not a very clean cut science to predict. There are thousands of climate scientists across the world trying to figure out how much carbon dioxide we need in order to keep our planet from getting warmer, but their research all points towards more CO2hotter temperatures on Earth. The latest scientific report claims that if you combine human activities with natural factors such as solar radiation etc., then the average temperature will increase by between 0.6C (1.15F) and 5.8C (11.5F), over the next 100 years. This information has been presented at the first United Nations Climate Change Conference which opened today Monday September 23rd. The UN also states that they hope this conference can lead humanity into a new era where everyone works together for a better future. Yes I agree! Let's get rid of these fossil fuels now so our children can live independently without having to worry about pollution problems when using gas-powered cars and other forms of fuel like diesel engines! We have no choice really since there are only three options left: A) we stop emitting greenhouse gasses; B) We find another solution, C) Global mass extinction event. I think the only way forward is option b - create an alternative source of energy right away. We can do whatever it takes to make sure we don't go extinct because of Global Warming.
