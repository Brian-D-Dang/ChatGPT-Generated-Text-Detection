A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a .22 rifle when the gun suddenly discharged and fatally wounded the Superviser. The tragedy was compounded by the fact that the girl's father had neglected to properly secure the safety on the firearm, leading to the fatal accident. This case serves as a reminder of how important it is for gun owners and parents to be properly educated about gun safety. Gun owners should always ensure that their firearms are properly secured and locked away from children, and that they are familiar with the various safety mechanisms built into the firearms they own. Additionally, parents should ensure that any child who has access to a gun is properly instructed in the proper use of firearms and taught gun safety rules. Finally, it is also essential that all gun owners, regardless of their experience or expertise, remain aware of their surroundings while handling any firearm.
