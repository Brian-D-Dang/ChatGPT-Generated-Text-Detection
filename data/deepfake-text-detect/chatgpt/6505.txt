First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from Going on a date, and I'm hoping the others will be same. Also, there's a lot of feeling that the platform is going to be a huge financial disaster for the World, and if there's no re-engagement, then it won't get it.
