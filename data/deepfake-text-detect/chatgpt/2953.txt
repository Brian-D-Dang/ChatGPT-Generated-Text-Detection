While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept they are. I guess this is a good thing because it will hopefully slow down development of these new technologies so we can really study them in detail before moving ahead with full blown implementation. There should be more alternatives being developed instead (solar power anyone?), but since fossil fuel companies don't care about sustainability or our well-being as individuals... If you're truly concerned about GMOs causing harm then eating organic foods would probably be your best bet anyway. GMO grains food subscription service
