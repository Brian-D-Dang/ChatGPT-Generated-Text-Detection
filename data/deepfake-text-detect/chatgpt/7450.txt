While it may seem rational to have the rich dictate the direction of society as they may have an invested interest, it is fundamentally undemocratic and unfair. Democracy recognizes that every individual has an equal right to vote, regardless of their socioeconomic background. Furthermore, the amount of taxes one pays does not reflect their inherent worth or intelligence level. A wealthy person's vote should not carry more weight than a low-income individual's vote in a democratic society. The goal of a just society should be to strive for equal representation and protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their wealth.
