For those who don't know, the trolley problem is this: You and another person are on a bridge which is over a trolley track. 5 people are tied to the trolley tracks for 25 seconds at each end. That's a total of 75 minutes. The next ten minutes will take you from point A to point B. The last 10 minutes will be in between points A and B. I'm not sure how often I've actually seen a situation where someone has gotten away with it, but if you're going to be traveling long distances then this kind of thing ought to have been avoided. If you can do any work like building your own trolley you should just mind your business and wait until you're ready. There were some interesting contacts that came up during our conversation that got me thinking about this more.
