Reddit is a website, a business, it is the "front page of the internet." This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these important content will make people realize that intolerance isn't as dangerous as fearmongering. Yeah, and I agree with you 100. I'm glad there are more resources for atheists out there.
