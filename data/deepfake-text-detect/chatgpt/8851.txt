Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and it's almost always the case in modern psychology which means you can't be both. for some reason i had no idea what was going on until this thread... obviously women are raping men... but if someone raped me then maybe they're worse than men?!?
