Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a tangent. If you're arguing against my point that people are so quick to judge the quality and value of books... based on word-of-mouth? Then please respond with a point that actually addresses that as well (as opposed to just repeating what I've already said). Otherwise, it seems pretty redundant if someone follows up an argument by saying they agree with your original statement, when there's no new information or response from you to provide counter-evidence. I remember reading something about how book stores want readers to buy their books and then not read them and never return to them. It was kind of funny to me at first, until i realized they were right. No matter how great a story might be, once you finish the last page, unless you feel compelled to go back to it later, chances are good that you won't pick another Random House novel out of the store shelves after you're done. Same goes for any other publisher; nothing will compel you to try anything else over the next decade. And most likely you'll take some time before buying a different book again. At best you'll get caught up watching TV shows featuring characters who remind you of your favorite authors. You could also end up browsing Wikipedia entries or searching Google Books to find quotes from famous novels. You'll even probably visit IMDB frequently to see which movies feature actors you recognize from books. But all these things are less compelling than the typical book review written five hours ago online. Hopefully I'm wrong, though given recent trends, I wouldn't bet the farm either way. You hit on two points here very directly: 1) The number of times I started and abandoned a book is high relative to the number of times I finished it and 2) Where do we draw our conception of "quality" and "value"? The part about abandoning is trueand it doesn't happen often enough, particularly among genre fiction readers (to whom this site tends), where popular taste can wax and wane rapidly. But let me ask you a question - is it ever worth rereading? Is there time or energy left over somewhere within your life to pursue a book series begun years earlier? Do you still enjoy The Da Vinci Code every six months after finishing the first three hundred pages? Does Twilight make such strong impressions upon your memory that you automatically compare its perceived "worth" to those of other major works, much the same way you may consider yourself superior to others simply for having been born into a certain culture? Do you think that all Balzac novels should be taken seriously despite his flaws? Are Dan Brown's bestsellers truly better than Shakespeare's (yes, he does write better prose)? If you answered "no" to any of these questions, maybe it'd help if I told you that you can produce nearly identical results by taking Baker Street Irregular out of your hands and shooting him repeatedly with a.38 caliber revolver. Where do you suppose the conception of value comes from? Who decided that 24 Hours In A Bottle Of Vodka Must Be Better Than Forever With Someone Special? When did we decide that The Godfather Isn"t Worth Reading Any More Because Pacino Can Say Everything Less Well? Why don't 4chan posters argue that Snakes On A Plane must be considered art because why, you know? They have opinions and feelings too! How dare you suggest otherwise you're living inside MySpaceTwitter!! When I say that Bookstores Want Readers To Buy Their Work and Not Read Them and Never Return To Them... What Exactly Am I Saying Here??? That THEY DON'T WANT TO BE READ BY ANYONE?? THAT THEY DO NOT DESERVE ANY ATTENTION FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC?? So yeah, I guess YOU'RE RIGHT!!! After ALL!!
