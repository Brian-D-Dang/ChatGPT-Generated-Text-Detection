I'm a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find sillytrivial. I'm currently dating a girl who is a feminist myself. Shouldn't this be the topic? There are plenty of things that feminist women do not like about feminism. Feminism has nothing to worry about over here though. They're just like everyone else if you give them too much time or attention at all because whatever they want in life is usually better than what they feel towards another personthing
