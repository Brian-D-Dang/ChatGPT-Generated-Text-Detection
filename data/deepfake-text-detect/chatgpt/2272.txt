I was only able to find one other thread about this topic, and it was kind of a train wreck. Common arguments: "It's not Jraphics Interchange Format" by that logic, neither is jpeg or htm (which both utilize GIF). There were also random references made like JPEG being patented which has been debunked numerous times. The real reason for the disagreement seems to be because either side knows full well they're in an argument over semantics but don't want concede on principle so then what should've been two separate threads turned into a shitshow discussion instead Wouldn't we all love everyone else to cut out gifs from their websites. But as long as there are gifs people will post them here everyday with titles such as "awesome thing I found! Too bad you can never watch it again..." The author couldn't even understand why he got downvoted yet posted another link later today without realizing how many more clicks would result in him getting called clickbait trash too;)
