I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry Christians would like you to think. You don't need Jesus to be happy and it is not moral or ethical for you to force your beliefs on someone else especially if they are hurting no one
