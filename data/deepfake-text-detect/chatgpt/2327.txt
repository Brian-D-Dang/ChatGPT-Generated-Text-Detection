This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point here isn't to argue against your specific argument but rather to explain why this logic can go wrong in various ways and how it's better avoided when talking about complex moral questions. I agree with everything else you said except "simple" morality doesn't necessarily imply that most people will agree on what constitutes simple morality. Also, there may not even exist such thing as objective morals (though i think we could make some good guesses)
