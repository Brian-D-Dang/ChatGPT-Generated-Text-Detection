The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here] . Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things. But for good people to do bad things, that takes religion. One of the most famous quotes ever uttered, I don't think this quote means what most people think it means. First, let's look at the context in which it was said. On January 17, 2006, Professor Steven Weinberg of the University of Texas in Austin was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in physics. He gave a lecture to the Nobel Foundation and the Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm in which he discussed the "evils" of religion. I think science will win in the end. Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things. But for good people to do bad things, that takes religion. There is a lot to unpack in this quote, but first, we should acknowledge that it is not a quote. Weinberg did not record the quote, and the quote does not appear in any of his books or articles. It is the title of a blog post from Steven Novella, a scientist and blogger. So, if we can't blame Professor Weinberg for the quote, who can? The answer, as often is the case, is a Jewish author named Sam Harris. Harris, an American author, philosopher and neuroscientist, is an atheist who has a Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCLA. Harris is known for his books The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation, and for his founding and promotion of the Reason Project, the Secular Student Alliance and Project Reason. In the last section of this quote, Weinberg was quoting Sam Harris. As we can see, Sam Harris believes religion causes evil, and even evil people do good things, which means religion is necessary for good people to do bad things. This is a very popular quote on the atheist blogosphere, with Harris getting credit for it. There is one key point that I find curious about this quote. Weinberg, in his lecture, added an additional phrase to the quote, which was not included in Sam Harris' original post. In the original version of the quote, as it appears in the lecture, Weinberg is saying that without religion, good people would still do good things, but "evil people will do evil things." Notice he doesn't say that "good people do bad things" in the original version. So, what did Sam Harris mean when he said that "religion causes evil"? Some people believe that Sam Harris means that religion causes evil by making people do evil things. However, Sam Harris himself has never said that, and if he did, I would have a hard time believing him. In his book The End of Faith, Sam Harris writes that he is "shocked at the level of mendacity and sheer stupidity that can be peddled to gullible believers in the name of God." I think it is unlikely that Sam Harris thinks religion makes people do evil things. It seems, to me, that Sam Harris was saying religion causes evil by making people believe they have an excuse to do evil things. We have to keep in mind that this quote comes from a lecture. It is not a book or an article, and the written record of it is suspect, at best. There is no way to know if Sam Harris was angry or not. He could have been speaking in a gentle manner, but the audience likely heard it differently, in which case they could have misheard him as angry. However, I have seen Sam Harris talk on a couple of occasions, and he does get angry at people when he thinks they are being stupid, or not using their brains correctly, or when they are speaking without evidence. I have also seen him calmly talk about these same subjects. I have no doubt that Sam Harris is a kind, intelligent man, who is a great skeptic, and does not believe in God. It is also my belief that he has a tendency to believe that he is correct about everything, and will defend his opinions with great vigor. I think it is possible that Sam Harris was angry when he said that religion causes evil, but it is also possible that he was not. The evidence, such as it is, suggests that religion causes people to do bad things. It is impossible to say whether that is because of religious beliefs or because of religious institutions.
