Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for an auto. In the wrong hands a car can be as dangerous as any other vehicle on the road unless you keep your head out of traffic and look at all sides before making moves
