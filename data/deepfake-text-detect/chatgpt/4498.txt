Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from youth all the way through college), and it was fun to play with people who were more talented than me, so that is why I love footballsoccer. However, after coming back home to Houston in 2008, I noticed something: while there are plenty of great parents and players on our team, they do little or nothing to help other children excel at sports because they feel like they are doing their kids some sort of favor if they coach them or even allow him (her) to join their team. I have seen many bad apples in this sport and believe most coaches will tell you their job is "getting the best out" of every child regardless of skill level and age. That's what soccer has become for many families. They want their kids to succeed. Unfortunately though, we live in a society where everyone wants everything now instead of waiting and working hard for things. If someone else does better than us we simply say its unfair, when really it might be we are too old or unathletic. We make excuses and give ourselves credit for being good enough, which makes it okay to keep failing year after year. Soccer becomes an excuse to stay indoors. It gets worse with older kids since the game is longer and harder to master (unless you're Michael Phelps). But while a lot of parents think advanced training means spending 100 per week on academies that promise success overnight, it actually takes years before anything can change, and then years still later until these same kids achieve greatness. Some people just don't care about their own kids, only themselves, if they fail one time it doesn't matter as long as they can blame others and claim their kid didn't try hard enough. Meaning getting involved isn't even worth it anymore (even if you had aspirations of seeing your kid earn scholarships etc.)... People rarely work together towards any goal. There is no accountability nor support available for seeking real excellence. This works against developing true Olympic athletes as well, since it promotes mediocrity rather than dedication. My point here is that the world needs role models. Adults need positive examples. Parents should look for ways to encourage each other and help uplift those around us. Coaches should strive for AAU titles consistently instead of avoiding difficult situations by saying 'oh he'll grow into that'. And, finally, children need adults willing to push them past their limits, whether physical or mental. For example, in high school I played baseball for a very short time. Most of the games ended within four innings. The few times I did manage five-inning outings, it felt amazing. Even without any practice, I could go 5-0. When i returned home to California, however, I realized how much easier it would be to lose 10 straight games vs winning 2-3 in Texas! Why? Because in Texas I had to last inning to win, whereas in CA when I lost I got three outs left and usually won easily! Imagine how much your chances would improve if you learned how to control vorexia. Another thing to consider is how one loses his self confidence and goes from feeling confident to helpless. I used to always use excuses such as " It's not fair " but I found myself using those exact words less often once I started focusing on my setbacks instead of giving them attention. Once you commit to a particular outcome, no amount of external forces can stop you... You must either leave your comfort zone and disrespect yourself for the results or stick to your guns, grinders, and dream. Everyone dreams of winning gold medals at Worlds... but the Olympics require you to train 8 hours EVERY day. No one pulls 9 hour days except Olympians, yet millions of Americans spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on academy centers, camps, private lessons, personal trainers, nutritionists, etc just to reach a mediocre result. How sad! Caring for others is never easy; caring for oneself is nearly impossible. In order to appreciate someone else's experience, one must first learn how to relate to his own situation. Yet despite having an idealistic mindset, we often lack empathy, compassion, and understanding of others' feelings. As far as traditional top programs go, the USSF has done a poor job marketing American clubs to overseas fans.... (more...)
