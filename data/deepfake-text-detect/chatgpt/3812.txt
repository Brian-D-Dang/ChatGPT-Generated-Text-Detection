Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I have no idea if these are really accurate representations or not, but I'm assuming they're based on what the website says about itself. (If you've read my blog before, like a lot of people, it's because I spent many years researching gender dysphoria.) I did some research into the websites that claim to represent these new genders and found one in particular: Tumblr, which is sort of "cute" by comparison. Here's a screenshot from an article I wrote on Tumblr!: This was taken during my time there - I actually had never heard of Tumblr until after I posted the image above, so I think it may be safe to say Tumblr represents the most ridiculous and bizarre ones of any social media site available today! So anyway... I decided to take a look at the main page (which has recently been updated with more newgender options), and here are a few things I noticed immediately. 1) The founder has a face resembling one of those awful plastic surgeons who make faces for fun - if he looks anything like the guy from the movie Deep Impact, then it must be true! 2) There are a number of images for newgender preferences. One particularly strange example is an image titled "Feminine Masculinity." Basically, according to Tumblr, a woman who likes to play video games, wear corsets, love pinkyellow, stay up late, and dance like she just stepped off a stripper pole can't possibly be happy with herself and should spend more time focusing on her manliness. This is obviously pretty much a meta-commentary regarding the fact that women usually don't want to talk about their feelings, and thus often get labeled as weak, pathetic, or feminine. (As a side note, if you check the FB profile of the founder, he doesn't appear to post very frequently on Twitter. He does seem to be active on Reddit though. If anyone knows where else he might post that would be great!)
