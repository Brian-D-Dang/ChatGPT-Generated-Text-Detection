This boggles my mind. I know that some airlines are different like Southwest because they do not have assigned seats. But why don't people relax until their seating zonegroup is determined? Is it just a comfort thing, or is there a reason for doing this? A lot of airlines also default to the middle seat as the "main" seat once you're seated unless your reservation specifically specifies otherwise (Southwest).
