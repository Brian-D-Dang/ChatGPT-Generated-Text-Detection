I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by which the President is elected would be changed to allow whoever receives more votes wins. This sounds good on paper but I think it might not work out so well in practice because there are a lot of people who live outside cities and would benefit from having representatives they could represent them when decisions were made at the federal level instead of leaving those issues up to their state legislators.
