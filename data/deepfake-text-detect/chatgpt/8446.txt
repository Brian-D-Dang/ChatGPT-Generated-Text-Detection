I'll allow that, in most cases, the misbehaving kid is just throwing a temper tantrum, but what do you do in cases where the kid has thrown himself on the ground and won't get up? And I also believe there's no need to argue this point. It seems pretty obvious - if your child throws herself flat onto her stomach with arms outstretched (like she was trying for an Olympic diving pose), grab those scissor-happy hands of yours before they can cause injury or hurt feelings! And don't be afraid either - leave enough space between children so nips are avoided as much possible too; we all know how kids have super sensitive skin when it comes hormones!! But never forget: every parent loves their baby more than anything else ever could... unless really gross accidents happen;
