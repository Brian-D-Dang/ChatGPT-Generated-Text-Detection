Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, would anyone potentially be a better source of information than their own peers? I am not saying the opposite is true: you should pay attention to what others on this forum are thinking and discussing; however, if your goal in life is to develop as much knowledge regarding any topic as possible, transcending the confines of academia, you might find that peer criticism (a rather common experience for students) isn't necessarily the best place for getting that info. The point behind my question was simply "why listen when there's already so many people here?" As far as developing your abilityknowledge by yourself goes...there can only ever really be one person with all the answers!
