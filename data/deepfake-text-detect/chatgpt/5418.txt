I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still believe there is no excuse for racist behavior against people who march on behalf of white supremacists and other white supremacists but I also feel like there should be things like this happening to everyone else as well. Is anyone here ready for the following: Black lives matter? National Anthem: Trump supporters: Stop using other peoples words. Real Americans: Don't get caught up in the Trump hysteria!
