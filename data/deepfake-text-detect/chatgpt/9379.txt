I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for prisoner should have the option to end their life in prison if they are doing a non violent prison for a non violent crime. I believe that the option should be given to every non violent criminal who has the choice to end their life..
