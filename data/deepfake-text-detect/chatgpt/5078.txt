First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from someone else's perspective. I'm not saying parking isn't expensive in Ontario but I think there are laws against parking lots that exclude people with disabilities though.
