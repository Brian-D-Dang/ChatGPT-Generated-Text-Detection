I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community, but this is simply my opinion on what should happen in Fort Worth Texas. The recent announcement that Fort Worth was one of 10 cities chosen to participate in a pilot program for an "LGBTQ-inclusive" memorial surfaced on social media last week, causing quite a stir among the LGBTQ community. This news has caused a lot of anger within our community. It also resulted in many people joining forces online and calling out city officials who supported it as a way to use federal funds allocated in the recent stimulus bill to promote homosexuality and other forms of hate speech. The pushback from the community against this decision has been immense. As someone living here and working at a non-profit organization dedicated to providing service to the LGBTQ community, I have been affected personally involving myself with this issue because it directly affects me: my job provides direct services such as housing and employment opportunities to individuals with disabilities and those identifying themselves as marginalized groups. In short, this will impact my job and livelihood which means I cannot remain silent anymore than I can continue to work at the non-profit. We are all afraid and angry; we don't know why certain decisions are being made and how they affect us. It seems that every time the topic comes up, there is a new controversy coming about with many people feeling frustrated and powerless over their voices not being heard. There are good reasons behind these decisions: 1) Washington DC is happy to spend money so long as it benefits them 2) Other cities do want to follow through with similar legislation 3) The federal government wants laws enforced 4) These types of decisions have worked before 5) These plans were put into motion without much input 6) If these projects were rejected, it could open up all kinds of legal issues 7) Some city council members may be motivated to get reelected 8) There are some potential lawsuits 9) Most importantly, there aren't enough volunteers willingable to dedicate hours each week to make the project successful However, I believe this decision is a waste of everyone's efforts and that we need to focus more on the things that really matter to us. Let me explain. Washington D.C. recently passed a measure legalizing same-sex marriage after a six year fight, allowing gay couples to marry across the entire city. Previous attempts to pass the legislation had failed due to opposition within the black community. Many have commented that if Fort Worth, the most diverse U.S. city is able to successfully pass its ordinance then it must surely be possible elsewhere. What is missing from this discussion though is the fact that homosexuality is only one form of sexuality. Gender is also important to consider when looking at this. Men today identify as "genderfluid" rather than just male or female while others feel no gender identity at all. For those who fall under both categories you might call yourself bisexual - though whether or not you ever experience sexual attraction towards either sex (especially between men) is another question altogether. These labels alone provide plenty of potential opportunities for inclusion in virtually any area of public life including sports teams, schools, hospitals, museums, businesses, etc. Now let's look at the other type of discrimination we face everyday. Transgender and transsexual people face an onslaught of negative stereotypes right now especially related to basic hygiene. From people not interacting properly to being called 'heretic' to having their parents disown them, transgender children see a constant barrage of harrassment from society every day which makes them fearful to even seek medical care. By passing a law protecting transgender rights not only could Fort Worth help prevent tragedies such as this that claim lives every single day - but it would ensure that everybody else gets treated fairly too! Let's take a moment to reflect upon what we would lose if we ignore the needs of the marginalized groups of our city and instead concentrate all our energy on supporting the priorities of the privileged few.
