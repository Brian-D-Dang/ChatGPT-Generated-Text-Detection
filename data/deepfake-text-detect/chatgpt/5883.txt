1. Military industry keeps some of the very few manufacturing jobs in US, this industry's survival critically depends on US's defence policies and government orders, without US spending sizeable chunk of its GDP on defence there will not be enough money to spend on other things, US can't afford to cut its military budget drastically, its budget is huge and any cuts in it will bring negative consequences. 2. Military industry creates a large number of jobs (1.3 million people as of 2013), further more it creates a lot of indirect jobs in other sectors, some of the biggest defence suppliers are nowadays US based manufacturing companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, it is estimated that Lockheed Martin creates 150000 jobs in US, this is a big number and a lot of small businesses are created to support this industry, without it US economy would not be in the good shape it is in. 3. The world is getting more and more dangerous and competitive, countries such as China and India are growing rapidly and their economies are more and more competitive, this competition between countries is not something bad as long as countries compete with each other through cooperation, but to be competitive you need to invest in a lot of things, and one of those is military. 4. USA's defence spending is around 20 of the world's defence spending, 20 is a big number, if US were to cut its defence spending by 20 this will also mean that other countries will have to increase their military spending by the same amount to keep the global defence spending constant, this will have a negative impact on global economy and world peace. 5. Military spending in US is at a constant level since 1998, this is a positive sign, it shows that the US has a clear and stable defence policy, it also shows that the US military is an efficient and successful institution, that is why the US spends a lot on defence, US spends so much because it knows what it is doing. 6. USA is a very big country and has many enemies, no other country has to deal with the same amount of threats as the US, this is why the US spends a lot on defence, to protect its own interests and those of its allies. 7. The US military is one of the most advanced in the world, US spends so much on defence because it needs to be the best in the world, to be the best in the world you have to be the most advanced and up to date with technology, the only way you can do that is by spending more. 8. A lot of the equipment manufactured for the US military is used in other countries, this is an indirect way of US helping other countries to grow and develop their militaries, the US military is used to manufacture a lot of equipment, which is then sold to other countries and used by them in their militaries, this helps other countries to develop their militaries. 9. US defence contractors have a lot of money to spend, they are one of the biggest corporations in US, they have a lot of money which they use to fund research and development projects and to build factories to manufacture products, without US defence spending the defence industry would have to rely on other industries for funding which is not a good idea as there are other industries that need to be invested in. 10. US defence spending is used to create jobs and to grow other sectors of the economy, a lot of money is spent on buying goods and services from other companies, this creates a lot of jobs. 11. A lot of the defence spending is used to research and develop new technologies and to buy products from other companies, this helps these companies to grow and makes the US a big market for them. 12. Military spending helps to create a big market for military products and helps to improve technology. 13. The US government is known to be one of the most efficient in the world, it has a very strict budgeting system and it knows where money is going to, the US government is very good at using its resources effectively and efficiently, this is the main reason why the US is such a successful country. 14. The US is the biggest economy in the world and it has been like that for decades, its economy is more than 20 times bigger than that of China which is the second biggest economy, this is why the US can afford to spend so much on its military, it is not the only country that can do this but it is the one with the biggest economy, China will have to spend 20 times more than the US to have a defence budget that is 120
