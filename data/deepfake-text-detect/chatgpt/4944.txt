My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother was crying inside and screaming like a little girl, yelling at them from a broken down car seat while their father yelled for them to go back out into the daylight. "Why didn't you guys just let him stay?" asked the father. Probably because they were going through some rough time together and wanted to get some much needed attention since they weren't getting along well with each other anymore? Did they have an argument over it later on that day? I mean really?? Do other parents care about their children more than I do?!?!?!?!?!? I don't believe parents should need friends or family members help but if anybody does then this petty crap needs to stop! Donate money or something like that to someone honest!!
