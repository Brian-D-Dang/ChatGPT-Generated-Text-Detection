There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: Forgot to mention that it was the first time I had ever seen him cry so loudly while dressed up as the dinosaurs (and everyone thought it was cute to see him do it). The thing is, there are more animals in this world than we know what goes on inside them. We have no idea how many things go through their bodies. If you think about every animal in existence, there's hundreds of things that may never stop moving around and they all process everything we say or read. There are also thousands of other things beyond our understanding.
