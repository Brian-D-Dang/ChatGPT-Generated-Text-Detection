Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for pornography by third wave feminists in general (and Melissa McEwan specifically). As an avid consumer of pornography who comes from a feminist background myself, this made me feel very uncomfortable as well as confused about where my own views stand on pornpornography. I would really appreciate any help that you can give me in regards to what exactly distinguishes second-wave vs. third wave feminism and how these differences are seen within different branches or subgroups such as intersectional feminism, radfems, etc... Thank you so much!!
