Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as something different from the rest, then it may have value to someone (iirc). - gd1Dec 6 '19 at 23h45
