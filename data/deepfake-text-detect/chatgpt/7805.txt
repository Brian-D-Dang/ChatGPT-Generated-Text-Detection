While it may appear that dogpiling is an effective strategy on Cutthroat Kitchen, it can backfire in several ways. Firstly, it can lead to a significant waste of time and resources in the bidding stage, as several contestants are fighting for the same sabotage. This can result in overbidding, leaving the contestants with fewer funds for other challenges. Secondly, dogpiling can create enemies among the contestants, leading to a toxic atmosphere in the kitchen. This can negatively impact the team dynamics and ultimately affect the quality of the dishes. Finally, dogpiling can lead to a lack of creativity as the contestants may focus on sabotages rather than showcasing their cooking skills. Therefore, it is not always the best strategy to dogpile on Cutthroat Kitchen.
