So first of I am danish. That means that I follow american politics, much in the same way I follow german politics. Somethings are importent for me and my situation, but not all things affect us directly. And second: If you have no idea what is going on, why do you care? I think it's natural to want some connection with your homeland when living abroad (and especially if one has children). But honestly - how many people from Denmark know anything about their own country except that they can get a flight there without too many complications from customs? I don't see any difference between an American who likes football or baseball knowing more about his home state than someone from a different state entirely.
