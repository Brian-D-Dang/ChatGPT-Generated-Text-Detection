Hi CMV! A recent post on AskReddit about homosexuality and pedophilia being a choice or not led me to this thought that BOTH homosexuality and heterosexuality are choice made by homosexuals, is hilarious. I've been told by my parents I was gay for years but never really understood what the difference between homosexuality and pedophilic behavior until recently because it's just so vague... That said browsing reddit has helped my father get over his childhood trauma
