In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals . I hate seeing things like this, it's so sad: (I never really understood why certain animals aren't considered "companions" in America... It seems that people who keep exotic catsdogs also dismiss (and often ignore) any of the downsides - being abandoned or mistreated by a human owner is one thing but adding into then mix wild instincts can be very dangerous for everyone involved!
