Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or even an ice pick then they should be charged as such and imprisoned for life (for those who are sentenced). If someone uses force against you So what? You can't just make up words in order to get your way now.
