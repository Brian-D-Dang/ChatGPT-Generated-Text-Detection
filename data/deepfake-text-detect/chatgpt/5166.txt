So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor religion? And it's country now where they're not allowed to discriminate in any way (except against themselves). They are always gonna be treated with respect no matter how much you think the other guy believes otherwise. Yeah but what if they were civil rights activists who said whatever is racist should be abolished.... Then again, that would mean that whites weren't supposed to actually be discriminated against by black folks anyway... seems like a pretty shitty notion considering blacks have been oppressed for centuries already
