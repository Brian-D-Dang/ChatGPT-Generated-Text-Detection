Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as different from "BuzzFeed" then the latter can be enjoyable. BuzzFeed News seems to have mostly recovered from the firehose of tits, cat gifs and gossip that saturated the front page of their website (and subsequently its site-wide front page). The journalism is still lacking, but it's not offensively terrible like it was a few years ago.

Well, he's really just a dude that plays Madden and writes bad takes about it on twitter, so the dude doing the talking is the most important thing. The gameplay is fine I guess, but it's hard to justify anything higher than a 610 when you look at the franchise as a whole.

I've been playing Madden 2010 for the past few months. What's funny is that the Madden 2010 version has better graphics than the current one, it's like the jump between Madden 2008 and 2009. The gameplay is not as good as it is now but the graphics are sharper and the player models look like real players, you can't really say that about the current one. The only downside to Madden 2010 is that there is no online multiplayer mode. And the coaching AI is terrible, you'll be doing the same things over and over in the same games. It has a lot of quirks, but overall it is the best Madden since 2015. But then again, this is the same guy who wrote an article about how Madden is doing too much for too many people. That basically says that the game needs to get simpler, which is completely ridiculous. The more graphics options there are in the game, the better the game will look.

I'm trying to get through my first playthrough of the single player career mode, it's just so boring and the commentary is so stale that I've started to get madden fatigue. I think what's really annoying about Madden is that there is no replay value. I play for a few months and then I'm bored and I stop playing. And then the next year, I play the game again and the same happens. But then I go back to Madden 2010 and I'm surprised that I can still have fun playing the game.
