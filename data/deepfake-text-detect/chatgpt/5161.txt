Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. Let's cut the cynicism for a minute, let's not have this come off as 'Bernie Sanders isn't really interested.' Yes Bernie supporters are cynical about him being President because they believe that if you're honest and humble enough you won't be judged by your actions instead of yourself. Bernie supporters are cynical because they don't want their own country to pay attention outside the wall street. They will value spending money over patriotism and accountability when there's nothing to spend it on except good intentions. That too my friend, we know, none of us need the president who doesn't care whether or not he cares about the people more than himself!
