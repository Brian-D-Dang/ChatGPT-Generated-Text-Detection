I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several breeders in my area who love to show me the "well socialized" ones they got from their breeder but every single one of those dogs was scared as heck and kept barking when we came near it (one even barked at another labrador passing by). Mine is also afraid if other animals but he doesn't yelp like that because well.. our neighbors don't cut his nails
