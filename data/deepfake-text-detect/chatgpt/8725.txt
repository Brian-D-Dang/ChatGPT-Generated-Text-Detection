From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have a good time as a war hero. I agree with you that he was more deserving than he was honored by the public in my opinion. We don't need to forget that.
