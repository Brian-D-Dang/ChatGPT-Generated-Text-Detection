A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a .22 rifle she did not know how to handle properly, instead of just putting the bullet in the chamber. She got all three shots into the man who was teaching her so that is why it happened but still its terrible! I think I read about this too... After reading some comments here on reddit from ranges security officersgun instructors though..its pretty clear they are supposed to train these kids with shooting first and foremost if you don't then this kind of thing happens
