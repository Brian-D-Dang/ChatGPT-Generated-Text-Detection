I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the "safe space" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao on this matter. Can you provide a link? The idea of safe spaces really are illogical and bizarre - if people want it they should build their own site instead of calling for other peoples' sites to be banned.
