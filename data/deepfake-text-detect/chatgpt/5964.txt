While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to be president. I would love to be proven wrong here but I just don't see him being able to do much more then anyone else. His campaign has been nothing short of a disaster, he's in debt to his campaign workers, they're begging him for money for their next paycheck and he has no interest in fundraising. He's also not really any better then any other candidate when it comes to financial support, I'm sure he'll accept any amount of money but he's not really good at raising it. He's also been running into other problems with his campaign staff, like how they let a reporter film them and then he had to make a statement about it. He also has a problem with the electoral college system in that he's going to lose a lot of states where he actually wins more votes then Hillary, even if she does win the popular vote. On top of all this he's got some real issues in his personal life, not only does he have a history of not paying his taxes but he's a known womanizer who's even made a documentary about it and claims to still be in love with his last wife and children who he hasn't seen in 25 years. He's also a liar, he's even admitted it himself and has a history of lying about his past, including how he took money from an insurance company and then had a change of heart and gave it back. He's also pretty old, he's 74 and honestly I don't see him lasting more then another 4 years if he gets elected, he might even die in office and what would happen then? We'd all be screwed. Also as president he would have to deal with the Republican party in congress and he would have to work with a lot of people who are against him, people who would make it harder for him to do his job. He'd also have to deal with a lot of foreign policy issues and no one knows if he's even capable of it. He's basically a rebel with no experience, he doesn't have any government experience or any military experience, he's never held any political office and he's never been a judge. He also doesn't really have a realistic plan for what he'd do, he's just going to tax the rich and that's about it. I like that idea but taxing the rich is only going to get you so far, it's not like that's going to generate 3.5 trillion dollars over 10 years. And then there's his lack of organization, he's a complete mess, he has a million different ideas and is all over the place, he's just not able to keep it together. And then there's the fact that he's a socialist, a hardcore one at that. He's been using the word socialist since 2008, it's his main platform and it's what he's run on for all these years, he's a socialist and he's a democratic socialist which I don't even know what the hell that means. So what he's saying is that he wants to abolish private property and the free market, he wants to put everything in the hands of the government and then he wants to tell us that he's going to fix the economy, he's so stupid. This guy has been preaching socialism for over 8 years and he's never done anything about it, he's just lying to us all. So no, Bernie Sanders is not the one, he's just a joke, he's nothing more then a rebel. He's an old, grumpy rebel and he's just not going to get it done.
