Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a little bit like an English word and not at all like the German one it's supposed to be pronounced as. 2. The logic behind this rule makes sense: Hard C sounds are hard! How much harder could they possibly get? 3. It gives us a nice opportunity to make fun of foreigners who pronounce our language incorrectly (even though we know that yanks have no idea how Germans actually speak their own native tongue). 4. If you want your name spelled out in detail when spoken aloud, then screw having friends with accents or weird names; just spell everything like its supposed to every time. Xavier Zee-VAY vs. Yehveed YEH-VEED I used Xavier because I wanted something with some color - most people couldn't say "Yeheved" without sounding a tad stoned if asked directly after speaking French, but everyone can do Zeevah pretty easily. Still, both apply equally well here since there will probably never be any need to refer back specifically to these two individuals by anything other than initial letter alone again anyway...unless, perhaps, he goes off on his own adventure somewhere else where nobody knows him so now my witty joke doesn't work anymore.
