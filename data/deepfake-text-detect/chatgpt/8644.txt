With our constant fast technological advancement people seem to think that we will lead our selves to destruction because we do not use technology with care, but recently all new and innovative gadgets are being used in the world. This is worrying me as I am considering buying a bracelet for my daughter who has diabetes mellitus. The bracelet is made by a company called Better Faith Beads that provides beads for her diabetes treatment which she needs from time to time. She can't wear it herself so they gave her some beads and she was able to use them while on her walk! It was amazing how much she improved after this! My husband and I bought this bracelet today based on her "how good" birthday gift its very easy to make the bead is beautiful like the one pictured above. Our son had his first surgery in August last year where he had to have a hip replacement repaired and I cannot wait until that happens again so I am going to buy him a bracelet that I love and not take anything away from him. It is also worth saying that this bracelet for free is really kind of you D: I just wish I could give it to someone else!! Thank you VERY MUCH!!!
