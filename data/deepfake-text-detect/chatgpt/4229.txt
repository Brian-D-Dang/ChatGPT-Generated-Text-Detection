I just read this [article] stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering the fact that Asians and white are a much higher percentage of the US population, I'd say it's more likely for someone from a lower socioeconomic class (like myself) to get accepted into college by those groups specifically because they're poor. This just seems idiotic to me That is literally what OP said?
