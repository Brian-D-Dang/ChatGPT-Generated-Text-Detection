before you guys bombard me with downvotes I would simply like to point out that I am not saying this is true. I am just expressing my conditional views that I think it is an awful idea and cannot imagine that a religion should be able to force people into believing anything other than what God Himself says is right for them. Why would anyone be happy about any kind of religious dogma but wonderful people? Because they don't have enough faith in themselves, really. They need worshipers who are willing to teach their children the way they believe in them instead of following the teachings of the Bible so many teenagers do.
