This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding. For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force us to buy hundreds of channels that we never watch. But now we have a way to stream live TV over the internet. We can get a "cable card" for our TVs and hook them up to an antenna. We can then watch all of our favorite channels including AMC, TBS, ESPN, and all the news stations. But why is this such a big deal? This is a big deal because we don't have to pay 100 a month for cable or satellite. We don't have to pay 120 a month for DirecTV. We don't have to pay 200 a month for Dish TV. This is a big deal because a large majority of the programming that we watch is on free networks. But the networks are just as greedy as cable or satellite companies. They want us to pay for these channels too. I refuse to pay for these channels. So why are we forced to pay them? The government needs to stop this crap. They need to force these networks to let us watch their channels for free. They are going to continue to make billions of dollars as it is. They don't need to charge us anything. We aren't asking for free premium channels. We are just asking for free TV. If you have this problem you are not alone. Let's fight back!
