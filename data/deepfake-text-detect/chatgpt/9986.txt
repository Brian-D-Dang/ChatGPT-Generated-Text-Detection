(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge people who disagree with me. I think that the death penalty should not be used as a form of punishment. I believe that it is morally wrong to take a life, regardless of the circumstances. Additionally, there are certain problems with the application of the death penalty, such as the potential for innocent people to be wrongfully executed, or the fact that it may disproportionately target poor and minority citizens. In my opinion, the death penalty does not serve as an effective deterrent for crime. Studies have shown that states without the death penalty have lower murder rates than those with the death penalty. Furthermore, the death penalty is an expensive process that can cost taxpayers more money than it would to incarcerate someone for life. Lastly, instead of using the death penalty, we should focus on rehabilitation and creating better early intervention programs for at-risk populations. This would be more beneficial to society in the long run, and would ultimately lead to a decrease in crime.
