Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and usually it's not your fault... But when you're raped by someone who has been drunk on purpose for the sake of punishing or humiliating them (or as in this case to get back at their ex), then it's really difficult. I think what he means is that men sometimes turn off comfort mode because they want fucked up things like anal play, but women don't tend towards stuff more taboo than being eaten out. If she doesn't feel comfortable going down on him without consent her only option may be to find another partner which kind of defeats his point about wanting something different from other people she "She" isn't referring specifically here though - nor are any females depicted in the post.
