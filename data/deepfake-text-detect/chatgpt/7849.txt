While it may be true that space debris might not pose an immediate problem, it is important to recognize the long-term consequences of neglecting this issue. Space debris has the potential to damage valuable space infrastructure such as satellites, which are essential for communication, weather forecasting, and national security. In addition, the amount of space debris is only increasing with time, as more countries and private companies launch objects into space. Without proper management and mitigation strategies, the growth in space debris will eventually create a hazardous environment that could limit future space exploration and activity. Therefore, neglecting the problem of space debris today could lead to serious consequences in the future.
