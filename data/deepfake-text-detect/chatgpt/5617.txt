So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion. The reason I'm hoping it will be ok here is because I've seen a lot of people who are not against Darius and I feel that there is room for discussion on the topic. A lot of people criticize Darius because of the theme, but I feel that that's a bit harsh as it's not like he was the first to have the theme, and the theme is one of the things that makes the Darius series special, but I can see why people dislike it. Another thing people criticize is that Darius is not very popular outside of Japan, but this might be due to the fact that the series is more popular in Japan than outside of Japan, and that the series is not so popular outside of Japan. Darius is one of my favorite shooters, and I hope that the series will get some more love in the future as I feel that it has a lot to offer. Hey I'm in the same boat, this is my favorite shooter series. The theme is the thing that really turns me off though. I can't take it seriously with that ridiculous aesthetic, and so the gameplay suffers for me. I know that the newest games are more hardcore and not quite so cutesy, but I still don't know if I can play a darius game without thinking of the gimmicky aesthetic that we've had for the last 10 years or so. Darius games aren't popular outside of Japan because they're not very good. They're well liked in Japan because they're popular. I think Darius games have a lot to offer, but I'm not interested in playing them because of the aesthetic. That being said, I'd rather have a shooter with a cutesy aesthetic than a shooter with a serious aesthetic. Nah, I'm glad Darius games aren't that popular. It's not like other shooters are particularly popular or anything. Darius games are good, I like them, but I'd rather play an FPS game than a shooter. Darius games aren't popular outside of Japan because they're not very good. Thats an interesting point, because I never really thought about it before. But I guess you're right, since the series has been unpopular for years. One thing I'm worried about is that the newest games will be unpopular outside of Japan as well. I think that the aesthetic has been a bit of a problem for the series, but I'm not really sure. I think it's important to note that the aesthetic really isn't that big of a problem, especially if you play the newest games. Yeah, it's definitely not a problem. But I feel that Darius is just better without the cutesy aesthetic. I think that the new games are still cutesy, but they're also much more serious than the previous games. I think that they are a good balance. That's fair. I guess it's just that the new games don't look like Darius games, and the old games don't look like the new games. I agree with this though, and I'm hoping that the new games will become more popular. Oh I see, yeah, the first games were definitely more cutesy than the newer games. I guess that's true, but I think the games are still recognizable as Darius games. Yeah, I think it's fair to say that the new games look more like Darius games than the older games. I think that the new games look like Darius games, but they're just more serious. Yeah, I agree with this. I guess that's the tradeoff. I'm not sure though, but I think I'd be more likely to play a shooter than a FPS, unless it was like a shooter that was a FPS. Yeah, I guess that's fair. Yeah, I agree with this, but I'm worried about the new games. I hope the new games will be popular too. Yeah, I think so. I think the new games are a good compromise. I'm not sure though, but I think I'd be more likely to play a shooter than a FPS, unless it was like a
