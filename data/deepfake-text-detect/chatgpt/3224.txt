"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the future, we will need to create more advanced intelligent technologies, including robots, to help us solve our most pressing problems. These robots will not literally become our children, but they will be our creations that we will need to nurture and guide, just like parents do with their children. There are concerns about the potential of robots to surpass human intelligence and perhaps even become a threat to our existence. However, proponents of artificial intelligence, including Minsky, argue that this can be avoided if we design these technologies with ethical considerations in mind and work collaboratively with them to achieve common goals. Ultimately, the future relationship between humans and robots will require us to navigate complex ethical and social issues, but it may also present new opportunities for our growth and evolution as a species.
