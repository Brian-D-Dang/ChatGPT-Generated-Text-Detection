I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by which a given branch is chosen for the legislative quarterlies or bi-weekly reports is not the same as the selection procedure applied to the electoral college. Witherspoon: Is there any other way you see this being resolved? Mr. Speaker, I can think of no reason why we must choose between proportional representation and Fixed Representation. Both equally meet our criteria in voting on legislation. Furthermore, both would provide equal opportunity for all parties represented in the legislature; neither would result in the domination of one party over another. Mr. Inhofe: We may be able to work something out here today, if it doesn't come up again tomorrow. If it does, I will try my best. The members are willing to leave us alone until they know exactly what is going on. They just want to make sure we do everything right before we start doing anything else. Senator Blunt: Do we actually vote on this bill now? Mr. Blunt: Yes. Senator Murkowski: Yes. And then we walk away. That seems like an awful lot of effort for nothing, don't you think so? [Laughter] With respect to the fixed representation, Senator Murkowski, did your opponent say he was against fixed representation, too? Or was his statement about "fixed" limited to his opponent's expressed opposition to proportional representation?
