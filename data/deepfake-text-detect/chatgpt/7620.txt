While having an extensive library on iTunes is certainly valuable, there are several reasons why you might consider switching to a streaming service like Spotify. For one, Spotify's extensive music library lets you stream virtually any song or album you want without having to purchase a physical copy or add it to your library. Moreover, Spotify's algorithms provide personalized recommendations and curated playlists based on your listening habits, offering a unique and constantly evolving music experience. Additionally, Spotify also offers exclusive content such as live sessions, concerts, and podcasts that iTunes might not have access to. Finally, using multiple streaming services can also enhance your music discovery journey, exposing you to a broader range of music, artists, and genres.
