EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People who use them for legitimate reasons can't just be labeled as "triggered" and dismissed without discussion of why those facts remain true. I've never heard anyone say this and I live in a very liberal area on Long Island.
