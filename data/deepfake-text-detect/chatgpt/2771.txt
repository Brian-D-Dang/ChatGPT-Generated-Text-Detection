I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need a smoke? No, smoking is associated with stress (whether or not it's caused). In fact, I would argue that the only reason to keep them legal is out of fear for your life if someone tries mugging you while you're walking down the street. A bad habit like this isn't going away any time soon though so at least make sure smokers aren't allowed free reign everywhere. And call me crazy, but it gives off an early warning sign about what kind of person he might be. In my experience anyway...
