This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... It's great to see someone willing to broaden their horizons and consider different viewpoints.

So, what is it that you would like to discuss or consider a new perspective on?
