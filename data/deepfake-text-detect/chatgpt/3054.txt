I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with how the animals are raised for their meat. There is all sorts of treatment done to ensure that these poor creatures don't die from starvation or exposure while being grown. The most common method employed in raising livestock such as sheep, cattle etc - at least here in Australia - involves putting them into what are called "cattle grids" which looks something similar to a small pen but they're quite big so there isn't any danger of the animals escaping (they naturally stay close by to each other). With chickens those cages are much smaller than the grid system used for cowssheep. They have access to water though, and then you can get them slaughtered more easily if you wish. Other methods include milking the animal regularly, keeping them indoors mostly during winter months, providing additional feed when needed. Again, just some examples rather than an exhaustive list...there are lots of different ways animals can be treated depending on where they live, what they need and whether humans feel the desire to provide it for them. If we had no way to treat our 'livestock', then they could suffer greatly - and I'm sure if nobody ate lamb or beef anymore then they'd probably disappear too soon anyway. We do try very hard not to cause unnecessary suffering to animals in order to raise them for consumption. Then comes the actual slaughtering process - quick death via bullet or whatever else people choose. There are laws governing exactly how long after birth they must be hung before killing, and again there are regulations about humanely killing the animal because sometimes lambs will be only two days old and still attached to their mothers, others may be older and dead already. This means that even if you buy your meat from somewhere localfrom someone who treats his stock well, he might have bought it from somewhere else where things aren't necessarily ethical either. But yes, generally speaking farmland produces higher quality wool and milk than does city-based commercial farming, simply due to the conditions under which both live and breed. So I guess overall we try very hard to produce high quality foodstuffs whilst causing minimal damage to the environment around us. As far as animals bred specifically for human consumption go, I think it depends whom you ask - farmers of whichever sort? Or vegans? Some vegetarians also keep pets, whereas others regard dogscatsetc. as food sources instead. Having said that, many people consider certain types of pet such as cats dogs as food items themselves because they kill vermin. All kinds of questions here!! How about factory farms producing meat products? These are very controversial issues and should bring up feelings of guilt as to why one chooses to consume meat derived from such practices. My answer: It depends on WHY you're consuming it
