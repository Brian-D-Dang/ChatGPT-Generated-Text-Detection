I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically it's probably safer than coal or oil in terms of risk factors (and there are many). What I am deeply afraid of is what these massive new reactors will do to our air. Our atmosphere contains some 2-5 nitrogen oxide; if you add another 25-50, you've got quite a problem on your hands... When people talk "nuclear safety," they usually mean:1) If there's one reactor meltdown, we might be able to shut down the whole plant for daysweeks while we wait for backup generators to come online2) Nuclear fuel must be stored at extremely low temperatures3) A single operator of a single reactor can't make critical decisions when operating 4) Each reactor requires huge amounts of foodstuffs to produce its own fuel I would never want any part of my life about which I can't control anything done by anyone else to affect me in a negative way. My mother used to say that she didn't care whether the president was black or white as long as he had good hair and great ears....she'd also like homosexuals lined up behind her! And yes, the second sentence is a joke, although it is ironic since President Obama has been doing some pretty awesome stuff recently with respect to gay rights! In other news, some websites today have claimed that Obama's stimulus package increase the deficit by 300 billion dollars! That's right, 300 billion dollars!! Anyone who says otherwise is lying through their teeth!!!
