Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, or considering regulating this increase to a certain level of wages for all employees within their jurisdiction. This is generally applied across industries such as food services where tips can be relied upon by workers. The problem with the regulation of this issue lies not only on how it will affect businesses but also what it actually means to raise people's wages. Minimum Wages: A Basic Perspective on Raising Minimum Wage The question about whether we should raise the minimum wage seems like an easy one - if someone makes less than 15hour then they deserve more money! But there are some key problems that arise when trying to answer the question effectively. For starters, let me point out that many companies aren't even paying their current staff members enough already at 7.25hour so I don't think we need to worry too much about them being able to pay higher salaries without laying off staff just yet. However, the government is quick to make exceptions when things go bad, which is rarely because every company needs to be profitable. In fact, most banks have recently been asking governments for bailouts after becoming highly leveraged from buying up assets (ie CDOs). So instead of worrying about whether we will create high unemployment rates through these regulations, perhaps we should look into why our economy works this way? Why do major corporations get bailed out while smaller ones struggle? Is this something we want to continue doing indefinitely until another economic crisis does us all in? Another thing worth mentioning here is that since the introduction of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, average worker productivity has increased over 3000. Despite this, real incomes are still around 25 lower today compared to 70 years ago [1]. What this tells you is that productivity leads to overall benefit increases rather than raises. Since low-skilled jobs are generally replaced by machines faster than other type of work anyways, increasing minimum wages isn't going to help those who could potentially lose their jobs due to automation anyway. It really comes down to ideology; the social conservatives side of the political spectrum doesn't believe a living wage is necessary whereas the liberals say it is. Increasing minimum wages might not solve the problem of income disparity between rich and poor, but it certainly might lead to further erosion in actual consumer purchasing power, especially among the working class segment of society. If everyone receives that little bit extra each month, it wouldn't mean anything unless prices decrease proportionally. Unfortunately, politicians seem to favour giving 'free stuff' to voters during election campaigns rather than addressing some of the underlying issues behind rising inequality. We see this time and again where products become increasingly expensive due to inflationary pressure, which is ultimately passed onto consumers via higher taxes eventually resulting in decreased consumption levels. Government intervention right now looks to be pushing the total tax burden on Canadian families towards 39, which is more than double the rate seen before the implementation of the GST HST system [2]. We shouldn't rush headlong into any policy change because we feel sorry for the majority of Canadians struggling to survive day to day, but neither should we ignore the growing concerns of wealth disparity and ever-increasing taxation levels being imposed on ordinary citizens. An Alternative Approach To Reducing Income Disparity There are alternatives to increasing minimum wages though such as better education systems focused on job training programs amongst others. By investing in policies geared toward making it easier for workers to obtain new skills through formalized educational institutions, we give individuals access to skill sets required for upward mobility. As long as employers value qualifications based on knowledge (a la University), rather than the ability to memorize information efficiently (i.e., standardized tests), soon-to-be graduates would find themselves being rehired following temporary layoff periods given the general lack of experience available to fill positions within most markets. Companies requiring specific skill set requirements may struggle under labour market conditions whereby demand exceeds supply - however, this kind of difficulty is no different than facing challenges encountered by companies seeking investment capital. Given sufficient demand combined with improved access to skilled labor, firms are likely to invest in hiring additional support staff (mechanics, managers engineers) to fill roles created by automation. Such measures could alleviate existing constraints faced by companies whose business models require them to maintain fixed physical plant through long term leases. One potential obstacle to overcome would stem from regulatory hurdles that prevent businesses from offering programs specifically designed to enable entry-level workers into the workforce. Any such measure that fosters entrepreneurship (such as reducing small claims court fees) along with changes to Tax laws would benefit both large and small scale investors alike by offering incentives for companies to expand operations beyond borders. These types of reforms offer opportunities to address global imbalances whilst simultaneously supporting domestic entrepreneurship, leading the economies of each country involved to grow relatively evenly.
