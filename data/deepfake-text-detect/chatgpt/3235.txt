I'm a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find sillytrivial. I'm currently dating a girl who is a feminist and it's important to have open and honest conversations with her about what aspects of the feminist movement you agree with and what you don't. It's important to respect each other's opinions and beliefs, even if they don't always align. You can also consider educating yourself more on the history and tenets of feminism to better understand the movement as a whole. This can help you have more informed and productive conversations with your girlfriend about it. Remember, being a feminist doesn't mean you have to agree with every single aspect of the movement. It's about recognizing and advocating for equality and dismantling systemic oppressions. As long as you are committed to those goals, you can be a supporter of feminism in your own way.
