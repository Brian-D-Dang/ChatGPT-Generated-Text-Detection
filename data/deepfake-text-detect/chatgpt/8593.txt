It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing that is certain is that China has not always been in economic or financial hands since it was founded five years ago on the promise that it would never give up leadership. To be sure, there are certainly Chinese diplomatic and military ties with Russia. But this does not mean that China will abandon its foreign policy completely behind closed doors. In fact, such steps would even make things more tense than before. Of course, China's influence over other countries is so powerful that it can soon become a major player in international affairs - at least until Beijing stops manipulating its own borders. Of course, what happens in China won't happen overnight. The circumstances may change by the day, but some still believe that the past two decades have provided a pattern for how China sees relations with others around the world. And once again, the need to manage these tensions between the United States and the Communist Party is an important issue. The same cannot be said of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) itself. After decades of growth and modernization, the Chinese government faces huge challenges today. It remains mostly isolated from most Western nations. Many Chinese citizens think that their country is too weak and should move away from the tightly controlled economy that is a breeding ground for terrorism. That doesn't necessarily apply to anyone else who shares their concerns. This - and many other aspects of society - are also under threat because of rising nationalism and hyperbolic rhetoric against China. China's leaders know that problems like the coronavirus outbreak will come back on them. They need to find solutions to keep fighting the virus, especially if it means warring with each other on the border. Today's China-Russia relationship needs as much support as possible. For example, the United States has already supported President Donald Trump, and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has pledged to use his position as president to try to resolve tensions between Moscow and Washington. Whether we agree on the solution will depend on whom you ask. If you want to follow Xi Jinping's lead in implementing a new China strategy for 2020, you might want to look carefully at your options.
