Edit: Thanks for all the info. I more or less quit responding because a couple people effectively changed the way I was looking at the issue. To be honest though, this question comes up often in my mind and I'm pretty sure there's some good information here that might help someone else with similar issues. I've recently been having an interesting problem where when I listen to music on Spotify (or any other streaming service), while working, it will eventually stop syncing properly. The last song is still playing but the UI tells me "1 hour left" or something like that, even if the track finishes after 2 minutes. This happens whether I use Spotify Desktop or play through Chrome as well as FirefoxChrome. It can also happen accidentally without switching over from another app so not 100 reproducible. Finally, it seems that I can only sync correctly once per session. If I try again later, I get no errors about skipping tracks and just have to take control of the playback manually and let it finish itself out...kinda weird behavior. Some examples are below, first one being typical. Second example shows it occurring twice within 10s of eachother (same spot) and third is showing right before going into sleep mode (usually around 11am).

[06-27-2017 04:42 PM] Jameson Lee: How did you reproduce the bug and what version of chrome were you using when it happened? Did you report this to Google yet? We're willing to spend time investigating these things if we think we may find something useful! [08-01-2017 05:14 PM] jamescarrigan: You probably want to file a bug. Pinging our team doesn't always work:P Don't worry about wasting anyone's time; we usually find stuff like this very quickly, especially given how many users we have now post questions across multiple sites:) [06-28-2018 08:22 PM] Jameson Lee: So I've had the same issue for quite some time now actually since December 2017 according to it coming back every 4 weeks or whatever:D (Screenshot) [05-09-2019 03:53 PM] Jameson Lee: Not logged in anymore unfortunately: (Hopefully next time I log in I'll remember to try and recreate it, otherwise it might not come back until October;) Anyway thank you guys for taking the time to look into it!
