I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm not even going to think about how many people they've slept with in the last six months). When I hear about stories like this, I try to offer advice to my friends, because I can relate. I used to be a serial monogamist, and I've been married for two years. I'm not saying that I'm any better than anyone else, but I think I know what I'm talking about. 1. You will fall in love with someone and be happy for a while. 2. You will fall out of love with that person, and it will hurt. 3. You will fall in love with someone else, and be happy for a while. 4. You will fall out of love with that person, and it will hurt. You will fall in love with someone else, and be happy for a while. You will fall out of love with that person, and it will hurt. Repeat steps 2-4 until you die. The first few times you fall in love, you feel like your heart is going to burst, like you're floating on clouds, and you can't stop smiling. But then you get hurt, and it's horrible. You feel like you've been stabbed, and you cry, and you swear you'll never love anyone again. But then you fall in love with someone else, and repeat steps 2-4. I believe that you should always have your heart open, and you should always be ready to love someone, but I think that you should make sure that you're in a good place before you fall in love. You should be able to be there for someone else. I'm not trying to tell you that you should never get into a relationship. I'm not trying to tell you that love doesn't exist. I'm just trying to tell you that it's okay to take your time, and find out what you're looking for. There are a lot of people who will tell you that you have to be married by 25, or have a baby by 26, or have the perfect career at 30. But I think it's okay to take your time and figure out what you want. I'm not saying you should wait for marriage. I'm just saying that you don't have to settle for the first person you meet. We don't have to make decisions. We can wait to fall in love, because the person we're looking for will be there, and we'll be ready.
