Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a proxy war between our two countries - not that any of it wasn't interesting to read about. But there's no question in my mind that there is some romantic side to American life beyond "war" or its terror-mongering attempts at peace. And although we've all had times when we thought we could get away with such things as being gay on U.S. soil (the question remains how much more you can be banned from doing so), there are still folks who believe the basic tenets of human rights don't apply here; there aren't enough grounds for those beliefs to hold up. But to see what sort of world we live in now is nothing short of awe-inspiring. The government has simply blown us away by embracing an ideology that seems completely foreign to us but which hasn't been challenged yet. The American West itself isn't new. It's merely got a lot of people wishing they were too ugly for America to tolerate. That, and the fact that many Americans have refused to congratulate US troops for their - dare I say it - good work (and actually do appreciate) job security rather than engaging with them personally. We're also not even quite sure why we feel compelled to let the military decide where we go after it has destroyed our economy. It uses the process of destruction to justify wars, using institutions that have long since lost sight of their place within history: the Constitution, Civil Rights Act, and the Voting Rights Act. This is a tradition that is far more representative of today's society than the past century: democracy, equality, and freedom of speech. We shouldn't pretend it doesn't exist. Let's take this as evidence that the US military has become nothing less than the most oppressive institution ever invented. In addition to its institutional failures, the US military continues to instill fear throughout the wider public sphere and risk further damage unless the US moves quickly and decisively against these institutions.
