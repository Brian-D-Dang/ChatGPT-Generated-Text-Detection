I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by which the American people are governed is not as simple or straightforward as many seem to think. The Founding Fathers had a very clear idea about how they wanted the government to be run but it boils down to this: "We hold these truths..." They were then followed up with the Constitution, the Bill Of Rights, and other laws passed in 17891791. In theory, the Founders intended for each state to govern itself - electing its own Senators and sending them back to D.C., etc... With full representation in both Houses of Congress at all times. But since there was no international law in place governing such things, another layer of complexity crept into our system. See also States' rights vs Federalism. It's complex and confusing! So if you want fair elections, raise the voting age to 18 years old, making college students eligible to vote too. If we're going to allow 16 year olds under 21 to drink alcohol why can't they cast their votes? After all, they already know what candidates they support, whether from personal experience or media influence. Let's give young voters an equal say as older ones who may have lived through decades of nonsense on voter ignorance and misinformation. We need to get rid of gerrymandering where districts are drawn so politicians pick their constituents rather than having constituencies come together based on issues and values. I don't care if your district borders California or Hawaii; you could vote in either one of those places because your interests are similar and equally important to any of us across the country. You might even like surfing over there;) As long as you live near enough the border of said states, why shouldn't you represent them? This would end partisan bickering between parties and make more sense in terms of federalism and sovereignty. Our current political situation sucks because most of my generation wants change yet has been raised to fear it. Others believe they've found something better out there but won't do anything themselves (see any presidential candidate) just wanting someone else to do it for them. There's definitely people putting money behind campaigns and influencing decisions within politics, but nobody really seems to understand why we exist. We need to vote United! Get online and look around, ask questions and research what's happening. Go beyond the mainstream news sources- read articles written by real journalists instead of talking heads. Maybe find a local journalist group. Or start one yourself if none exists! Become active without being part of some party, faction or movement. Divide and conquer isn't working here and never will work. Start thinking outside the box. Think big picture instead of petty fights and name calling. Time to unite before the money runs dry. So when the founders wrote the constitution, their intent was that power rested solely in the hands of US citizens living IN THE UNITED STATES AND NOT BECAUSE WE ARE RACIST OR FASCISTS TO HAVE A SUPREMECENTRAL GOVERNMENT WHICH EXERCISE TOTAL CONTROL OVER ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS INCLUDING THEIR FUNDAMENTS OF LIFE LIKE HEALTH CARE INSURANCE, EDUCATION VOTER REGISTRATIONS.Also even though the senate and house of representatives are supposed to reflect the average citizen's views and opinions they NEVER DO!!!! And the reason why is because the democrats control EVERYTHING!!!!!THEY NEED THOSE 2 BUILDINGS SO THAT THEY CAN DICTATE HOW TAXPAYS SHOULD BE SPENT ON SOCIAL PROGRAMS ETC... IT IS TIME FOR CONGRESSWOMAN ELENOR SUZUKI WHO HAS HAD SEVRELL SUPPORT FROM MR TRUMP TO CHANGE HER MIND ABOUT THIS AND PUSH THROUGH ANY LAW EVEN IF ITS ILLEGAL!!!
