Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. "That means that marriage should only become a legal contract between two people of the same sex" sounds as if you are saying those who disagree with your opinion can't marry? That's not what it says at all! It just states there shouldn't have been an exception made for them when civil unions started becoming available in Massachusetts... I am going into my second week now and still trying too figure everything about gay rights but one thing has really stuck me; The fact most homosexuals seem perfectly fine living their lives privately without anyone knowing they're even different from heterosexual couples we see on TV or such (i'm assuming). Does everyone know someone straight married coupleparents yet never mention anything being 'different' than other hetero families which makes these distinctions pretty useless imo.. If society doesnor want 2nd class citizens then why keep segregating themselves by using labels?! Just seems unfair no matter how hard some try harder others donate more money etc... Most times life goes where u go rather than focusing solely onto its communities standpoints i think-Example: many years ago after graduating college (mid 90) this girl went home back east she got along great till her mom found Pokemon cards santa claus introduced things regarding Santa Claus making fun comments towards gays over dinner Christmas Eve causing issues within family!!! No idea whether friends were around during conversation either way must remember dad was also present!! My question here comes down do parents make homophobic remarks toward children?? Say perhaps kids masturbation habits??? These kind thoughts may differ however personal experiences aside please comment:) Here again another very similar situation happened involving childhood friend recently - Example:- This young lady grew extremely close wen both our fathers died unexpectedly 6 months apart leaving 3 year old little girls behind vulnerable enough needing adults attention talking openly whereas myself had 4 older brothers growing closer together through tragedies due circumstance vs strangers allowing friendship grow naturally because nothing else mattered except surviving situations financially physically emotionally ilyng9gmailcom
