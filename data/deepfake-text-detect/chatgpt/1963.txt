Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the proposed legislation, it would become illegal for citizens of all ages and gender identities who are not out as trans people to use restrooms that match their assigned sex at birth - even when they're using them alone or with family members. This measure was passed by North Carolina Republicans last year but has been temporarily blocked from taking effect because of ongoing legal challenges. The bill also removes civil rights protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The law previously allowed transgender people access to public facilities corresponding to the bathroom matching their preferred name and gender if "nothing unusual is known about the individual such that heshe should be questioned upon entering." Now there will be no exceptions; advocates say this amounts to forcing transgender students into humiliating situations where school officials learn more intimate details about them than necessary. A new section notes that government employees have already successfully sought damages through lawsuits "for failing to accommodate persons whose sincerely held religious beliefs require accommodation contrary to state anti-discrimination laws." So far, the only major Republican lawmakers publicly supportive of HB2s repeal include Trump allies Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney. But other GOP legislators like Rep. Patrick McHenry said after Obama left office without issuing guidance concerning Title IX: "I think we've got time now." In fact, a study released Monday found that 717 bills were introduced across 36 states during 2016 designed to limit LGBT rights negatively impacting nearly every aspect of life including housing, healthcare, education, employment, adoption and foster care services among others. So long as conservatives feel emboldened under executive orders signed by President Donald J. Trump, don't expect progress anytime soon.
