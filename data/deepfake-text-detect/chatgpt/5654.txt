I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the other way around. I understand the reason for this (I think) is that in the old days, the freezer was designed to freeze meat faster than the fridge because the meat would cool faster than the surrounding air. However, what I don't understand is why modern fridges and freezers have a fixed location for the freezer (usually the bottom). I have a couple of questions: Why was the freezer placed on the bottom of a fridge instead of the top? Why is a fixed location for the freezer chosen? You say "in the old days" - can you elaborate on this? Also, do you have any links or references to this "old days"? - Marcus Muller Jan 17 '12 at 17:11 Marcus Muller: The "old days" were at least 15 years ago (and possibly 30). I was living in Germany at the time. - Tom Au Jan 17 '12 at 18:35 I have heard, probably wrongly, that in the old days meat was kept in the fridge for no more than a week and then defrosted in the freezer for several days. I think that the fridge was designed to keep meat fresh for that week. - cjc Jan 17 '12 at 22:17 Tom Au: I'm wondering if this has to do with the position of the condenser coil in the fridge. It is often on the bottom, and so I have often heard it said that this is because it is easier to keep the freezer at a lower temperature. - Dan Jan 18 '12 at 17:09 I'm guessing that the freezer bottom of the refrigerator isn't on the bottom of the refrigerator. I'm guessing it is on the bottom of a separate unit. The fridge top is just the door for the freezer. That being said, it would be more energy efficient to store the food in the bottom of the fridge. Also, if you have a freezer bottom of the fridge, you can easily see the frozen food from the fridge. It also allows more room in the freezer for the largest items, like ice cream and frozen pizzas. I don't think the freezer bottom of the fridge is more energy efficient. I think the freezer compartment is kept at a lower temperature than the fridge. - Dan Jan 18 '12 at 17:07 The reason the freezer is on the bottom of a two door unit is because it is easier to cool it in a more efficient manner. You could do it any other way, but it would be much more difficult. Also, if the freezer is located on the bottom, it is much easier to access the frozen food and store items in an organized manner. In the past it was normal to freeze meat for a week or two before cooking it. If the meat was kept in the fridge, it would quickly be ruined by bacteria. In those days, the freezer was a separate unit, and it was not as energy efficient to cool. I would bet that the fridge, is on top, because it is easier to cool it than the freezer. I've always wondered this as well. The reason I've always thought of is that if it's the top, the food won't spill over. In a bottom mount, you'd have to open the door, take the food out, put it on the counter and replace it. I would think that the top would also mean that the food is raised, meaning that the cooling system has less distance to cool. Michael D.G.Michael D.G. I think the reason the freezer is at the bottom is to accommodate for the condenser at the top of the fridge, so it doesn't have to have a lot of air space between it and the food. One of the reasons why I have always used a separate freezer is that I can't stand the messy food in the fridge. Things like raw eggs, onions, garlic, greens, bread, etc. (in my case, anyway) get a smell that permeates the entire fridge. The freezer, on the other hand, smells only like ice. And the freezer also has the advantage that it is easier to see what is in there. I have a small freezer, though, and only use it for keeping veget
