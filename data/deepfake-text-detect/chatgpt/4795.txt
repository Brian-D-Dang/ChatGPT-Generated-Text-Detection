I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites for useful information (e.g., the British version of Wikipedia), manually copy-and-paste that into spreadsheets to generate reports or chart positions against competitors' salesrevenue etc. Nowadays we have an Internet connection so why not use our internet? That's what most people do when they're sitting on their computers all day! Sometimes this is called data mining... But there are also many other terms like these: web scraping, web crawling, crawlers, robots, spidering, search engine optimization, SEO, Web 2.0 marketing... Hmmm, maybe you should start with the generic term "crawling" instead of just saying "web scrapping," because you want your product to be used by as many companies as possible - including those who don't know about data analysis. Sounds reasonable? Good luck!:)
