First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised. Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, and the memories of when my foreskin got cut away from the head are so happy that they do indeed overshadow any negative feelings towards having been circumcised in general. I don't think you can discount or downplay anything if you were forced into doing something against your will. It's like being forcefully raped by someone in your own home while conscious, yet still trying to say "it wasn't THAT bad"
