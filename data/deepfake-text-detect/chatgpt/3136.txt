This people are selling good feelings. Not really being able to talk to the dead or a magic pill to lose weight. They are like movies or video games. They provide entertainment and temporary escapism for people who are looking for an emotional or psychological uplift. While these services may not have any scientific evidence or factual basis, it is important to remember that people should not rely solely on them for making major decisions or improving their lives. It is always better to seek professional help from certified and licensed experts in their respective domains.
