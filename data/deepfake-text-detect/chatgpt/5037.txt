Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by reason - within reason alone, no matter how irrational it might seem to others or otherwise contrary to its own needs. This includes including the arguments against strict religious belief systems such as Christianity; methods of persuasion and practice; beliefs about personal responsibility and Christian faithfulness; the moral obligation for self-government (the Christian right); efforts to understand the nature of religion itself in terms of freedom from injustice; and an awareness that some actions are necessary only because they agree with our sense of justice. In other words, hyper rationality requires a commitment to pragmatism rather than rational thought. Feel free to comment below on what I have written here.

The world could use more people who believe this way of thinking: skeptics, atheists, agnostics, philosophers, skeptics, believers who disagree, nonbelievers...
