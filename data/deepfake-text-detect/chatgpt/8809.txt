I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured to give birth in public! That's also true for men who want to stay married and that they're terrified of having kids. It's not all about sexuality though. If you don't like your name being used as an excuse to shy away from something or someone else's name (usually it'll just make them feel uncomfortable), then definitely stop using it, but otherwise keep trying!
