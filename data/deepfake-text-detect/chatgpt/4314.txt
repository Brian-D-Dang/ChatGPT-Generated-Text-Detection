The likes of ratheism argue that most of the world's problems come from religion, and that a post-religion world would be miles better. As humans, we inherently drive ourselves into trouble: our beliefs give us influence over everyone around us; they provide comfort to those threatened by change; and they are used as tools for manipulating individuals and groups in society. Communist countries were built on religious principles but then had them abandoned because it was too costly or difficult to enforce atheism. Communism is essentially an anarcho-capitalist paradigm taken to its logical extreme where no one will be able to make money without having left their faith behind. The problem with Communist states is that they don't actually work perfectly well - there are still corruption scandals, dissidents can easily flee, and people have been killed simply for being suspected of not believing enough. One very important aspect of religion is keeping it out of politics and especially when it comes to elections. An election can be a form of war between competing ideologies, each of which wants to win. You could see this in places like Egypt and Iran today, where there is often violence between rival parties trying to get votes. This leads to greater polarization within society, where certain factions become more entrenched than others. This leads to evermore violent political conflicts, until you reach a crisis point where both sides start fighting amongst themselves. Religious people do great things all through history. They've saved many lives, helped build civilizations, invented sciences and mathematics, and made some really amazing discoveries. However, none of these achievements came about without people making a lot of sacrifices. Religion has led to wars and bloodshed, and even at times helped create more problems rather than solve them. It has also caused massive amounts of suffering throughout human history. Religious doctrine is sometimes oppressive, and governments who use religion to justify rule end up creating religious dictatorships. There are always exceptions, however, so I'd go ahead and say that almost everything that happened in history could be attributed to religion if one looks hard enough.
