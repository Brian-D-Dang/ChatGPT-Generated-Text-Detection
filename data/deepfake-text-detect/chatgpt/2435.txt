Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to 15hour. While many would agree that this should be accepted by every company in America as an ethical way for their employees' better wages; there are some who disagree on whether or not it will actually work towards anything good at all, besides encouraging higher employee turnover rates due to low pay (which turns into more money spent hiring new staff). Many people also argue against companies being forced through government mandate to raise wages because they feel it could potentially lead those same businesses out of business altogether if customers can no longer afford what these stores sell... And others believe such action isn't necessary since our economy has proven itself capable enough over time without any outside help from politicians like Obama, which leads me to my next point: Obama himself opposes increasing the federal minimum wage to 15 per hour. He believes "it doesn't make sense economically." This response came during his 2015 State Of The Union Address when he was asked about why we still haven't seen him change labor laws despite campaigning so hard on them four-ish years ago. That's right folks... If you want something done ask your mother, but don't count on President Barry O'Malley doing much for us even though he promised repeatedly throughout his campaign trail that things were going to get far worse under anyone else other than him. So while most Americans continue supporting Bernie Sander's plan one Senator just recently released his own version of how to increase income equality across all 50 states called the "Raise Up" Act, where each state must have its minimum wage raised to meet the average before getting more benefits after meeting certain benchmarks set forth within each particular bill.
