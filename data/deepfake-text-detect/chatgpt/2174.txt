The Earth is constantly changing and moving in predictable patterns and cycles. The water cycle and nutrient cycles (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, etc.) are Earth's metabolism. The Homo sapiens component of the biosphere consumes these resources - we feed ourselves by eating plants which have been produced using soil nutrients that were stored for millions or even billions of years from detritus accumulated over time. Anthropocentric views on nature seem to fit well within Western culture where technological prowess has served us as a competitive advantage; however they fail to adequately describe how our human existence truly fits into the whole picture. We may be able to manipulate natural systems but this does not mean that those interactions will automatically yield positive outcomes. In fact, many negative impacts can occur when humans try to impose their own ideas onto ecosystems without properly considering all factors involved. For example: it seems obvious now based upon history that expanding agricultural activities away from coastal regions resulted in significant changes locally and globally including deforestation and widespread erosion due to increased runoff. However at one point people thought that was an improvement since land use became more productive so there seemed no reason to expect otherwise. Human ingenuity only goes so far if it ignores basic ecological principles. Therein lies the problem with thinking about Nature solely through anthropomorphic lenses because while useful for certain purposes, such approaches are limited simply because they do not encompass everything else going on in nature. It fails to take into account gravity, massenergy balance equations governing chemical reactions between elements like hydrogen and oxygen causing explosions whenever conditions allow them to come together under pressure. Furthermore, some things just don't make sense unless you think outside genus homo and recognize the self-similarity across multiple domains including ecology, evolution biology and cosmology. While individual animals and organisms might have unique characteristics which differ slightly compared to other species, functional units made up of cells share identical DNA sequences regardless what organism-specific traits each cell exhibits. This means that the functions carried out inside any single animal body could also be performed anywhere else given enough genetic variation. If mutation rates remain constant then eventually every function found in biological life would exist somewhere else in the Universe once long stretches of time pass. Ultimately, given sufficiently large numbers of individuals interacting randomly over sufficient spans of time nearly anything imaginable becomes possible! At present humanity remains tightly coupled to complex global environmental systems via climate change effects caused primarily by burning fossil fuels releasing CO2 molecules back into the atmosphere helping to warm the planet thereby impacting weather patterns ranging from extremes related to temperature precipitation events affecting local environments downwind causing rising seas levels threatening island nations and low lying areas around world including major cities along coastlines worldwide. Climate models used today suggest that temperatures will continue increasing until concentration of greenhouse gasses peaks sometime during later 2020s followed by eventual decline allowing ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica melting leading sea level rise reaching several meters above current heights towards end century according to predictions of various research groups working independently. As population density increases in warmer climates requirements for fresh drinking water increase making aquifer depletion a growing concern. Other problems include lowered air quality resulting in outbreaks of diseases previously rare or non-existent within specific geographic locations often having pandemic potential enabling rapid spread among populations living close together. Such plagues ultimately lead to collapse of societies collapsing economies further exacerbating food shortages fueling conflict giving rise to new social orders. All told catastrophic cascading consequences follow inexorably pushing civilization past tipping points beyond return even before full scale meltdown begins occurring. Indeed, our corner of cosmos appears destined for extinction whether humanity survives its encounter with reality depends entirely on path taken now toward mitigating risks associated with runaway feedback loops operating in chaotic system.
