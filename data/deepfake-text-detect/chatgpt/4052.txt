First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I am not sure why you would want to go into medicine at all if you don't have any intention of following in your parents footsteps. It might be for fun but it certainly isn't for financial reasons (you can do well without going into school). Let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate Sorry I should've been more clear with my question; what is an undergraduate?
