First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces everyone to post their opinion without any context of the situation (downvote on your own posts? Really?) Now you have people who never leave reddit because they've been convinced that what is considered bad form and "internet toxicity" elsewhere must be seen as good quality here; or worse rednecks with half-baked opinions Bitcoin Cash supporters REALLY do suck!. Why should I like Bitcoin if it failed so miserably at being money - can't there just ever go up for once?! Down vote donuts! The answer isn't more censorship by admins - we need better moderation tools than those provided right now most importantly not some centralized power which could easily become corruptible via briberyblackmail etc. Opinions make us human, living inside my head too;
