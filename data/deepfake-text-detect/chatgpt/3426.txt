I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was disappointed to learn that while the film is based on a true story, it takes some creative liberties with the facts, particularly in regards to the portrayal of Alan Turing's relationships and the role of other codebreakers in the Enigma project. It's always important to keep in mind that Hollywood movies are not necessarily accurate portrayals of historic events and figures, and to do your own research to get a more complete and nuanced understanding of the subject matter.
