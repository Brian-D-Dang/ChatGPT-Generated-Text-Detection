On a hair dryer: "Do not use in a shower." If somebody's dumb enough to use a hair dryer in the shower, they're not going to pay much attention to what it does. The same applies if someone uses the shampoo and conditioner in a shampoo barber shop that is full of hairspray; if you wash their scalp with shampoo when they don't want tonic water only then they probably won't care for the shampoo.
