Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news x] , [x] after delivering a speech in which she said that "for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of black and brown children in cages is not just heartbreaking but also distressing," "I'm angry about it" and asked Congress to pass laws against the practice. She's also made some comments on local radio stations saying those things X]. And then I was surprised when NPR released what they called an exclusive interview with her earlier this week where she says so many similar things. This interview actually comes from an article written by a journalist for Politico Magazine - one which is being quoted here because they had access to the interview. [HT: Msrmm]
