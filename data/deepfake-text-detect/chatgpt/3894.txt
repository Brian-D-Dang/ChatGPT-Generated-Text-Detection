Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from club level), and when we were younger I was always so aware of the body's limits physically that it seemed like I could do no wrong; but at some point in time this changed. Nowadays with more advanced technology available for football, which is meant to assist players in their physical performance has seen its own evolution through different ball designs and philosophies. However, very little has been done by any player or team regarding improving certain aspects such as footworkmovement, running etc.. My question would be how should one develop these skills nowdays? Congratulations on making it into football! That is an amazing achievement, you must feel so proud!! You have answered several questions about training before. Let me answer another question first: What are those things you mentioned in your post?? I think what you mean to ask is "how can I improve these skills NOW!" The best thing you can do now is train hard every day with the correct technique and intensity in order to achieve improved muscle memory overall fitness levels. What will help you in training is the program given by your coach in the IFFHS Clubs section. The main points you need to focus on during practice sessions are getting your legs moving quickly, running fast around the field, sprinting up and down hills, jumping high above the ground and off the wall... There are many other exercises provided by an instructor in the form of drills.
