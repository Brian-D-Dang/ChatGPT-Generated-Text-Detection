Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or anything else, then they are not worth my time nor my energy (or even my life). This is what always gets me when people consider us to be criminals because we have possession of a firearm but then get so bent out of shape over something like having your picture taken in public. If there were no cameras, nothing would ever happen.
