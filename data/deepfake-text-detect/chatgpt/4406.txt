First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are being wasted on those who buy them in the event of a massive population boom. If you had an opportunity to hunt down one today or tomorrow...go for it! However if most people were allowed their space, then nature would ultimately take care of itself and there wouldn't be any "overpopulation" issues at all. There will always be some type crowding problems when resources become limited but over-extraction makes things worse not better. I don't have a problem with being able to purchase animals from zoos. They help provide income for those organizations and keep captive bred animals alive. Some advocates say these types of industries need to go because they create too many zoo attendances which increases humananimal conflict rates. Personally, this isn't my main concern. The real issue here is the conservation of endangered animal populations. That means letting them live free in their native environments so that their gene pools can expand naturally. The way I see it, if humans want to save wild creatures (particularly threatened ones), then we must allow them enough leeway to prevent extinction before we step into the picture. This means allowing as much economic freedom as possible without placing undue burdens on our environment. From what I understand, the U.S. has done little in regards to this aspect. We actually continue to place legal bans on possession in order to protect our native wildlife habitats. Those restrictions do nothing more than slow progress towards saving the world's last wild spaces by increasing funding costs and creating limitations on where animals may roam. Making anyone legally prohibited from purchasing exotic pets does absolutely nothing to advance this cause. It only increases revenue for private breeders, generates unnecessary jobs for tax collectors, and unnecessarily limits options for the growing number of pet owners all while doing very little to aid other efforts toward preservation. The maintaining of a healthy ecosystem requires species diversity. Species survival depends upon sufficient numbers living together to form food chains. Through selective breeding, genetic manipulation, cloning, etc., mankind increasingly attempts to increase population levels through unnatural means instead of relying upon intelligent design. Oftentimes, hybridization enthusiasts encourage biological engineering projects that produce unhealthy results. These programs intentionally seek out specific characteristics within certain organisms to enhance traits in another species - even though both parent strains operate independently under different conditions. In addition to deteriorating individual health, such practices introduce unpredictable mutations that increase the risk of undesirable outcomes including disease outbreaks. When combined with a lack of effective birth control measures, the potential exists for dangerous interbreeding between unrelated breeds and, thus, reduced biodiversity. Excessive environmental pollution also creates its own dangers including increased global temperatures, decreased oxygen concentrations, rising sea levels, acidification, nutrient depletion, habitat destruction, contaminated water supplies, deforestation, soil erosion, toxic waste accumulation, bioaccumulation, and loss of biodiversity due to invasive plant and animal species.

Information about genetically engineered foods is available via Food Folly: GMO Myths Truths on GMOs. If we make changes now that could eliminate unwanted competition later? I'm sure we will eventually get around to developing drugs and technologies that will alleviate chronic illnesses but until we reach this point, why limit our options? Do medications really stop the progression of chronic diseases? Sure they can kill bacteria and viruses but does this mean they cure us entirely? Also, what happens if generations pass by without further advancements in medical science? Would we just accept having full blown Alzheimer's? Or Parkinson's? Cancer? Heart Disease? Diabetes Type 1? All these ailments seem treatable yet none of them have been eradicated completely, nor perhaps imaginable given current technology. As long as there are new discoveries made everyday, there is still hope. Don't believe me, try and find something that hasn't already occurred for yourself. You won't succeed. Every day someone discovers something brand spanking new. Even if it was discovered yesterday, you probably didn't hear about it unless your social circle provides you access to news media 24 hours a day every single minute....because if not, then chances are you haven't seen anything new since you woke up two days ago. Trust me, check Facebook sometime. It doesn't matter whether it's good, bad, funny, sad, informative, well written, poorly written, serious, or hilarious........there's always something going on somewhere in cyberspace regardless of what time zone you reside in. And that doesn't include censorship either.....you know, government shutdowns, political parties blocking websites, ISPs disabling IP addresses, search engines limiting relevant content, and various privacy policies stopping citizens from researching information online or sharing personal knowledge. So with all that said, why not use modern medicine to battle illness? Why else should get old school machines. Crazy mixed record, defined by worst case) Noticiea lease all[lpropositilnow
