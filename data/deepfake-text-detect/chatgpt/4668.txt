I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. McDonalds is just a company that sells hamburgers and fries for money. They have no responsibility to educate their customers on whether those burgers are safe to eat. There were two things wrong with this case: 1) The plaintiff should not sue his employer without first seeking permission from an attorney who can do nothing but advise him against such action; 2) if he had sought legal advice (as required by law), then he would have been told that there was absolutely NO chance whatsoever that they could win this suit. That is why they sued in the first place because lawyers like me will never take cases where we think we might lose. It is always best to go into court knowing you are going to WIN! If you don't know for sure you won't be able to get out once you're inside. So instead of doing what legally-required precautions should have prevented them from eating these tainted food products, people made some very bad choices when deciding how to handle themselves after being fed said contaminated burgers. But ultimately, nobody at McDonald's did anything illegal... so as far as I'm concerned, McDonalds shouldn't even need a defense. In fact, according to Wikipedia [ ]: "According to the Supreme Court ruling,[1] one of the ways in which 'the defendant does business' is to sell its product to individual consumers directly." I wonder if anyone ever thought about suing McDonald's over that? In fact, since Burger King seems to have gotten away scot free, maybe somebody should file a class action lawsuit against ALL fast food restaurants... all together. Why stop at McDonald's? We'll call it "The McBurger Conspiracy...." My point is, this whole thing could easily put more pressure back onto McDonalds than it has already received in the past 20 years of existence. You see, our society tends to blame corporations whenever something goes awry with the purchase process, the quality control process, etcetera. Because companies employ laws to protect us from ourselves, therefore we feel safer buying stuff off of them rather than making our own decisions regarding our personal health and safety. Laws create responsibilities, and until recently most individuals didn't seem willing to accept this kind of responsibility.... but now that we have seen the effects that substandard ingredients have had on our life spans and our bodies, NOW we realize that letting other people decide how much risk we ought to be exposed to isn't actually working well enough. Even though we probably lack the necessary skillsknowledge to make educated judgments concerning the dangers we face, it doesn't matter anymore. After awhile, any level of uncertainty becomes intolerable and demands immediate resolution... and nowadays, we demand the ability to resolve problems quickly. We expect companies too. And sometimes we buy crap despite studies proving otherwise simply because we want quick solutions to problems that plague mankind. Then we bitch about the prices that come along with these instant fixes. Sometimes we forget that these cheap products exist only because another person paid less money for whatever it is... and that means that someone else somewhere must have had to work harder than they needed to in order to pay for your junk. When the costs involved in producing goods increase significantly due to rising wages and increasing materials, then obviously someone must have suffered greater hardship than usual during production time, yet somehow that cost wasn't included anywhere in the price tag. Some kind of invisible hand ensures that every item bought from Big Business carries an exorbitant amount of unseen labor having to happen before you ever receive the actual good itself. Those greedy businesses aren't exactly trying to help us... they just want our money. Hell, we give them plenty of ours anyway. Who needs ethical standards when one person can spend thousands upon hundreds of dollars on someone else's product just because they want it?! Of course, it really begins long before you find yourself paying 4 for that gallon of gas - we're talking about everything from high school students to big corporations, each pulling strings in favor of the next guy down line. If everyone just did the right thing, everybody wouldn't have to suffer equally. Instead, we live in a world where we conclusively choose the lesser evil option. It's called freedom. People say the government takes care of us... if that true, then let the government step up and start taking care of us. Making laws starts at home. As citizens, we tend to assume the role of police officers responsible for enforcing the rules set forth within city codes. Maybe someday, instead of waiting around while corporate America collectively ignores its duties, the community will become empowered to institute new and better regulations designed specifically to keep corporations accountable towards consumer expectations. Perhaps if this happens, McDonald's may eventually be forced to remove toxic additives from its artificial chemicals used in processing meat potatoes..... Mmmmm!!!
