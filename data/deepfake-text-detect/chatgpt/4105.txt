Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of qualified female scientistsengineers - increase the numberquality of females in finance and economics, etc... I always get a feeling that it's just wishful thinking on their part if they think "they can make more money by having more females." I'd be curious what percentage of STEM jobs are held by women.
