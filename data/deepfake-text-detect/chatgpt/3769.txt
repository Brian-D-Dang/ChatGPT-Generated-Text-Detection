After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the left supports an idea for reducing gun rights, they go out of their way to make sure that no matter how small or insignificant your issue is, you are being heard by them. You missed my point completely. I am not saying restricting guns will stop all shootings. However at least there would be a chance of saving lives if people had access to guns instead of having no guns pandemonium.
