Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this below). I have never seen this idea put forward as an ideology. It seems to me that it could easily be interpreted as "we are all free but we don't like paying taxes or obeying the government - so let's create a country where no one has any moral duty to do anything except what they feel is right." If you're talking about taxes then fair enough - maybe people should pay more tax than others? But how does it make sense to say your behaviour is not dependent upon somebody else doing something good for you personally? How can I achieve personal happiness if I'm forced by some arbitrary number of other people to contribute towards some work some person did in order to get those funds? Of course there are many problems with this argument but it raises two major issues that I want to address: 1) The suggestion that individuals shouldn't have to be accountable for their actions because someone else deserves them (which implies everyone gets everything they wanted regardless of their deeds). This is why it makes no sense at all to talk about human rights when these same people will happily sell out every single citizen of another country in the name of patriotism... but they'll still claim they care about human rights anyway. Liberals who label themselves as left wingers see no contradiction here either... because every act against them should also be considered anti-human.. but some of us actually do care about humans being treated humanely and deserve protection from such acts. As far as the religious question goes, there were even liberals back in the day whose views on religion changed and ended up becoming entirely conservative. So it's pretty clear that most of the time we don't associate ourselves with "liberal" or "conservative" ideologies - just moderate ones which give us varying degrees of power and influence over society through the state. We tend to identify ourselves ideologically with the party with the strongest influence over politicians. This is what I mean by "ideological identity." There was a lot of disagreement among liberal British conservatives during the ToryLabour split because Labour had been trying to implement policies which would keep Britain economically stable while simultaneously providing social services for poorer communities whilst cutting welfare for rich children. Conservatives felt Labour had tried to bring in too much social change and gave supporters of the Tories reason to vote Liberal Democrat... only to end up voting Conservative again soon afterwards. At least that's how I understood it... I assumed the Liberal Democrats were mostly responsible for the economic turmoil caused by the Islamist terror attacks in London in 2005? Maybe the BBC made things worse by campaigning so hard for the Tories? Who knows, nobody really cares anymore. What matters now is getting rid of that nasty, hippie Labour candidate!
