The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustratedcritical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single men who seek out the company of other single men often do so because there are no women their age available for them to date or hook up with. While a majority of gay males prefer to stay friends rather than moving into something more serious, some members of our community choose not to pass on friendship. Some people do find love even when it's just as friends. This relationship can be very satisfying to both parties involved if each person respects the boundaries set by the other party. For most anyone looking for male attention online, meeting new people face-to-face within your own area will be much easier and safer.
