The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustratedcritical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single mothers shouldn't be blamed for worrying about embracing the supremacy over their childless heterosexual children because someone else might have a child with them? What about single parents who feel unworthy of affection despite having teenagers around? What about single fathers struggling financially due to being unable or unwilling but still wanting offspring like the fatherhood experience they're capable of providing? It seems like every single person has a daughter without kids at home just waiting for her to grow up into adulthood. There's nothing wrong with supporting single parent families as long as you acknowledge that it isn't your responsibility to raise those babies too! I understand what you mean completely! I definitely don't want people tearing each other down though.
