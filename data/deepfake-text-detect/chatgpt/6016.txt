Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 6000 songs. Another complaint is that it doesn't play the music from my phone. Then I'm the only one who actually bought a portable hard drive, not a cloud player, to store all my music collection. I have 347GB of music on my phone which I can't transfer to the cloud. If I do that, I will probably end up with less than 250GB, which is not enough. I also use Spotify Premium because I like to listen to the songs from playlists. However, I also want to listen to my own playlist so it can be a problem for me to switch from one playlist to another. I found a workaround, though. I use a laptop for Spotify Premium and another device for my own playlist. This is a very useful function of Spotify. But the annoying thing is that when I add a new playlist to my own playlist, it is placed on the top of my own playlist. I don't want that. I want to choose which playlist to play. Then I created a playlist named "B." Then I added 12 songs to the playlist named "B." When I want to listen to my own playlist, I switch to "B" with the following command. I can also add a new playlist to my own playlist. I hope Spotify can change this setting. I used Spotify Premium from March 2017. Now I can listen to music from the cloud and from the portable hard drive. But I can't find a way to listen to my own playlist. If there is a way, please let me know.

However, I have a very annoying problem. It is that I can't control the playlist. I have a folder named "Music" on my phone. I'm using "Clean Master" on my phone to make sure that it is working correctly. I have created a playlist named "B." I want to listen to my playlist "B." I found a workaround. I've attached a document to this post. Please take a look at it. This entry was posted in Uncategorized on November 22, 2017 by zenotype.

I used to think that a laptop is more comfortable because you can control it with a mouse. But now I think that a smartphone is better because it has a touch screen. I had a computer crash and I had to wait for two days for the new one. I can't believe it. My old computer was only two years old. I was very annoyed because I have a lot of documents on my computer. I couldn't work on them. However, I could work on my smartphone. It was like I was still using my computer. I'm afraid that I'll lose all my data when my computer crashes. I always backup my data on an external hard drive. But I don't backup my computer. I'm very sorry. This entry was posted in Uncategorized on November 15, 2017 by zenotype. I had a computer crash.
