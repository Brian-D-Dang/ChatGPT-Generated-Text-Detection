I am a 23 year old male Indian American male. I have never held hands with a girl, been kissed, or obviously had sex. I have never even asked someone out to be honest so this would all be new for me but at the same time not really because my friends tell me that they believe no one likes them and it is just easier to stay single than deal with rejection. no you can't Please do explain why... Unless your parents are very religious, there's nothing wrong about touchingkissing another person as long as everyone involved consents!
