To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting there, I do have a clear understanding of what Common Core is and what it entails. There are some benefits of this system such as increasing the amount of students that graduate from high school and receive a diploma, but there are also some disadvantages. The main reason I do not support Common Core is that it is forcing students to learn at a faster pace, and as a result, not absorbing and retaining the knowledge they are learning. The kids that don't do well in school and have been struggling for years are now having to jump from grade to grade and learn a lot at once. I am not saying this is a bad thing, because obviously the point of school is to educate and prepare us for the future, but I think that students should be given more time to learn and more time to grow. Another reason I don't support Common Core is that I feel that it takes away the learning process and takes away the feeling of accomplishment students get from learning something. For example, instead of learning how to write a paragraph, students are taught that a paragraph is four or five sentences, and that is it. They don't have to learn anything about what makes a good paragraph. They just have to know how many sentences are in a paragraph and how to make sure the sentences are in a paragraph. In my opinion, students should learn why something is a paragraph and what goes in a paragraph, and why it is a paragraph, rather than just memorizing that it is four or five sentences. I am not saying that Common Core is completely bad, but I just think that it takes away some of the learning process and makes students learn facts rather than understanding concepts. Common Core is a good thing, and it will help students to get ahead in the future. It will increase the amount of graduates and help them get jobs. Many people say that students aren't learning anymore, and they are just memorizing facts, and they are right. Common Core is the answer to that problem and will help students learn more about everything and not just memorize facts. It is up to the teachers to make sure that students are understanding what they are learning and that they are not just memorizing facts. In my opinion, students should be able to learn at their own pace and have more time to learn. Though Common Core is a good thing, it is also a bad thing, because it makes students learn at a faster pace and they don't have time to learn.
