Partial Delta for uDHCKris. I'll give you a partial because I do think that New Friends works as a combination option, but I think my CMV is more focused on the idea that one's social circle should not solely consist of people with similar backgrounds and experiences. Here is your partial Delta: While I understand your point about the potential benefits of using New Friends as a combination option, I do appreciate your focus on the importance of having a diverse social circle. I agree with the idea that surrounding yourself with people who have different backgrounds and experiences can broaden your perspective and lead to personal growth. Thank you for bringing attention to this important aspect of social relationships.
