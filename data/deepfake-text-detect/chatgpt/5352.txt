Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, or have implemented very low wages for most workers such as California, Arizona, Hawaii, Georgia, Connecticut, New York City, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, Indiana, Washington state (as well as Iowa), Vermont and Michigan were among those who passed laws requiring higher wages every month before lowering them to 10 an hour earlier this month.
