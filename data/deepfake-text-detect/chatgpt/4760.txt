Country music was not always bad. There were legends such as Johnny Cash who defined what country music was. However, today the country music culture is full of songs about drinking and drunk people getting into fights in bars. It's no secret that alcohol has a negative effect on your body when consumed too much or over time. Alcohol also affects how you feel mentally before being intoxicated, and it can make you act very differently than normal towards other people. This article will cover some important facts about alcoholism which are often misunderstood by those who don't know the truth behind addiction to booze. Some myths about alcoholism have been proven wrong but still they exist because many believe them despite all evidence to the contrary! I hope this information clears up any confusion or doubts around these topics for anyone reading this... Alcoholics Anonymous: What Does It Really Mean? The most common question concerning AA is "What does it mean if someone goes through 12 steps and then decides everything is okay after that? Doesn't heshe just relapse?" Sadly there isn't one single answer to this interesting subject. Even though the first step of going through life problems with friends and family is vital to everyone dealing with an illness like alcoholism (as well as staying sober), not every person goes downward from there. Many need years longer to get their lives back together again. Most consider themselves clean; however, they may have relapsed multiple times previously without realizing it - especially under severe circumstances where they did not do much thinking at all outside of doing things to hold down harmful feelings and thoughts and avoid exposing more pain inside. Due to both past mistakes and current situations, alcoholism sufferers could end up feeling ashamed, depressed, angry, and afraid. These emotions cause cravings and temptations, so AA members have to be careful trying to stay away from triggers while working toward recovery. After living through 12 months of sobriety, a recovering alcoholic frequently feels better than ever due to healing, clearing, and gaining new strength over time, even though doing it alone requires dedication. A little bit each day brings positive changes and opens old wounds before becoming healed. But only if they work hard enough at it. The real problem comes when un-recovering individuals think that they have recovered and abruptly quit participating in group activities. They simply didn't go far enough among relationships, attending meetings, taking part in recovery team gatherings, etc., which leads them right back to square one. Therefore, AA continues to teach its members how to live healthy and productive lifestyles regardless of whether alcohol abuse issues remain present or disappear completely. You need to see what works best for you, and continue to follow along until reaching success. People who stop attending meetings aren't necessarily lost forever. Rather, they have simply exited the process prematurely - which is why AA exists. For reasons we cannot understand fully yet, that particular level of sobriety seems intolerable for some people. If it happens once, they might recover some days later but eventually give up and return to drinking. Those who repeat this behavior are considered relapsers and must rewrite history to start anew in order to become true walkers. Only God knows why certain people keep coming back to another glass of wine or drink when others succeed immediately upon entering the program. I guess people differ greatly when undergoing treatment from alcoholism. From my experience, almost half of patients leave groups early and never come back to help their spouses deal with severe emotional trauma caused by binge episodes during rehab. Unfortunately, their spouse usually doesn't want anything further to do with them afterward because of added resentment brought on from seeing him or her behave badly in front of children and loved ones, and throw out of hospitals repeatedly. A few weeks ago, my wife came home and said she tried something different for our child's upcoming birthday party. She had bought a cake decorated with balloons and rainbows, complete with confetti and streamer decorations. We looked at each other silently in shock and amazement, wondering where she got all of this money and equipment from since neither of us knew she owned expensive toys. When she walked off to put her bathrobe on, I told her, "I love you, honey. Thanks for helping me raise a happy kid!" Her eyes turned red and tears fell slowly down her cheeks, dropping onto the floor below. Then she began crying uncontrollably, shouting, "You ruined my baby boy's fun for his big 4th [year]!! My son hates birthdays now! He wants nothing to do with that stupid shower anymore! How could you ruin EVERYTHING?! Don't EVER buy presents for MY kids next year!!! Why would YOU do that??" Her face was the picture of anger and disgust. Her words sounded hurtful, although they weren't intended that way. Soon we realized we could barely hear ourselves speak thanks to heavy breathing combined with deep bassed sobbing. All I wanted was for her to calm herself down and be able to say a few sentences to obscure meaningless statements of significance, or else to assess her condition of madness.
