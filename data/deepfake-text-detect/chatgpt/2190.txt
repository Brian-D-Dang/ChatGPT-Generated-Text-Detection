I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have livedcurrently live there, I could not be more dead set on never visiting that place again. Most of my associates are from NYNJ (including me) and they seem fine with it... however every time i go back home everyone is just a miserable fuck
