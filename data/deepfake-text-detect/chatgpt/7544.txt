I would argue that the purpose of rchangemyview is not to promote groupthink, but rather to encourage critical thinking and open-mindedness. While some users may share similar viewpoints, the subreddit encourages respectful dialogue and the exploration of different perspectives. This often leads to productive discussions and the potential for individuals to change their own views based on the evidence and reasoning presented by others. Furthermore, users are not obligated to change their views and it is accepted that people will have differing opinions on various topics. Therefore, rchangemyview is not promoting groupthink, but rather promoting a healthy exchange of ideas and the potential for personal growth and discovery through considering differing viewpoints.
