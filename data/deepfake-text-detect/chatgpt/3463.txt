I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any concern for their wellbeing or mental health, there should be support and resources available to help them through it. However, preventing someone from ending their life is not the solution. It is important to respect an individual's autonomy and their right to make their own decisions about their life. It's also crucial to have open and honest conversations about mental health and offer resources for support and prevention of suicide. As a society, we need to work together to create a culture of care and empathy, where people can feel supported and valued, and have access to the help they need to overcome any personal struggles.
