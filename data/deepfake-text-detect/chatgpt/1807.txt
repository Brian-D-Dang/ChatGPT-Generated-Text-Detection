EDIT: Lots of very well rounded, interesting points. Thanks! Really helped with my perspective. EDIT 2: I've been awarding deltas to people whom have been making some very good, solid contributions... This is a great example of that. It's okay if you need help, but it won't hurt to stop and think about what you're saying before posting. You sound like an immature little shit at times.
