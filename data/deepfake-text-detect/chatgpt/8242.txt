A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government). Losing an election does NOT mean that the losing candidate's vocation is over. If you are trying hard enough, and if your supporters believe in what it right for them then there will be another chance... If OP had been elected as MP with his preferred policies he could expect similar duties of service - either through Government positions such those mentioned by others here; possibly also policy advisory roles at Ministries.....or again maybe...as Opposition Leader!..........and so on....
