View changed by a combination of the comments of uceleritas365 and uQwerkss: I guess we all understand numbers differently, but ultimately I think it really is lack of empathy more than anything else." While there are no doubt that people will always have differing views on the subject matter regarding the merits or otherwise of Twitter's decision to remove content posted by users who harass users online.net users something that has been criticized as an attempt to undermine free speech rights in general some argue people should be allowed to express themselves without the need for censorship. Googles response could well have been "I agree with you," said one user named Joshua Monahan, though he reasoned "If people want to post hateful stuff they shouldn't feel compelled to censor others based solely on their opinions while others called for Twitter to change its policies following the recent backlash from users not supporting the removal of explicit comments about transgender immigration policy from users like Morgan Stanley's Shannon Watts. Twitter added that it would consider whether the removed tweets violate its own rules, though Monahan believed Twitter should take action against the offending tweet instead; Watts disputed this possibility saying social media companies must follow their own rules because Twitter had taken down the controversial tweet. Twitter also clarified its stance after police responded to an investigation into the tweets sent out by users who suggested that the company was censoring speech, saying in a statement provided to BuzzFeed News that user posts were still allowable under the law as long as they did not violate Twitter terms of service. Twitter cited a 2014 court ruling which states that posting offensive material violates the First Amendment right to freedom-of-speech protections conferred upon Twitter users regardless of whether someone uses the platform due to their political beliefs. Twitter later said it deleted the original message during an internal review process before removing it.
