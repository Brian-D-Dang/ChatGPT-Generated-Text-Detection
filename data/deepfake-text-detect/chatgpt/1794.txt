So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern -day citizens owe something back to their countrymen and women who served in our military before us; a lot more than people seem willing to admit nowadays: we were raised by them after all! People should thank those men and women now with acts like these rather than merely making "patriotic" gestures at times (I can't stand when people wave flags during sports games), or wearing American flag clothinggear everywhere they go as soon as they get home from work." That's an interesting point, that not everyone lives up to their ideals. How do you feel about the idea of patriotism? It is generally accepted as good thing right? Also being proud of your country seems reasonable too. Isn't it really dumb to say "we need less Americans because they don't care enough about their own country" yet want immigrants coming into America just so they will drop out of sight even though some might contribute better things to society then others? And how does patriotism make sense if one nationality has been fighting another nation since time immemorial basically...
