The McDonald's Liebeck lawsuit was not frivolous but rather brought to light a serious problem with the company's coffee. The lawsuit was initiated after Stella Liebeck, an elderly woman, suffered third-degree burns from hot coffee while she was a passenger in her grandson's car. Liebeck initially only asked McDonald's to cover her medical expenses, but the company refused. It was later revealed that McDonald's had been serving coffee at an extremely high temperature, which had caused numerous burn injuries prior to Liebeck's incident. In fact, McDonald's had received over 700 complaints related to coffee burns in the years leading up to the lawsuit. Furthermore, Liebeck's case was not an isolated event, but rather a part of a larger pattern of corporate negligence. By refusing to take responsibility for the harm caused by their products, corporations can put their customers at risk and generate large profits at their expense. Therefore, the Liebeck lawsuit was not frivolous, but rather a necessary step towards holding companies like McDonald's accountable for their actions.
