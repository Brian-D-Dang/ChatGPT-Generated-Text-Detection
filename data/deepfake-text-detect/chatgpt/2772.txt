The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here] . Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things, but for good people to do bad things, that takes religion. One more time: If God doesn't exist I don't see why we should behave any better than the worst of us are -I'm a Christian- if he does exist however, then even though I'm not perfect by no means am I one of those who think they're going straight into heaven just because they did something nice (or conversely said sorry); in my opinion God only wants "righteous" people...and he's pretty picky about what constitutes righteousness; He isn't quite as brutal with his punishments as most Christians believe (but there still are some)
