The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to understand some things. But we have a lot that we need to think about if we want to be successful. Our first thing after becoming president was to change the law which means forever all citizens of any country who became President shall have one vote on the most important question before them or legislatures. When they do this, then it becomes legal and the citizens will not be forced to write their own laws for ever. It will only happen when our Constitution comes into force. This process can take place anytime and anywhere. The reason why we believe our Constitution should be changed is because every country has a history of slavery, discrimination against blacks, etc.. All of these people were so very oppressed by slavery and prejudice until modern times. If you remember, the first time Thomas Jefferson overturned the Civil Rights Act he wrote "Congress may issue an opinion with regard to slavery." In fact his opinions did not come out without a huge backlash from those who opposed him. Since then it seems like politicians like Bill Clinton and John F Kennedy try to silence criticism instead of addressing the problems that governed them. There are many reasons why a majority of Americans would oppose changing the constitution. First of all, as mentioned earlier, we don't know exactly what these people think of changes to the Constitution. We cannot discuss such subjects in terms of the constitution. There is no guarantee of civil rights in this day and age, particularly when practice suggests re-establishing slavery and discrimination against black people. Secondly, even though the Supreme Court upholds the 1864 ratification of the Universal Declaration of Independence, there will always be obstacles to government's efforts to reform the system in order to stay above the fray. The US was founded by Benjamin Franklin, and many of his writings have been cited, but they have not quite translated into American form. They continue to contain the same errors that make up neo-liberalism today. While such progress brings us closer to freedom than ever before, there are still several other hurdles that must remain until we have more freedoms. Finally, let me give you a few ideas on how you might proceed. You wouldn't know where to start. 1. Start by scouring the internet. You probably won't find anything meaningful posted here today; however, do not hesitate to explore your options and visit some sites like Google Scholar or Computer Science News. Does this sound familiar? Maybe you'll see something that fits your interests. 2. Have a look at the available resources online. Remember that you're going to get hit with hundreds upon hundreds of articles and books that you haven't read yet. Try checking out numerous sources on a daily basis or knocking down some websites. 3. Get yourself checked out again and again. Don't wait long for what you've become accustomed to. It's okay to give up on life, especially if you're tired of fighting. Perhaps you now have a job where you don't worry about getting enough sleep throughout the night. With the help of simple computer skills you could shift to more effective ways of doing things. 4. Do stuff that made sense to you two years ago while driving home. Nowadays you can go hunting in Canada as well. A good friend recently came back from a trip to France. He was coming home from a vacation in Thailand and was just about to buy a new car when this unexpected person called him and asked if I had any money! Needless to say, my husband laughed and said yes, however, I was completely blindsided and never heard a word of his words. Actually, I didn't really hear much of anything else. Those two days when I finally got back to normal, he started talking about his previous experience. "Man, I wish I had learned more about this world," he told someone who had just gotten back from Greece. Of course it wasn't true, I had spent two months studying abroad in Europe. He explained to me how I didn't realize English was not my native language, and about that time, I felt a strong impulse to learn French. Unfortunately, I hadn't realized how unreadable it was. And, I couldn't figure out how to translate it properly. So, I began working on translating it backwards rather than forwards. Even though I needed to use different methods, and it took me a long time, I eventually finished translating it. By the end of 2015, I had completed 15 of the way through the translation process. That's right, I actually already knew what an English speaker meant when I tried to explain that translation correctly. Before I left for Europe for France, I found myself understanding Spanish very well. I also quickly discovered that I was learning much better English than some of the Spaniards. So, I gradually shifted away from aiming for a high school diploma (I have three) and towards doing slightly less work. After all, I am working two jobs, and living and and evenwork just and be while out between. Go low low over and and in outright. but around either or our but over and overlook and the enjoy
