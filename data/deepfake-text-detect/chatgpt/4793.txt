Climate change or global warming as it previously was known as is a hot potatoe and not a very clean cut science to predict. There are thousands of climate scientists all over the world studying this issue but there are only about 100 who have made public statements on their findings. There has been no consensus reached by these hundreds of scientists that humans play any role whatsoever in causing the current conditions. After more than 30 years, we still don't know what caused global temperatures to rise during the 20th century! Most climate models don't agree with each other despite attempts at forcing them to fit historical data due to uncertainties involved in modeling such complex systems. The most accepted theory for temperature rise is cosmic rays from space as well as solar activity. These two factors would account for about 10 of climatic changes seen so far. It also makes sense if you think about how energy radiates out through space into our thermal infrared spectrum. Solar radiation and cosmic ray fluxes vary throughout time, seasonally, annually etc., while greenhouse gases like CO2 can stay constant year after year until they reach critical levels when feedback loops kick in accelerating increases. So yes, some climate scientist did try to warn us about environmental calamity, just probably didn't look too closely at his own predictions. Prediction is hard because its difficult to model an entire Earth system accurately enough to really tell much at all - especially since none of us understand the dynamics of oceanic currents and weather patterns clearly either. And even then it becomes impossible to distinguish natural variations from human activities in many cases. Global climate models could actually be useful tools to study nature itself (no pun intended), but one must remember that free fall acceleration does not mean gravity, nor will using atmospheric pressure equate to weight here on earth where mass is distributed non-uniformly, and compressing air may produce positive buoyancy locally without affecting overall density. I am sure there are plenty more issues that come up as climate models become better able to simulate aspects of daily life including: soil moisture, forest cover, sea level rise, crop yield, insect pests, hurricane formation etc... We might find ourselves getting closer to answering questions we were worried about, but unfortunately some answers will likely be bad news, maybe even catastrophic! Over recent decades large parts of the North Atlantic Ocean have experienced increasing numbers of hurricanes reaching major intensities, perhaps related to increased tropical Pacific El Nino events? Some researchers believe warmer oceans make storms stronger, others say greater rainfall depletes waters making less powerful ones occur later in seasons. However, the extent to which this pattern has changed since 1970 remains uncertain. Of course, another factor that contributes to storm intensity is wind shear between warm moist surface winds and cold dry upper air currents. Although both trends appear to have strengthened over the last 50 years, neither trend appears strong enough to explain recent unprecedented records set across several different regions. Another interesting aspect of hurricane development relates to ocean circulation patterns within the Gulf Stream. Several studies have suggested that storm intenstiy variability might be linked to weakening of the western boundary jet stream associated with decadal shifts in Arctic ice volume. This hypothesis suggests that future cooling in Antarctica may lead to lower wintertime flow speeds along the northern latitudes and result in fewer summertime storms. Finally, rising carbon dioxide concentrations tend to enhance evaporation rates thereby strengthening precipitation amounts relative to average values, though research suggests that the magnitude of increase in heavy rainfall confounded by higher CO2 partial pressures is often smaller than expected. The first three days of 2017 began with a high degree of confidence regarding forecasts and expectations, however by day four things had started to turn sour. Last week the US National Weather Service announced that Hurricane Irma would intensify past 185 kts before striking Florida next weekend. Despite clouds being present near all edges of the Caribbean basin, there was little expectation of this happening prior to landfall. Now that it looks like it is going to happen, everyone seems to want to talk about "climate change" once again. Even CNN is expressing concern about possible effects, noting that: One thing experts caution against is treating post-hurricane recovery efforts as a test case for global warning. "We can take lessons learned from Harvey [in Texas] perhaps, but none of those apply directly to Irma." But let me get ahead of myself. While people around the globe are now paying attention to what hurricanes do way more than usual, they should not view the past record to assume that whatever happens today or tomorrow will continue. As mentioned above, hurricanes involve numerous forces acting simultaneously yet individually. Here are the three main drivers behind varying behavior exhibited by individual storms over time.
