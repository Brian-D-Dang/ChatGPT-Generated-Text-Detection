Firstly, I'm using a throwaway because most people get really sensitive about this and my views are pretty much the antithesis of reddit (love Rand Paul, support Mens Rights, hate Islam). Secondly, as you can see in his post history he's not being completely honest. He hasn't actually posted to any of those subs recently at all except for TD I don't know why anyone would be bothered by your opinion lol
