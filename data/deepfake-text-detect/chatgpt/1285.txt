To my knowledge there are no peer reviewed sources that link GMOs to any negative health effects. There is as much reason to believe genes manipulated in a lab are any less safe than ones produced by natural selection, or the random mutation of organisms (or vegetables). I'm going to need some sort of proof before I accept it.
