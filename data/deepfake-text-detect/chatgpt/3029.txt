Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one of you gets tired? Are there other forms of intimacy that are acceptable to your partner if they aren't getting as much out of PIV and oral sex? We have talked about this a bit already on our journies through life together so far.. She has never had an aversion to it but i dont want her to feel like she is satisfying me sexually when we both know thats not what im going for...
