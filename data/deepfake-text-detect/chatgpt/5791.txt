So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor because of their ethnicity. Because, discriminating is a thing only white people can do. However, it seems that white people are allowed to discriminate against minorities, so long as they're not calling it a white power thing. It's a term that only minorities can use. That's pretty messed up. It's like a double standard. Now, I'm a white person who was born in Japan, raised in the Philippines, and is going to school in the US. I've always felt like the black people here have a point. I've always tried to make a point of not being racist, but I still know that I've made people uncomfortable just because of my appearance. But I've been told that it's not racist of me to not be comfortable around a black person. That's not my fault if I'm not comfortable around a black person, it's their fault for not being white. But I'm confused because I'm not allowed to discriminate against minorities, but minorities are allowed to discriminate against me. That seems pretty messed up. How are you going to apply that to a white person who is racist towards blacks? If someone says they are uncomfortable around a black person, would you allow them to simply say "hey, you can't come over to my house, because I don't want to see you." or would you say "NO! That's racist!" You are born with a skin color, but you choose to be racist. You are not born with racism in your heart. I've never heard the term "reverse racism." But if you take away the "white power" part of it, it is still discrimination. If you are not comfortable with a black person, that is called racism. The person you are uncomfortable with does not have to be wearing a white power shirt for it to be racism. It doesn't mean that racism is ok, it just means that racism is not ok, no matter what color you are. I'm sorry to say this, but you've been brainwashed. What the crap is this all about, really? I was born in the USA, and I still think this is all a load of crap.
