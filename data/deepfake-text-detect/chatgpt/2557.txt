I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for manslaughter, they can choose to starve themselves until death or take pills that will kill them. You do realize you're talking about assisted suicide right? If not your comment makes no sense at all because it's literally what people are trying to achieve when they commit suicide anyway...
