With the advent of self-driving vehicles, the unavoidable will become clear: people are terrible drivers, and operating your own car is unacceptably reckless if a better alternative exists. I see it as an opportunity for all companies to learn from experience with self driving cars by allowing consumers to opt in or opt out without having their information exchanged over the airless system that forces them into engaging in risky behavior like driving while drunk or high on drugs. A fleet management company, such as Lyft would have no choice but be able to offer autonomy at zero cost rather than risking criminal charges against its customers who risk losing money because they don't comply with autonomous vehicle laws when using tech systems designed solely based upon driver consent alone. College students, however, make up less than 20 of mass transit ridership today compared to 80 during peak hours and ridership declines dramatically next year due to coronavirus restrictions even before COVID-19 lockdowns take effect. Learners may not want to drive themselves around beeping in their dorm rooms every day after graduation so they won't need a car anymore; they could just choose to ride public transportation instead unless it's time to play a leisurely carpooling adventure or strike gold deals online - both risks of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Uber isn't alone among ride hailing firms racing toward this new reality: Lyft already offers access to free rideshare services like Uber Eats that allow you to hop between cities via apps (and a steadily growing list of cities where Uber ridesharing costs 1 per hour), UberX taxis offered through UberEATS and UberBike - and Lyft riders can plan trips directly under one roof thanks to its Flex service giving them free rides daily starting April 15th. In some cases, self-driving technology has been used to provide emergency rides amid crises such as Hurricane Dorian last September. But the reality is more complicated since most travel data lacks sufficient privacy protection standards; there aren't many automakers offering rideshyers these days worldwide, let alone self-drive carmakers wanting to expand beyond what they've built onto existing fleets ahead of customers needing help navigating dangerous routes trying to navigate the world outside their homes once again. Given how badly society needs to adjust to new realities, this represents a momentous challenge yet another barrier to economic progress. The economy must adapt rapidly enough to handle the unprecedented demand created by the pandemic, but it cannot forget safety concerns inherent in fully automated mobility itself or limit the benefits of being able to consume affordable forms of transport whenever possible.
