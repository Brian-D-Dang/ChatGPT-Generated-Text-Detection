Let me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers for not giving Goldeneye 007 the main character a proper name, it was a lot more interesting than Goldeneye 009. Goldeneye 008 and 009 were enjoyable games which are still fun to play today but Modern Warfare 2 was awesome!
