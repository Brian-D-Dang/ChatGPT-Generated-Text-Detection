You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the world of wine buffs to help me make my point clear: The original Greek word for an apple was or "germanikos" which means Germanic (the land where they originated) kind of apple, while or paskalotosis refers directly to the fruit itself. Other words from classical times are or trapetisthesios and or moshtismea meaning "apple (s) " as well as several others including apo kyriou from Cyrene," i.e., one who comes from Cyprus), okysinos, phrygion, siderokastron, and so on; these refer to their shape (as opposed to tartness) rather than any other particular trait. The Romans added many more terms reflecting not only other types of apples but also different qualities. In fact, they had two separate names referring to the same type of apple. There were specifically named varieties such as Sampsonia Gigantea or Giant Apple which came in the form of huge purple fruits with yellowish flesh (this variety apparently has been lost). Others included Malus chilensis and Malus uncum spina - both of which we now know derive from China, though precisely what Chinese ancestor gave rise to those forms remains unclear today- plus many others then unknown to us. As far as we can tell from the surviving literature at least some of them derived from Central Asia, though there may have been various introductions into Europe around this time too. Wine makers used lots of local sorts but often called all kinds by similar name regardless whether they were actually related or not, sometimes wrongly assuming some sort to be exactly equivalent when really the differences could be very significant. That said, even within a specific region the ripeness of the season meant that they weren't all available year round anyway. So, overall, you'd get people simply calling everything 'appel' no matter what. However, here's where things got complicated because among the numerous regional names some regions didn't use the term at all despite knowing about what they were talking about (sometimes due to changing political dynamics between France and its colonies). For example, the French themselves never made much distinction between real apples and crab apples, though neither did anyone else at first. Instead, they referred to both together as the best known species under the generic name Malus sylvestris, the source being totally obscure nowadays (though perhaps that was where later European writers got the idea from). Nowadays, many varieties do carry the name Appellant instead, especially parents of modern hybrids.
