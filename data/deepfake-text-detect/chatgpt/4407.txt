First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from a financial standpoint and keeping my personal preferences in perspective so that you don't think it's based on me not wanting to walk or something like that. Second, when we drive our cars home after work (we all have one), why would anyone pay 4-5 more per month than they already are? It makes no sense whatsoever if someone saves 10month by buying gas instead of paying about 2 higher parking fees for each car anyway. Also, there probably won't be any tax savings since most people will still pay gas taxes regardless whether they buy gas with their debit card or credit card. So as much money as those extra few bucks might bring them over an entire year, what difference does it make? If anything, I'd be okay losing 12 of my income just to save that 2. You're not saving enough to cover the cost of your monthly payments either way, assuming you actually need to park somewhere to begin with! And who knows how long prices could go up, especially during busy times like summer vacation. As far as using cash to avoid parking tickets goes - yes, charging them without a receipt can get tricky but try it here sometime: If nothing else, use some common sense where parking isn't free across the board in cities and towns everywhere - it's not worth getting fined hundreds dollars for simply trying to 'get away' with being nosy.;) Most places give ample warning before ticket issuance which should allow plenty of time for both parties to arrive at the same conclusion equally quickly. Okay...enough ranting off topic, back to the post above. Just curious. What kind of job do you guys typically hold each week? Are you a full-time worker with office jobs and lunch breaksday off while working other jobs during the day OR do you tend to work closer to 40 hours a week with regular days off while also having side business for yourself? My experience has been that it was cheaper to take public transportation than driving for things less than 30 miles but then again, I live near Washington D.C., which apparently doesn't have many alternative modes of commute aside the metro system and bike lanes throughout the city. Something tells me that's not necessarily the case though every major metropolitan area out there...especially ones outside of the northeast. I've seen sales pitches made for checking out sites such as and others to check traffic conditions on certain routes, etc. The problem is that these types of services seem very hit or miss to find real accurate information. Certain roads will show high numbers of vehicles for example only to turn around later on and have lower numbers than expected. In light of that, I started thinking about doing my own analysis using Google Maps API or similar online tools vs. going through websites that offer unreliable data altogether; however, could someone point me towards any research done regarding this subject already? Any help is greatly appreciated:)
