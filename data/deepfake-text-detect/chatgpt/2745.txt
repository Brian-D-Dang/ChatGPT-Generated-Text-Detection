I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are similar to Turkish with a bit different accentdialects To be fair, I'm still figuring out how things work here but those two countries seem like they have some similarities
