This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point of view is that one action does not necessarily lead to another and the credibility of the argument should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. It is important to look at all the facts, weigh the evidence and consider the potential consequences before drawing any conclusions.
