I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry liberal Catholics. This comment basically says: "Again the article has nothing to do with anything other than Dick Cheney being caught in some kind of witch hunt by one of our current members of Congress seemingly not knowing what he was talking about." It is unclear when or if this is actually true, but it certainly does not mean what the article said dates from either of those issues (and this is an issue that can be worked out without calling Dick Cheney a hypocrite). Historically, the language used to promote equality between men and women at all levels of government has been seen as sexist. However, during my time on the Senate floor, when Senator Mary Landrieu introduced the Anti-discrimination bill (SB 1482) I received numerous emails which made me want to say something else when I heard that it had passed the House. So - while it's not a term I would use for an institution, it makes me think that we're needed to move forward towards greater representation within government. What seems particularly odd is that since the old laws were so vague they didn't really seem to track past ideological differences. The new ones are even more ambiguous because the wording of SB 1482 doesn't make any sense whatsoever! In addition, another interesting factoid about SB 1482 is that the wording of the bill states that "any woman who is pregnant." This makes no sense whatsoever. Since both bills are part of the same "legislative process," I don't know how that was ever understood. Therefore, it may just be because these two bills haven't passed yet. Also, the bill states that 'the persons who take up residence shall not stay there for the duration of their pregnancy unless or until deemed safe for them by the same physician, nurse, and doctor.' So yes - I'm not sure why we need that exact language now either. Why wouldn't someone simply write this down? And why be very careful to NOT read the entire version of the legislation? If you read it, no way you will understand why it didn't go through. You'll probably only understand it well enough to realize the errors of judgement that occurred under the previous initiatives. There's a reason too many politicians and media outlets included so much of this nonsense into the first place rather than try to pass it off as historical. That's right - the American people are fucking stupid. They're stupid. Right? Now, get over yourselves. It is important to note that SB 1482 did not mention that "women" will legally continue to be able to vote at the state level, regardless of whether they get married or stay in civil unions. So it is clear that the current law does not recognize that "women" are supposed to be allowed to vote at the local level. As long as such a law exists, then the proposed amendment doesn't sound like the sort of sexual harassment we've come to expect from tyranny against women.
