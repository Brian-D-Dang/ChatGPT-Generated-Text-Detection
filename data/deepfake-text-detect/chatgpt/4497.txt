I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the normal layout, which is the other way around. I've looked online but cannot find any information about this case or if its unusual in anyway. Thanks! A: You may be able to do away with the refrigerator entirely and have only an ice maker water dispenser built into your kitchen wall.
