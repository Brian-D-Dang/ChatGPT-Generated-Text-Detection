With our constant fast technological advancement people seem to think that we will lead our selves to destruction because we do not use technology with care, but recently all new technologies have been presented by means of Smartphone, and this is a good thing as it can help you in many aspects, even if there are other devices present which could help us. I've also heard that eventually the phone would just be used for notifications, no longer being able to reply or call people, etc... I'm hoping somehow those days won't be far away!
