I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that you would sooner or later end up voting for. The problem is with Canada it's the Conservatives and Liberal party. If anything we need a new government to fix this Oh yes! This is exactly what I'm talking about - especially with the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) - they basically just go around and attack your candidateparty every chance they get because we're so NDP friendly here in BC.
