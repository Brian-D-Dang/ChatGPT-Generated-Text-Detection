Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this below). The political party I voted with at the last election was the Conservative Party. The government that has been put into place by David Cameron is not perfect but it seems to me those who are upset over its policies do so because they see them as bad rather than recognising what an enormous challenge facing Britain today - namely Brexit - requires us to do. It may be true that some of the government's policies have caused problems or even destroyed businesses (although experts say most issues were either avoidable or could easily have been avoided), yet you can hardly argue these results aren't remarkable given where we started from: two recessions, eight years of Labour rule destroying almost every institution of British society including the police force; one million people out of work for longer periods during the financial crisis (although others will point out that unemployment figures taken more recently are worse); the highest taxation levels since 1945 which means living standards have declined significantly once again. However despite some fairly painful decisions being made under the leadership of Prime Minister Theresa May (who many forget had never held any elected post before) there seem few options available when faced with such difficult choices. And although politicians may argue their credibility ended after Brexit, remember they did exactly nothing about keeping the country together until now due to their inability to get anything done in parliament without making concessions to other parties and groups within it. So yes, there perhaps should have been a discussion prior to leaving the European Union involving all countries involved and certainly greater transparency around exit plans, however negotiations appear to be moving forward according to schedule regardless whatever the outcome. Secondly, whilst many complain that a "strong leader" like Donald Trump is taking power away from traditional leaders in places like Brussels then here too you cannot deny the reality that his approach has changed things drastically by forcing industrialised nations to finally act upon trade deals already agreed between themselves pre-Brexit. Thirdly, if you look at your own views carefully, highlighting areas of disagreement does little except give rise to further division whereas understanding why someone else might hold different opinions allows both sides to find common ground and hopefully come closer towards achieving solutions. Many people think refugees shouldn't enter Europe in order to protect its borders only to realise later how costly that stance actually becomes in terms of security costs and social unrest. Therefore I understand where the opposition to immigration comes from as well considering the number of thousands killed trying to get across deserts in search of better lives far outweighing the benefits. Last year alone we saw several terrorist attacks and mass killings committed against innocent civilians, causing much death and destruction wherever they happened. When it happens suddenly there really isn't time to prepare and a policy based solely off world opinion tends to make very little sense especially when dealing with terrorists or organised crime organisations hiding behind national boundaries. Practically speaking though, banning travel visas for anyone wanting to fly into Britain, stopping migrants crossing the English Channel or not allowing families staying together to apply for asylum prove incredibly difficult obstacles to overcome. So lets recap therefore I didn't vote for Brexit because I thought it would destroy everything, I just believed something needed to change. If you disagree please leave comments down below
