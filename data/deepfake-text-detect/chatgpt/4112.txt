Hello everyone, with all the media coverage lately regrading transgender individuals I find myself uneducated on the particular subject and would love to be enlightened on the topic. I support transgenders in many ways but have yet to fully understand quite a bit of how they work within societyculture. As someone who has dealt w mental illness for over 20 years this is my first time being diagnosed so I would appreciate anyone's insight into it as I am just starting out trying to learn more about the whole situation. Hi Peter! Your post was very insightful; you really did an excellent job summarizing your experiences and collating them in such a concise way. What would you say is the most important thing we can do as a community to help TRAGEDY survivors?
