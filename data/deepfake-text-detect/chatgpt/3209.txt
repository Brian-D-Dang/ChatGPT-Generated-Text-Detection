I always have to hold my eyes to keep them rolling out of my sockets when I hear (australian) people talking about their trips to europe and canada and america. I can understand how that might be frustrating to hear about others' travels when you haven't had the opportunity to do so yourself. However, it's important to keep in mind that everyone has different life experiences and opportunities. Instead of getting annoyed, perhaps focus on the things you can do to make your own travel dreams a reality in the future. Maybe start saving up or researching destinations that interest you. Remember, your time will come!
