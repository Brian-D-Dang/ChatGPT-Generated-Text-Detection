Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll repost it here with more details. I'm not sure what the scale of the problem is...but if you haven't already, please read my post from yesterday [here] (URL0). It might be useful for you to see how we're approaching the problem (if you haven't already done so). Also, I hope my answer will help you better understand the scope that we have in fixing this issue because none of us can do it alone! As far as I know, there's no way to disable the animation on custom weapons (in game or otherwise), except by editing their code. There are other things that can make certain animations behave differently depending on weapon typeaddition etc., but since these are all fixed in-game, and most people don't want to change them anyway, the only thing left is adding up the details of each one every time you use your weapon, which would take forever. Also, even though this thread wasn't created specifically to discuss the topic, it was the only place I could think of where someone else would care enough about the matter to try to fix it. Sorry I couldn't provide solutions earlier!:) I wish I had been able to, because of what happened in an old thread I started years ago xD Oh man, that really sucks! Well, thanks to everyone who responded and helped me sort through this mess. You guys are great!!
