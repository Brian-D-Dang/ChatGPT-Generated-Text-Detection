My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother was showing him what to do when he wants to try something new and she had some sort of an argument with her husband about it, but not for too long as they left their children alone together. Then she said "I'm never buying you anything ever again." I don't know if that's an exaggeration or completely accurate... That kind of stuff happens sometimes - my kindergartner did this all year last year - making his own art supplies, learning how to make firecrackers (that we then used on our school trip). He also helped out around the house.
