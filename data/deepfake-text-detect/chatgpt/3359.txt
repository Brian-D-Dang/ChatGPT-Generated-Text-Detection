I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for a non-violent crime and they are of sound mind, they should have the ability to choose to end their life. While this is a sensitive and difficult topic, it's important to consider an individual's autonomy and right to make decisions about their own life. However, it's also important to ensure that this decision is made freely and without coercion, and to provide resources and mental health support to those who may be struggling with suicidal ideation. Ultimately, any decision about the end of someone's life in prison should be made on a case-by-case basis and with careful consideration and oversight.
