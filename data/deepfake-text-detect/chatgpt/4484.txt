Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I don't want there. There will be a DJ and fooddrink provided by not-too expensive catering company (I chose Calon). The proposal is for this to be at the end of April as part of an easter break. Would anyone have any suggestions on how I could organise such a thing? The party will probably just go from around 7pm until late in the evening depending on who RSVPs etc. But we're hoping no later then 11pm or 12am if they can do that! Any help would be great. Also, would you all consider doing one too when you turn 30? If you are planning one already, who's having theirs? Thanks everyone. xx
