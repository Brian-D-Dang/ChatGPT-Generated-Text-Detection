First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however: We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is political correctness. Everyone believes that there's a fundamental difference between sexist politics and mainstream political correctness. In the same way, you're not supposed to accept the fact that they're being bullied by a sexist law-abiding, "opinion-based" or conservative government. Thus, I'm not advocating "political correctness" to be political correct. The point is that we all know that, in protest of the sexist policies, they're being bullied and have a right to control their own behavior. I'm not advocating that we "come to believe" that we're a sexist, a racial, xenophobic, anti-Western, anti-capitalist, anti-Semitic, anti-social, anti-American, anti-haters, anti-semitic, anti-Christian, anti-American, anti-semitic, neo-Nazi, anti-Semitic, pro-religious, anti-immigrant, anti-religious, anti-religious, anti-war, anti-Christian, anti-educated, anti-Greek, anti-Muslim, anti-American, anti-K American, anti-Semitic, anti-Semitic, anti-Christian, anti-racist, anti-Semitic, anti-white, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-authoritarian, anti-communist, anti-semitic, anti-communist, hateful, anti-religious, anti-American, anti-discriminatory, anti-conservative, anti-semitic, anti-Semitic, anti-semitic, anti-semitic, anti-religious, anti-freedom, anti-government, anti-semitic, anti-government, anti-slavery, anti-government, anti-crockery, anti-terrorist, anti-religious, anti-sexist, anti-Christian, anti-communist, anti-American, anti-semitic, anti-semitic, anti-communist, anti-semitic, anti-christ, anti-global, anti-American, anti-christ, anti-black, anti-religious, anti-semitic, anti-religious, anti-political, anti-American, anti-government, anti-conservative, anti-semitic, anti-american, anti-American, anti-American, anti-gun, anti-western, anti-semitic, anti-Semitic, anti-christ, anti-feminist, anti-payroll, anti-gun, anti-war, anti-government, anti-government, anti-government, anti-semitic, anti-semitic, anti-poverty, anti-semitic, hateful, anti-Christian, anti-American, anti-Islamic, anti-Semitic, anti-authoritarian, anti-establishment, anti-religious, anti-fascist, anti-war, pro-semitic, anti-abort, anti-government, anti-freedom movement, anti-abort, anti-government... There's plenty of this. But I support a stance that we need to support the interests of all people, even if we don't support the basic human rights, anti-Semitic, anti-humanity, anti-global, anti-American, anti-war, anti-semitic, anti-Americanism, anti-Semitic, anti-semitic, anti-Semitic, anti-hip, anti-American, non-abort, anti-religious, anti-American, anti-American, anti-semitic, anti-war, anti-feminist, anti-American, anti-gay, anti-American, anti-semitic, anti-Semitic, anti-semitic, anti-anti-American, anti-Zionist, anti-religious, anti-American, anti-Feminist, anti-Semitic, anti-capitalist, anti-semitic, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic, anti-establish, anti-authoritarian, anti-Semitic
