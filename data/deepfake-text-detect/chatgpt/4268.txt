Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never been to any of them because I can't stand crowds and have always been bad at parades, but I really want to attend the New York City Pride festivities this year and I was wondering if anyone has experience volunteering at these events? Followup question: What are some tips for someone that befriends LGBT people while growing up in the south american country where being gay is frowned upon?
