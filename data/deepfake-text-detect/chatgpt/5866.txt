Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women in various types of positions in industry or the professions or whatever, I always ask the question: Why? Why do we want to increase the number of women in this or that occupation? What exactly are we trying to accomplish? I have never found an answer to that question that I found satisfactory. Now, I must say that I think we should have more women in the professions. I think we should have more women in the engineering professions, the science professions, the law, and so on. But why? What is it that we are trying to accomplish? And if that's the question, why do we ask that question? Well, I'll tell you why I ask that question. I ask that question because of my background, because of my training. I was trained in the philosophy of science, so I'm going to approach this question from a philosophical point of view. Now, what I want to do now is go back and I'm going to talk to you about what I consider to be the traditional philosophical position on the issue of the role of women in society. You may have heard of this term "traditional philosophy." It's not a well-defined term, but I'm just going to use it to refer to a broad range of philosophical views, the views that predominated in the Western world for the past 2,000 years or so. And I'll talk about what those views were, what they were not, and why I think they're the only reasonable answers to these questions. Let me start with the one that I think is the most important. I want to start with the one that, in my view, is the most important issue, and that is the issue of what the nature of the role of women is in society. Now, when you look at the role of women in society, there are two ways of looking at it. There are two different ways of looking at it, and there is a huge amount of confusion about this. It is a confusion that I don't think is going to be resolved any time soon, because it's not a simple issue. I think it's a very complicated issue, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to try to point out why I think there are two different views, and why I think that the view that I espouse is the only reasonable view. Let me talk about the role of women in society. What's the role of women? We know, in general terms, what the role of women is. It's not the role of women to be in the professions. It's not the role of women to be in the arts. It's not the role of women to be in the sciences. It's not the role of women to be in the engineering professions, the law, or the administration of government. It's not the role of women to be in business. What, then, is the role of women? Well, the traditional view is that the role of women is the role of mother. What is the traditional view of the role of women? The traditional view of the role of women is that the woman's primary role in society is that of mother. Now, why is that? Why is it that the role of women is the role of mother? Well, it's very simple. The role of women is the role of mother because it's the way God intended it. The role of women is the role of mother because that's the way things are. Now, I want to point out that that's a very simple, straightforward answer. The traditional view of the role of women is that the role of women is the role of mother because it's the way God intended it. The role of women is the role of mother because that's the way things are. There are lots of ways of defending this view, but I want to focus on what I consider to be the most important one, which is the way that it's defended in the philosophy of the early modern period, in the 17th and 18th centuries. Now, if you want to know what the early modern period was, I'm going to talk about the early modern period, or the early modern era, the 17th century and the 18th century, and I'm going to define the early modern period. It's just a term that people use for a certain era. It's not a well-defined term, but it's just a term that people use for a certain era. The term, the phrase, the word, the concept
