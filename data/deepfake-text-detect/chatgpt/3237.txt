I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit I understand your concern. It is true that allowing someone with a large amount of debt to run for office can potentially create conflicts of interest and raise questions about their ability to make sound financial decisions. However, it is ultimately up to the voters to decide if a candidate's financial situation is a concern for them. It's important for voters to educate themselves on a candidate's policies and experiences before making a decision at the ballot box.
