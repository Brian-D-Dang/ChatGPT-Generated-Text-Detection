First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person I'm not a parent and I feel like I have to share that with you. As I said, I am not a parent, I'm not a child, yet I'm still having my kids. I am just a simple person. I'm not a parent and I'm just a child. I don't feel like I have to share your kids. I'm a fairly objective person.
