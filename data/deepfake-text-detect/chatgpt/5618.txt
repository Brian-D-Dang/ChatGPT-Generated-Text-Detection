I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our debt is like going to a fancy restaurant and charging every meal to a credit card). I saw the results of the Iraq war, the bailouts, the stimulus packages, and the prescription drug plan and realized that I was just seeing the tip of the iceberg. I don't believe that less than 10 of the federal budget is necessary to make our country run (sadly, I have no idea what that budget should look like). So when I read about these websites and services that help you trim your spending, I was floored. I was particularly interested in Credit Card Debt Snowball (which is now owned by CareOne). It's a system that allows you to track your spending and payments, and then gives you a set of steps to follow to pay off your debt. They even have an iPhone app that tracks your spending and tells you if you're on track to pay off your debt within the time frame you've set. It's really great to have such a simple way to budget and pay off your debt. I'm surprised it took me so long to jump on this bandwagon. I also started using a company called Simple to manage my checking and savings accounts. It's also an iPhone app, and it also gives you a debit card. There are no fees, and if you use the app, it gives you a free debit card (they also have a paper statement option, but I'm not interested in that). I have an account with Chase and a savings account with Chase, but my checking account with Chase is being reviewed for possible closing (this is a long story that involves my account being frozen, and then unfrozen, then frozen again). I'm also not sure that I want to continue to use a company that screwed up my account so badly. Simple offers free checking, with no minimum balance, and no fees. There's an iPhone app and a website, and you can even check your balances using your Twitter account. It doesn't get much simpler than that. And I'm seriously considering buying a Prius. I've never been a huge fan of hybrids, but I've been driving the wife's Prius this week and I'm loving it. The gas mileage is great, and the interior is very comfortable. It's also a great alternative to a minivan, and since we're planning on having a kid in the next few years, I'd love to have a second car that's smaller than the current SUVs (the wife will probably want a second car too). The Prius is 23k, and I'm hoping to get it for around 20k. I've found a few on Craigslist that are in the 18k range, so I'm hoping to get a great deal. I'm also hoping to get a good deal on a minivan, because I'm hoping to use that as our daily driver. So that's my latest new-age-hippie-yuppie-conservative-liberal-economy-friendly-financial-savvy-green-car-buying plan. I'm proud of myself, and if you're interested in joining me, feel free to leave a comment with what you're planning to do. Posted by Bobo at Monday, September 19, 2011 Labels: conservative, debt, financial planning, liberal, minivan, prius, spending, suv, yuppie Prius is a great car. I wouldn't take it to the dealer for a test drive though. I did that and the dealer wouldn't even let me try the brakes because the system has "lots of moving parts." I've heard lots of people say that the Prius isn't a great car because of the brakes. But I really like it, so I'm hoping it's not a problem. I haven't tried to buy a new car in a while, but I'm hoping to do so in the next year. I'll be starting with a new car. I will see what I can find. Damn, I forgot to mention that I'm selling the Impala. I'm hoping to get 3500 for it, and then I'll use that money to buy a new car. I'm sure you could sell your Imp
