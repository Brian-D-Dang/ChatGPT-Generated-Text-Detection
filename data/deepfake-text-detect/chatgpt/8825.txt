First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I believe there is much more to the educational systems in this country than just those two parts of the state are very similar. What do you think about the situation with education? Do you see it as a problem or an opportunity for everyone?
