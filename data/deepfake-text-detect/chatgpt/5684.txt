The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, and how it works, but not how it came in to being. Then there are those who claim that the universe was created by an omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good being. For the sake of this discussion, let's just call him God. Now, if you claim that God created the universe, you are making a claim about the universe. You are claiming that the universe is either the result of an uncaused, uncreated being, or is the result of an uncaused, uncreated being which then created itself, the universe. In the first case, you are claiming that the universe exists, and came in to being. In the second case, you are claiming that the universe exists, but that it did not come in to being. Now, since you cannot prove that the universe exists, you are making a claim that cannot be proven. You are making a claim about the universe, which you cannot prove, about which you have no evidence, and about which you know very little. So, why do you think that your claim that the universe exists and came in to being is any more correct than the claim that the universe does not exist or that the universe came in to being by itself? Why do you think your unproven claim that the universe exists and came in to being is any more correct than the unproven claim that the universe does not exist, or that the universe came in to being by itself?
