With the advent of self-driving vehicles, the unavoidable will become clear: people are terrible drivers, and operating your own car is unacceptably reckless if a better alternative exists. I see this coming in my lifetime as well - it's happening already with ridesharing apps that take away our need to have an employer-provided vehicle at work but don't provide safe alternatives for employers who can afford them. So what do we want? I'm going to start by listing some not so great things about cars: 1) Cars consume scarce resources (fuel, land, etc.) more than other forms of transportation. 2) People die every year from driving accidents and their effects extend beyond those involved directly into increasing congestion on streets and highways due to traffic fatalities. 3) The number one cause of death worldwide is cardiovascular disease and cancer related deaths related to smoking, obesity, diet, lack of exercise, high blood pressure and diabetes. Car ownership contributes greatly to all these conditions contributing to overall health problems. 4) Long commutes increase stress levels and decrease productivity. Our commute time increases dramatically when you factor in the time spent waiting at tolls or gas stations. We also pay higher taxes than most nations because of local roads which would be less expensive without automotive fuel tax revenues. Commuting longer distances competes poorly against rail services even though they are safer. High speed rail may prove to be less costly over time. It should come as no surprise then that commuters frequently report lower rates of both physical fitness and mental health. 5) Roadside litter wastes valuable natural resources like water and oxygen through pollution from automobile emissions. This problem has been exacerbated recently by aggressive marketing campaigns talking up the environmental benefits of electric vehicles (EV). Clearly EVs save energy compared to conventional gasoline engines; nonetheless they still produce greenhouse gases, create noise and give off toxic fumes while using electricity generated from dependency upon fossil fuels and nuclear power plants. Electric batteries require rare earth minerals making it difficult to source them outside of China where mining practices often violate human rights standards. 6) Driving produces social isolation and loneliness as fewer opportunities exist for humans to get together face-to-face. There are relatively few traditional public spaces available now, even as urban areas grow denser with greater restrictions placed on parking availability and height limits (see below). As America becomes increasingly polarized politically, access to each others' homes is limited under current campaign finance laws just as private business interests seek to privatize public space by removing sidewalks, reducing park size and removing street trees. 7) Automobiles distract us from paying attention to our families, co-workers, friends, neighbors and communities around us. Traffic makes conversation impossible unless we choose to talk across lanes instead of engaging each other - simply being behind another driver gives rise to defensiveness even among polite minds. Studies find children within 1 mile of home zones suffer diminished cognitive development when exposed to traffic even during quiet periods such as school breaks. Children experience temporally compressed experiences because cars wait impatiently for pedestrians to cross before proceeding along busy arterials important to nearby businesses. In many older cities, low density housing forces residents in close proximity to drive everywhere regardless of accessibility. Those living further out must walk long distances to reach destinations including jobs, schools, shopping centers and leisure activities despite having public transit options readily available. Even worse, public transport service quality varies widely between countries let alone city and region. For example, subway lines in New York City remain overcrowded whereas major metropolitan systems elsewhere in North America routinely operate at 80 capacity. Universities throughout Europe are experiencing ever worsening traffic jams and traffic injuries especially in major cities due to poor planning decisions made decades ago regarding roadways and how much space needs to be allocated for automobiles versus bicycles, walking, mass transit and pedestrian use. Why isn't there enough room for bikes AND buses?! When was the last time you saw bikers riding alongside the bus or train? Not until Google Maps came along! Moreover, the construction required to move large numbers of heavy vehicles, equipment, personal belongings and goods across town is rarely considered part of any plan except to repair damaged infrastructure caused years earlier. Meanwhile, affordable housing continues to decline leaving Americans trapped in sprawling suburban sprawl unable exit the inner cores of major metropolises. Their only choice is to keep doubling down on costly suburbs in search of employment income rather than investing in locally accessible community oriented primary care facilities that benefit society and neighborhoods alike. 8) Automobile manufacturers regularly push for new legislation enabling evermore dangerous features such as lane keeping assistance systems, autonomous driving features, blind spot detection warning systems and adaptive cruise control (which reduces reaction times), all of which incurs more risk for drivers. These new technologies enable a form of automation wherein ride sharing companies could intentionally target specific passengers within cars according to age, gender, race, ethnicity and socioeconomics profile. By doing so, they could offer riders cheap rides (by exploiting economies of scale) and spread economic impacts equally across everyone in the population minimizing negative impact absent the ability to measure past history events where nonevents!
