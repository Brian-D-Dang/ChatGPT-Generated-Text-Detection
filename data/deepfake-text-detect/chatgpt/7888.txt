I understand the opinion that negative stereotyping and profiling can only change when the potential victims break the stereotype. However, this opinion overlooks the fact that the responsibility to end negative stereotyping and profiling falls on everyone, not just the potential victims. Stereotypes and profiling are often deeply ingrained in society, and they are perpetuated by various institutions, media, and individuals. Therefore, to end negative stereotyping and profiling, it requires a collective effort from all members of society to challenge these harmful biases and change the narratives that promote them. Expecting the potential victims to break the stereotype puts an unfair burden on them and ignores the systemic nature of prejudice. It suggests that they are responsible for changing the attitudes and perceptions of others, rather than holding those who hold those biases accountable. In conclusion, negative stereotyping and profiling can only change when individuals and institutions take an active role in eliminating them, rather than placing the responsibility on those who are affected by them.
