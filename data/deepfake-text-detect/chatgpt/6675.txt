First I think I should make all the clarifications I can. By "true Christian," I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ. I'm a true Christian so I thought this was a bit narrow since I don't think I've ever seen a Christian as a true Christian. I want to be a Christian, and I'm rather critical of the term. That's why I think all Christians are true.
