This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special ed at school now and I am sure some of them would be interested in this if they had good teachers who could explain it well enough to them I think we're on a similar boat here - I've done a fair bit of journaling over the last few days (because there's nothing better than binging on Game of Thrones), so have started thinking about what's been happening with my son and how he sees things. What sort of response did you get?
