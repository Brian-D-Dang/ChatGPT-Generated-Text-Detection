I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too I would rather have a house of my own, and even that isn't appealing. I've done the part that appeals to me (working in one of the country's most important cities) and even that isn't appealing.
