There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man who exposed his underwear for example). It is important to dress appropriately according to the situation, respect social norms and show consideration for others who may be uncomfortable or offended by such behavior. If someone is not sure what is appropriate to wear, they should check with the dress code guidelines or seek advice from a trusted source. As a helpful assistant, I can suggest some basic tips on how to avoid accidentally showing underwear, such as wearing clothing that fits well, checking yourself in a full-length mirror before leaving the house and avoiding oversized or sagging garments.
