There must have been thousands of times when I was talking about a hypothetical person when it came to picking pronouns and I chose the pronoun she or he, maybe even both. There were definitely some days where there really wasn't much choice because my kids would say "he" in response every time someone referred back at them with their gender neutral name (Pippo). It makes sense that we don't want our children feeling excluded from society so they conform as best possible given all these messages being thrown around everywhere anyway - but what are you supposed do? I personally took this stance for years while also finding out how many people who knew me growing up didn've picked either one... At first glance if anyone had asked whether gendered words should be used by default based on biological sex wouldn t matter unless your job involves writing prescriptions - then suddenly adding gender identity into consideration is confusing........ And yet somehow since knowing more than 1 transgender individual myself life has changed..... The whole topic seems difficult.... You can imagine why! But not just mine, now others too. Not easy!!!
