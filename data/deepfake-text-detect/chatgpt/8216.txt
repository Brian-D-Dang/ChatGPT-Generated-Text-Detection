I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with that statement or your way of presenting it through wordswriting (which I do not agree in this case), then they may decide to post on the internet about how much better forking really makes things! You have no control over what people will be saying online because once its out there so far as making sense; It can't even change anymore by itself alone without some sort support from external sources like government regulations etc... If we made laws against ideas being offensive (that was my original intent behind why). Then think hard at just who would those policies apply too? Whoever says something outside our comfort zones!!! Do these changes make any logical common-sense?! What happens when somebody has had enough bad experiences already due off their own personal beliefs but still decides he wants others around him having them also instead searching his mind further into believing whether certain actions should indeed exist within today's modern age lives??? Than thinking after all..isn't life supposed tpbe fun???? Why aren'ts more governments working towards bringing us back together again?? There must meone else smarter than ourselves running everything!! And yes...there IS actually one: God Almighty Himself!!!! If only Mankind could get past themselves long enoughto realize He ain'thole nor afraidof anything anyone might tryin orderto bring Him down sinceHe never waivers intheir efforts regardlessif said endeavors were realor imagined....but hey maybe thatsjustme talking (and please don 'treally take offense)
