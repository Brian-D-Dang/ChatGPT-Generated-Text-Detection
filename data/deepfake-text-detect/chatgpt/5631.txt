Let me start off by stating what I believe the reddit basic income theory is. From what I have read from rbasicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society, the government will give every citizen a certain amount of money to live off of every month. It will be a basic standard of living that will allow you to live comfortably, without having to worry about the extra money you might have to spend on other things. Sounds pretty cool right? A life without having to worry about money? Although this may sound amazing, it does come with a few downsides. The biggest one being that the government would have to be printing more money to make up for the money that would be given to the citizens. Which would most likely cause the value of that money to decrease. Along with that, a lot of people would stop working, since you would get money from the government even if you are not working. This would cause a lot of jobs to be lost, since so many people would not be working. Finally, the government would be taking away a lot of the freedoms that we currently have. For example, you would not be able to decide what you want to do with your money, since it would be taken away from you. This would be a major loss of liberty that we currently have. I believe that the reddit basic income theory is an amazing idea. I think that it would make our lives a lot easier and would make it so that we would not have to worry about money as much as we do now. I think that it would also help people who are trying to get jobs and who are looking for an income. I also think that it would make it so that people would be able to live a much healthier life, since they would not have to worry about money as much as they do now. However, I do not think that it would be able to be executed. I believe that people would stop working, since they would get money from the government even if they do not work. This would cause a lot of jobs to be lost, since a lot of people would not be working. I believe that people would also be less motivated to do well in school, since they would not have to worry about money. Another reason why I think that it would not be able to be executed is because I believe that the government would have to print more money to make up for the money that would be given to the citizens. This would cause the value of that money to decrease. I also believe that this would cause a lot of unemployment, since so many jobs would be lost. Finally, I believe that it would cause a loss of freedoms. This would be a major loss of liberty that we currently have. I believe that this would cause a lot of unemployment, since so many jobs would be lost. I believe that it would also cause a loss of freedoms. A) I do not agree with the idea of a reddit basic income theory. I do not believe that people would be able to live a healthy life, since they would not have to worry about money as much.
