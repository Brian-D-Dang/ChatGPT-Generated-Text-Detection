I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately turn around on a dime whenever anybody who is perceived as transgender or non-cisgendered makes an offhand comment about how much better it could be if they were just born male. When you think somebody's rightful place isn't with their own gender identity but rather within whatever box society has given them by birth - even though said person's mind may not have moved from its original position at all during this period? The fact remains: They are still cisgender...and no matter where we draw our "line" (if indeed such line exists) for being allowed into certain spaces under these circumstances; many trans folks will always fall somewhere outside those lines." - Tiff Nguyen essentiallytina RPGaDay2016
