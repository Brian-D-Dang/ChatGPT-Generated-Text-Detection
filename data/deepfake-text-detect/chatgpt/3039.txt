For context: I am in the UK, so that is the political system I'm most familiar with. I am also NOT very knowledgeable about politics in general, but I have an interest and some knowledge of US politics (particularly because it's a big country). posted by kindall at 10:46 AM on May 1 [1 favorite] My first reaction to your question was "yes" then I went back through my answers here and realized there are two reasons why it might not be so easy for me: I've lived outside the U.S., now living back in. This means I can't do any home-cooked polling of friendsfamily without having them run the numbers through their own filters for accuracy; they may know more than I think they know. And even if we sort out their input, what about people who don't live nearby? The sample bias would be huge. On the other hand, this could help with 2 above...if you were interested enough to do nationwide surveys, perhaps over several years. The second reason I'd say no is that I'm fairly well informed regarding my town government municipal elections happen every 2 or 4 years depending upon when things get voted on, along with school boards, county commissioners, state senatorial districts, etc. If you want a really accurate picture of how much power each group has nationally relative to another, you'll need to take into account local issues as well as national ones.
