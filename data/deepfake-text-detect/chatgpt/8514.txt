Fairly simple premise. I'm 35 years old. I remember the Cold War. The first Gulf War. The Iraq War. War in Afghanistan, etc... I hear talk all the time about "preventative war." Just what exactly is that? It seems to me it's a bunch of politicians wanting us involved militarily and getting away with not having our troops shed any blood or come home badly wounded if they're lucky enough for their side win by some miracle on foreign soil without heavy casualties (Obviously this excludes wars started because we were attacked.) If your country was invaded you'd be pissed as hell too but there are people who believe invading other countries will stop terrorism which can't possibly have been said before WWII yet still has never proven true although Nixon did try at least once when he went after bin Laden....It seemed like an invasion would only cause more problems than anything else until Obama got elected so maybe now things could change again.....Lets see how long till Iran gets its nukes! There goes another terrorist attack from Islamo-Fascism!!!!!
