I am a young black male, who is torn between both sides of the aisle regarding race relations in America. I have experience racial profiling and understand that there is still work to be done as far as equality goes. Being raised by two cracker ass motherfuckers has left me without much regard for any white person or anyone with money really...but it's not all bad. Oh no. You're one those "crackerass" people too?
