One counter-argument could be that removing trigonometry from the SAT math section would reduce the rigor of the exam and lower the expectations for high school students. Trigonometry is a fundamental math subject that is typically learned in high school and is vital for many STEM fields. Therefore, including it on the SAT math section can provide an opportunity to assess a student's mastery of these critical concepts and demonstrate their preparedness for college-level coursework. Additionally, many prestigious universities require students to take a math exam that covers trigonometry, so including it on the SAT can help students prepare for these future assessments.
