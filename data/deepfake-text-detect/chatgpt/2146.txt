Personally, I'm not religious, so I guess I'm trying to get some insight here. Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything without divine intervention (like magic). You're at work and are about to have sex with your girlfriend for the first time - would that be immoral? What if she was infertile or something like that? Would any sexual intercourse between 2 people ever be considered moral by this framework? If there were no such thing as sex before marriage then wouldn't masturbation forever after also be immoral because of all those wasted potential babies? Edit: Or sperm donation? Heh...
