I believe this comic expresses the argument most cogently: Now, to my wall of text: I run a small software company that's reasonably successful. I've been doing this for the past seven years or so with one partner and now have another working on it (the business has grown from 100kyear in revenue when we started out into something much bigger). While there are some upsides about having two founders benefits such as mutual support during times where you're both under stress deadline pressure?there aren't many downs! The only thing is worth mentioning here was early-on [when] our initial CTO left us - he had taken up full time work elsewhere after six months at his new job but before committing fully; over those next few weeks while finding him replacement (s) neither founder could spend any significant amount attention towards running other aspects within their respective areas since they were busy hiring... We didn't lose too terribly due directly because all practical day by days things continued normally without major interruptions - however if either guy couldn??ve still devoted more than 75 effort back then everything would probably be better off today.... Since starting devbootcamp not long ago me personally find myself very stressed every single morning thinking "how am going get through these 5 hours..." yes i know ive done programming courses previously yet never found them mentally taxing like.Net 4 MVC seems.. perhaps its just an aspect human nature being perpetually defensive even though your way ahead? maybe fear causing self doubt re what might go wrong rather letting oneself take risks given greater exposure learning experience behind.. whatever mental blockage stands between success failure,. Its certainly affected productivity overall quality life satisfaction considerably...
