I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. The plaintiffs may have been over-served, but that was entirely their fault. I'm not trying to say that this is a "frivolous" lawsuit, but I am saying that there was absolutely no way McDonald's was negligent in any way. The only way the plaintiffs could have been hurt by the coffee is if they had reached in to grab the coffee and put their hand on the hot engine block of a truck. It's not like they were standing in the parking lot in their pajamas and slippers, sipping coffee. They were in a moving vehicle, where the coffee was clearly marked as being HOT. If you read the New York Times article, you see that the coffee was at an extremely high temperature. It was so hot that it burned the plaintiffs, but it was so hot that it dissolved the foam cup in which they were drinking it. If you read the details of the case, you will see that the plaintiff's own lawyer admits that the coffee wasn't very hot. The plaintiffs were drinking it in a foam cup, so it was probably room temperature (unless they were holding the coffee in their hands for a long time). There are three main facts that make the plaintiffs 100 at fault here. 1) The coffee was HOT. It was so hot that the plaintiff's own lawyer admits that the coffee was not very hot. It was so hot that it burned the plaintiff's skin, but it was so hot that it dissolved the foam cup in which the plaintiff was drinking it. 2) The coffee was not very hot. If you are in a moving vehicle, and the coffee is hot enough to cause third degree burns (i.e. it burns the skin), you are being stupid. If you are in a moving vehicle and the coffee is not hot enough to burn you, but hot enough to cause third degree burns to the outside of your car, you are being even stupider. 3) The plaintiffs were drinking the coffee in a foam cup, which is supposed to be room temperature. If you are in a moving vehicle and you are drinking the coffee in a room temperature foam cup, you are being extremely stupid. Here's the bottom line: The plaintiffs are 100 at fault in this case. The plaintiffs were 100 at fault in this case, but they were awarded 2.7 million in damages. The judge, in this case, ruled that McDonald's was responsible for the coffee being scalding hot. I cannot fathom how the plaintiffs could have won this lawsuit. Here's a link to the original New York Times article. Here's a link to the original Associated Press article.
