I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends who don't want to be understood as such because they're asian or black but the majority are Asian or white people." Considering the Japanese culture is culturally diverse, it's surprising she hasn't studied linguistics much. "People don't know what accent even if you like one kind. You feel the American accent," she said. "There aren't many Japanese people here, so they think just because I'm Chinese doesn't mean I have an accent too." She adds that people tend not to focus on her ethnicity when discussing Japanese history with others due to its importance within Japan. Her grandparents were Japanese immigrants from China so there isn't much interest about Japanese history elsewhere except Japanese communities around Japan nowadays. "Suddenly, there was something foreign coming out of Japan!" she says, laughing. "If they knew we weren't Japanese, maybe it wouldn't look so strange going back home now?"
