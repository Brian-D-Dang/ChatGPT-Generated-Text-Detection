Before I continue, I would like to start by saying that I am not a pedophile and that I am strongly against the sexual abuse of children. My view is that this is what we need to do as well and that children should be protected from it. I believe that with all my heart that I have been at peace with my sexuality in life. It does hurt when people try their hardest to make me feel uncomfortable because they think that if I'm attracted to them then I must behave accordingly; that's why I never talk about it with anyone; only when I need to express myself. In fact, some time ago I decided that maybe the best thing for me was just talking to someone who wasn't feeling comfortable with how my body behaved. This led me to believe that being able to openly discuss my sexuality would help me to live freely and honestly, rather than constantly hold back my thoughts and feelings. I have no interest in having sex or any other intimate relationship with anybody; never mind the things that don't look good on me; nothing matters more than putting out my body and enjoying the experience. At least, that's what I hope for. Now here is the advice I gave you earlier today: Make sure that your sexuality doesn't detract from your happiness. Don't assume that everyone has to agree with you - take responsibility for yourself! Find a woman who will respect you and her sensitivity. If she can tolerate that kind of sexual energy, she may feel right up her alley. But remember that you are free to say whatever you want - that is the way it is! And that is all that matters! Don't accept your sexuality, but give it a chance. Be courageous, even if it could mean losing your job. No matter how many times I told you to stop your love of men, you failed and drew away from me. You never heard of me? Well then congratulations - that means you are truly a man and that you deserve happiness immediately (albeit without the fear that you won't get it). Congratulations and enjoy!
