Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. It's just hip-hop and nothing more than that." He later continued: "I'm glad I gave rap criticism such a bad name when you hear Jay Z [rapper] talking about how he wants 'Hip Hop Artistry'. What has artistry got to do with being able to talk?... If a rapper talks raps like that then it's called publicity for the sake of getting money out his pocket. And if we all start doing something as stupid as him then there would no longer be any point in keeping this genre alive because it will have lost its value. It'll become just an artiste who says whatever pops into your head without rhyme or reason." The article generated considerable controversy at the time primarily due to the fact that many perceived Goldie's criticisms were hypocritical given that Goldie himself had achieved significant fame by using similar rhetoric to promote his own music career; singer Mark Ronson stated on Twitter in response to the interview, "Goldie makes some really good points here but lets face facts...he was probably trying to get press," whilst fellow musician Joe Jonas also responded similarly to comments made by Goldie regarding Drake, with Jonas stating, "Cmon now." In another Tweet in 2011, Goldie criticised Kanye West after a video clip surfaced where West claimed that people ought to listen to records rather than watch films and television shows, replying with, West] sounds like a fucking toddler!" In 2013, Pitchfork Media included a critic's round up of twenty years worth of songs deemed 'worst' from 2000-2013 during their yearly series The 25 Best Songs About Music. In the top spot was Slick Rick's 2003 song "Dangerous," which featured lyrics referring to the group OutKast, Tupac Shakur, Biggie Smalls and Eminem collectively as drug addicts and murderers. Entitled "the worst" listed number 3, 2, 1 4 respectively, were Rihanna's 2010 single "Bitch Please II (Interlude) " and Beyonce featuring Justin Timberlake's 2005 hit "Check On It"; both tracks referred to women negatively, though only one contained explicit language. Disrespectful rapper Bizness Boi criticized Goldie's comments about the death of MC Lyte, claiming that they come across as racist. Goldie said in reaction, ...] He said he didn't understand why everyone went crazy about me calling her a bh cause she wasn't disrespectful back then...' [...] He needs to grow old.' On July 10th 2017, Warner Bros Records issued a statement thanking the public following Goldie Blaxxx's removal from Cristal Dank Battle competition. Following a backlash against the decision, the label released additional statements clarifying its position on the matter including detailing that Goldie had been removed from the label earlier in June 2016, before receiving the win. Goldie Blaxxx ultimately performed two duets with Wiz Khalifa alongside Chris Brown on the latter's 2018 tour entitled One Nation Tour. Both singers shared the stage together on numerous occasions throughout the leg of the world tour, performing several other singles as well as new material. At a concert held at London Stadium, Goldie greeted former collaborator Pharrell Williams backstage wearing clothing bearing the logo of his recently founded company N.E.W., Entertainment World. After hearing news of a planned release date for Williams debut album GBE2, Goldie told journalists that he was looking forward to releasing his collaboration with the producer titled So Happy Together, and expressed optimism that it could be as successful as the pair's previous releases Hello Goodnight and Sailin', despite having never met him prior to working with the producer. He eventually reworked the title track of the record onto his 2019 EP 2300 Watts, under the new title of Too Many Fools, in order to avoid confusion between the artists.
