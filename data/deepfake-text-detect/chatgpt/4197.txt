On a hair dryer: "Do not use in a shower." If somebody's dumb enough to use a hair dryer in the shower, they're not going to pay much attention to you anyway. I was just gonna say this. I'm getting mine styled at home right now and they have one sitting on my head while I hold it up so they can see what happens when I try to blow-dry it there.
