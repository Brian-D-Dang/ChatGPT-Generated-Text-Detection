EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one can and should support the Palestinian cause without being anti-Semitic. However, I don't think one can support the Palestinian cause while simultaneously being anti-Semitic. To do so would mean supporting the destruction of the nation state of the Jewish people. "One of the most fundamental ways in which the Zionist movement has distinguished itself from the Bolsheviks, the Nazis, and other anti-Semites is by the total commitment of the Zionist movement to the principle of a Jewish state. And the fact that the Palestinians are trying to destroy that state is evidence of the anti-Semitism of the Palestinians." We know that the Bolsheviks were anti-Semites because they targeted the Jewish people for extermination. We know that the Nazis were anti-Semites because they targeted the Jewish people for extermination. We know that Hamas is an anti-Semitic organization because it calls for the extermination of the Jewish people. But we don't know that the Palestinian people are anti-Semites because we're not sure what they mean by destroying the Jewish state. The Palestinian people may be anti-Semites, but if they're not, then the destruction of the Jewish state wouldn't be an anti-Semitic act. There's nothing irrational about supporting the Palestinian cause while simultaneously opposing Hamas. The Palestinian people may be anti-Semites, but if they're not, then the destruction of the Jewish state wouldn't be an anti-Semitic act. There are a lot of Jews living in the Jewish state, that would be a shame if it were to be destroyed. No, they're not. There are Jews living in the Jewish state. But if the Jewish state were destroyed, then they wouldn't be living in the Jewish state anymore. OK, so what's the alternative? I think a Jewish state in the area where the Jewish people lived from time immemorial is the best alternative. But why should that have any bearing on what is best for the Palestinian people? If that is what they think, then there is no point in trying to convince them otherwise. It would be better for them to live in a state where they are not dominated by a group of people who are not them. But that would also be better for the Jews. I have heard about some terrible things that happen to the Palestinian people. I think those things should stop. I think the way to make that happen is to make it clear that the oppression of the Palestinian people will not be tolerated. I think the best way to do that is to make the Palestinian people feel secure. I think the best way to make the Palestinian people feel secure is to make it clear that if the Jewish people are going to live in the area where the Jewish people lived from time immemorial, the Palestinian people will not be oppressed. A Jewish state in the area where the Jewish people lived from time immemorial is the best alternative. That is not the only alternative. If that is what they think, then there is no point in trying to convince them otherwise Yes, there is. They need to be convinced otherwise because it's not good for them to believe in something that is not true. I have heard about some terrible things that happen to the Palestinian people. I think those things should stop. Yes. But why? I think the way to make that happen is to make it clear that the oppression of the Palestinian people will not be tolerated. I think that would make the situation worse for the Palestinian people. I think the best way to do that is to make the Palestinian people feel secure. So the best way to make the Palestinian people feel secure is to make it clear that if the Jewish people are going to live in the area where the Jewish people lived from time immemorial, the Palestinian people will not be oppressed. I think that's what the Palestinian people think. What evidence do you have that they think that? A Jewish state in the area where the Jewish people lived from time immemorial is the best alternative. I think a Jewish state in the area where the Jewish people lived from time immemorial is the best alternative. But why should that have any bearing on what's best for the Palestinian people? I think the best way to make the Palestinian
