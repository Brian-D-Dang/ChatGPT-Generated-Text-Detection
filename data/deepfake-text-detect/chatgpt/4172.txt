There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: This is an honest question I'm not asking for some sort of negative feedback just wondering why on earth this would be acceptable behavior in public? As someone else mentioned, it's likely that he had hearing aids.. which now that you mention are most likely what they were using to make his sounds until they died out (and he didn't get them changed).. as he could clearly hear themselves.
