I was first exposed to the universe by watching season 1 and 2 of the show. I really liked them and purchased the A Song of Ice and Fire books , which are even better than they were on tv in my opinion (but if you're not a reader it's probably a different story). As I read more and more into the series, I have become increasingly confused about this plot hole: How did Robert Baratheon become king? He wasn't mentioned as being heir apparent or anything before he married Lyanna Stark. Sure, he had been King for quite some time when Ned went off to war but that doesn't mean he would be left out of inheritance once his brother died. In any case, here is what I see so far: 1) When Robert becomes king, all Targaryen bloodlines disappear from Westeros2) In order to marry Ned Stark's sister, Elia Martell, Eddard has to eliminate Robert Baratheon as an eligible candidate3) If Ned didn't kill Robert after finding Lyanna dead with their child, then Cersei must have poisoned him4) Once Robert dies, who inherits the throne? Stannis5) And since Joffrey isn't even legitimized, how could he inherit the throne at all, let alone without a conflict with Stannis' claim6) This whole thing just gets worse because there is no way in hell Gendry will ever make it back home7) So why does anyone care about Jon Snow again?8) Did none of these people know that the Starks hold Winterfell9)?10) Why do Robb and Renly never offer to help Stannis invade the North11?) 12) What happened to the stormlandsthe Reach13) 14) Who controls the Iron Islands now15) 16) 17) 18) 19) 20) 21) 22) 23) 24) 25) 26) 27) 28) 29) 30) 31) 32) 33) 34) 35) 36) 373839404142) 434445464748495051) 52) 53545556
