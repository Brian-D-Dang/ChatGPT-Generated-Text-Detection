Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of criticism.com lately as well as well as a few people disagreeing with them all over twitter but you see these opinions are becoming more frequent now than ever before which makes me think about it again. In summary I'm still not sure what this means exactly...but again I dunno if it's due to the fact that people aren't really trying anymore or because people have started behaving like adults who don't know how much they enjoy watching TV shows? I thought it was just that there wasn't enough money in the world for many viewers nowadays.....that kinda sucks being the guy who watches shows every night so everyone hates him heh
