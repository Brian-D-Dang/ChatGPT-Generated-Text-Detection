First Let me just say I am 16 and don't have much experience with how it is in the'adult world'. But I don't think a 100 platonic relationship can exist without dating someone that has respect for you. So yeah - you're right about the whole thing being OK but not OK to create drama by getting your emotions into every scene together or whatever, but yeah, one of the most important things are the relationships they've been talking about. This isn't necessarily seeing each other as boyfriends since that's what makes them friends?
