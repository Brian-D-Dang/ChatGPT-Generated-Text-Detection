I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly interactions with the people they serve. One example of a friendly and positive interaction between a police officer and a member of the public occurred in August 2017, when a police officer in Tampa, Florida, was responding to a call about a homeless man threatening to harm himself. When the officer arrived, he found the man sitting on a park bench and talking to himself. Instead of immediately arresting the man, the officer sat down and talked to him for more than an hour. He listened to the man's story and offered words of encouragement, eventually convincing him to seek help for his depression. Other examples of officers who have friendly interactions with citizens include those who have taken time to mentor local children, volunteer their services at community events, and even accompany victims of crime on hospital visits. These small gestures can mean a great deal to the citizens they serve and demonstrate the human side of law enforcement.
