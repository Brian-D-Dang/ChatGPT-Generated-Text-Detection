I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This doesn't mean it is supporting him, but I don't see how anyone could say with a straight face they're not in some way getting involved because of this video. Plenty people still won't like Bernie's politics even if he follows all their crazy demands
