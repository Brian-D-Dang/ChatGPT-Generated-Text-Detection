From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have his moments. He was just doin what he had become accustomed to doing: shooting the shit with his pals and having some fun in the process while being as skilled at choosing words as anyone else who ever existed. He also...kind of negotiated the land deal for the US administration so we could buy our way out of it.
