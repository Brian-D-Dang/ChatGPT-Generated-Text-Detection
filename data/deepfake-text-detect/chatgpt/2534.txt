I don't personally feel that the arguments against meat eating (morality, sustainability) have enough depth andor meaning that directly affects me or others around me to make me feel as if I can never eat meat again. I mean sure they may be true on some level but a lot of these points need more support than just "caring about animals" which is all too often used as an argument in defense for everything from gay marriage to veganism Edit: spelling
