Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of debate and disagreement in the field of historical Jesus studies. It's a complex and nuanced topic, and there are many different perspectives and interpretations. Some scholars argue that the evidence for the existence of a historical Jesus is very strong, while others are more skeptical and suggest that there is less evidence than is commonly thought. Some focus on the historical context and cultural milieu in which Jesus lived, while others look more at the textual evidence and historical records that have survived. Ultimately, the question of whether Jesus was a real historical figure or a mythological construct is a tricky one, and it will likely continue to be debated by scholars and researchers for many years to come. The important thing is to approach the topic with an open mind, and to be willing to consider multiple perspectives and interpretations.
