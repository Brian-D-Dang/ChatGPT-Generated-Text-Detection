Let me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers for the game's shortcomings, but its audience. If you haven't seen or heard of GoldenEye before, here is a basic rundown: James Bond travels to Cuba and meets up with his friend, Felix Leiter (who also works as an agent) who tells him about a Soviet spy named Dr. No (an alias). He thinks there may be another one on the island, Juan Sanchez Cerano, so they go undercover to investigate. Meanwhile, the CIA has their eye on a Russian scientist whom we'll call Yuri Gordin. The two agents meet each other at a party where they are double-crossed - turns out Gordin was working for the Soviets and the KGB planted some spies within Devon Corporation which makes weapons used for nuclear bombs; U.S. government must take down the corporation before they get hold of the bomb. In order to make sure Gordin doesn't destroy anything important while he escapes, Bond needs to stop Gordin from accessing certain servers. Once he does that, all hell breaks loose when the Russians launch a surprise attack against England using the aforementioned nuke weapon. Bond manages to survive long enough to blow up most of the bases holding missiles, rendering them useless except for the ones needed to protect London from further attacks. Unfortunately, he wasn't fast enough! In fact, Gordin escapes just in time to detonate a second missile over Washington D.C., killing everyone inside. This kills off our hero, leaving only a few survivors behind. But wait, what happened to the villain? It seems Bond players weren't quite satisfied with how he went out back then...so a new version called "Golden Eye" came along! You can guess how different things turned out since the player can now kill Gordin through various methods like poison gas or even throwing a knife into his stomach. They do away with the whole going after the computers stuff too because apparently no one wants to sit around doing nothing waiting for someone else to find something important. Okay then. I mentioned the original title got poor reviews years ago due to being considered too difficult and unbalanced compared to more modern shooters. Personally, if I were to judge the difficulty based on several criteria, including length, level design, difficulty curve, etc., I would say it's pretty fair but still way harder than any shooter of today, especially Call Of Duty games. So why didn't people like it? Well for one thing, playing on PC requires installing mods that allow you to play at higher speedsgive health packs upon dying among many others. Another reason could involve the lack of content available until release day when Nintendo offered Goldeneye 007: Source, fans' first chance to play it online. Other complaints include the limited number of levels, a very short campaign mode, and low quality voice acting. Some argue that the controls aren't good either simply because the aiming laser isn't strong enough. All these factors might explain why the community surrounding the N64 classic is practically non-existent nowadays despite having millions of copies sold. Now let's move onto the PS2 sequel. While most gamers agree that Sony made a huge mistake making such a bad game, the question remains: Why did they bother remaking the one nobody liked in the first place? By making yet another remake of an old favourite, consumers had already been fed plenty of nostalgia-fueled turds prior to this. If they wanted to continue the trend of remakes, wouldn't it've been better to focus more attention on titles not nearly as loved as the previous versions while keeping those classics untouched? What if somebody were looking forward to Gex 2? Would Sucker Punch really want to risk alienating potential buyers by releasing a subpar product? Is it possible that they somehow knew in advance of how poorly received the next installment will likely end up? Whatever the case may be, there are mostly negative reactions towards this game and it continues to receive mixed reception ever since its debut 15 years ago. Most reviewers seem disappointed by most aspects of Perfect Dark Zero, ranging anywhere between terrible graphics to notably weaker AI. Even though it does offer much improved gameplay mechanics overall, the main criticism lies in its story consisting essentially of rehashing past events from earlier entries. Sections involving missions should feel fresh instead of recycled, hence the exclamation point - your mission ends abruptly following the completion of a goal, meaning you're stuck with little-to-no closure whatsoever. Plus, if we're talking about the technical side of things, let us not forget that Microsoft created a stronger engine capable of handling far larger environments which rendered faster and smoother. One particular example would be driving vehicles during outdoor sequences - the experience feels miles ahead! Nowadays however, Perfect Dark Zero receives tons of hate because everybody loves hating popular sequels whether their improvements actually matter or not. The third entry into the series takes major steps backwards....!.... (..ra kicks. gets. was gives was was exist was, and. has the.. form! thinem provides,.. (raised v still extt
