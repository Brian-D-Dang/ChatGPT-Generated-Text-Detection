It is not reasonable or fair to place the full responsibility for avoiding an unjustified police shooting on the victim. Law enforcement officers are expected to follow proper protocols and procedures, and to use their training to deescalate situations, use appropriate levels of force, and protect citizens' rights. In many cases, victims of police shootings may have been unarmed, mentally ill, or simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even if a victim did resist, evade or disobey orders, this does not necessarily mean that they deserved to be shot. It is important to remember that everyone, including law enforcement officials, are accountable for their actions, and that every life is valuable and deserving of compassion and empathy.
