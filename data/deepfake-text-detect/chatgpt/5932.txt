He's intelligent and wealthy and adaptable apparently. I think the majority of Gotham's problems could've solved with smart investments in social programs and industry and the police force which Bruce has been funding, he would've made a good mayor if he didn't have the Batsuit. I think the majority of Gotham's problems could've solved with smart investments in social programs and industry and the police force which Bruce has been funding Sure, but I think the majority of Gotham's problems could've been solved with smart investments in social programs and industry and the police force which Bruce has been funding, and the police force which was run by someone who wasn't corrupt and incompetent. I agree that the corrupt and incompetent police were a problem, but Bruce also set up a crime scene and then told the police to find the killer, which is the other major problem. I think the majority of Gotham's problems could've been solved with smart investments in social programs and industry and the police force which Bruce has been funding True. But since all we can do is speculate, we'll never know. I thought that was a brilliant idea I think that this was a great episode, but I'm not sure I'd say it was the best of the season so far. To me, that would probably be the one with the Joker, since it seemed like the first time they really nailed the character. This episode was pretty great, but I'm not sure it really nailed Bruce. I've always thought that Bruce would be more likely to be a firebrand than an Ayn Rand-esque libertarian, even if he doesn't actually become a firebrand. Also, the fact that he wants to be the hero but not the Batman is one thing, but I always got the feeling that he was afraid that he wouldn't be able to live up to the Batman's legacy, which was why he was so reluctant to actually put on the suit and take up the mantle. I'm also not sure that the Bruce that I've seen on this show would be so much in love with the concept of money and wealth. In a way, I think the Bruce in this episode was closer to the Bruce from TDKR. I'd say this is the best episode of the series so far, but the Joker episode was great too. I'm not quite sure where the theme of this episode was supposed to be. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be about Bruce's fears or just to be a really dark episode about a guy who gets away with murdering his father. I mean, I guess it's the latter, but the former was what I took from the whole thing. Yeah, I think the Joker episode was a better one for me. I think the theme was "too many cooks in the kitchen." Bruce Wayne is a good man with good intentions, but he's ultimately just an incompetent leader and manager. His inability to see that this was an inappropriate idea from the start meant that he was going to get outsmarted by the people he had been outsmarting all season long. I think the theme was "too many cooks in the kitchen." Bruce Wayne is a good man with good intentions, but he's ultimately just an incompetent leader and manager. I mean, it was never going to work to begin with. His inability to see that this was an inappropriate idea from the start meant that he was going to get outsmarted by the people he had been outsmarting all season long. He wanted to show the world that "you don't need Batman to make Gotham a better place." I'm not sure how the fact that he failed to get the job done is necessarily his fault. The episode also felt a bit too long to me. I think we're in agreement that the Joker episode was better, but I'm not sure we're in agreement about this episode. Yeah, this episode felt too long to me as well. I would say the first episode of the season was the best of the series so far, followed by the Joker and then this one. It's weird that it is always so close between two episodes. I liked the first episode as well. I think the Joker was the best one of the season as well, but I have to say that this was a really good episode too. I'd say it's one of my favorites of the season so far, but I'm not sure that it's
