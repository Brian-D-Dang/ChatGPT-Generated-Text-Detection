While it is true that labeling people as the "First African-American" or "First Woman" to do something may emphasize differences, it does not necessarily do more to separate us than bring us together. In fact, celebrating and acknowledging people's accomplishments based on their identity can inspire others from similar backgrounds to strive for greatness and break down barriers. These "firsts" can serve as role models and open doors for future generations. It is not about highlighting differences, but rather recognizing and celebrating diversity and the unique perspectives and experiences that individuals bring to the table.
