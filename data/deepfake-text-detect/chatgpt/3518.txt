I was only able to find one other thread about this topic, and it was kind of a train wreck. Common arguments: "It's not Jraphics Interchange Format" by that logic, it should be pronounced "guh-rap-hics" instead of "juh-rap-hics," which most people say. In any case, while there may be debates about how to pronounce "GIF," the most widely accepted pronunciation is "juh-rap-hic" with a soft "G" sound. This is the pronunciation used by the creators of the format and is used in most official references and discussions. Ultimately, it's not a big deal how someone pronounces "GIF," and it's more important to focus on understanding and using the format effectively.
