Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and go on Twitter calling themselves "Prisoner X" and start sharing their supposed stories of what they knew about 911 when no-one else would talk publicly. Finally we get an official government report that happens years later and finally answers our questions: everyone lied except for them; there were never any planes or passengers involved at all because it wasn't an airliner strike but rather simply a controlled demolition of WTC 7. It's an important case study as to how not long ago still considered rare in these times of fake news can you believe anything?

William Whyte's question to the business world during the 1980s led him towards his radical conclusion "the job will be done better, cheaper and faster," putting workers first and overthrowing management. His book 'The Organisation Man' (1956) examined human relations through workplace relationships. He found managers incapable of providing leadership. Woodrow Wilson taught us that citizens had rights. If businesses didn't have responsibilities...to employees, customers, communities, society, shareholders...they shouldn't exist.. James Carse wrote of a need for an optimal intellectual environment encouraging learning and individualism. a" Thomas Jefferson suggested creating self reliant gentlemen farmers who produce more than enough food with little effort.... We should copy Sweden. The Enlightenment threw off old metaphysics and religious beliefs. Science unravelled mysteries before Darwin. Technological developments separated humanity into urbanised (work centred), industrialised societies, based upon mass production reaping social benefits... AuthorKazemi describes himself as a political philosopher. Although he believes strongly in scientific progress, Kazemi argues that science alone cannot make sense out of life nor resolve our fundamental problems. There must be a comprehensive philosophy accounting for both physical reality and existential issues. Life does matter, but only in relation to other things. This approach results in the unity of knowledge and action and the reconciliation of reason with faith. Does technology give meaning? Which aspects remain true whilst eliminating others? How much power over nature can one man really claim? These seem reasonable questions. But Kazemi uses contemporary examples where familiar rules don't apply. The reader has to decide how far Kazemi takes us beyond conventional thinking. Kazemi aims to keep the complexities of modernity with its unprecedented opportunities while keeping a firm grip on truth. This isn't just academic rhetoric.
