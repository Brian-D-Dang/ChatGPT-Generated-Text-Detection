A counter-argument to refute the opinion that having children is good for the country and bad for the individual could be that having children is not only beneficial for the country but also for the individual. Having children can bring joy, love, and fulfillment to people's lives. It allows individuals to pass on their values, traditions, and knowledge to the next generation. Additionally, raising children can help individuals develop important skills such as patience, time management, and problem-solving. While raising children comes with challenges and sacrifices, the rewards it brings to individuals can outweigh the difficulties. Therefore, having children can be good for both the country and the individual.
