I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by Congress is largely concerning, but I am very proud of those conservatives who have argued that there should be one chamber, and that it would be wise to let the entire House and Senate have its own chamber.
