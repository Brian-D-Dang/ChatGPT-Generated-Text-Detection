I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still think they were wrong to interrupt him and distract from his message. He said he felt it was necessary because someone needed to say something about police brutality against black people. Now, I haven't seen this particular video yet but my initial impression is not favorable to them. Perhaps being focused on another subject for so long has given me tunnel vision, or maybe it just comes down more to the fact that my opinion doesn't matter anyway. But I am curious as to what others here feel? Are these kinds of protests effectivedesired by protestors? And if yes why do we see such little outside support when white lives are also lost at the hands of police officers? Edit: Finally watched the entire thing... I have to be honest; I thought both sides would come off badly after watching it. The Black Lives Matters side definitely came across better than the Trump supporters though who seemed pretty rude towards the protesters especially near the end there. Edit 2: After further consideration it seems like the BLM movement does indeed receive some support even from fellow conservatives! Thanks for the input everyone.
