To me growth of economy is a meaningless statistic. Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange. What kind of person evaluates actions in this way? I don't see how the growth of the economy doesn't have any value, because it's an indicator that countries are growing and people want to buy more stuff from them.
