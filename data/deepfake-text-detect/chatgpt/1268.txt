So first of I am danish. That means that I follow american politics, much in the same way I follow german politics. Somethings are importent for me and my situation, but some things aren't as important to others. Second: as a Dane you'll certainly get more insight into American Politics then most people living here. Are there any particular topics from US politics which have relevance to Denmark?
