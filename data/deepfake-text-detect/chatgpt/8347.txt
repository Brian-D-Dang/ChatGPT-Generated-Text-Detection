To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going towards members of my community as well. However there's a side effect how do we handle child custody? If both partners were married before they had children then it'll just fall into place; but what if one partner was not previously legally recognized for whatever reason (which is probably most cases). Would parentage laws still apply or would you need two separate agreements on who can get accesscustody over certain issues such birth certificates etc.? A: You will indeed want at least 2 contracts between spouses regarding all future matters should this happen because many states follow "equitable distribution" when making decisions about property division among divorced people regardless...so best thing might simply mean splitting everything 50 50. In some placeslike Illinois - a lot more than half may go toward alimony payments post divorce depending upon circumstances however! Also keep mind too moving from state after being separated by court order does NOT automatically invalidate preexisting marriages where applicable so long an Idaho resident has never lived outside its borders.
