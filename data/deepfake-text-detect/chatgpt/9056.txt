I really like Coke (hell look at my username), like really. I made the trek to Atlanta about a year ago for the sole reason of visiting the Coca-Cola Museum. And while there, they had a great selection of pumpkins and stuffed animals at their store. I also love everything else in the museum. This was an incredible experience; it is one I will never forget! Which to you? Is a classic '65 or '70 car worth more than today? Or are you just down on your luck with Cars 2? If not, don't worry, we've got you covered here... We enjoyed this article but please do share it:
