I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is not as effective as a bidet in terms of personal hygiene. Bidets are designed to clean thoroughly and remove all bacteria, while toilet paper might not remove everything. Bidets are also more comfortable and hygienic because they don't cause irritation or leave bits of paper stuck to your skin. Many people who switch from toilet paper to bidets find that they feel much cleaner and fresher after going to the bathroom. It might take some getting used to, but using a bidet can be a great alternative to using just toilet paper.
