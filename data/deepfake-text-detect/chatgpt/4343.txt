First thing, let's assume the biblical Jesus is completely true. Now, I have a fair knowledge of the biblical tale, but if I say something wrong, feel welcome to correct me in the comments below (please don't do so at work). Second, how did he explain the resurrection? He spoke to them just before his death and said "I'm not dead yet." He didn't actually speak to anyone...just a spirit he chose that was faithful.
