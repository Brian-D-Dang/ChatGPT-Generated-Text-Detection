I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any fear of the unknown or what lies beyond then I guess we'd have less wars and more peace for certain, but not really sure how else our lives might change. I do believe in an afterlife (and by "afterlife" i mean something like reincarnation) at least partly because if you die on your own terms, even though its not the same thing as living forever...if you can live again anyway after death anyway why suffer here? How does believing in the soulreincarnation make suicide ok?
