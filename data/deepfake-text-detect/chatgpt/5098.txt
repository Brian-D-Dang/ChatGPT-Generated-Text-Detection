I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, kids are beautiful and all that, but they're a lot easier for me than human beings who don't need family members' love at this point in their lives because I know families do not exist anymore." As I write these words, it feels like life is getting the worst possible way I haven't been able to imagine ever since I first started writing these letters back in 2012 to my mother three years ago. My mother died last year during the holiday season after suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. Dying alone has felt like forever. That's why my grandmother died ten months ago; she was the only thing holding us together until her death. There were times we weren't thinking about each other as if nothing happened or waiting on our grandparents (my parents), then there would be moments where we couldn't talk without crying into our pillow pails while we talked about how much we loved each other even though sometimes it seemed less loving. It just doesn't feel right now. We've tried so hard to keep things moving forward despite everything happening around us with COVID-19, but we didn't survive the holidays. This Christmas was the hardest time yet without my grandfather dying too soon. In 2020, I've made some sacrifices. My large family came through, my sisters got married, my aunt passed away unexpectedly. My sister and brother moved across state lines shortly before Thanksgiving 2018 due to COVID complications. I spent Thanksgiving Day desperately trying desperately to make sure my dad hadn't died suddenly by staying home every weekend. I wish I could claim victory over this virus but I'm still dragging along with a limp heart feeling unable to see any improvement no matter what I had planned or hoped for. Everything seems overwhelming especially given how unprepared I am for the world to reopen again - just four weeks ago I thought I'd finished writing my Christmas letter to my husband giving him the final assurances he needed. Now I wonder whether he'll never forgive me - he did deserve it - but I also think his forgiveness will come sooner rather than later. Now I worry more about missing out on Christmas than being alone with my family and my dogs. I know I shouldn't cry over it, but it hurts knowing how badly I lost my father. This isn't the worst loss in my life - they both lived long enough for me to weep over them. Many people missed seeing their beloved husband and two daughters when he deadened early December2018. I hope my mother knew him well but neither of us expected him to die immediately afterward-it wasn't our intention either - and that's exactly what happens when you lose your mom. My friend Pauline tells me in this week's column "You Have Yourself A Wonderful Holiday Season" that he thinks coronavirus might be closer to the end than anyone knows. Pauline believes the pandemic may cause more grief than anyone anticipated: "We want everyone to celebrate Thanksgiving - folks celebrating together as best as possible! But that doesn't mean everyone should spend their days thinking about COVID lockdown rules in isolation. You want everybody to enjoy themselves this holiday season? Celebrate small acts of kindness instead!" Pauline says he hopes everyone finds joy this holiday season amid uncertainty: "Because we humans aren't nearly ready for all the wonderful things that our ancestors experienced thanksgiving traditions brought us - we certainly won't want to miss out." Pauline recommends incorporating the holidays into everyday activities including virtual turkey dinners with friends and watching movies online rather than eating dinner in a restaurant just yet. Enjoying a meal together virtually sounds fun, but Pauline argues that while we Americans know better than most what great traditions look like amidst COVID restrictions, it takes a different mindset toward Christmas to accept presents wrapped up inside the house. "Even though one cannot send gifts outside Christmastime, many adults understand that Thanksgiving needs to happen," he writes. "If someone sends you a present today others will appreciate your kindness beyond measure...when people start thinking seriously about sending presents next year its time we remember what they say they appreciate most." Pauline reminds readers that "the holidays experience lies within ourselves." "Donating to charities helps keep families together financially and emotionally, making Saturdays cold and grayer for the whole family. Giving means sharing our traditions alongside those we love. Sharing donations online allows everyone in one room to benefit today - something we wouldn't otherwise consider - like Christmas trees tucked under blankets tomorrow evening." Though my friends and I celebrated Thanksgiving without my father believing we understood what was arriving, Christmas 2021 might be harder without him. As Pauline points out, Christmas represents "a time of gratitude," adding that "Christmas tree traders will be disappointed without him waving goodbye rather than bracing for chaos ahead once the holidays begin." I hear Pauline saying that Christmas 2021 might sound strange without my father, but believe me despite my fears increased fatigue struggle weight Pittsburgh-ers without a few ices wennes makes spirits remaining amid the weightiestsh yazahzseth weightiness rest.
