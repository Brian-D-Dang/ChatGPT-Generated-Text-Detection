With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more restrictions on when and how police officers are allowed to use lethal force. I believe there should be more training for officers in de-escalation techniques and that officers should be held accountable for any misuse of force. Furthermore, I think there should be a better system for tracking police violence and an independent body to investigate all police related deaths. Finally, I think police departments should be encouraged to hire a diverse range of officers and to build strong relationships with their communities. This would help to foster trust between the community and the police, making it less likely for deadly confrontations to occur.
