While it is often argued that private businesses should have the freedom to choose their own clientele, this argument ignores the fact that in certain situations, this freedom can lead to discrimination against certain individuals or groups. For instance, if a business chooses to discriminate against individuals based on their race, gender, religion, or sexuality, this can result in a society where people are unfairly treated and denied opportunities solely based on their identity. In such cases, the government may have to step in to ensure that all individuals have equal access to goods, services, and opportunities provided by businesses. Therefore, while private businesses should have the freedom to conduct their business, this freedom needs to be balanced with the need to prevent discrimination and promote equality of opportunity for all.
