Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data] . In the comments, a lot of people were saying that they are finding out, or think that they have found out, that technology is not bad. I am going to address this statement at least partly because as much as I love Futurama, and can relate on so many levels with its characters and situations (and indeed some of the cartoon's plots), I don't share all their opinions about how the world should work. I want to start by getting this straight: Don't confuse something being good for society as good for humanity. Technology isn't always a net positive! Sometimes even good things come with complications. The reason we need to be careful to do so is because when we make arguments like "technology creates jobs," we are making an argument against innovation within our current economic system. We are also assuming that technological advances will result in job creation - which seems wrong because we know from history that if you give people more power over resources then you will get less activity and lower productivity. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to find new ways to solve problems; but we should be very careful about the assumption that technological development results in increased social benefit. To understand why I will digress slightly into what the Futurama episode Rents describes well: namely, the benefits of backbreaking labor versus leisure time. Let me explain the concept of leisure time now. Much research has been done recently showing the effects of leisure time availability and quality on human behavior. One study claims that leisure time increases satisfaction with personal activities, including physical, mental, emotional, social, and sexual needs (Cokayne Muehlenbeck 2007). Another study suggests that people value leisure time more highly in countries where government policies provide better access to leisure times such as parks, seafood restaurants, historical sites, and beaches (Diener et al 2010). So while your economy might be able to create a higher rate of employment through automation thanks to technology, people may stop working altogether if this leads them to disengage completely instead of just using new technologies to gain access to other forms of entertainment. It would seem as though everyone who works will lose out due to automation and computers replacing humans doing manual labor. But this is actually not true. The primary problem will be a loss of production since the machines aren't creating the goods anymore. When the machine does the tedious work of making clothes, furniture, etc., people suddenly end up with nothing else to do except participate in leisure activities. They won't spend any more money buying food, clothing, or fuel. If the machines are no longer producing, then these products become commodities and thus lose value. People who previously worked full-time and built wealth during their free time should therefore see their income reduced significantly - except those in the top few percent of earners who receive substantial bonuses each year. Our economic model requires us to use resources, but we pay taxes to keep the rest of the population alive. So rather than reducing overall output, technology provides a way for people to generate more revenue without increasing overall consumption. The main point here is that attempting to equate technological progress outside our current economic systems with improved opportunities to live and enjoy leisure simply ignores the fact that technology has had negative side effects. There is a difference between allowing the industrial revolution to lead to a prosperous nation and allowing exponential growth to take control over every aspect of life. It is important to balance the scale of what happens in each case to ensure that people continue to benefit from both innovations and traditional methods.
