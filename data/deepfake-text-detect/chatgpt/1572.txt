I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends , family and colleagues do. As a matter of fact it is more often than not something that I just don't get past an initial taste without any desire or motivation to explore further at all... So you're basically saying "if this is how i feel then no one else can have these opinions"? That's pretty close minded, broski
