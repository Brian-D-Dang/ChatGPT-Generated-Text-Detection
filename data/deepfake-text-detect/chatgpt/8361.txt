Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I don't want there (unless they are friends of the host). But because a lot can happen over two years and if you invite 50 or 100 for this milestone birthday party then some may not make an appearance again until your 30th40teh anniversary which is just silly! I have been looking at NYC venues but now everyone has their own weddings booked in 2018 2019 - eek!! So what's left? Queens still seems like too large town with high rents etc...?? Any suggestions would help me narrow down options asap!!!
