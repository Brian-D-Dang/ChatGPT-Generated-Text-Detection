I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry atheists make them out to be. But you know what? It's still your right not to. If all it takes for someone to refuse service is their belief in god then fuck 'em. Maybe they don't deserve civil rights anyway and maybe we shouldn't cater to them if they can't do something that no one else has to
