Improv, as an art form, is a medium almost exclusively to be enjoyed live. SNL, while having improvised elements, does not fall in this category because most skits are rehearsed and filmed ahead of time (although the process can involve spontaneous improvisation at times). Improv Comedy Shows The Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King was adapted into two movies: The Shawshank Redemption in 1994 starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman; and later in 2007 with Andy Durden as Red played by Johnny Knoxville. Both versions were very well-received critically but neither one lived up to the praise they received. To give you a taste for what I mean when I say both films failed, here's my review from IMDb that sums it all up quite nicely: "A prison inmate becomes involved in archery lessons run by Waltz who informs him about issues on society outside. While doing so he starts teaching Randall how to read which leads them to discovery of facts within prison walls. They also help each other escape together." A grade B movie like The Shawshank Redemption isn't exactly the sort of thing you want to take your children to see. But we do love our fiction adaptations and have been known to watch these ones over and over again and sometimes even find ourselves humming along throughout the film. Here are some more reviews of the first version only: Now let me quickly address why I am talking a little bit of smack about such a great film. First off...not enough people actually watch the films themselves instead relying on others opinions or else simply watching the trailer before seeking out more information about it. Secondly, there has always been a stigma attached to any adaptation whether its good or bad. It seems that many think if something gets made based upon another work then somehow automatically makes it worse than just reading the original material itself because, after all, actors don't know their lines! And thirdly, we must consider that every single person who critiques the Shawshank film will probably never get to experience the full glory of the book or maybe haven't ever experienced the genius writing of Stephen King himself. So go ruminate and enjoy The Shawshank Redemption in theaters while enjoying a hearty serving of saltines. Jigaboo Nation Wreck-It Ralph by John August Rich Moore (2012) is clearly inspired by Disney animated classics such as Pinocchio (1940), Fantasia (1941) Beauty and the Beast (1991); none of which Wreck-it Ralph shares with the latter being a video game culture loving arcade gamer. Yet despite those inspirations, Strange Brew, as stated previously in this post, would serve as a better comparison for the story. Director Rich Moore explains his decision to use the Brothers Quay's screenplay as follows: In terms of the gags [in] Beauty and the Beast - well, the idea came from Gaston and LeFou. What I wanted to avoid was trying to tell stories too close to things that already existed...I didn't really feel comfortable taking the kind of ideas that Pixar takes to make films like Toy Story and Wall-E these kinds of popcorn flicks where everything's going to turn out okay in the end...and stuffing them down this character's throat. Instead, I took a look at old Disney cartoons Goofy meets Bugs Bunny meets Porky Pig and tried to distill dramatic beats from them. These aren't perfect analogues to the source material, but they're still funny. I'd much rather talk about the jokes than try to sell the audience "This Is How You Make Stories Better." No matter how hard I type it out, it sounds like Tony Stark explaining Iron Man's arc reactor to Darth Vader during Star Wars Episode III. Thanks for listening. Monkey Business! Transformers 3: Dark Side Rising, co-written by Steven Spielberg and Ehren Kruger, picks up 10 years after Transformers 2 ended. Much like the second sequel (ahem, Revenge Of The Fallen), Michael Bay is back behind the camera directing. This time however, it looks as though he went deep undercover to produce the sequel. He wants us to believe that dark side Optimus Prime is banished to planet Earth 20 years ago when prime discovers sarah Connor, human Decepticon leader of 'Optimus' fame...Once on earth, saharan Autobots catch wind of humans and start invading cities in secret until making their move to destroy humanity to save themselves from extinction.
