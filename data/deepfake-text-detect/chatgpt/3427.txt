You may have seen news that BlackLivesMatter protesters interrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Seattle. I think this was wrong to do, because he has fought for civil rights As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs.

It's always important to engage in respectful and constructive discourse to make progress towards a more just and equitable society for all.
