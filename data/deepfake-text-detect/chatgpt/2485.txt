Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on without really taking any action. So here's my suggestion: Write a letter! Don't just write one though; be creative and personalize your message as much as possible so they know who you are - some folks get letters from celebrities or their representatives (for example, Death Penalty Focus sent out an email today asking for help in getting a letter written by someone famous). But most importantly DON 'T FORGET TO ATTACH YOUR MAILED SUPPORT!!! They need at least 2,500 pieces of mail before January 31st. If every person reading this blog writes only ONE LETTER we will reach our goal easily!! Spread the word... let everyone you can think of know ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN!!!!
