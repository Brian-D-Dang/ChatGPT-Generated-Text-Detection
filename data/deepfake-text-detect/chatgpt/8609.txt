In spite of the imperfections of the USA and Europe, it still remains a truth that pretty much all of the most desirable places in the world are run by men. 1. Because Americans love to travel, they like to go out with friends. This is because people tend to be more involved in their lives as well. This means that there's something for everyone when you're traveling around the world. There's nothing better than having some fun with a bunch of people. It also means that people over 50 can go on walks without fear of becoming sick or dying from a dangerous illness. If this sounds familiar, it has to do with the fact that many people in the US are actually quite good at walking around. In England, for example, they have a decent walk, even if it's only 10 minutes. When you visit places like South America, Africa, and Asia, these walks are really meant to bring your mind alive. The trip itself benefits both the person who takes advantage of them (and their surroundings) and those willing to take part in the journey. 2. Eventually, more and more people like to visit places like China, Russia, Thailand, Japan, etc. Although they may not want to go to all of those places, you should definitely take a trip to one of these countries so you don't end up miserable and wishing you could just get home instead of throwing yourself into an endless interplanetary disaster waiting for the next American ever to arrive.
