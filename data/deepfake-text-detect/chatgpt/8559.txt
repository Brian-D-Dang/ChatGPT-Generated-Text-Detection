Hi guys! To expand: Although I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman for example) a woman to their face and when talking about sex, I always feel like I have the wrong person. How do you know they are not talking about sex? The first thing I noticed is that my mouth felt automatically male-ish like 13 of the time until I started talking more specifically with them (the other half was female). But there's something else about it:P
