A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a gun into the air when it exploded in the face, killing her brother who had killed himself shortly afterwards while shooting a relative, five years ago. The shooter died instantly after he blew up his own head off without warning leaving behind an assortment of bullets that landed near the body cavity of his mother. The man accused has been sentenced to death by murder charges in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit alleging that he deliberately stepped on the trigger during the assault causing her death as a result of his actions resulting from his inability to control his temper which led him to shoot himself several times with a handgun pulled out of the holster around his waistband before killing himself with one bullet hitting him seven days later.
