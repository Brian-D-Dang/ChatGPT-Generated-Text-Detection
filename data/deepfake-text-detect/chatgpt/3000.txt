There must have been thousands of times when I was talking about a hypothetical person when it came to picking pronouns and I chose the pronoun she or he, maybe because that's what I was used to. I never noticed how many times I did this until one day someone pointed out something that I had said in conversation with my class mates over lunchtime at school. They asked me why I always picked "she" rather than "he." It made sense after they explained but then later on I started noticing more instances of using gender neutral pronouns for people. Now what happens is that if you don't use gendered pronouns everyone knows who's being referred too because we all know what an English teacher looks like! So instead now we tend to just call them by their name - young manyoung woman (this works well) as well as saying things such as: 'the boy', 'him', or simply ignoring gender altogether e.g.: I'll write an article about the advantages of biological sex-based scholarships next week so stay tuned...
