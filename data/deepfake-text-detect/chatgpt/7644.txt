The decision to be pro-choice or pro-life is a deeply personal one, and it's important to recognize that everyone has their own reasons for feeling the way they do. It's understandable to feel conflicted or guilty about being anti-abortion, but it's also important to remember that there are valid reasons for supporting a woman's right to choose. It's possible to hold a nuanced and respectful attitude towards the issue, while also acknowledging that there are complex and difficult ethical dilemmas at play. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide for themselves what they believe is right, and it's important to respect the autonomy of all people when it comes to matters related to reproductive freedom.
