I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think you are correct, scientists do not assume the uniformity of nature as an absolute, given fact. Instead, they approach it as a working hypothesis, subject to revision based on empirical evidence. The scientific method involves testing hypotheses by making observations and conducting experiments to determine if they are supported or disproved by the evidence. In this way, scientists are able to refine and improve their understanding of the natural world, and update their models and theories accordingly. So, it's accurate to say that the uniformity of nature is not blindly assumed, but is rather treated as a provisional assumption that can be confirmed, revised, or rejected based on the evidence gathered through scientific inquiry.
