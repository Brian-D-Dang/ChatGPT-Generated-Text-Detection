One counter-argument against allowing airline cabotage in the US is that it may lead to unfair competition and a decrease in the quality of airline services. If foreign airlines were permitted to operate domestic flights, they could potentially offer lower prices due to lower operating costs, and this could put domestic airlines at a disadvantage. This could lead to domestic airlines cutting corners on maintenance, safety, and service quality to compete with their foreign counterparts, ultimately harming consumers. Additionally, foreign airlines may be subject to different labor and safety regulations that could create discrepancies in working conditions and compromise air travel safety.
