I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural experience and not something you need in your life. A lot of people are saying it's going extinct because there aren't many Japanese left here anymore who know how or want learn about using them (plus they don't have any place for their students back home). However looking around YouTube proves this wrong: There seems as if everyone wantswants teaching themselves once again traditional methods on eating with these sticks although most old timers probably won"! hate seeing someone learning all over Europe now...
