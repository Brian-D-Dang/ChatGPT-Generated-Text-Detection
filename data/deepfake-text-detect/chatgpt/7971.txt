An increase in the minimum wage could actually benefit not only the lower and middle classes but also the economy as a whole. When workers earn more money, they have more purchasing power to spend on goods and services, which can stimulate consumer spending and business growth. Additionally, when workers are paid a fair wage, they are more likely to stay in their jobs longer, reducing turnover costs for employers. This can lead to a more stable and productive workforce, ultimately benefiting both the employees and the employers. Furthermore, research has shown that increasing the minimum wage can reduce income inequality, leading to a stronger and more sustainable economy. Therefore, it is important to consider the long-term benefits of a higher minimum wage for not only the lower and middle classes but for society as a whole.
