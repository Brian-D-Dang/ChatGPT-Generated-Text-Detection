I was first exposed to the universe by watching season 1 and 2 of the show. I really liked them and purchased the A Song of Ice and Fire books after that. It's like a lot of shows and movies - you sort of need to sit and watch it all before you can enjoy it fully. The book series is great! And yeah, there are definitely gaps in terms of what happened in each episode compared with the show
