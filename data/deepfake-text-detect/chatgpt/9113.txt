New here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong. Before I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal experience, not fact based on certain facts or any other person's experiences at all. I understand your frustration but you can't say shit without proof it's true. First off, how do we know that? Second, what are the specificfacts about me. There would be no proof beyond a reasonable doubt why I do what I do if they were right.
