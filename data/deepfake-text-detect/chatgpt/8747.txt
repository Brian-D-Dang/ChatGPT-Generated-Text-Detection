I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends . The first time I was at the coffee shop in Palo Alto, I had a fantastic experience: I got a cup of coffee with my sommelier and Anheuser-Busch. Like that, I knew exactly what I wanted. We shared a drink - or so it seemed - and we talked for hours. And then... There came a moment when everything just fell into place: we began talking. We kissed, he said, while rolling our eyes slightly. He offered us an espresso latte. "That sounds great!" I exclaimed. "I mean, if you need another one? We can have one myself." It is true that there are many coffee shops today. But they all share a common goal: to sell out the people who would buy them once they were done drinking caffeine - not because they thought it was bad coffee - but simply because they want customers to know how awesome their coffee is. And it must be good coffee, because it isn't.
