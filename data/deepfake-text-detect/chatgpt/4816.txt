I really like Coke (hell look at my username), like really. I made the trek to Atlanta about a year ago for the sole reason of visiting the Coca-Cola Museum. It's pretty sweet, and very informative; it doesn't matter that they don't have any real Coke in there or anything...this place is cool! If you ever find yourself traveling through Georgia on your way somewhere else go visit this museum. The best part? There are Pepsi products too! On my way home from said trip I was listening to an audio book when someone called me. After hanging up the phone, it came on again. This time it wasn't work calling so much as friends wondering where I was if not stuck on a bus. We had planned this night out before leaving town. When we finally got off the highway our friend was already waiting outside with his truck, though he wouldn't leave until he saw us drive away. On the ride across state lines in the dark we were able to converse freely, laughing and joking around while trying to fall asleep. Of course, that would be impossible since all three of us passed out immediately once inside his pickup bed: Me, him and his mom who kept sticking her head outside every now and then yelling "BROTHER!! BROTHERS!!! COME ON NOW!!!!" She eventually stopped after awhile but eventually went back to sleep sitting right next to me. That lasted approximately five minutes. After being awakened by the tailgate closing, I found myself staring into the face of four heads looking down over me, and curiously yet angrily questioning why I am awake in their vehicle. They asked what planet I plan on staying on today and when I explained that I thought that one was just sleeping on the floor of theirs, another took offense saying something along the line of "so YOU think either of MY kids can do THAT?!" My response was instinctive, without thinking I raised my arm and swiped his lip smackingly hard enough to draw blood. He began screaming bloody murder, waking everyone up. His mother jumped up cursing under her breath, asking how dare I touch them, disturbing some dust mite infested blankets she left lying out to dry only moments earlier. Before any of us could say more than two words, the third person in the room fired back. He stated loudly that "you know what will happen if you kick ME, RIGHT BABY?? What happens if I decide tonight to kill you??? You WILL DIE!!! DO NOT TRUST ANYONE!!! NEVER EVER EVER!!!" And then all hell broke loose. The first thing anyone noticed besides Tom doing damage control was the fact that I started bleeding everywhere. Blood was coming out of both eyes, ears and nose. Soaked sheets became soaked with red liquid and now I was holding my own guts together because of...nothing, probably. I honestly didn't care though because I felt justified in defending whatever dignity I possessed...something I tend to take real seriously. Yet even just these few words alone floored me, as did everything else that followed. Their faces grew darker and dirtier each second, their mouths becoming sets of jagged fangs ready to tear chunks of flesh from those around them. All six people circled around me, pulling their fists back to strike. At one point I looked past the mass of bodies surrounding me and saw Jesus standing down at the end of the aisle watching us. He motioned towards me, silently telling me to keep talking. I told them no, that we need to split, that I was okay. Then I glanced down at my body and realized I was covered with their blood. Even though they said nothing more, I still knew exactly what they wanted, and I refused to give it to them. It seemed ridiculous that something grown men couldn't get along on a simple road trip, especially considering none of them had been drinking prior to embarking on such utter foolishness. As if sensing that I might change my mind, Tom threw open the door behind me, allowing me to step out onto the grassy shoulder of the freeway. Fortunately they opened the passanger side doors afterwards, otherwise it may have gotten a whole lot worse. Overhearing the conversation between Tom and I, the lead female gave forth threats which ranged wildly in severity but ended in the same outcome: "We're going to KILL EVERY FUCKING SON OF A BITCH WHO WENT TO THE PEDODROME TODAY AND DIDN'T TELL US WHAT HAPPENED! WE NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING BAD IS GOING DOWN SO THIS WEEKEND THERE CAN BE NO FIGHTS AT ALL IN OUR GROUP! COUNTDOWN begins Sunday morning tomorrow...and remember, this ends Monday OR WE ARE PULLING OVER AND WAITING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE!" They let out a collective sigh of relief, knowing how easily they could run me over with their car if necessary....well, I3: all they are away below 10 per) decided to substitute what has come to be (being bad having gone good) taking place
