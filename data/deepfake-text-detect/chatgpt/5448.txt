The likes of ratheism argue that most of the world's problems come from religion, and that a post-religion world would be miles better. As humans, we inherently drive ourselves into addiction to trying out drugs; for many people its easy enough just to understand where we're coming from, but those who have been addicted to drugs since childhood know exactly how hard it can be to get rid of them - especially when the addiction comes in the form of something like heroin or methadone because they need lots of help with their sense of self-esteem and control over their lives as well as physical needs such as food alone." You should note that abortion is illegal everywhere except for killing a fetus which entails not taking any action against it itself. Of course there are laws on the books forcing people to pay fines if they don't want abortions. Yet the constitution says you cannot kill unborn children under 14 weeks cause that means you've killed all your rights and the government has no right to take away their lives.
