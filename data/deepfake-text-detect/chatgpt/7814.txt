While some people may argue that plus ones shouldn't always be invited to gatherings, it's important to consider that attending social events can be intimidating for some people, especially if they don't know many people there. Inviting plus ones can make attendees feel more comfortable, and allows them to bring someone who they can share the experience with. Additionally, by including plus ones, hosts can expand their social circle to potential new friends or connections. Overall, while there may be some logistical challenges associated with accommodating plus ones, the benefits of doing so tend to outweigh the costs.
