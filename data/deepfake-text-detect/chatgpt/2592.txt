Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to be wrong in most cases of course Transgender is an adjective, so you should say "transgenders." You would not say someone with brown hair was 'brown-haired'.
