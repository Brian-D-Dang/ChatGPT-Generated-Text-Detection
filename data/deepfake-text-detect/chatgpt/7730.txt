The beauty of living in a democratic society is that individuals have the freedom to express their opinions and beliefs, and to participate in the political process. Bernie Sanders has a significant following and has been a vocal advocate for progressive policies that resonate with many Democratic voters. It would undemocratic to deny him the opportunity to run for the leadership position simply because he is not a registered Democrat. Furthermore, by welcoming individuals with diverse backgrounds and perspectives, the Democratic Party can strengthen its platform and appeal to a wider range of voters. Ultimately, the decision of who should lead the party should be left to the party members and voters, rather than arbitrary rules or restrictions.
