I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, the yin and yang. There is no grey, no middle ground, no middle option. There is no option to be both good and bad. Agreed, there are choices to be made, but not between being good and bad. I've read somewhere (although I can't remember where), that in the old times, people used to see grey between the black and the white. The grey was not the place of the shades, but the place of balance. In other words, when you choose to do something you must do it totally, or not do it at all. Nowadays, we are used to see the grey zone as a middle ground between the black and the white. In my opinion, to be good is to be good when it is necessary. It is not something you have to do and do it all the time. It's a choice, a decision, a conscious and voluntary act. It's something you decide to do and then you do it, and then you stop doing it. To be bad is also a choice, but it is not a conscious choice. It is a lack of choice, a lack of decision. It is the inability to make a decision. It is to not choose. It is doing the opposite of what you should be doing. To be a good person, you must choose to be good. Not to be a bad person, you must choose to be bad. Not to choose is to be bad. To be both good and bad is impossible. You can be a good person with bad thoughts, but a bad person with good thoughts. You can be a good person with bad actions, but a bad person with good actions. A good person who makes bad choices, but a bad person who makes good choices. Good and bad can coexist, but only in the grey zone. So, stop looking for the middle ground. There is no middle ground. Either you are a good person, or you are a bad person. If you are a bad person, then make a decision to be a good person. It is not enough to be good when you are forced to be good. You must be good even when you are not forced. If you are good, then live good. If you are bad, then live bad. I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Somehow, I think it's ok to post something in a different language when it's a quote. And it's a quote worth to be preserved. It's something you decide to do and then you do it, and then you stop doing it. Yep. That's exactly how I understand it, too. I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, the yin and yang. There is no grey, no middle ground, no middle option. There is no option to be both good and bad. There is no option to be both good and bad. I think that makes sense. It's an interesting way to look at it. I'm not sure that all people see things in terms of good and bad though, but as to be honest, I'm not sure that I do either. It's a very black and white way of looking at things though. It's a very black and white way of looking at things though. Yes, exactly, that's why it is so interesting. Just saying goodbye and being a good person doesn't make you good. It's when you're good even when you don't have to be good that makes you good. I think that's what this quote means. I also think the quote is about making the right choices and not just good choices. Just saying goodbye and being a good person doesn't make you good. Yes, of course. It's about what you do, not about what you say. I agree. It's about the choices you make. I think it's also about making those choices even when you don't have to.
