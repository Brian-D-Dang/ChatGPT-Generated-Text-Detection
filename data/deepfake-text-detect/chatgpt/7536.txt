One possible counter-argument could be that while the freezer on bottom may offer easier access to the refrigerator section, it also requires more bending down to access the freezer, which can be difficult for some people, especially those with mobility issues or back problems. Additionally, the freezer on bottom may not be as energy-efficient as the freezer on top, as cold air naturally sinks and can escape more easily from the lower compartment, requiring more energy to maintain a consistent temperature. Therefore, the superiority of one arrangement over the other may depend on individual preferences and needs.
