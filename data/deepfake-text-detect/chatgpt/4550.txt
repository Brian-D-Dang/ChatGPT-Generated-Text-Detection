It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be freed from their captors and turned into pets to help them with differentiating between humans (at least that's what I'd want). The money they earn could then go towards bringing other species back to the wild. I'm not a big fan of people playing God either. In fact few years ago when my parents were visiting me in Germany for my birthday we found out about another family who had bought an elephant because one of its legs was deformed or something like this. They kept it as some kind of pet for almost 20 years until... well you know by now how it ended up. So I don't support captive breeding or keeping things just for fun. But even if all these good ideas are already implemented there will always be those idiotsfools somewhere else playing at this cruel game and killing off thousands upon thousands. Even though I personally feel really sad thinking about these poor creatures having such bad lives. Yes, we should stop doing stuff like that, but having a reason such as "because they're cute" isn't much of a softening effect on our hearts.
