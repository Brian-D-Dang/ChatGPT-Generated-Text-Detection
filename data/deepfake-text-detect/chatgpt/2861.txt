I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry christian reddit would think. Agreed! It's ridiculous how atheists are being treated on Reddit sometimes but it doesn't mean they can be dicks to Christians too
