I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry I understand your perspective. It's important that people have the freedom to practice their religion without fear of discrimination or persecution. It's possible to support gay marriage, abortion, and other progressive issues while also respecting people's right to have different beliefs and values. It's all about finding a balance between individual freedom and social responsibility.
