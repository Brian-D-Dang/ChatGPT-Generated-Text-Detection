While it is understandable that some may perceive this phrase as disrespectful towards elders, it is important to note that the phrase itself is not inherently derogatory towards any particular age group. The notion that respect must be earned is a fundamental aspect of mature communication and healthy relationships. It encourages individuals to value the actions and contributions of others, rather than simply holding them in esteem based on their age or status. By recognizing the importance of earning respect, younger individuals are actually demonstrating a level of maturity and thoughtfulness, rather than simply trying to undermine their elders. Furthermore, it is important to remember that respect is a two-way street, and elders should also strive to earn the respect of younger generations by valuing their beliefs and ideas.
