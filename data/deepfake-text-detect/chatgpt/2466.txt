New here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong. Before I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal experience but maybe some insight can be provided on the subject (I hope). The fact that you need something like opendota or even the new matchmaking system in place just speaks volumes about how bad things got with DotA 1. The game was a lot better when all dotabuff had were hero stats which are now being updated manually by fansites because valve doesn't give 2 fucks anymore (compare it to HoN where there's always an update every week)
