I just read this [article] stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that people black, white, or any other minority experience high rates of unemployment because of the amount of work they do in their fields (and how little they actually accomplish). If you think those aren't stats then you are probably right.
