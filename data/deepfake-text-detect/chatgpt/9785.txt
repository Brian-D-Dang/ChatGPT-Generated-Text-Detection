I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. It is understandable that you feel strongly about the GOP's stances on social issues. However, if you are primarily concerned about improving access to contraceptives for medical reasons, it may be worthwhile to consider other options. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes a provision that requires health insurance plans to cover all FDA-approved forms of contraception without co-pays or other out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, many states have adopted Medicaid expansion, which has increased access to contraception for low-income individuals. Finally, there are numerous organizations that provide free or reduced-cost contraception, such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America. It may be worth considering these options to help ensure that you have access to the contraceptives you need.
