There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man who walks down the street with his genitals hanging out?). Our society has come far enough that we can treat our fellow citizens as human beings instead of stereotypes or specimens to keep us amused.' I'm sorry but I'd say this guy was pretty darn well behaved compared to many areas where women are much more likely than men to show their genitals on purpose! Just because something you see doesn't meet YOUR standards does NOT make them indecent. Get over yourself lady - if he's got no problem then neither do YOU!!;-P
