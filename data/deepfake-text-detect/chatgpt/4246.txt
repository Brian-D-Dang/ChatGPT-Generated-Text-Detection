I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think knowledge works in science-when scientists find something interesting they try to work out what this might mean. A good example of this happens when scientists discover an important biological process or property and immediately start thinking about how it relates to other processes in the same region. This can only help progress the field since answering questions will lead to further discoveries - it also gives us some insight into the nature of our own theories on processes happening around us. However, there's still the problem of falsifying the result; eventually someone will come along who has better methods andor can replicate the experiment without any errors, but that person will be hard pressed to get funding for their research if they don't have a published paper to back up their theory. One way scientists go about addressing these problems is by carefully documenting all the experiments they conduct. Scientists often compare data from many different experiments with one another so that they know which experimental results are valid and those which aren't. One of the more common ways for people to do this sort of comparison involves using a program called R. For most people who want to learn about scientific experimentation, understanding scientific experiments begins at reading the summary of each experiment described above (which is essentially how you would actually perform the experiment). This allows them to see exactly what types of parameters and measurements were used in the actual experiment and whether the numbers reported on the results page reflect the true values obtained during the experiment. The next step after reading the summary of the experiment is learning more specific details about the experiment itself - how many participants participated, what conditions were used, and even how elements were measured. When these kinds of details are written down, they can be put together in a table that makes it easy to quickly access information related to the original experiment and thus helps make sure that the conclusions drawn in the summary are identical to those expected based on the data available. We usually refer to such tables as "conclusions tables" because we believe that no two findings should necessarily be significantly different unless changes occurred between them and most people tend to assume that once they read the conclusion table, they'll never need to look again except perhaps when the same type of experiment is performed again, like looking at video footage taken by a camera. So why would anyone bother with creating conclusion tables? Well, because just being able to point to a table containing all of the relevant conclusions does not provide enough detail to understand the experiment properly. To really get a feel for what happened during the experiment, you need to be able to observe both the experimental results and the analysis report itself, including all of the information necessary in order to gauge the validity of the experiment. That is, you must know what was done inside the lab, outside the lab, what the conditions were before and after the experiment, and what kind of equipment used in the experiment. In addition, you should clearly be able to determine the level of agreement among the conclusions reached in relation to the initial premise of your study. If you cannot assess how much agreement exists, then you may conclude that the conclusion table is useless and simply discard it. These are just some of the reasons that scientists write their fundamental studies into conclusion tables. As yet another tool for assessing uncertainty, end-to-end scientific experiment comparisons allow researchers to evaluate how well they agree with underlying assumptions within particular hypotheses. Needless to say, this helps them figure out how strong the evidence for their hypotheses actually is and increase their confidence in their results. So now for the fun part... On completion of basic experiments, each researcher prepares an independent set of conclusions: conclusions that stand alone and contain no implications for the rest of the literature, or a few simple statements about the results of the experiment. An example of an independent set of conclusions might be 'the concentrations of proteins found in pitcher plants seems to correlate well with concentration of the plant hormones involved in regulating growth'. This is a straightforward statement that says nothing else beyond the specifics of the experiment itself. There are many examples of independent sets of conclusions being created by researchers at universities across the world. It is typically possible to create these conclusions using standard statistical techniques such as regression analyses and generalized estimating equations (GEE), although we won't talk too much about GEE here since it is beyond my scope. What is important to note about independent sets of conclusions is that they are not meant to be the definitive answer to every question you ask about the experiments themselves, though they do leave plenty of room for interpretation and therefore can be used to guide future analysis of the experiment (ies) being conducted. Let me give you an example of this. Suppose you had a bunch of subjects lined up, examining various objects. You wanted to measure the distance traveled by each object, so you could use this information to extrapolate how far away some animals seemed to run compared to others.
