First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways aren't always our ways (with very few exceptions). I have an exceptionally intelligent dog and he's also the most stubborn son-of-a-bitch you've ever met in your life! He'll do what I want him to when it suits his needs - or if food is involved...if there isn't a lot at stake then we might as well be talking about dealing with another human being on that level. In fact, from my perspective every other living creature thinks exactly like dogs think because that IS how humans work too! We operate pretty much for no reason whatsoever beyond selfish motives except where stated otherwise. The only thing that changes between species is whether those motivations get acted upon by fearlove or whatever else drives us. If that were truly different than all animals would act differently toward eachother based off instinct alone since similar circumstances exist everywhere across the board so why wouldn't one animal react more aggressively against another? Again, They don't! It doesn't mean everything has been solved according to some blueprint though because reality certainly does intervene sometimes especially in nature itself which seems arbitrary enough even without considering manmade laws put into place over time. That said, let me go back to waterfowl hunting. If ducks flew away immediately after seeing you or sensing danger instead of just floating around looking confusedly up while quacking inquisitively before flying off again they'd probably live forever despite getting shot often lol Just saying.....you can see where I'm going right?? Superstition comes from somewhere deep inside ourselves regardless who tells somebody "You need something special to hunt" vs. "It dosent matter." Either way someone feels better telling themselves its got nothing to do with them directly either consciously through religion etc., subconsciously via self defense mechanisms such as denial resulting out of guilt leading to many problems today....or both!! Here's proof: nentry532873" Unfortunately however these superstitions and beliefs continue throughout society." Here's 2 related links from my experience studying philosophy and understanding intentionally or unintentionally formed belief systems behind almost any phenomena imaginable:"Why Do People Believe Weird Things?" Superstition By Any Other Name": Now onto actual stalking tips. Pictures are key obviously although timing counts bigtime along with location selection vs others possibilities assuming a walk out blind type setup. Overcast days help tremendously imo due to shade available during duck flight path times plus lower light levels overall compared to sunny skies making lowlight picture taking easier. When shooting sporting clays or skeet make sure you have plenty of extra ammo sitting nearby should anything happen. This goes double whenever using shotguns with multiple chokes holding lots of shells cuz chances increase drastically towards needing additional shots per kill attempt anyway depending on conditions, distance traveled prior to impact (especially apparent with shotgun slugs), wind direction strength and variety of birds encountered within given scenario. You needn't shoot all five rounds held open choke unless absolutely necessary, consider using semi auto mode until close range possible if needed. Having several types of shotgun shells handy will allow changing rapidly among various loadings dependent on factors noted above. Pay attention closely to patterns of connections made between fired rounds versus lead positions indicating kills already scored. Take notes carefully paying attention to distances required per successful hit including bird size comparisons. Consider bringing binoculars wshooting glasses for distant spotting purposes. Using field dressing gear saves valuable preparation time whether freezing weather must be expected or not. Lining wings helps prevent further damage done to meat in case wing gets wet somehow causing subsequent death. Make certain decoys face southward facing specific directions pointing in opposite directions for added realism flushing capability benefits. Check position frequently ensuring to adapt accordingly once opportunities arise. Have patience allowing situation surrounding your stand opportunity to unfold naturally rather than forcing matters. Think ahead regarding potential obstacles coming your way keeping options open as far forward planning concerned yet maintaining flexibility of movement focusing squarely on present situation unfolding b4 moving next step onward. My most memorable hunts involve extended periods spent waiting patiently watching surroundings for present situations developing giving myself ample time prepare mentally b4 committing fully to follow thru. Sometimes stealthy setting up takes hours whereas quick set ups typically produce less effective results in terms of numbers harvested. Use suitable scents including ones native to local area woods providing camouflage scent cover of equal quality provided by clothing worn underneath jacket sleeves and legs near ankles bearing high contrast colors vs background ground foliage used heavily elsewhere in outfit.
