One counter-argument to this opinion might be that while Reddit-style forums allow for a more diverse range of topics and discussions, they can also become overwhelming and difficult to navigate. The structure of a single thread forum, on the other hand, allows for more focused and organized conversations. Additionally, single thread forums often have a tighter-knit community and allow for more in-depth discussions on specific topics, whereas Reddit-style forums can be more superficial and focused on upvotes rather than quality of discussion. Ultimately, the best forum structure depends on the specific goals and needs of the community using it.
