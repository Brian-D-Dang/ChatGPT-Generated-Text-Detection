First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and there is a cost associated with incarcerating people which does not justify what we get in return for locking them up-especially when you consider how expensive college tuition has become over time compared to inflation. Secondarily - if someone wants to kill another person they will find an opportunity regardless whether or not any law exists against murdermanslaughter; however brutalizing people who have committed only non-violent misdemeanors can be seen as more "just" on some level because 1) at least these criminals were punished by doing something other than serving jailtime 2) incarceration serves enforcement purposes 3) education benefits SarcasticX Poetry reading? Does he read out loud from his writing pad like the comic books do? Or maybe just stutter before each line so everyone thinks its poetry?? Either way, sounds pretty painful...Have fun!
