I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter. My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy or apathetic to do so themselves and need a push in that direction (which could come from signing them). Doing this I hope would reduce both voter fraud AND people NOT voting because no one signed them up either way it's better than nothing right? If we were to require IDs then manymost wouldn't bother showing their ID period and instead just act like complete assholes when asked for proof once at the ballot box. We should also abolish early voting altogether since its been shown time after time over the last decade that it increases turnout by a very tiny amount while allowing massive amounts of fraudulent votes which leads me to believe that early voting benefits Democrats more often while election day voter fraud tends to benefit Republicans. It isn't about how long people are willing to wait in line; its all about whether those voters can get away with it. Early voting should only apply to military personnel deployed overseas as well IMO. Its ridiculous our government thinks Americans abroad deserve less rights than citizens back home who might not even show up for work due to lack of faith in elections...wait.. what??? Anyways.... The above being said though, yes, my main concern here remains voter registrationID. We've allowed these things into areas where there typically aren't any, simply out of convenience but now we're seeing lots more shenanigans happen and I'm concerned with letting it continue without addressing basic safeguards surrounding it. This IS why Trump won he was able to stump Hilary supporters into thinking she had already won before anyone got to vote in several states! What happens when those same types of issues arise under new leadership? Who knows? But I know we shouldn't take chances by making excuses (like "its always happened" despite evidence otherwise) nor should we allow anything remotely similar to occur again!
