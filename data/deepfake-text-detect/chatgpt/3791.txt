Being transgender and wanting surgeryhormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think your parents are out of line if they don't buy into this I'm sorry but it's not my job to convince someone else how they should live their life (and in case nobody reads the other comments: No, my parents do believe trans people can be happily married and have happy lives just like everyone else.) And even though I know it sounds really lame, I actually get dysphoria sometimes, which doesn't mean I want surgery at all. But thank you for taking the time to read:)
