In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn't work that way and so we have to deal (or not) by the information provided us... But I'm pretty sure your puzzle was put into some sort or order at one point! That's why there are only three pieces for each shape - because they're all supposed go around 3 times along its own circle before being joined up again where their centers meet; like this: So if someone is missing any piece (s), then something isn't right about how things were originally made... which means either additional assembly instructions need added OR perhaps an error message needs generated?
