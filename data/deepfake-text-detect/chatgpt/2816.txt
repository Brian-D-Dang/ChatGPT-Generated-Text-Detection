Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and it makes me feel bad to constantly compare the two in my head because they're both horrible things for anyone involved (in this case a woman). But can someone help make sense of why one tends to be more "acceptable" than another? I think you should consider looking at pictures of people who were raped as children or adults and see if your perceptions shift once you put faces on them. It might give you some perspective.
