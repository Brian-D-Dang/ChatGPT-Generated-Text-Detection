I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with the fact that there is no physical benefit at all from consuming pork or chicken. Over 200 different studies have been conducted and over half of them showed a positive effect when you consume more plant protein than animal proteins in your diet. More recently, some other research has shown that these increased levels of healthy fat can help us live longer - not just by increasing our overall lifespan but also reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides. This is important news for people who are trying to improve their diets while living healthier lives through better health outcomes," says study author Moya Goodfellow-Meadows, PhD Candidate at the University of Bath.
