Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. That means no flying from Washington, D.C. to New York, or from Los Angeles to San Diego, unless you are on a US airline. In recent years, the Department of Transportation has eased restrictions on foreign airlines, so that they can operate more domestic routes. For example, from 2004 to 2008, the DOT allowed the Japanese airline ANA to fly between New York and Los Angeles, even though the airline is based in Japan. The DOT is currently considering whether to allow JetBlue to fly from New York to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Because airlines are licensed by the DOT, the decision to allow them to fly domestic routes is made by the DOT itself. The DOT is currently accepting comments on this issue, until January 13, 2011.
