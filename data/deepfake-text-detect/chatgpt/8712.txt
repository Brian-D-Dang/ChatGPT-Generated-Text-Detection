First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue itself. I agree that it's a bad idea to walk around without knowing what you're gonna be doing and how much space you'll have in your car since everyone wants exactly the same things. Hell most people would just take a quick photo and leave.
