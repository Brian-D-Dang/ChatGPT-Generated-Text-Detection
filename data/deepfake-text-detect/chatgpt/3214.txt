It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be given proper care and medical attention in zoos. Zoos also provide educational opportunities for people to learn about different animal species and their natural habitats. Additionally, some zoos participate in breeding and conservation programs to help preserve endangered species. However, it's important for zoos to prioritize the well-being of the animals and ensure that they have enough space, proper nutrition and enrichment activities to avoid stress and boredom. It's also important to ensure that the animals are treated with respect and dignity, and not exploited for entertainment purposes. Overall, zoos can be ethically justified if they are operated responsibly with the welfare of the animals as the top priority.
