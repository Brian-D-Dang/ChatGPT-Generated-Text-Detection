Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, are we as women and girls not doing the same for our elected officials? We need them to represent us in Washington D.C., but how can they if no one knows what issues matter most to young people like yourself?" Ayla: "I appreciate your question because there is a common misconception among those of my generation (millennials) regarding politics - namely, many believe you have to be old enough to vote before getting involved with political advocacy." "The fact is," Ayla continued, "there's nothing stopping millennials from registering to vote at age 17! It may seem daunting now, especially considering all of the wild changes going on right under President Trump's nosebut the sooner each American takes ownership over their government through voting, the better chance this country will see lasting change!" This was another good reminder not just for me personally; though, also anyone reading these words who feels disenfranchised by today's so-called 'leadership.' In addition to speaking up when candidates aren't being held accountable for breaking promises made during campaigns...andor policies enacted after assuming office don't align with public opinion polls taken prior.....it would probably behoove every eligible citizen to get registered to vote ASAP too.
