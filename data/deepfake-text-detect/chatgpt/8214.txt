I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter. My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy or busydistracted and won't bother voting in any of them (and then it's just a waste). If I were making this decision based solely off what was going around me at that moment though... ...because we all know who Kanye West voted for..winks.
