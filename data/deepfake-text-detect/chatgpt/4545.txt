Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than any other. In reality, we are all human beings and every person matters for this world; not because of their 'country' or whatever but as a whole being which has its own value. For a long time I have been feeling like Britain was becoming increasingly self-contained and the amount of Britons who do feel proud about Britishness while also recognising it's faults grows smaller by the day. The recent referendum result shows that Brits aren't entirely united on how much we want to be an independent nation anymore. It wasn't until recently that I realised why: We're afraid of losing our identity if we become too multicultural. That is probably one reason why you see people going out of their way to avoid talking about so called "British values." Everybody knows what those are but nobody says anything. You can say you don't care about immigration but then again you might get labelled racist etc - depending on your political views anyway. Not saying there is no racism at all within Britain but I find many Bigots use it as an excuse since everybody else does. This is somewhat true. If someone criticises something from an ethnic minority point of view, chances are heshe will come under attack from other minorities accusing himher of racism. This leads to two things: A lot of people go silent when criticised and some jump into defending ethnicity instead of listening to eachother. For example, just check most of these comments below! The bottom line is though that in order to survive, everyone needs outside immigrants aka non white Europeans (I am European). There seems to be quite a fear of letting others live here. And let me tell you, Europe isn't exactly safe place to visit either with anti-white sentiments everywhere as well as Islamic terrorism. So yes, I think nationalism is very wrong especially in western countries where racial superpositions already exist. As for the question itself, my answer would definitely depend on whether I consider myself to be black African, middle easterner or european. My family comes mostly from North Africa but I grew up in South West London. All three of us share similar features (with difference between us in skin colour mainly...but also accentuation and hair texture) therefore I guess I could call myself panafrican? I'd prefer to identify myself as such rather than just afrocentrist but I'm still young:P. But as for now I'll stick to panafrican and hopefully one day maybe Afrocentrist as well. Based on personal experience I've noticed that Black Africans tend to belong together whereas Middle Easterners often seem separate. One thing worth mentioning however is that Middle Easterners don't look alike unlike Blacks. They may speak Arabic but even language varieties like Lebanese dialects don't appear identical to Iraqi ones. Of course apart from that I found Blacks to be fairly homogenous (in England..and i know lots of other places across the continent). Another issue I have with Western governments supporting Israel despite atrocities committed against Palestinians is how hypocritical they sound given that many Arabs perceive Jews as oppressors (for historical reasons) even before Zionism was established. But nevertheless I must admit that in this case blacks and whites needn't worry about Jewish rights nor should anyone else really give them priority over Palestinians. It depends on context. Is that man black Ethiopian or Nigerian? Does he eat chicken or turkey? What kind of music speaks from his lips? How old is he? Where did he grow up? Etc. Why try to make assumptions based solely on appearance? I mean it's common knowledge these days that Ethiopians love red wine....it's delicious!:) To add further proof of this fact, Ethiopian cultural influences have spread globally like wild fire among the youth culture worldwide. Who coincidentally happens to wear colourful clothes and listen to hip hoprap type songs (also known as bpm rap) popularised throughout Africa and beyond. Kudos for sociologists anthropologists et al. So some clarification needed on...what actually constitutes a panafrican community? Since the USA (or perhaps the UK?) doesn't recognise AfricaAfricans as citizens yet...is "panafrican" used as some sort of catchall term for anybody listed above? Are Black Americans included? Or are they classified separately merely because they are American Citizens??? Just curious...hopefully my previous posts weren't totally confusing lol No single term describes 100 of PanAfrican individuals. More accurately, groups such as "Black America" and "White America," describe persons representing specific subgroups within broader categories of Black and White respectively. These larger groupings include many heterogeneous PanAfrincal communities, including Hispanic Blacks (e.g., Jamaican Hispanics), Asian Blacks (e.g., Chinese Asians), Latino Whites (Mexicans Spaniards), Indian Indians (from India), Portuguese, with small intranar elast Terremenys jarastra arlastahdarnie otraster trZhewery complexperment
