Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good or better than any of America's excellent brick-oven pizzerias serving thin crusts or deep dish slices. But there are great frozen pies that taste like high end dried out cardboard - so don't order one if you're looking for an authentic dining experience... I've been putting together this list since 2011. The top 10 haven't changed much over time (with some exceptions) but I look forward to your comments and suggestions on additional choices. Please let me know which ones YOU think deserve inclusion. Also, I'm always trying new places and testing their offerings so please keep me posted when something special comes along! You may notice quite a few more frozen options now available online compared to just three years ago: It's easier to find what you want without having to leave home. But if you do have access to a brick oven you'll likely avoid them all and stay local instead. That said, the list reflects my personal judgment with about 20 due to research and 80 based on my own preferences and experiences eating many hundreds of types of pizzas at dozens of restaurants. Thanks go out to our friends at PizzaMolecule, who share most of these selections. Thank you also to those who shared their favorite frozen pies via Twitter - JWilbur Bakerfrozenpizza, especially Sean 'Ash' Ashcraft (seanashcraft). Looking ahead, we're working on expanding into other categories such as panini, pastas, calzones, etc., plus offering delivery within LA County. And yes, there will be another Frozen Pizzeria Cookbook coming soon, focused specifically on frozen pizza. Stay tuned - it should come out next springsummer 2016!!! Top 10 Best Frozen Hot Pies Fresca's Hawaiian Style Pork Chops The original Fresca's was founded by former employees of Papa John's before being later purchased by DiGiorno. They started producing this hot pie back in 1997 after moving production to California and gaining access to fresh ingredients including 100 percent pork meatloaf. While it took nearly two decades to debut, they finally brought it out west in 2013. Quality has remained consistently solid and the flavor remains bright throughout and slightly sweet on the edges. You'll feel the difference between fresca's and di giorgio's right away too. PISCIATO STYLE ALFREDO CHICKEN CASSEROLE This chicken alfredo casserole tastes so similar to real Italian Alfredo sauce that you'd swear someone put it inside a box. This version tastes like they used actual pasta noodles rather than whatever ship shape commercial product they use today. It might not have become popular until recently because Italian sausage wasn't readily available nationwide in supermarkets until well into the 90's still only found in northern parts of Italy where it originated centuries ago. CRUSTLESS CALIFORNIAN FISH TACOS VERDE WITH LIME RICE AND PEANUT BUTTER BAKLAVA CRUMBLE TOPPER SANDWICHES Crunchy rice pastry topped with peanut butter gives way to crispy fish tacos layered with tangy salsa verde and shredded white cheese. Looking for a dessert? Add on top Peanut Butter Baklava Cookies then skip straight to 11 - The Endangered Species Cookie Sandwich: Swiss Meringue Pie. At least make room for both though... CHILLIN' BBQ FRIZZIES While there were plenty of canned baked beans around during World War II, frozen versions didn't really take off til the 70's when Campbell Soup expanded sales and distribution across the country. Nowadays, almost every grocery store carries several brands including Friskie's, Reddi Wip, and Smucker's. Chillin' brand or its sister brand Frizzies produce freezer-fresh baked bean patties using natural foods ingredients and baking soda. Several flavors include classic red chili, maple bacon deluxe and barbecue. Personally, I prefer Frizzies Classic Bean Patties, but everyone can agree Fat Free Avocado Ranch Beans would probably win my vote. These packets easily double up as snacks or sides while camping or picnicking. Recipe Link My Review ] HOT DOGS Hot Dogs have arrived at Topps Field in Brooklyn.
