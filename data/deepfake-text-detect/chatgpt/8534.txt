I am a 23 year old male Indian American male. I have never held hands with a girl, been kissed, or obviously had sex. I have never even asked someone out on a date before but now that I realize more about my sexuality and what it means to be gay (and I'm off the hook) I can't help but wonder if I should "come out." My question is: Would I want to come out? I do see your point to the extent that you say that your friends are attracted to each other because they're not ashamed of their sexual orientation. However, you also state no need for friendships in order for relationships to work. You clearly mean that you would like to maintain intimacy with your partner by sharing what kind of person you are. If you were having platonic issues then you probably chose someone who would suit your needs. But as indicated above, the friendship aspect is very important. It's not just about reciprocity - I don't think you did anything wrong here. There is nothing wrong with being attracted to people who don't identify with your interests, culture, religion, ethnicity etc. You could certainly add some things to your life that make friends with you however they arent supposed to be. What i dont understand is why you feel attraction towards women when they sleep around together and sleep with them. Is there something wrong with that? from the title: The reason for this, im afraid, is that women tend to sleep with guys they know very well. It seems ridiculous to me that men may choose partners that they really know little about. I still think that the idea of being sexually attracted to girls is a valid one-on-one thing. So, why should men choose women over boys? This is another issue which comes up every time we hear about people going through "bad" marriages.
