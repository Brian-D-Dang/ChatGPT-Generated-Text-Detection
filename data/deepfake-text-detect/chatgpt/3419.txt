Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions at heart. However, some people have taken the SJW movement to extreme levels, turning it into a toxic and divisive force. I believe that enforcing political correctness and social justice through shame and intimidation is not effective in fostering an inclusive and compassionate society. It's important to promote open dialogue, empathy, and understanding rather than cancel culture and dogmatic adherence to ideological purity. What are your thoughts on this?
