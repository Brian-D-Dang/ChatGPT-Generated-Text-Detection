While it is true that not everyone likes the taste of coffee and that some people may experience a placebo effect when drinking it, this does not undermine the fact that coffee has known physiological effects on the body. Caffeine, the primary active ingredient in coffee, is a stimulant that blocks the neurotransmitter adenosine, leading to increased alertness and improved cognitive function. Additionally, coffee has been linked to a lower risk of several diseases and conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the effects of coffee are negligible or that those who enjoy its taste are lying to themselves.
