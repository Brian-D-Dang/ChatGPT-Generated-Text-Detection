I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly firearms. This happened in an area where a gang member in his early 20s was shot multiple times by an officer, then later stabbed to death by a rival gang member eventually arrested by the department's Special Victims Unit. The shooter boasted that he had "a whole bunch" of friends with guns. That argument, however, doesn't hold water when you consider how many people over the years encounter criminals in their hometown or at an apartment complex as they walk through the streets. What about the number one reason for going to a gunfight? What if there are some sort of family-friendly neighborhood you're not aware of - especially one you live near? Would you spend time in this neighbourhood if you were injured in any way? Have you ever been to an altercation like this in your life? Let us know in the comments!
