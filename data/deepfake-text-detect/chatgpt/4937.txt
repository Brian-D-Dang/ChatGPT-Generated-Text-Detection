Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a reason.com offer where you can request that you ask for your money back after payment with your credit card information and it will take 6 weeks before the refund is processed and then give you the money back if nothing happened. That's awesome! Thanks for letting me know!
