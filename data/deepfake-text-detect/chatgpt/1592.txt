Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a little bit stilted and snotty. 2. The way that it looks in speech (saying "X" does look different from spelling out the word). 3. It sounds cooler when you say things like 'Xenophobe', 'Geeksploiter' or 'Emo-bro'. 4. Sometimes people just don't get what X means! It's time we stopped using this stupid abbreviation: A Latin prefix meaning "from beyond," referring to those who believe they have come up with something newi.e., are superior. Examples include "Zen Master," "Evolutionary Scientist," etc.which tend to be used by the well off and educated. This kind of thinking gets boring very fast because 99 of us will never live long enough to see an X become world famous...so it doesn't really matter if someone else comes along with a better idea someday! So I've decided instead to use my own version of an old insult against anyone who wears glassesthe "gap-mouth." Instead of focusing on how smart or cool someone may seem while wearing their spectacles, let me focus on how much less intelligentcool they actually appear compared to everyone else without them!
