In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals and exercise properly. Even though some animals are kept in cages they are better off than those animals kept in dirt floored cages in CAFOs. It is not good enough to say that animals in CAFOs are 'comfortable' because the majority are not comfortable and are suffering. Why would you say that, when the current debate is about how to produce meat in a more humane way? It is not good enough to say that animals in CAFOs are 'comfortable' because the majority are not comfortable and are suffering. I'm confused about this. If a calf is lying down and eating a ration of milk and grain (which it can access easily) and is surrounded by other cows, how could it be suffering? That's not to say that some CAFOs are not a problem. But the argument about suffering should be based on the specific conditions of each farm, not the generic term "factory farming" If you look at the video of the pig farms in Denmark you will see that the sows are kept in very small cages, they can barely move.

Sorry, I have just realised that we are actually talking about the same thing. I should have said that the majority of cows kept in CAFOs are not comfortable and are suffering and you can see that in the videos of cows being transported and the ones that have been penned up for too long. I am not entirely sure what the OP means by this. It doesn't seem to be a direct quote from the video. And what makes you think that the piglets in the video you linked to are suffering? Yes, they are a bit more crowded than they should be, but what do you think is the point of the video? Sorry, I have just realised that we are actually talking about the same thing.

Because the piglets are penned up for too long. They are also not fed properly. I have also just seen the video of pigs being transported. It is shocking. The pigs have no space to move and the ones that are not lying down are trying to stand up. They are also not fed properly and they look emaciated. If they were fed properly then they would be much thicker and fatter than they are. The piglets in the video are not in cages. They are in cages and they are being fed the wrong diet. You can see that they are not happy and are not getting enough exercise. Why would you say that, when the current debate is about how to produce meat in a more humane way?
