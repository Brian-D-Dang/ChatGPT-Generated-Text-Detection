EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People who use them as such either don't understand what an actual trigger is or think themselves above the need for certain accommodations. Exactly! I get so annoyed when someone talks about "trigger warning" and it's really just like, deal with your bullshit emotions instead of trying to have everyone else cater to you.
