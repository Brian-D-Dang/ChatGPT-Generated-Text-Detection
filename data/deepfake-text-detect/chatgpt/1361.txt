EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People who use them only do so because it's easier than trying to think about what makes something uncomfortable and sad, then just making up some kind of trigger for that feeling.
