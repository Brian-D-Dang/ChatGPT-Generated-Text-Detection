I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. My question is, how can you distill your preferences in this field? For instance: what makes a good cup or two at Starbucks acceptable and tolerable versus an amazing experience that leaves one craving more?? How does someone get past all those bitter beans with questionable origins on their palate so they don't have any expectations going into it it's just hot water!? Furthermore... there are people who prefer drip-style coffees over espresso! Both versions actually exist because we're talking about taste buds here as opposed being strictly fussy professionals - amateurs should be able too enjoy both if possible without feeling guilty:) Is enjoyment purely based off personal likesdislikess even when once again tasting something objectively great from another person?! To quote Doug Adams "The difference between us may not necessarily lie only within our individual palates [sic], rather than differing degrees along some dimension which must remain unquantifiable." It seems impossible no matter where these talks go considering everyone has different experiences associated wth each brand type etc..but perhaps understanding why would help shed light upon them somehow!! Any thoughts appreciated! Thanks folks:D:)
