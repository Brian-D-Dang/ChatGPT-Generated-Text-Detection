First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised. Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, and any discomfort felt is purely physical. As for the other questions: if you're asking about circumcision "off the table," then no, you're never going to be able to get a partial penisectomy since they will have to remove the whole thing. I'm more curious about religion and cultural norms surrounding this decision in modern times. Is there ever pressure from parents or peers present?
