Countries need children in order to sustain themselves, without a younger generation the country will not advance and will not be able to sustain itself. Elderly will not be able to care for healthy teenagers In this age group of adults we have the responsibility of providing children with the necessary tools so that they can educate themselves on their own initiative by studying at home rather than having to attend school. The outlook is bleak. As many as one million new refugees are expected to arrive every month until 2016 when Syria's civil war ends according to UNHCR chief Peter Maurer. This means that millions more people will flee the violence in the Middle East and North Africa. And these numbers won't stop rising unless there's something done about it now. There is no doubt that the refugee crisis is a humanitarian disaster, but it's also becoming an economic problem. It could cost the global economy up to 1 trillion over all if it continues unchecked, according to Ciaran Murphy, director of international development policy at Chatham House UK. A recent study conducted by the World Bank found that just 14 percent of the estimated 4.8 billion displaced people worldwide were living within the borders of countries where job opportunities exist - meaning most are forced into squalid camps or informal settlements, unable to work or access education. Even worse, young people who leave these camps often end up being preyed upon by gangs and sometimes go missing altogether. According to Sound-out initiative, 90 percent of unaccompanied minors get involved in crime after leaving the camp. They become vulnerable because they lack social skills, training or social support networks, making them easy targets. Our best hope lies in finding ways to avoid any further generations of displacement. We must find solutions to tackle poverty and ensure that those who are already marginalized receive equal rights regardless of their race, sex, religion or origin - especially women, children, older persons and people with disabilities. Young people across Europe stand ready to help, starting next week with the launch of our youth leadership programme 'Bridges'. Through Bridges, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds will use creative arts and workshops to foster innovation, creativity and resilience among their peers. This year, we want you to join us! Take part in solving social problems through activities such as art therapy sessions, sports events and mentoring, but don't forget to bring your friends along too! We'll even throw you a party afterwards (for free)! So, make sure you sign up before 31 August 2012 - this short course only lasts 5 days and features two practical projects to implement in your community to address problems that affect young people today: Focusing on the work of Dr John Holt and his team at Oxford University, this talk explores the history and present state of mental health research around the world. The focus is first on how early 20th century scientists looked at mental illness (it was called "mental disease" back then), but gradually began researching other illnesses like the flu and tuberculosis. What followed was a long history of research funding, epidemiological studies and scientific conferences that brought together some of the leading minds in psychiatry, psychology, biology and medicine in order to develop better treatments. Today, the understanding of mental illness has changed enormously since the early 1900's. But what happens to this knowledge? How does science protect against new diseases coming out, how do researchers move forward using advances in technology and how do clinicians learn from each other? These questions are explored. If you're interested in learning more about mental health research, whether through work experience, volunteering or attending lectures, then come along to this session. You may be surprised by what you hear! For health professionals looking for a change of direction in clinical practice, this workshop looks at the latest developments in evidence-based practice; case studies that show how current evidence supports advice given in NHS England Guidances; information that can guide clinicians and patients with respect to the need for individualized assessment and treatment planning (including psychotherapy); and how information is integrated into clinical decision making decisions. These presentations are great examples of how evidence based practice works in practice; encouraging conversations between healthcare professionals who share similar values around patient safety and high quality care. We invite healthcare professionals working in primary care, acute hospitals, dentistry or mental healthcare settings to attend either in-person or online. Please contact Laura Edwards at or 8658 for more details on the event. How much time should I spend doing my bit to make sure everyone gets a decent start to life as well as the future? Learning to think differently about caring and wellbeing might sound simple enough, just a few hours spent thinking about what you can do. However, it doesn't always feel quite so simple when trying to plan and manage change for yourself, which is why this inspiring talk aims to give you a practical framework for thinking about care and wellbeing in your career and family life.
