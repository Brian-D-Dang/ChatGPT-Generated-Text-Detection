Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and just got hisher license revoked for driving while intoxicated twice this year (1160 days). He has been arrested at least 10 times since 2006 and the last time he was charged with any crime other than DWI was 2009! Now we need someone who can drive over 4 hours away from home that night so they will make it before midnight. The person drives fast enough to reach their destination by 1am but not too fast or risk getting pulled over en route. That would take about 6 hours if traveling quickly which I doubt your friend could do on foot going 50 mph through traffic let alone walking very quickly...but you never know. You have 3 hour window where you must get them back safely without being caught doing anything wrong. What should you do? Give up 25 an hour even though my buddy may not pay me anyway because what am I supposed to say "Sorry dude, im out of gas money"? Answer: Say yes, tell him its ok; whatever works as long as he makes it there safe...your buddy better be able to walk the rest of the way himself, otherwise call 911 again when he gets there...you are already holding all you pieces together and now your buddy's life hangs in the balance!
