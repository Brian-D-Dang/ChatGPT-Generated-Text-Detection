To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting there (I'm only 13), a teacher at my old middle school told me about it and how students who are "bad test takers" or don't perform well in standard tests may be penalized for not meeting these new requirements. Is this true? What do you think of the idea behind common core? Do you find yourself agreeing with the goals of Common Core and what they want to accomplish? Or disagreeing with them entirely? Please let us know!
