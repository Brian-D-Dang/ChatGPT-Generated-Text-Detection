Many people would disagree with the opinion that dogs are not your friends. Dogs have been bred for centuries to be companion animals and many people consider them to be their best friends. They offer unconditional love, loyalty, and are always happy to see you. Dogs have been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, reducing stress and anxiety. They also provide comfort and companionship, particularly for people who live alone. In fact, many dogs are trained as emotional support animals, providing therapeutic benefits to their owners. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that dogs are not your friends.
