I'm planning to vote for Bernie in the primaries but, if Hillary gets the nomination, I'll still vote for her in the general - I will do anything in my power to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president. Although I disagree with him on many issues, I've actually been quite impressed by how mature and rational Bernie has been during this campaign. He's still very idealistic but, unlike the young radicals that he recruited, he's learned how to work within the system to advance his causes. Bernie Sanders will never be president. So, please, don't vote for him in the primaries, unless you want to help him lose the general election. If you want to help Bernie, here's how you can best help him: 1) Encourage Hillary Clinton to keep many of the progressive policies that she has proposed during this campaign and to implement many of the ideas that Bernie Sanders has proposed. 2) Encourage Hillary Clinton to select Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. 3) Continue to make sure that the Democratic Party continues to adopt progressive policies. I'm afraid that the Democratic establishment will not listen to me, but I am begging them to listen to you. And if they don't listen to you, and they don't listen to me, then they will listen to Bernie Sanders. Please post your thoughts and your comments below.

David Axelrod Everybody knows it. The Dems have turned into a bunch of croney-loving, bought-and-paid-for, "too-big-to-fail" corporatists. I have to disagree with you on this one. I want Bernie to win because he's the only one with the courage to challenge the status quo. I'll be the first to admit that he's not the most articulate man around, but he has the courage of his convictions. He's a good man and the world needs more good people in it. I'm not saying that Hillary doesn't have many good ideas that I agree with. I'm just saying that Bernie Sanders should be the nominee. I like Bernie Sanders' passion and energy, but I want Hillary Clinton to be the nominee. Bernie should be the VP. He's a very smart man and he'd do an excellent job of running the country. Hillary Clinton has more experience and is more pragmatic. I'm open to a more progressive Congress, but Hillary Clinton is the best chance we have to beat Donald Trump. I want Bernie to win the nomination, but I want Hillary to win the general. Bernie Sanders should not be VP because he's not willing to concede. I agree. I think he's too arrogant to be a VP. I like Hillary, but she has too much baggage and she's too untrustworthy. I'm not saying that I like Hillary Clinton better than Bernie Sanders. I'm saying that I think that she's the best choice to beat Donald Trump. I think that Bernie Sanders would be a great president. I just don't think that he can win the general election.
