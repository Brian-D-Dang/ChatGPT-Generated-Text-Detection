Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as actual news, it's not too bad. However, when you consider the fact that the majority of user-generated content isn't real news but rather memes, quizzes, listsicles (aka low quality viral media), etc., where does this leave Buzzfeed? It leaves them somewhere between happy users and corporate profit with no ethical boundaries whatsoever.
