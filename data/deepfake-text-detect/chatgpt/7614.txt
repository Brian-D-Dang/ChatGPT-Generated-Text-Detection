While it is true that there are no clear-cut moral frameworks that permit one and condemn the other, it is important to consider the fact that humans have evolved in such a way that we are naturally inclined to have sex with other humans and not animals, while the same can't be said for eating meat. Moreover, it is widely accepted that having sex with animals is harmful and can cause significant physical and psychological damage to the animals involved, while not everyone believes that consuming meat is inherently harmful or wrong. In other words, while there may not be a moral framework that specifically prohibits one and permits the other, the arguments against having sex with animals are much stronger and compelling than the arguments against consuming meat, which is why the two are not necessarily equivalent.
