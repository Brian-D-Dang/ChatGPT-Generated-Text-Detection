As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not something I would do, but then again, I am not in the medical field... I agree with you and I'm sure many others agree as well (some might disagree).. But what about the "best" way to spend them? Who comes out better at the end when they are dead vs if they live longer?
