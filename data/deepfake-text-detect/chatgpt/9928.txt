Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. This knowledge has made me very aware of the importance of standing up for justice and fighting against discrimination of any kind. I have always been an advocate for equality and have worked to create a more inclusive society. My Jewish identity has also instilled in me a strong sense of community, which I strive to nurture by participating in Jewish organizations, volunteering, and supporting causes that impact Jews both at home and abroad.
