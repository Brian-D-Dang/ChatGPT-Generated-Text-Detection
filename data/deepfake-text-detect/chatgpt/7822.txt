While it's understandable to be bothered by disruptions during a movie, it's important to be compassionate and considerate towards others. For someone who is hard of hearing or deaf, going to the movies can be an important and valuable experience. It's unfair to deny them the opportunity to participate in something that is enjoyed by so many. Additionally, it's possible that the child and their family may not have had a full understanding of how their behavior impacted others. Rather than jumping to the conclusion of kicking them out, it may have been more helpful to approach the situation with kindness and understanding, potentially offering assistance or accommodations to make the experience better for everyone involved.
