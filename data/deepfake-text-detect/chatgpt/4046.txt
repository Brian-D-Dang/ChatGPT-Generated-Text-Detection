NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, while stabilized units are allowed to increase in value over time (as they usually do). The problem with rent control is only 3 of the market takes advantage of it so its not a very effective way to limit rents. Also tenants rights advocates have argued against it because you can get evicted even when its below market rate. Rent stabilized units still aren't as affordable as other apartments because there's no cap on how much they can go up but since its a government regulated market you cannot price your unit out of existence without a lot of risk
