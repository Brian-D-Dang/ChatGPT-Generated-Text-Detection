As can be seen in [this image] , in most places in the U.S. (and maybe elsewhere that right-on-red is allowed?), it is legal to turn right on red from a green light, and contrariwise at stop signs or intersections where they are not permitted. I don't know if this practice has any precedence other than here, but there's no law against doing this; neither does anybody seem to mind although I do see some drivers who have been trained to stay completely left of center when turning right on red, which probably makes them more dangerous for the rest of us. And you certainly aren't supposed to jump ahead of the cars behind you by making yourself an obstacle. So why? Is this just another example of human nature proving itself yet again as both simple and complex? It seems like we'd all rather get somewhere and hit something instead! But then what would the world come to.......unless perhaps we could build our way out... (Small note: I also thought about posting this at reddit.comraskscience but wasn't sure how science related such a question.)
