So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor culture! So in a sense reverse discrimination (if it exists) is the same as being discriminated based on your race? I know that's probably wrong but how else can we explain why there are no racial quotas for certain jobs or positions at universities etc.? Interestingly enough most people who oppose affirmative action seem to be Caucasian males - which makes me wonder where they got such an idea from... But back onto topic.. so basically all cultures have been appropriated by Caucausians since forever right? This would mean each individual has 'discriminated' themselves against other races RIght?? Now if you're saying some groups still haven't accepted whites into them then fine; maybe those cultural practices were never intended towards caucasusian immigrantsimigrants afterall:p The point here though isn't really important anyways - my question was more related specifically with understanding these concepts regarding 'the colour line'. Also another quick example- when talking abuot Native Americans having own reservations like Blacks do (which must've existed before colonization obviously), i thought well yes indeed... masses had already moved away due too land expansions colonialism....but now looking further up north, many Alaskan natives consider Russians illegal occupants even tho technically Russia holds claim over Alaska thru purchase made during WW2. Also Irish nationalists resent British occupation much farther than anyone could ever feel Usa did anything bad.....so yeah....i don think "appropriate" means equal rights between different peoples living within one nation state.....maybe its just better understood through history rather contextually speaking......say India gets independence first followed closely b 4 USA itself became independent..and countries without historical links start getting colonies ...then perhaps our reasoning might make little bit sence......just kinda curious!
