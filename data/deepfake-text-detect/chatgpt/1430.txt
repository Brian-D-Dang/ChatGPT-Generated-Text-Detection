I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to make a reaction like this. Is there any reason why two unetified substances would react together? Not necessarily uncommon for simple chemical reactions (like sodium cyanide potassium hydroxide) - you can get some interesting mixtures of compounds if both react at high enough temperatures.
