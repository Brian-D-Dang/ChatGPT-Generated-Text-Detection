I'm not a cop hater. I like to think I'm a relatively reasonable person but I'm honestly not even 100 sure how I really feel with the constant barrage of negative news and events related to law enforcement. It can be overwhelming and difficult to form a clear opinion. It's important to stay informed and educate ourselves on both sides of the issue before forming a solid stance. We also have to acknowledge that not all police officers are the same and there are certainly those who are dedicated to serving and protecting their communities with integrity and respect. At the same time, it's important to address and criticize systematic issues within law enforcement and work towards accountability and reform. It's all about finding a balance and striving for progress towards a more just society.
