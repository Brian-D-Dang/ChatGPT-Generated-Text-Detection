While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to be president. To win the presidency you need to first get elected in your state (or city) district; a majority of voters there then vote for their preferred candidate (s). He has no such constituency here except for maybe Florida.
