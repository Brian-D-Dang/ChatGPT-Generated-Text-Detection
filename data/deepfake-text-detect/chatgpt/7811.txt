While it may seem reasonable to argue that variable tax is unfair or immoral, it is actually a necessary tool for progressive taxation. Progressive taxation is the notion that those who earn more should pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. Variable tax facilitates this idea, allowing for a graduated income tax that benefits those who earn less and reduces income inequality. Moreover, taxes are necessary to fund public goods and services, such as schools, hospitals, and infrastructure that benefit everyone, regardless of their income. Therefore, it is important to ensure that everyone pays their fair share through a variable tax system. Suggesting that variable tax is immoral or bad fails to recognize the important role it plays in promoting economic fairness and equality.
