A counter-argument to refute the opinion that there is no difference between believing you don't know how the universe came in to being and believing that God brought the universe in to being is that the two beliefs are fundamentally different. Believing that you don't know how the universe came in to being is an admission of ignorance and a willingness to explore different possibilities and theories. It is an acknowledgment that we don't have a complete understanding of the universe, and that there's still much more to learn. Believing that God brought the universe in to being, on the other hand, is a religious belief based on faith and a particular interpretation of scripture or religious texts. It involves accepting a certain set of beliefs without evidence or proof, and may not be consistent with scientific evidence or theories. Therefore, while both beliefs may offer answers to the question of how the universe came in to being, they are not equivalent, and it's important to understand the differences between them.
