I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I will give you an example: in high school everyone was convinced that my best friend would get married and have kids shortly after graduating. She graduated and went off for college. We began talking again when she returned home on leave. The talks were much more serious than before then; it felt like our friendship had been set back years, if not decades (she worked full time while going to school). Sometimes we talked about how things should go down but with no real plan of action as far as marriage plans or children are concerned. When she entered her second year at university I heard nothing new about her life except that her parents planned one day having grandchildren. It took me months just to gather information about where exactly she lived because nobody seemed interested enough to ask questions. They didn't even write letters anymore...but only because they couldn't find anyone willing to take them seriously any longer! Her father passed away recently and although he often complained about his daughter's lack of interest in him, something happened during those last days that made him change his mind quickly...maybe? He became so obsessed with finding out what "the right" decisions were for his family that people simply gave up trying to talk sense into him. My mother doesn't seem too worried yet though...as long as all the paperwork gets done properly she can always rely on being able to visit her supposed grandchild whenever she wants without bothering anybody else. That seems to be their primary concern these days anyway - filing papers instead of spending quality time together really isn't that big of a deal to some folks:
