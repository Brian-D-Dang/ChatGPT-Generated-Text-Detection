I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot if there is no immediate threat to life? Sometimes it was just for fun, but sometimes they do it seriously... They are not trying to kill anyone! (except criminals, of course)
