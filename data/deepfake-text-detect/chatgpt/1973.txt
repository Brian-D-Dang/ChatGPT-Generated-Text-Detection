I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly relations with the community they serve. A new video from Chief Johnson's Facebook page shows just that: "We are proud to partner up with 1st District neighbors in a show of support for our men women serving ToThePeople!" said Milwaukee Police Department on their Twitter account."As always thank you to those working hard and putting themselves at risk every day," wrote Whitefish Bay resident Mike Zwiebelman on his own twitter profile after seeing this interaction between Officer Wachendorf and Jacob Borge, a local musician."Thank you so very much! It is nice when positive things happen as well!!! I hope everyone has an amazing holiday season!!" responded Borge via email.
