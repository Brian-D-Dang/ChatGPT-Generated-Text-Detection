So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern economists were wrong about the oil price crisis in 2008. In 1998 Nelson Mandela was elected president of South Africa - a country that is still struggling with its apartheid past and which has been ruled by some very bad people during the last 70 years. That being said none of those people are currently running South Africa as they've already passed their 90th year. So it looks like our current economic leaders will leave office around 2035-2040, so I don't really consider them 'bad people'...
