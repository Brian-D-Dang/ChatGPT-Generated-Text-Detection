To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example; 1) Incest increases genetic disorders in offspring - who cares? Post-birth abortions for birth defects is a reality already anyway so if you can't afford to deal with an unwanted child (and many people don't want kids at all), just abort it after its born! No one should be allowed such luxuries as having children they didn't plan on! Bigots need not apply. My point here being this isn't really about genetics or health concerns anymore...its purely emotionalreligious now which means there's no reason NOT TO allow them to marry. If anything we'll get more tax money from these poor single moms coming into our country because thats what happens when women become pregnant by their brother.....they stay long term in America instead of moving back home like normal immigrants do....so make incest legal too while your at it so rich folks can adopt those babies raised in "incest" families rather than keeping them out of adoption and denying American citizens access to new life!! Bring ALL THE BABIES!!! lol..more revenue for us baby making machines D....just kidding but seriously...if legalization helps bring over babies without fathers then why not?? It doesn't matter where they come from right??? So legalize both:P. Not even gonna address AIDS either cuz frankly speaking once again that ISNT anyone else's business nor does it affect me personally so let em fuck each other up:). Forget my comments above about how grosswrongtrashy etc it may sound hahahaha, I honestly could care less! Now lets move onto sex between husbands and wives......yeah I know Im going off topic; But since everyone wants gay marriage legalized anyways WHY DONT WE JUST LEGALIZE SEX BETWEEN COUPLES AS LONG AS ITS CONSENTED?! THATS WHAT GAY MARRIAGE WOULD BE RIGHT???? You see what im getting at dont ya?? Heres another good analogy.........................................You wanna play monopoly? Well first you gotta agree on rules before playing right??? As far as i understand it gaaayyyyssss consented to sex meaning technically according to current laws its fair game!!;) lololol...but ok whatever lets stick with consenting adults only......wouldn't take much time to add consent clause to existing law..you're welcome gays AND straight couples;) See perfectly simple solution here; Seriously though........the real issue here was never legalizing gay mariage it always has and will continue to revolve around religion....which makes no sense whatsoever because most religions teach love thy neighbor yet homophobia still exists.......................I think religion needs 2 revisit some core values ASAP
