This one seems so obvious to me but I'll provide the basic points: It is a person's right to do whatever they want with their own body so long as its not against the law. But what if you don't like it or get fat? Some people can't help that, therefor we need laws against being cruel and taking away rights of others simply because you're unhappy about your situation.
