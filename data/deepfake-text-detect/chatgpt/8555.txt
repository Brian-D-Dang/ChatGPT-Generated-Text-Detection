To my knowledge there are no peer reviewed sources that link GMOs to any negative health effects. There is as much reason to believe genes manipulated in a lab are safe and effective than the potential harms of taking them on human consumption during the day when it's not important enough for me to make up my own mind about whether I want to eat their food or whether they should be stored in a freezer. The people who claim that they know how long it takes to grow plants but have never done any research to confirm this are either naive or completely ignorant to what science actually says, especially given the known risks associated with consuming foods containing certain chemicals. And if you really thought the search for "safe" organic foods was just an exercise in futility, you might turn off your computer screen and look at the pages filled with articles claiming to include GMO advice from experts in fields beyond natural sciences such as bioengineering, gene therapy, and biophysics. In fact, one of the most frequently asked questions of scientists asks why we don't use tissues from animals grown in nature (salmonella) instead? Why do some research studies emphasize what can and cannot be tested in animal tissue culture with little scientific basis? Look further back to see: But this is all very obvious. People who live in polluted environments likely aren't going to throw out fruit trees because of their food waste. We have been told by other societies that it will be fine to take a small amount of fruit per person, which can lead to extreme disease outbreaks like the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But now, in countries where climate change causes more severe outbreaks, agriculture is becoming an international threat; farmers are being forced to cut down their crops and endangering livestock and humans along with dairy cows. This has increased concerns among scientists over biodiversity loss, as well as the impact of agricultural practices on pollinators. It seems that even though our taste buds may crave the fruits and vegetables produced by vegetable farming, these things only serve to increase the risk of diseases that spread through the environment. The problem here is that these products cause harm to our reproductive system, making it harder for us to kill these harmful viruses. Not surprisingly the majority of respondents rate government intervention in this matter. However, many Americans do not think anything of confiscating their produce. If they did, farmers would find it easier to protect themselves against environmental hazards. Instead, their argument is that in order to keep farms free of harmful insects, plants must contain the necessary nutrients to be fertilized without damage to the soil, and thus avoid damaging production systems. As for not worrying about pesticides, of course, the researchers behind the current study suggest that pesticide makers need to reduce chemical exposure to family members and pets - including children. Environmentalists also point out that pesticide contamination increases "the likelihood of transmission between host hosts," since they use fewer chemicals - or less - than genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Regardless of that, creating accurate estimates of the possible adverse effects of pesticides on human beings and ecosystems remains an extremely difficult task. If the United States reaches its goal of limiting global pesticide supply, then the world will need to address the flaws in funding for wildlife conservation to prevent further pollution. That is, how does money become available for wildlife protection, leaving governments to fund and sustain large populations of wildlife species to benefit the general public? How does funding be made better so that research does not occur across borders on a regular basis, while keeping millions of endangered species out of the wild? A next step is to ban commercial purchases of pesticides used in agriculture, particularly those found in fishing nets. For example, bans on commercial use of insecticides, pesticides like weedkiller, and fungicide used in cosmetics, make it far too easy to build up toxic substances and access them to the communities that rely upon them. Allowing the sale and cultivation of chemicals in rural areas could limit the number and diversity of lands available to shoot fish, shoot insects, and hunt wild animals. Such attempts would starve natural resources away, wasting land to expand hunting and grazing, and leading to deforestation. These restrictions would ultimately result in fewer natural resources being harvested and shared equally amongst populations, unlike traditionally practiced practices that conserve biodiversity. It is time for the American public to remember that control of global warming isn't always possible, and it's definitely not impossible. The approach adopted by the Obama Administration last year is a conservative echo chamber that doesn't consider climate change to be a threat or a long term issue; rather, it emphasizes "how we manage our future - not how we act" and makes clear that letting states decide how to regulate their own destruction is the best way to ensure we don't come into conflict with each other. Too often, though, that approach does nothing to address the root cause of problems we face.
