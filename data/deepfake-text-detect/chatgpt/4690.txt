Bar soap is all you need. And you dont wash your hair at all, you just rinse it. Sometimes I use shampoo, maybe once in a month or two, if my hair starts looking dry (and not from the heat), but otherwise no one ever sees that stuff. A perfect first shower for someone who's never been to the gym before would be this: stand under cold running water, with your clothes on and wet down only enough so you can feel clean - and then get dressed. And in case anyone actually asks what you did today, tell them that you went swimming. That way they won't ask about anything else!
