I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several dogs and they get far better at hiding in trees because it makes the snow melt easier to shovel out. I personally don't carry my dog anywhere over town unless we're going skiing. She is such a good dog that she runs into me on every chance she gets!
