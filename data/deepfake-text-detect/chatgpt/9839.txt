First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and are largely rooted in racism and classism. Mass incarceration of people from marginalized communities further entrenches inequality, and takes away resources from those who need it the most. Additionally, the prison-industrial complex is a for-profit system that relies on the suffering of inmates to make money. It is an exploitative and dehumanizing system that harms both inmates and guards alike, and fails to provide any meaningful rehabilitation or restorative justice. Furthermore, it is wasteful, expensive, and ineffective - incarcerating people has been shown to not reduce crime rates. Therefore, I believe that the current prison-industrial complex should be abolished, and replaced instead with a system that focuses on providing true rehabilitation and restorative justice, rather than simply punishing offenders. This would reduce the amount of people being incarcerated and ensure more equitable outcomes for those involved.
