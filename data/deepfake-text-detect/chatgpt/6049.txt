So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern, major religions have histories of political and social interference, and most have been responsible for mass murder. I'm not religious, but if I were I'd be very afraid of Islam. It's the only major religion that the Koran says to kill people who don't believe the same as you. The modern left are also far too liberal on certain issues for me. I'm all for treating everyone fairly and equally, but not at the expense of our own survival. As I understand it, modern democracy, which I support, only works because of one fundamental principle: the majority rules. I'm not so blinded by my lefty credentials that I can't see this. It may not be fair, it may not be equal, but it's how it is. And there's nothing wrong with that, but if you let the minority rule over the majority, you have to accept that things will go to shit. And with that, I'll stop before I say anything that will come back to haunt me. I'll just say that I'm afraid of what the future may bring.
