After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read a few non-fiction writings by Stephen Hawking about black holes and relativity but they were so boring it's a wonder he made it all the way through them. Every day scientists are discovering new things in our universe, awesome facts like quantum entanglement or different ways reality can be detected via these experiments. If you want something lighthearted, there are some good humor booklets (I got one for my birthday) that cover science on fun topics such as Pi Day or Elvis Presley's diet. But if you really want something deep and interesting then why not try reading a physics textbook? There're tons out here every year from Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press:
