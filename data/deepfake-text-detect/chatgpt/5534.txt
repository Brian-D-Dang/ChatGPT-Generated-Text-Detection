A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that province. I don't include dialects, but I think there's a real problem if a dialect is so dominant that it's not understood by the majority. I don't mean that a minority language has to be understood by the majority, just that the majority be able to understand it. If I can't understand your language, it doesn't matter how many people speak it. But I don't think the language of the people who came to the area first is the only language that counts. That would mean the English of the French in Quebec would be superior to the English of the French in Ontario. I'm not sure that's right. I think there should be a higher standard for schools and for government. I have no problem with people who don't speak English making a deal that only people who speak English will be employed at a school or in government. It's the children who should have the right to learn the language of the majority. Bonnie, you said that your spouse was harassed by immigrants. I'm not surprised. I don't think it's fair for people to harass other people. But I'm not sure that it's fair to expect a country to be bilingual. I believe that the world is becoming more and more bilingual, but I don't think it's fair for people to expect that. But I think it's the responsibility of the government to make sure that the majority language is understood by the majority. I don't think Quebec is better off than Ontario. I think Ontario is better off than Quebec. And I don't think it's wrong to say so. I think that the people who came to Canada in the 1950s and 60s made a deal with Canada that if we came here, we would become Canadian. We would obey the laws of Canada. We would speak English. And we wouldn't go back to our old countries. If we didn't like it here, we could go back. But we promised to be loyal. That's the deal that was made. You could argue that the people who came in the 1970s and 1980s made a different deal. They were guaranteed English services and they got that. But they didn't get a deal to speak English and obey the laws of Canada. I think it's wrong for someone to ask me to be loyal to a country I've never even visited. But I'm loyal to Canada. I think the people who came to Canada between 1950 and 1970 made a deal. And I think it's wrong for them to ask me to be loyal to Canada. I don't think my spouse is racist. He's an intelligent man, and he's proud of his heritage. But he feels like he's being asked to be loyal to a country he doesn't even like. And that's not fair. And he's not alone. I don't think he's racist or a bigot. And I don't think people like him are racists or bigots. I think they're loyal to the country they came from. I think that loyalty is worth more than loyalty to a country that doesn't belong to you. But I think loyalty to a country you don't belong to is wrong.
