Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 19th century and continued until the end of the 20th century. History The second world war broke out during the Middle East's civil wars between Arab states and Europeans when the Islamic State (ISIS) invaded Iraq in 2011 with the aim of splitting its Iraqi resources into two regions: Syria and Turkey. The French-led coalition launched airstrikes on ISIS strongholds in the Syrian mountains as part of Operation Euphrates Shield. It also targeted other targets in Iraq, including oilfields and industrial sites belonging to Turkish state oil firm Gazprom. Despite these attacks, ISIS fighters held several large cities throughout Mosul and Raqqa in 2017 by striking Iranian-backed military posts, killing at least three people, mostly civilians. ISIS has been attacking Iraqi forces since 2018, after seizing control of major towns, air bases and villages ahead of an imminent expansion of its leadership. In February 2019, it was announced that the group had executed at least 49 civilians for plots related to the spreading of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes COVID-19. In May 2020, ISIS claimed responsibility for the suicide bombers attack in Baghdad and Mosul, the first such explosions in years. In August 2016, it detonated explosives at a school in central Baghdad that killed four teachers and one student. A month later, it bombed two schools in northernIraq, killing two children and wounding another. In June 2015, it changed its name to Al Qaeda after the terrorist organization conducted deadly attacks on the US embassy and consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which led to devastating global business losses. In November 2014 it carried out similar attacks in New York City, killing nine people and injuring over 200 others. A year earlier, it attacked an American Embassy in Tehran and a hotel. Clashes between ISIS and local militias continue to this day. In March 2019, it announced that it would not allow any foreign aid to enter Syria or Iraq, citing "battles with Daesh [Daesh] and regional allies." In April 2019, it withdrew a border militia from eastern Syria following calls from President Trump to withdraw troops from there. In mid-May, it withdrew all western support for Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) forces fighting Kurdish militants. In December 2019, it said that it had withdrawn more than 100,000 soldiers from the region as a result of the armed conflict with KRG. Two months ago, it announced plans for up to 1 million terrorists to return home and take revenge against the Kurds. On 29 October 2019, the UN Security Council voted unanimously to pass Resolution 314 calling upon Russia to protect the interests of its citizens and cease hostilities with the PKKKurdish separatists in Europe. Resolutions 312 and 313 were approved in September 2019, respectively. These resolutions are intended to help strengthen the ceasefire agreement between the parties in the ongoing battle between the PKK and the PKKKurdish separatist groups. On 23 July 2020, the United States signed a similar resolution calling on Russia to provide humanitarian assistance to the Republic of Georgia and Armenia. In March 2020, Ankara blamed Russian aggression against Azerbaijan for the deadly attacks on its sovereignty along the Golan Heights, running counter to international standards, particularly due to its historical ties with Israel. Between 2000 and 2005, ISIL affiliated with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). During that period, we witnessed a growing number of attacks targeting civilian populations in Iraq, but we have seen no evidence in recent weeks that the group continues to target civilians or those who don't agree with their interpretation of Islam. In the past few days alone, ISIL has attacked Salahuddin Mosque (a mosque in southern Iraq) and damaged the buildings of the Imam Abdalla Hamad al-Nujouri. Since then, ISIL has invaded mostly residential areas near Baghdad airport as well as the city of Najaf, where they have come under fire numerous times. Many of the attacks we saw last week were targeted by IS militants, however, the IS network remains active in other countries, creating new potential targets for terrorism. March 19, 2007 - January 4, 2008 Al-Qaida former leader Masood Barzani (born 21st Century), known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was arrested in France on 10 December 2006 and charged with multiple counts of premeditated murder and terroristic threats, according to media reports. He also allegedly admitted to having collaborated with the murderous jihadis during his time as leader of the armed wing of al Qaeda in Iraq. After being released and living under house arrest in Paris, he was detained in Germany. He was subsequently deported back to Turkey in 2008 for taking refuge in Qatar while seeking asylum for his wife. The case has triggered a worldwide outcry against the torture practices of al-Baghdadi and other associates of al-Qaida. He died in 2016 aged 80 on 6 December 2008 part with name - - - - - - - - - - etc - - - - - - - - participants - -
