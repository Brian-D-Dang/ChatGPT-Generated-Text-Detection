Improv, as an art form, is a medium almost exclusively to be enjoyed live. SNL, while having improvised elements, does not fall in this category because most skits are rehearsed by the performers themselves; rather it's something they do for fun and to impress their audience with some sort of funnyness or humor. SNL's original sketch series, which ran from , was more than just a comedic comedy show, but also an experimental experimental musical - the group had never made a full-length Broadway musical before that season. This is why, technically speaking, there isn't much difference between these two shows: SNL has its own production team and the actors work on other projects, while SNL's current cast consists mostly of people who have worked on the show in the past. The biggest advantage to them is that they can actually collaborate on what exactly they're working on without being forced into any particular choreographed choreography. As such, SNL tries to make sense of difficult situations, like when something unexpected happens. It often involves making a very simple joke about the fact that you've been standing up to someone that isn't your own family member, but instead is doing it so that everyone else around you and anyone else you care about knows that heshe thinks it's hilarious. But sometimes they try to make things happen just so that others don't know where they stand at any given time. And sometimes they forget that, even if you aren't the one taking the jokes, that might make all the difference.
