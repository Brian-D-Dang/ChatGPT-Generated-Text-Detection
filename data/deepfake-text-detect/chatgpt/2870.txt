There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, while others say they don't work at all. But most economists agree on one thing: A higher IRS budget is bad for the U.S. economy. The current administration has proposed expanding the overall federal budget for fiscal year 2012 from 3.8 trillion to over 4.5 trillion - a nearly 8 percent increase in spending. The president also wants Congress to approve an additional 50 billion annually through 2017 for social programs like Medicare (which he describes as "unsustainable. Despite his warning about unsustainable government policies, Obama also proposes adding another 716 billion toward increased debt service payments by 2017. These costs will be incurred unless Congress acts soon, because currently they've been capped below what the Congressional Budget Office says would result if no action were taken. Entitlement Spending Booms During Recession Recovery Periods While Americans have become accustomed to hearing talk of stimulus packages during recessions, it may surprise you to learn that entitlement spending is booming today. In fact, a new study shows that when it comes to cash outlays in general, Social Security-related expenditures jumped more than 12 between 2002 and 2008; this amount was exceeded only by defense spending which rose 14. Over the same time period, total federal tax revenues fell 9, illustrating how much our nation spends beyond its means. Moreover, the bulk of these deficits come not out of discretionary expenses but from mandatory ones such as Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. In short, we need long term solutions that cut retirement benefits instead of borrowing trillions of dollars from future generations with little hope of paying them back. Why Is It Bad For Our Economy? One reason why it's especially important now to control your own destiny rather than depending on public handouts is that history suggests that high levels of government spending tend to slow economic recovery following downturns. Specifically since World War II, every single recession ended with significantly lower GDP per capita than originally projected six months earlier. This phenomenon explains part of the sluggish recoveries after other wars as well including both Korea and Vietnam. A strong economy requires sustained job creation so people can afford basic living necessities - something that won't happen until policymakers get serious about cutting entitlements. As Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman once said, "you cannot increase welfare without paying for it. You must either raise taxes or reduce subsidies. If you choose subsidize, then there must be someone who receives less. That person is the poor man... To pay him off you must take money away from some other group. Therefore, any attempt to help someone else results in making somebody else worse off." By focusing too broadly on increasing revenue, deficit reduction plans typically focus almost entirely on raising income taxes paid mostly by taxpayers earning under 200K a year. Instead, we should begin requiring those receiving benefits under entitlement programs to bear their fair share of funding cost increases associated with Social Security and Medicare. Beyond simply having fewer children or working longer hours, the best way for many middle class workers to protect themselves against rising healthcare premiums is by reforming the system itself. By allowing younger working years to accrue credits towards retirement savings by putting aside funds into private accounts managed directly by individuals, employers andor 401 (k) administrators, it might make sense to offer deductions for contributions made within pre-tax earnings brackets. From age 25 onwards, each dollar invested via 401 (k) savings could earn up to 10 times more than it does now on average! Depending upon financial literacy education requirements regarding investment units, younger citizens might also receive incentives like matching contributions. Such a program could potentially be created along with reforms to restructure Social Security benefits, leaving retirees better prepared financially for their golden years ahead.
