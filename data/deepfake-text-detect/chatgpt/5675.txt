So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training and all, but it just seems so damn silly to me. You have these guys who are barely trained and what's worse is that they're not actually firefighters, they're volunteers. Honestly, I don't really care. I'm not even trying to disrespect anyone or anything. I just think it's kind of funny. And that's the kind of humor I like. I did an experiment the other day that I thought was pretty funny. I had a group of people come over to my house. I got them all to put on their gear and I told them that they had to go rescue my family from a burning building. They all ran into the house, went upstairs and started opening closets, and going through drawers. They started taking out things that they thought could be used to make a fire. They kept yelling about fire extinguishers and stuff. They were looking for a fire. After a few minutes I just said "Okay, the fire is out. You can leave now." They all started to leave. But then, I was like "Oh, wait, the fire is still on." They all kind of just stared at me with their mouths open and then I said "I just thought you might like to go back up and start looking around for a few more minutes." I was laughing so hard. Everyone else thought it was a little mean. But I thought it was hilarious. The best part was that they started looking for a fire again. It was so funny. But I guess what's funny to me is a little bit different than what's funny to other people. I actually thought it was really sad. But it was definitely funny.
