I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically it's still quite difficult to get things like Chernobyl or Three Mile Island going again (or even worse). But what really bothers me is how we got into this situation in the first place - who was responsible for creating so many new problems that threaten our existence? In my mind, there are two main culprits: politicians and corporations. It's no secret that most countries' governments view nuclear as an easy solution to their electricity needs while they're trying figure out other means at their disposal, such as windmills and solar panels. Corporations do pretty much the same thing. To make more money by being cheap, they want everything on the cheapest possible terms, making sure people know prices - and thus make purchasing decisions based off price alone. And when it comes to uranium mining, companies try to convince you that "it's safe" because "we've been doing it for decades." However, these long-term results don't necessarily matter if you're only looking at today, or tomorrow. In fact, over time (i.e., decades), current practices can lead to future disasters. This isn't just speculation though; history shows us exactly that. So yes, Fukushima I II were basically caused by humans, but the real root cause lies elsewhere. If we didn't allow for the short sightedness of both government and private enterprise then wouldn't be nearly as bad? So why am I ranting here? Because right now it seems like almost everyone has forgotten about GermanyFrance's EPR reactor project in France, which began construction back in 2007. The plant would use molten salt instead of water for cooling purposes, since German regulations forbid building reactors using ordinary water due to safety issues. After spending around 4 billion Euros (5.8 Billion USD) on the project, EDF suddenly announced plans to abandon the project last year after receiving approval from French authorities, for reasons unknown and very hazy (but presumably related to cost overruns). At least one major reason behind its cancellation could possibly be that Germans themselves don't approve of nuclear projects anymore, given Japan's recent disaster. On top of that, the plant itself will utilize about 1 million tons of coal per annum (which is in stark contrast to Germany's relatively clean renewable energy policy). All told, it looks like nuclear technology wasn't able to prosper in Europe when it came down to actually implementing the actual infrastructure needed to keep heat under control - something which should hardly come as any surprise to anyone familiar with history. Now let's take another example: South Korea. As seen above, it recently imported over 80 of its electrical power through contractors involving Russian firms including Rosatom. Without getting too deep into political discussions, the relationship between Russia and China has become somewhat strained lately. Earlier this month in particular, China successfully tested its own indigenous HTR10 fast breeder fusion reactor in addition to conducting several successful tests of advanced ICBMs capable of reaching U.S. soil, also demonstrating the capability for miniaturization and operation anywhere within range of an enemy attack. Meanwhile none of those events seemed to bother President Trump at all. Further complicating matters however is that a large portion of America's energy supply originates in Texas...where energy resources tend to lie near populated areas, leading to serious environmental consequences whenever accidents happen on site. A number of years ago, residents discovered radioactive waste welling up kilometers below ground surface levels following a chemical explosion, causing mass fish deaths as far away as 25 km inland. At the present moment, a nearby facility continues to leak radiation at alarming rates despite attempts made from officials to contain it. An international group called "Project Underground" has proposed converting some old railroad tunnels underneath Houston into underground storage facilities. These would store spent fuel rods that are currently stored outdoors until reprocessing becomes feasible (and obviously safer than keeping them outside). Unfortunately, state law prohibits opening the railroad lines above ground without express permission from Congress! So naturally, public opinion towards nuclear power remains minimal. Sure, America produces plenty of natural gas thanks to fracking and shale oil drilling, but unfortunately politics plays a role there too where lack of regulation leads to disastrous outcomes all over (also see Turkey and North Dakota pipelines debacle). And yet, both of these examples show "nukes can work," doesn't it? Well, that depends entirely upon your perspective. For instance, the entire United States suffered a major black out earlier this summer because insufficient power generation capacity prevented utilities from maintaining proper balance amongst different regions. If solar panels weren't available, utility companies would have simply turned to fossil fuels to compensate for lost production. Of course whether solar panels produce enough energy during peak hours and especially when cloudy conditions prevail has been a subject of debate among scientists for decades already. And it's no wonder, considering they generate less than 0.2 of total global energy according to Wikipedia. Furthermore, researchers have done experiments with negative effects of having people cut out other trying to test theory testing, wayward titterediting! The coagulity (chastems
