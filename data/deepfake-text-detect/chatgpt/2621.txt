Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but some opinions are better than others [edit: I am referring to them being morallyethically "better. If you submitted a topic to this sub with the question 'Hey public! What is your favourite movie?', then it would be fairly clear that most people wouldn't have an answer (or any strong feelings about it) beyond "I like it" or something similar). If someone makes an argument based on facts and logic they're entitled to whatever opinion they want, especially when those positions aren't held by many in society. My favorite type of person though can make decisions from both sides. They don't have to think one side over another, because they see all angles as valid.
