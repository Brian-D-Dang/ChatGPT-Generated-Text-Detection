I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the ranks. The idea of "best" is a bit difficult for me as it's often subjective and there are always exceptions (like how Bakemonogatari doesn't get much love here but gets tons on MAL). Spirited away has been getting alot of praise lately
