I'm referring to this news story about the incident at the community pool in McKinney TX. You can reference it here, the video is down the page and is approximately 8 minutes long: This occurred on my street (not a good thing), but I was not affected by any of it as we have no children living with us or going to that school district - so for me there's really nothing I need to know besides "they're all okay..."it being an unfortunate situation where some parents are extremely irresponsible babies instead of normal people who understand what parenting means... The comments section under the article has lots more information if you want to read them though!
