I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. I just can't believe that I am enjoying it better than some of my buddies who are drinking coffee in their dorm rooms every night at 11pm and after work, while everyone else is still couch surfing from 1am because they're bored out of their minds doing absolutely nothing productive! This is not a bad thing as long as you don't drink too much or your coworkers smoke weed too often when you want to get drunk on the weekends otherwise you might have wasted your own money eating chips whenever you feel like sleeping. My friend was only sober once last week so he spends his nights alone asleep.
