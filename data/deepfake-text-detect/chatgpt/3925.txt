As a gay man, I can be extremely wary of other people for my own protection. I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate straight men and women, but not necessarily their behavior (unless those behaviors include me). However, if we're talking about actual homophobia that isn't just about straightness or heterosexuality it's more along the lines of sexism, classism, etc rather than heterosexism. Doesn't homophobia have to do with your sexual orientation?
