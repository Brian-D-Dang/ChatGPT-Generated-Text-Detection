Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" I don't frequent BuzzFeed much but I saw the headline for this article and thought it was interesting.
