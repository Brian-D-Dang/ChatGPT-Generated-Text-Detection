Hello. For a long time now I've felt that there are many people in hospitals and psychiatric homes who will never be able to function independently and will never work, their children will not have access to clean sanitary facilities, their parents will rarely be able to make it home safely, they will never be able to see or spend time with friends, and the number of psychiatrists increasing is steadily decreasing. "The government must increase funding for these services so we can provide them more care and support," he said.
