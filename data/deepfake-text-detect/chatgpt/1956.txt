Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself free shit to the point where my tax bill goes up and then I have no incentive not to vote. It depends on whether it's income based or property-based taxation, but if you're renting your place, aren't they already getting rent from you (at least indirectly)? If there were an election issue about raising rents 30 tomorrow (or increasing some other cost by more than 100), would renters still be completely unaffected because "they didn't buy their home"?
