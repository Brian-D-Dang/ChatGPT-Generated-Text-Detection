There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a degree or diploma upon a student who had successfully completed an academic program. Graduation ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools have become increasingly popular in the UK in recent years. It is becoming more common for these ceremonies to take place, usually at the end of the academic year, with parents invited to attend the festivities. The ceremony involves presenting each child with a certificate of achievement, often accompanied by a speech from their teacher or school principal. The day can also involve activities such as performances by the children, awards being presented, and refreshments afterwards. Graduation ceremonies are seen as a way of celebrating the efforts of the children, and providing them with an opportunity to mark the end of an important phase in their education.
