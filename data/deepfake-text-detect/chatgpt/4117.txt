Estimates show that the average american uses around 4 times the resources that the planet could support, if everyone was an American. These numbers are somewhat lower in Western Europe, where this figure is closer to 3; however, these figures do not take into account population growth rates and are therefore misleading. I'm confused as to why people think it's meaningless?
