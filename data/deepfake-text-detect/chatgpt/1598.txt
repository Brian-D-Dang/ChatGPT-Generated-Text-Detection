The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustratedcritical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single men (and women) have every right to be annoyed by the "I'm-so-special" ego trip that female friendships can take on when we don't grow up with them. Of course not all single people are self absorbed, but some definitely do seem more so than others.

It's hard being alone again after experiencing relationships...it feels unnaturalweird at first.
