I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with facts: 1) The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has set a goal that by 2017 100 of U.S.-raised sheep will have access to an outdoor area for grazing or shelter from inclement weather. In addition the USDA also requires producers to provide clean water at all times during production; only give food when animals are hungry; allow ewes and lambs full movement while in their natural environment including access to feed as well as shadecooling areas; ensure adequate rest periods between production cycles through provision of resting, quiet, dry locations away from stressors such as noise, dust, temperature extremes); 2) according to the American Veterinary Medical Association "While there is no specific evidence suggesting that consumption of rare meats such as heart, liver, kidney, sweetbreads etc., increases risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke or cancer," they do recommend limiting intake due to higher levels of saturated fat found in these organs." 3) According to Livestock Environmental Quality Council study done in 2008, since 1985 NCBA research shows two thirds of US cattle were raised outdoors prior to indoor housing. Today more than 90 percent remain inside year-round. 4) What about those studies claiming red meat causes Heart Disease? A recent Gallup poll showed over 80 percent of Americans believe the scientific community knows if meat is healthy or not but less than half actually know what reputable scientists' conclusions may be - which just goes back to why people don't trust science anymore. So here you go...there seems to be some confusion surrounding how much red meat we should consume based strictly on health concerns...so let's break down the recommendations given out so far: Dr. John Sievenpiper, Professor Emeritus, University College London says "The problem with animal protein is not necessarily its quantity - even though middle class westerners tend to overeat most other animal foods - but rather our poor quality diets lacking in dietary fiber and micronutrients required by humans" He suggests following guidelines established by The World Health Organization advising adults 18 years old and older maintain a maximum daily intake of 500 grams (about 1 pound), equivalent roughly 3 ounces per day. That amount includes beef, pork, veal, goat, mutton and lamb. Some experts suggest substituting chicken or fish instead of red meat...and still others say keep your total number of servings low regardless of whether they're red meat or poultry. Both groups agree we shouldn't be exceeding 4 oz. of any type of meat each week - or 24oz throughout one month (that comes to about 2 lb). And remember everything we put into our bodies reflects on us - You can find Dr. Sievenpipers complete article HERE. As always check with your doctor before making drastic changes regarding diet.
