Human sentience (or consciousness, or sapience, or whatever term you like) is an emergent behavior of neurons and their interactions, which can be replicated in non-organic systems, i.e., computers. Thus Human sentience is an emergent behavior characterized by the ability to respond to stimuli and influence their behavior.
