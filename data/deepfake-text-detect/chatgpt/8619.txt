You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the whole discussion to remain open to interpretation. Idk if you can or not but I've heard people point out how much less of an issue it is when they say something negative about someone without knowing them as an individual. Like if I said my friend she was born black and white didn't make me feel any different than everyone else and never had a problem with her. She just got over it and went on to have fun with other peoples lives and life experiences.
