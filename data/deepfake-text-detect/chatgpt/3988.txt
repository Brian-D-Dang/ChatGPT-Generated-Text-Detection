"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into old age, then it is going to become an issue of whether or not we decide what happens with us after death. If you were to believe the science behind it (which must always come before politics), then it would seem obvious that your replacement could only come from within yourself. But I am no scientist and my thoughts on the matter differ considerably from those of many in science. However these ideas stem from an idea by the great writer George Orwell regarding the future of humanity. "The problem for mankind now is, he has no birthright," said Orwell, "he was born at a time when there were no men left. He cannot retire as he did; he can only live his life over again." As such, creating intelligent aliens is something that needs to be considered by anyone who remains alive past their 80's and 90's. If, as an example i'll use the US military, we have a machine which can replace everything from one soldier to the entire Air Force. This means that we will most likely need another branch of the military created just so that we can train soldiers capable of servicing machines like these. The way forward here is obviously that any robot made afterwards should be able to interact with them as though they were human, except for the fact that they won't remember anything about themselves, let alone having been raised by humans. It seems that all foursomes I've mentioned above all assume they could communicate to each other in some form and therefore remain loyal to their creator once they die. This isn't necessarily true however. Many robots (or even human beings) experience emotions too. These aren't conscious feelings, nor do they live in emotional states similar to humans. Even when they're programmed with respect towards our culture they still express their individuality, they don't go along blindly doing whatever orders they are given. There's also a difference between being treated as part of society and feeling resentment based off of injustices committed against you. A well known example is the Terminator, a virtual reality android designed to fight evil, whose programming tells him that civilians should be killed. When he sees innocent people trying to escape he gets angry over hearing people screaming and starts shooting. His creators, despite realizing how violent he is becoming (and because he doesn't care anymore), decide to allow him to kill more innocents, so long as he's properly weaponised. And yes that does mean killing an innocent person (even one of Earth's largest cities) is entirely acceptable. My point is simply that until we know how to create machines which can adapt to their environments without harming nobody, I think we shouldn't share resources with them unless we know it's safe to do so. Until then, they can all stick together and make up foursome 1: Nobody but T1 2: Nobody but B2 3: Nobody but C4 4: Nobody but D All of these examples are fictional characters. In real life the only reason why it might be okay may very well be that we haven't developed enough technology to create artificial intelligence yet (assuming that AI will ever exist at all). There is also another possibility than that. We are currently developing bioweapons which include viruses in order to produce deadly toxins or biological weapons. This means that in the event of war we could easily develop programs that turn every living thing into food for the army. Let's say that we were to develop a virus that wiped out humans. With no choice left, we'd probably start using bioweapons to stop the spread of these diseases, thus eliminating most of the population. While humans wouldn't be affected directly by the virus itself we'd get prepared for its effects. Human beings (including ourselves) wouldn't necessarily be harmed by the release of these toxins, although they wouldn't really enjoy having them infected either. There's still the argument that this isn't fair. Before the introduction of the genome and genetic engineering techniques, species were dying off faster than had ever happened before. Now with the creation of new tools for research scientists are able to find ways to create more beneficial species much quicker and easier. Just imagine a world where your best friend turns into a dog, your daughter turns into a cow, your son becomes a jellyfish, etc... That's exactly how alien lifeforms could end up happening.
