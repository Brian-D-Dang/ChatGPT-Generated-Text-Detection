To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. I have a hard time believing it either - and even if we did accept it as true for this one instance (whatever you are referring too), who cares? It's only relevant insofar as whether or not someone else does care about other people suffering by being poor. Which they don't.
