I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry atheists would like them to be. I'm not sure if this is what you were asking for though... That's exactly it! Never understood why some atheist are so hateful and aggressive towards those who hold traditional Christian values
