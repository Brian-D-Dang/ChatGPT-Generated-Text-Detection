I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the "safe space" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao. While I don't believe any particular CEO of any company should have a stated "mission" for a company, is there anything that Pao has said that might hint at what kind of company Reddit would become under her leadership? Their CEO is going to be Ellen Pao. Their previous CEO was Reddit's first employee. - Charles Dec 22 '14 at 14:30 I'm not a Reddit user, but I am a CEO, and I don't think a CEO's mission statement should be written down anywhere. It should be a working knowledge of what the company stands for and how it's going to be run. I think it would be a mistake for Pao to publish her personal mission for Reddit, because she will inevitably run into conflicts with the community she is trying to make happy. As a general CEO statement, I think it's great that she was a founder of Reddit. I'd say that's the perfect background for a CEO of Reddit. - JimmyBreed Dec 22 '14 at 17:56 I'm not sure what to make of this post. Do you want a list of things that the new CEO thinks are important? Or do you want to know what she's said that indicates her philosophy? I can't really tell from this post what you're looking for. - D.W. Dec 22 '14 at 18:02 D.W. I'm looking for whatever she has said, explicitly or implicitly, that might indicate what she plans to do. While I do not think it is a requirement that a CEO state a mission for the company, I do believe that it's important to know a CEO's vision for the company. - Charles Dec 22 '14 at 18:11 While I do not think it is a requirement that a CEO state a mission for the company, I do believe that it's important to know a CEO's vision for the company. - Charles - Charles Dec 22 '14 at 18:15 Charles: I'm pretty sure it is a requirement. It's how you get things done in the company. And if the CEO doesn't know what he or she is doing, it's his or her responsibility to find out, and then to implement what he or she has found out. - D.W. Dec 22 '14 at 18:35 D.W. I believe I've answered my own question. There is nothing that Pao has said that has indicated what she might do at Reddit. - Charles Dec 22 '14 at 18:41 If I was hiring a CEO for a startup I would ask that person to describe a situation where their company became successful in the past. If they are not able to describe any such situation then I would consider that a red flag. If they can describe a past situation where their company became successful then I would ask them how they would apply the same principles in the future. - D.W. Dec 22 '14 at 18:45 I don't see the harm in her making a statement. It's not like her statement is going to be the law of the company. It's just a guide. - Charles Dec 23 '14 at 1:50 Charles: I don't see the harm in it, either, but there's a big difference between a guide and a mission. A guide is an expression of the thoughts and feelings of the person in charge of the company. A mission is a statement of intent of the company. A company is not a person, and when we're talking about a company, we're talking about intent. The CEO may have a lot of good ideas, but what we need is a mission statement, not a bunch of ideas. - D.W. Dec 23 '14 at 1:55 Charles: I've updated my answer to include a quote from a post by Pao that indicates that she has not yet put much thought into what kind of company Reddit would be. - Charles Dec 23 '14 at 1:56 Here is a link to her blog post about the company. To be clear, I am not an expert on the company and I have no idea what she plans to do. I
