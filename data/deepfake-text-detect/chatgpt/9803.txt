I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand why this is an issue and it's something I'm working on. I'm trying to be more organized and keep better track of my assignments and due dates. I'm also trying to set aside more time to study and review the material. Additionally, I'm making a conscious effort to ask questions in class and take more notes while listening to lectures. I understand that this is a process and it will take some time to improve my academic performance, but I'm committed to doing whatever it takes to become a better student.
