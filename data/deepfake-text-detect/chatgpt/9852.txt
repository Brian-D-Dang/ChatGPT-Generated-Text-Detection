You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the saying to be changed to, "they are completely different things." This is because while it may not always make sense to compare apples and oranges, they can be compared in some ways. For example, one could compare the taste, texture, color, size, nutritional content, or even the cost of the two fruits.
