There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, while others think it is simply a tax break for business. It's hard to argue with them when they cite the examples of George W Bush as evidence for not cutting taxes because Washington has done nothing but increase spending in the past four years - yet those same lawmakers have never talked about cutting government spending at all since 2010. But here we see why none of us want Washington to cut back on wasteful spending: We know what the president did last year; we're counting on Congress to show us how much more must be spent before our country will start working again. That's not enough!
