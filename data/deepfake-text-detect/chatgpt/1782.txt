I'll allow that, in most cases, the misbehaving kid is just throwing a temper tantrum, but what do you do in cases where the kid has thrown himself on the floor and refuses to get up? You go into his room. You pick him out of bed by hand or arm if necessary (just like your own children). And then take him back downstairs with you until he gets it through his head that crawling around under furniture isn't going to accomplish anything worthwhile."
