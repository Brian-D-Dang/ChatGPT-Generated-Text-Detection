I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with the pros: 1. Lamb is low in cholesterol - FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER research has shown that even high fat (cholesterol) foods had a lower risk of heart attack than foods containing less saturated fats. This means you can eat more lamb and not feel like you are cheating yourself.2. Lamb is good for your gut health. It contains bile acids which help keep stomach acid balanced.3. You won't get all cholesterol from one meal as you do with other meats. You will save money by not buying all ground beef or chicken.4. Lamb is leaner than chicken.5. It is easier to cook than chicken breast.6. Not only is the meat on the bone better tasting but the bones have an extra 13 grams of protein per serving so there is additional muscle building potential.7. There isn't any additional cholesterol in lamb compared to beef8. It is cheaper to buy whole lambs rather than cuts that retail at more expensive prices. The cost savings add up quickly when you consider these things.9. Even if you don't eat the meat off the bone you still get all the nutrients it provides and some of those nutrients may help your digestion.10. Poultry is controversial and some people say that raised chickens and turkeys cause more infertility problems then might otherwise happen. LAMB IS GOOD AND CHICKEN IS BAD!!!11. Studies show that pregnant women who ate chicken were 2 times more likely to develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy than women who ate chicken free of cholesterol12. Chicken breasts contain more total calories and many people find them too heavy for their body weight gain requirements13. Many women report that they lost at least 10 pounds after giving birth to lambs14. My personal experience with lambs is that they are very healthy, they grow nicely and weigh about 1 pound each time we get them back. Problems with Lamb Meat? Lamb does contain certain allergens though generally not serious ones. Listed below are some common food allergies that people often encounter when eating: Rice cereal: Hariga Koya and Alla Star Rice Cereals are both made from wheat. Wheat is known to come into contact with lamb liver (which is a source of gluten). Cashews: Cashews are found in cashew milk and cashews are a major ingredient in chickpeas. Chickpeas contain small amounts of gluten. Gluten is considered a type of sugar. Milk Products: Milk products from cows such as dairy yogurt and cheese contain large amounts of lactose. Most people are sensitive to lactose but most cow's produce enough lactase enzyme to prevent allergic reactions. However, uncooked cheese could be introduced to the body through a broken window or saliva and therefore should be avoided. Nuts: Nuts include walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, peanuts, pistachios and pecans. Almonds are a major dietary source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are necessary for brain development. Go ahead and enjoy your salmon though; it is completely safe for humans.....except when eating raw. If cooked, nuts can become contaminated with salmonella.
