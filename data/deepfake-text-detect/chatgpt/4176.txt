I'm very confused and bothered by the amount of ads for prescription medications that run on television and in magazines. In my mind, the reason that these medications can only be prescribed to patients with preexisting conditions is due to the fact that they are addictive or highly-addictive products such as opiates (Prescription painkillers). Do people really think that this will help them? Yes! They do - but not without consequences. If you're addicted you've probably read about heroin addiction.
