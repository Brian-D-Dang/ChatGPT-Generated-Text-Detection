Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for "sleeping around," and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise. I've never heard of this being considered "genuine" or anything like that to begin with - there's no evidence that women are rewarded less for sleeping around. It just happens to be true that some men do get praised for it.
