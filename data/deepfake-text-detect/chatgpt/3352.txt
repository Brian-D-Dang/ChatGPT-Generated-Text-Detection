I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm assuming this person is sexually active). I'm concerned about their behavior and the potential risks they are exposing themselves to. What can I do to help them make safer choices?
