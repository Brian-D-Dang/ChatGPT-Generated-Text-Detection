Edit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) This isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a little bit crazy, right? Some people go fishing and catch dinner or venison every time they pull their rods out of the water; others are on an endless quest to lose fish after fish with no success whatsoever. Same goes for hunters - some kill deer almost exclusively while other's never have so much as a shot fired in anger even though they may spend many hours walking through dense woods looking to take down some big game that will eventually eat them alive if not killed quickly enough!
