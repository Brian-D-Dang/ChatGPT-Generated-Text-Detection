I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning. It seems to me that we have developed an ideology which we are willing to defend at all costs, rather than trying to understand why we hold it in the first place. The reason I think this is so important is because there doesn't seem to be any logical explanation for holding such views. The idea that women are naturally submissive may not necessarily come from our ancestors but could be conditioned in us through constant reinforcement by society and other people around us (family or friends). To put forward my point: given that most men do not like being dominated by women as they see them as lesser beings then those who dominate them would either 'not beat their woman' or even worse kill her if she did something he didn't approve off; is it possible that some parts of patriarchy itself has been hard wired into us? Would this make sense biologically speaking on how some male brains work? Or am i simply making up excuses here...? How can someone get pregnant without sex though? Sex isn't just penis-in-vagina stuff, unless you're talking about rapeincest or alien abductions.. Even then, it's still more complicated than that! How does sperm know where to go after ejaculation? If anything should happen, it'll take months before going anywhere.... "More importantly, what makes mens' rights feminist a "sisterhood"?" This made me laugh until I cried...It was beautiful! But seriously, I had no clue that MensRights were also feminists now? Aren't you supposed to hate each other? And yes, women look down upon guys saying men need help too right? So whats up with that Men's Rights movement? They want to have equal rights too? Oh wait..... Sorry, not sorry!!
