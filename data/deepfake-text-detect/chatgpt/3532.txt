Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I understand. So, what kind of party are you thinking of having? Are you planning on having it at home or renting a space? Also, what's your budget for the party? Knowing these details will help you plan better.
