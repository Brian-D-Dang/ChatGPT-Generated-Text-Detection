Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved in the sexual encounter so that they are satisfied by it; consent makes sure everyone's needs are being met while allowing each person who participates the freedom of choice without coercion or manipulation - ultimately this means saying yes when you want to say no. But what does consensual mean? Does "consenting adults only" include every adult who wants to participate or just those with whom both parties have discussed their desires beforehand (and perhaps some form of protection)? What about if one party changes their mind mid-act: is that considered rape even though he agreed at first? Is an intoxicated individual capable of giving meaningful permission, especially considering how many college students drink heavily before engaging in drunken hookups? On campus, where did exactly do most people go wrong on these issues? According to Rolling Stone, University of Virginia senior Emma Sulkowicz was raped twice during her time as an undergrad but refused to report either incident because she felt nothing would come out of them. She then began carrying around a mattress, which became known simply as "Mattress Girl," as part of activist art project called Carry That Weight. In 2014 Mattress Girl went viral after releasing photos from the performance onto Twitter along with a statement accusing UVA administrators and friends of the alleged rapist of turning a blind eye toward his actions by failing to adequately respond once notified. The accusations against him were eventually found not credible due to lack evidence, although two other separate investigations into allegations made against him also cleared him. But despite all evidence suggesting otherwise, news outlets like CNN ran coverage of Mattress Girl outright claiming she had been raped repeatedly over three years. This kind of reporting has become increasingly common among national media sources following events such as Christine Blasey Ford coming forward with charges of attempted groping leveled against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last week. As reported by TIME magazine: While reports surfaced last year detailing Dr. Ford's experiences as well as other women's accounts of assault perpetrated by Judge Kavanuagh, details surrounding her story remained murky until Wednesday afternoon... A local Washington Post reporter tweeted [that] Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to call for hearings tomorrow before moving ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination should the FBI complete its investigation sometime today... Yet hours later came another bombshell - one that revealed why Republicans may feel comfortable proceeding now. In a letter sent late Tuesday night, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, disclosed information provided to Congress anonymously alleging "the existence of documents concerning the official actions of President George W Bush relating to the nominations of Charles Pickering and David Souter to the United States Supreme Court." It continued: T]he anonymous source alleges that prior to Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation proceedings, Senator Grassley received additional materials pertaining to past negative comments about Judge Kavanaugh," referring to Chairman Chuck Grassley.... Both Democrats and Republicans appear eager to move quickly through the current process, despite calls from survivors' advocates for more fact finding and public testimony under oath. After hearing these new developments Thursday morning, Trump expressed confidence that Kavanaugh will soon secure enough votes to join SCOTUS. So far, all indications suggest he'll likely get them. And whether you believe Dr. Ford tried to take advantage of our system by making up false claims in order to derail his ascension to the highest court in America doesn't matter much anymore anyway. Because regardless of your political leanings, chances are good that someone close to you knows somebody who believes something similar happened to herhim or knows someone else whose life was ruined thanks to unsubstantiated charges lodged against them decades ago. Once a lie gets rolling down hill, it sometimes becomes difficult to stop it dead in its tracks... Which brings me back to my original question posed earlier: Has society failed young men everywhere? Or has social justice propaganda succeeded in brainwashing us all to imagine that we live in a world full of abusers waiting for any chance whatsoever to strike again?
