I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for murder, that person should be sentenced there too I think. There are multiple crimes committed by people with similar convictions. The point is that a murderer disenfranchises innocent victims and murderers make criminals scapegoats through government inaction.
