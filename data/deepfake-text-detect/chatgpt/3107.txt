CMV: ISIS isn't about the US, it isn't about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isn't about us, and to be honest with you I don't care what they do in Syria if we aren't being attacked directly by them. If all the Muslims hate each other more than their governments then eventually there will come a point where that hatred turns into something bigger.
