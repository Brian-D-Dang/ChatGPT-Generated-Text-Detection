The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as a tattoo). The tattoo consists of the words "God" and "tattooed," implying that the tattoo contains symbolism from the Bible. It also tells us that the tattoo depicts "Shrek." So there's really no reason to believe that the tattoo says anything about Jesus Christ?
