First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" does. Second, because some ideas are simply better than others; we should not be afraid to say so just in case someone takes offense or thinks less of us for thinking this way. Also if you're familiar with egalitarian debates online (not Reddit but other places) more often then not they will devolve into arguments about women's rights vs men's rights (at least on TRPMGTOW subs).
