While it is true that trying a child as an adult can have serious consequences and reduce the protections offered to children in the justice system, there are scenarios where trying a child as an adult is the most appropriate response to a heinous crime. Some crimes committed by children, such as murder or rape, are so severe that they require a more mature legal response. These children are not the same as the typical juvenile offender who may act impulsively or lack judgment. They knowingly committed a violent or heinous crime, and trying them as an adult may prevent them from committing similar crimes in the future. Additionally, holding a minor responsible for their actions as an adult can help victims and their families feel that justice has been served. People expect consequences that suit the severity of the crime. Trying a child as an adult may be seen as the most appropriate punishment for these crimes. It is less focused on vengeance and more focused on the fundamental principle of fairness. Finally, trying children as adults is not an entirely new concept in the judicial system. The United States Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of juvenile sentencing schemes that allow for some children to be tried as adults in certain circumstances. Parents of children who are susceptible to committing deadly crimes should be held accountable for their child's behavior.
