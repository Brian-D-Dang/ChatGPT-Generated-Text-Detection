EDIT: Lots of very well rounded, interesting points. Thanks! Really helped with my perspective. EDIT 2: I've been awarding deltas to people whom have been making some very good, solid arguments in this thread that aren't just "I think it's unfair," and haven't seen the point yet about trying to offer a different perspective for those who feel they know what happens but need to be reminded or to see things from another angle. You might want to edit your post so you don't sound like an asshole...
