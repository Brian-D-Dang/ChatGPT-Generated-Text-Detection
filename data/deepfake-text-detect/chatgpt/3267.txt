Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, causing immense destruction and suffering. It's difficult to justify the deliberate killing of so many civilians, particularly when other options were available. 2. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki didn't necessarily bring an end to the war any quicker than other options. There is debate among historians about whether Japan would have eventually surrendered anyway, and whether alternative strategies like a land invasion or a naval blockade would have been more effective. 3. The use of atomic bombs set a dangerous precedent for future conflicts. It essentially introduced the idea of nuclear warfare and signaled to other countries that atomic bombs were fair game. This has created a global nuclear arms race, which is a major concern for international security. 4. Lastly, the aftermath of the bombings was devastating. Tens of thousands of people died immediately, and many more suffered long-term health effects. The radioactive fallout from the bombs remains a serious issue in both cities to this day. The destruction caused by the bombs was extreme and long-lasting, and it's difficult to argue that the ends justified the means in this case.
