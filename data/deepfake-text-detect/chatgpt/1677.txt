This CMV post is partly inspired by this rrelationships [post] I came across earlier today. This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had the opportunity to discuss it with my parents yet because of my extreme lack in confidence due to being a virgin at 28 years old (this was before I even knew what virginity meant). I am beginning to think that maybe there are some other people out here like me who, despite their age or social status, may be misunderstood as socially awkward without ever having been told they were awkwardly shy etc? It doesn't mean we aren't confident though! In fact quite the opposite; our strong willed personalities probably help us avoid situations where most people would freeze up completely but instead seek others for support from time-to-time when needed - hence why many of those same, confident types seem to stay single...only to find themselves alone one day after another until you hear down the road "Robert, your dad finally got around to telling you he has something he wants to tell you: you" cringe More likely than not these confident types don't need validation so much anymore but still crave love nonetheless. So if someone tells you past relationships didn't work out because shehe wasn't attracted to you then thank them from the bottom of your heart for doing such an important thing which helped save your life just in case there's any doubt about that statement later on...a good deed done is worth more than 100 apologies....period. Just sayin'!!!
