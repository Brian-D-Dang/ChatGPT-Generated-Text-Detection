I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically it's too late to get any sort of bailout money for Fukushima waste disposal facilities now anyway. The other issue is that Fukushima was originally intended as an experiment in nuclear energy technology designed by the Japanese government, so there are still lots of questions around what happens when we're already dealing with the consequences from Fukushima if you don't clean up after the tsunami disaster (which many people believe will happen). Regardless of the risks, we should continue researching the technology, looking at where Chernobyl may be leading us next, trying to figure out how we'll react once Fukushima melts down again. We can learn things like how high levels of radiation make humans uncomfortable or dangerous considering there were no emissions markers of radiation entering the atmosphere before the explosion occurred which would indicate something serious happened outside Fukushima yet there weren't any before. This means we need better detection methods such as satellite imagery to help warn us before Fukushima. Also, we might want more tests on the Fukushima reactors and if they haven't gone bad enough under their own weight then we shouldn't invest much attention into sending weapons off base even though some have been banned since 2004 while others could become prohibited later this year due to radioactive fallout issues. The best way forward frame work remains to explore alternative energy sources.
