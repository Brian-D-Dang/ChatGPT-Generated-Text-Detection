I believe that "Buckle up, it's the law" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority] which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they don't know what they are doing. It does not matter whether you have a lawyer (or no), and it doesn't matter whether someone has a criminal record (or they never had one). That said, I think that's about right. If you're a government official who wants to do something good for its citizens, that is a distinction worth keeping aside from your personal political views, of course. But sometimes being considered as an offshoot of the state or even a fringe group, it puts you at risk of being called out on the peddle of hate speech. And if you're associated with such groups, it could make sense to avoid them altogether because of their many possible negative implications for your health: public officials will find themselves having to defend themselves against similar slanderous attacks from loyalists affiliated with the extreme right-wing ideological party LGBQT. That will only help those who want to fight back by trying to change things around here. As an aside, the 'Back off' slogan is probably the most offensive PR ever thrown at anyone - but wonderfully so, since no individual was ever taken seriously enough to try to stop this kind of propaganda on the street. The unintended consequence would be that any attempt to'reclaim' the word might be perceived as somehow supporting the ongoing struggle of LGBQT activists. A period of silence would provide much needed protection against such harsh rhetoric. Best regards Eoin M E (Image credit: YouTube)
