Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as we have now shown from the beginning, such a climate change-induced social collapse is not only unavoidable but inevitable - it also leads to problems in our economies too: The term "social collapse" may be used to describe a situation where society collapses due to one reason or another; however, there are many other factors that could lead to economic collapse. Thank you for replying:)
