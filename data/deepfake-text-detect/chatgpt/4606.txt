To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. On one hand there's no clear legal right of access for everyone to all information about any aspect of a person or thing - just because its public does not necessarily mean it can be published publicly without consent from the individual concerned (and if you look far enough into this you'll find most exceptions are made for 'public interest' reasons). And even then, getting consent and actually publishing something might still require court proceedings etc. So on paper we could say that, yes, there should theoretically always be an exception where someone publishes things about someone else who hasn't given consent. But practically speaking, how would you prove whether this was going on? Would your friend have had time to notice first before publication, so they'd be able to come forward with proof proving their non-consent? How much evidence do you need other than "I don't want people knowing"? I feel like that kind of lets people off the hook too easily. And yet another perspective is suggested by some countries having laws against outing anyone unless the law itself allows it, which sounds reasonable until you realise that those usually only apply when two parties aren't married within marriage (family members), or maybe when they're children. It's also worth noting here that the US famously doesn't follow such laws, and as well has many more exceptions, including ones allowing journalists to expose wrongdoing. So perhaps a blanket ban isn't necessary either way... But also consider: As long as both parties are aware that information is being shared, why bother making a fuss over disclosure? Its not illegal after all! If anything, at least in my personal experience, you might get annoyed at being called out on compromising situations, but ultimately accept it, don't fight back, and move on. Isn't revealing a secret supposed to make matters worse rather than better?? The whole situation comes down to balancing aspects of privacy vs free speech vs transparencyaccess to justicewelfare issues. Ultimately though, perhaps I'm looking at it wrong; so part of this question may boil down to "What makes your childhood sexual abuse different? Why should others care?" Which brings us back to 1 (maybe) above.
