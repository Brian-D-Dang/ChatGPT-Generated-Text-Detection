As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this health crisis. For example, in New York City's Chinatown, there is a sign on every corner reminding drivers that they can no longer use their cell phones while driving, due to increased fatalities from distracted driving accidents... In addition, businesses increasingly want to avoid taxes by simply shifting production overseas or opening new operations in low-tax countries like Mexico and China. This allows them to keep profits at home without paying any taxes - under the guise of protecting consumers, who aren't even aware of how much they pay in taxes until it's too late. The effect on poor people has been devastating: This isn't just about food prices. It's about access to food for everyone, which access we take for granted until it's taken away. If you think the wealth gap between rich and poor Americans doesn't exist before this epidemic, then you're probably still living with your parents. I've seen first hand what happens when a family loses one member - they lose everything. And these families live paycheck to paycheck. That means saving pennies for groceries food, gas money to get out of town, transportation to go see doctors appointments (when needed), and public services like trash pick up, water delivery, sewer service, garbage disposal... These are all things an average American family might not be able to afford if their income didn't decrease right after losing someone. I'm talking five times as much in terms of expenses. The rising cost of basic necessities has only exacerbated things. People don't eat half as much either so the number of calories burned is reduced exponentially for those who do eat less. We need to address obesity starting now because it could prevent millions of unnecessary deaths down the line.
