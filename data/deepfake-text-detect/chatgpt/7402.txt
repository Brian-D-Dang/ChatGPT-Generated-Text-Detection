While it is valid to have concerns about political dynasties and the concentration of power within certain families or groups, it is important to evaluate each candidate on their own merits and qualifications. Just because someone shares a surname with a former president does not automatically make them unfit for the role of president themselves. It is important to look at their policies, experience, and ability to lead, rather than focusing solely on their family history. Additionally, it is up to the voters to decide who they believe is the best candidate for the job, regardless of their family background. Ultimately, democracy involves the opportunity for all qualified candidates to run for office, regardless of their last name.
