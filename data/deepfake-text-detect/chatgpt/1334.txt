Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a proxy war: We had nothing to do with it other than supplying weapons (and getting our own butchered like pigs in a sty), training soldiers who went over there on their own dime, etc., yet we still get blamed for every atrocity committed by those troops," you write. "To be clear, I fully support America's involvement in that conflict - my dad fought in it as an enlisted man during WWII - so if anything, I should defer some blame onto him! But no one remembers that because they're too busy holding us responsible." You also note how "many Americans now live under the delusion that Vietnam ended more than 50 years ago when the last American soldiers left Saigon," adding: "Americans from all walks of life have been conditioned not only to hate communism abroad, but to despise any form of socialism at home. Sure enough, many politicians are quick to embrace authoritarianism whenever elections come around without ever once condemning violent tactics employed against protesters back here!" Doing your homework helps, too... right? Wrong. When it comes to politics, especially on college campuses where most students don't vote or pay attention anyway, "students can easily become indoctrinated into the narrative being spewed about them through the media, even though everyone knows that popular opinion is often far off base. And despite what you may think, political activism isn't solely driven by radical leftist professors and students: They actually represent only 1 of registered voters nationwide ... Meanwhile, less than 5 of non-college graduates agree with these anti-American views. This is simply due to age; millennials tend to lean farther left politically than older generations. Moreover, although Trump won 73 million votes in 2016 compared to Obama's 59 million, he lost the overall election because his supporters were largely white males aged 18-34 years old. So yes, protesting peacefully at rallies is important, BUT so is turning up to work, eating dinner, sleeping, going shopping, etc..
