I'm very confused and bothered by the amount of ads for prescription medications that run on television and in magazines. In my mind, the reason that these medications can only be prescribed by a doctor is so that the doctor can evaluate your individual situation and symptoms, and determine if the medication is appropriate for you. I can't help thinking that a TV or magazine ad is not going to give you enough information to make a good decision on whether or not to take a new medication. A few weeks ago, I was looking at one of the magazines that specializes in news about medicine, and saw an ad for a new medication that is used to treat depression. The ad looked quite official, and seemed to be written by medical doctors. The ad was promoting the medication as a "new medication that can change your life." No mention of side effects. No mention of risks. No mention of potential problems for people with other medical conditions. I thought to myself, "I wonder how many people see this ad, and decide to take the medication without first talking to their doctor?"
