I'm a lifelong veggie, and I've been vegan for a while in the past although I'm not anymore. I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being vegetarian or vegan without considering environmental impacts with meat eating. It's just that most people are dumb as fuck when it comes to thinking about anything other than themselves "Most people"? Not sure how many studies there have actually been on this topic but they all indicate otherwise...
