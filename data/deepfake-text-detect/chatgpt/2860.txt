This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... I'm a conservative. In fact, had Obama been shown respect by his opponents in 2008 he would have won that election (or so it seemed) without Romney being such an asshat who could not get out of his own way (that's what happens when one thinks they're running against Al Gore). I think we found our first victim.
