So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor race. That's the entire point of this debate! And its also not like there are any other laws or rules against it in legal ways so I don't know if it really matters to you?
