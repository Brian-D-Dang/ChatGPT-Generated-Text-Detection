I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info:) Now, while I am not one who is fanatical about women's sports or particularly fussed by it... If you feel that the disparity in terms of pay needs to be addressed...please do try and share your ideas on how we can address them as best as possible. But if you want to rant against them and use immature ways of doing so....go ahead with the heat.
