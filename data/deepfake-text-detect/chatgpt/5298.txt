Variable tax, or at least they way the US does it, is poorly done, inasmuch as it often discourages extra labour from people who may very well need the extra money to keep their jobs. But if you're using your credit card debt wisely and paying on time then a lot of people might think twice about going out cheaply for fun while your friend can be yourself. You could also use it responsibly by setting aside some savings accounts so that there isn't any interest payments looming over them when they're not working full time anyway
