Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. "That means that marriage is not a sacrament, but it's a ceremony for getting married."OK? Now then...what do you think of the idea of staying in until after the wedding (I'm assuming the wedding was yesterday), and just living off the income from your job as an unemployed person while looking for work? That seems much more sustainable than working at one place for years on end.
