It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. It does not take away from the benefits of public transport, it merely rewards those individuals who benefit most from their vehicles being driven by others. Myth 2: Cars pose health risks The number one reason for car accidents has been to cause serious injuries to people as a result of being hit by other vehicle. The second biggest driver is the death due to a road rage incident in a car accident when one of the occupants of a car did not know about the threat posed by people using their own vehicles. The third biggest risk associated with vehicle crashes is the problem of passing airbags on large roads. There is also a potential hazard if someone use the steering wheel too high and get caught causing it to spin out of control or head-on collision with the vehicle. 3rd current "safety" issue is that drivers tend to do something more dangerous before they leave the edge of their lane even though they have absolutely no time to think about doing so. This is why many insurance companies provide discounts which allow certain vehicle models to be used for their purposes without having to pay the amount to cover the cost. I believe this reduces the likelihood of accidents amongst drivers because they can avoid the danger of hitting another person at low speeds, but also means there will always be consequences to speeding up and overloading them.
