So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal , there is no way to "win" a nuclear war, as the damage caused by the attack would be so massive and widespread that it would likely result in a nuclear winter, rendering the planet uninhabitable. 2: Even if one side were able to achieve a decisive victory, the damage done to the environment and the people would be catastrophic and long-lasting. 3: The use of nuclear weapons on a large scale would also cause immense political and economic instability, which would further destabilize the world for years to come. 4: There are much better ways of resolving conflicts than through the use of nuclear weapons, such as diplomacy and negotiation.
