Estimates show that the average american uses around 4 times the resources that the planet could support, if everyone was an American. These numbers are somewhat lower in Western Europe, but still well above sustainable or even'sustainable' levels; I believe they're about 1-2 more than what can be supported by nature without any externalities (such as pollution). I don't know where you got your number from and it's a bit simplistic to say "you use too much" when talking about issues like this because different countries have vastly different power mixes which will affect how we do things differently for various reasons with varying degrees of efficiency.
