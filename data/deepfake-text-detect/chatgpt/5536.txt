I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; I have spoken out against religious intolerance and ignorance; I have protested against the war in Iraq. I consider myself to be open-minded and I try to be non-judgmental. Yet, I have never had a real conversation with a conservative person. I mean a real conversation where the other person could actually respond in a reasonable manner and I could respond in kind. I have never had a real conversation with someone who thinks that the United States should not be engaged in diplomatic or economic relations with China, Russia, or Iran. I have never talked to someone who thinks that the United States should not have environmental regulations. I have never discussed the idea that the world is a smaller place and that our interests need to be global and not only national. I have never had a real conversation with someone who thinks that affirmative action is wrong. I realize that there are very good reasons for these positions and that people on both sides of these issues have legitimate concerns that have to be addressed. In fact, in most cases, these positions are probably held for the right reasons. But, it has been my experience that I can only talk to my conservative friends about the personal and I can only talk to my liberal friends about the global. The conservativeliberal divide in America is so wide and deep and fundamental that it has created a wall of sorts between the two sides. The positions I have listed above are not personal, they are global. I don't care if someone else thinks that homosexuality is wrong, I just want them to acknowledge that their viewpoint is not acceptable by law. I don't care if someone else thinks that the environment can be ignored, I just want them to acknowledge that the environment is important. I don't care if someone else thinks that affirmative action is unfair, I just want them to acknowledge that some people need help to succeed. My point is that even though my positions are liberal, the issues are global. If we can't start having real conversations about the global issues, then we will never be able to work together to solve the problems that the world faces.
