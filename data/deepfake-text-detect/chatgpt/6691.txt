Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one I was having dinner with a friend and he asked me to be with him for a few days. I said, I'm okay with that, but I'm not the guy who gives you a bunch of dollars, or that I'm going to make you a pocketbook. I'm not the guy who gets you started on a good relationship, and I don't think I'm going to get in trouble.
