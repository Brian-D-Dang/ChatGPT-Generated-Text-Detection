Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view I hold. My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any one if you want to dispute it. 1) The "Culture" of the incoming administration has been that of academia for some time now. We have no choice but to assume this will be maintained because their are very few other options in terms of leadership at all levels. 2) They like to operate on the fringe rather than in the mainstream with things like; choosing Mc Cain over Bush or Palin over McCain etc.. Its not just a Rand Paul issue either... they prefer outsider status. This includes most of the people who would take charge even in Obama's second term which means we may see more appointments outside the normal channels such as cabinet appointees. 3) Their ideology leans toward the conservative side, however many liberals feel there isn't anything left they could do whereas conservatives believe they can make everything worse by doing nothing. As long as our republic survives (a bit shaky right now given recent events), many will continue to roll out from under rocks hoping for change without knowing what they think it should look like exactly. 4) There aren't enough constitutional lawyers around anymore except those willing to work for free because there aren't enough jobs available. While these types tend to lean liberal politically, many seem to think that since Obama won he must know what he's talking about and therefore shouldn't need help formulating his decisions legally. If we don't see immediate results, they'll blame him until something else happens is my guess. 5) With the current economic situation, It will become harder and harder to find candidates who lack political experience unless they come off as too radical. For example, Jindal was passed up because he was seen as too moderate and lacked theoretical knowledge even among other conservatives. That doesn't mean he couldn't turn into another Gingrich or Cheney though. He only had 2 years left school so he didn't get much formal education. His first job after college was running a fraternity house and later became state attorney general where he failed miserably. In 2000 he ran for governor against Bobby Jindall for Lt Governor then lost badly despite being hand picked by George W. Bush. Then when Katrina hit Louisiana, Jindal skipped town leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. He probably looked good to a lot of folks till someone found footage showing he wasn't doing squat while others were suffering. Since then he hasn't made waves but has managed to keep himself relevant somehow given how successful Jeb Bush was as Florida Governor. You also have to wonder why Mike Leach jr. isn't mentioned as a possibility? 6) Texas is going to remain independent no matter what. This might cause issues depending upon your definition and perspective. Some say it would put states rights above federal ones and others argue otherwise. What does seem clear is that Texas will likely refuse to allow people living in TX illegally entering back across the border regardless of whether their home countries produce passports or not. So while we lose 11 million dollars per month due to illegal immigration, we gain 14 billion each year in tax revenue and billions more indirectly through retail sales. By 2014 Texas will pay Mexico between 8-12 Billion annually in benefits and taxes. Whatever money remains after paying for services currently provided by government employees within Texas will go directly to raising funds elsewhere. Eventually the Mexican economy will collapse like Cuba did once before and Mexico will start begging us for help again. The USA has already spent 10 of GDP on drugs alone (10 Trillion Dollars). At least 30 goes towards law enforcement including Homeland Security making them 3rd highest budget item behind defense and health care. These costs add roughly 1 point on every dollar of Gross Domestic Product for 20 years. So in 2018 Texas will spend 4 of GDP on funding drug programs (plus interest) regardless of whether legalization occurs or not. 7) No Child Left Behind is gone forever in favor of Common Core standards. Most schools are already implementing common core and there seems little reason to stop. Money follows children so expect lots of parents becoming concerned about educating their kids. Expect a huge increase in private educational institutions bringing down public schooling cost. 8) Washington D.C. politicians will fight tooth and nail to protect their turf and privileges even if it means destroying the country. Drones, surveillance cameras and CCTV everywhere, buyouts, bonuses, hiring new staffs, increasing salaries etc... All signs pointing to increased spending. The same process happened here during Reagan's presidency especially after Carter raised taxes causing inflation to skyrocket. 9) Social Media will replace traditional media as far as most Americans are concerned. Already facebook and twitter use have grown exponentially in less than two decades meaning millions of teens are using social networks simply because everyone else is doing it. When the son of a Mark Zuckerberg puts forward ideas such as net neutrality, nobody listens to John Kerry anymore because his views only resonate amongst certain groups online. People like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates started businesses online before anyone ever makes any business reactionary claim affects the rest of America.
