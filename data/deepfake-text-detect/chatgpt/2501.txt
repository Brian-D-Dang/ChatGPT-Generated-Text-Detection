I am a 23 year old male Indian American male. I have never held hands with a girl, been kissed, or obviously had sex. I have never even asked someone out on a date in my life. It is very frustrating because all of my friends are dating and hooking up left right and center... Is there something wrong with me? What should i do to fix this problem that has plagued me since childhood??!?!? Please help!! ANSWER: Don't worry too much about it yet - you're still quite young so things will happen when they come around (not for everyone at the same time though!) You'll find your own way eventually:)
