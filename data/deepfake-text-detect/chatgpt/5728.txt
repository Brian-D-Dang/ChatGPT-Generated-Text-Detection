If addiction is a disease, why do most addictions end spontaneously, without treatment? Why did some 75 of heroin-addicted Vietnam vets kick the drug when they returned home? It's hard to know, but here's a theory: Addiction, as we usually think of it, is a personality trait, not a disease. A person's preference for a certain addictive substance or activity is in his genes, says Michael Rutter, a professor of child psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, in London, and director of the Medical Research Council's Child Psychiatry Unit. "If you say that addiction is a disease, you're saying that it's a medical problem," says Rutter. "And we know from experience with other medical problems that they're not caused by genes. But they're caused by genetic predisposition. So if addiction is a disease, then it must be caused by genes, and that's wrong." It's a position that upsets many addiction researchers. "Michael Rutter's a good person to be talking about this," says Eve Marder, a professor of biology at Brandeis University and chair of the National Institute on Drug Abuse's behavioral neuroscience and addiction study section. "But he's also wrong. There's just no question about it. Addiction is a disease." Rutter's argument, and the implications of it, is debated in a new book, The Neurobiology of Addiction, edited by Rutter and Tom McGuinness, a professor of behavioral and brain sciences at the University of Texas. Although a disease implies a precise, biological cause, what Rutter is saying is that addiction is not a disease in the usual sense, a medical condition with a fixed cause. He believes that addiction is more like being left-handed, or having blond hair or blue eyes. "In those cases," he says, "there's a genetic predisposition, and it has an effect on the environment." Drug addiction, Rutter says, is a personality trait that is affected by genetic predisposition and the environment in which you grow up. There are some people who are predisposed to addiction by their genes and some who are not, he says. Then addiction is not a disease, it's a personality trait. "If you take two people who are addicted to cocaine, they may well do the same thing, but they won't do the same thing to the same extent," he says. "If you took one away from drugs, he may not go back. The other may. And if you took them both away, one may, one may not." Rutter's view doesn't contradict the idea that addiction is a brain disease, a disease of the brain, as is depression or Parkinson's disease. But it means that addiction is not, by itself, a disease. If you have addiction, it's a disease that affects your personality, and that affects the way you behave. The idea is that addiction, like other personality traits, is a combination of inherited characteristics that are expressed in the environment. There are certain genes that make people more likely to get addicted, and then there are a whole bunch of other genes that cause people to get addicted under different circumstances. The idea that addiction is a personality trait has been around for a while, but it hasn't really caught on in the addiction research world. "It's not a mainstream view," says David Nutt, a professor of experimental psychology at Bristol University. But the idea does fit the evidence. When you take people who have addictive personalities, and put them into different environments, they're more likely to behave in addictive ways. "It's a nice, clear hypothesis," says Nutt. "And it fits the data quite well." Researchers have long known that people who are predisposed to addiction are more likely to become addicted, but they didn't know why. In the 1970s, David Nutt and colleagues at Cambridge did experiments with laboratory rats, which are probably the best animal models for studying addiction. They found that if they gave a rat a drug that caused a high, he was more likely to continue taking the drug after the experiment was over. "Rats are very susceptible to addiction," says Nutt. "They'll self-administer cocaine for hours, day after day." In the 198
