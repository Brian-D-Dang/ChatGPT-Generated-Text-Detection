While it's true that rights only exist as much as they are recognized and protected by the state, it's important to understand that the concept of rights goes beyond just the legal framework. Rights are essentially basic freedoms and protections that humans are entitled to simply by virtue of being human. They exist as inherent qualities of every individual, and every individual has the moral right to expect their inherent rights to be protected and respected. Furthermore, the idea that talking about rights without mentioning responsibilities and limits encourages faulty and destructive thinking is flawed. Clear and unequivocal recognition of rights is crucial to create a just and equitable society. However, it's important to acknowledge that these rights come with corresponding responsibilities and limits. For instance, the right to free speech comes with the responsibility to avoid causing harm or inciting violence, and it is also limited when it comes to hate speech. In conclusion, while it's true that rights are only as strong as the state that recognizes and protects them, it doesn't diminish the importance of clearly defining and protecting these fundamental freedoms as they form the bedrock of a just and equitable society.
