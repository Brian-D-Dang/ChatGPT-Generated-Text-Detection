The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested themselves for domestic violence than women they're calling about it! Or this one: In 2010, seventy-two percent of homicide victims were male - even though males make up only around fifty-five percent of the total population. These facts do not comport with our cultural biases when we judge human behavior; according to these statistics any man who reports a rape or domestic assault has no right to expect justice because he was probably guilty anyway. But what many people don't realize is that your chances of being wrongfully accused just by reporting an incident depends on the race and gender identity of both you and the person making the accusation, or at least whether there's enough public pressure to force investigators into doing something stupid. As a result, simply acting as a victim often means giving up anonymity while bringing attention to yourself and putting yourself in danger. Andrew Chang (who I think should change his name) explains how Asian American women have been uniquely affected by this reality: [A]s Asian Americans have become increasingly visible within popular culture over the past several decades... people often assume Asians are from "other" countries where other things happen, such as male chauvinism and misogyny. Asians therefore may experience prejudice based on stereotypes without having experienced overt racism.... [T]he assumption that Asian-American women must have cheated to get here creates a double bind for those trying to enter elite U.S. institutions like law school through affirmative action programs designed to benefit minorities. If she admits her true heritage, then she runs a risk of being judged less favorably during the admissions process due to her ethnicityan issue especially pertinent given recent verdicts overturning University of Texas' minority enrollment policy for UT's Austin campus. She can also run the risk of being perceived as fraudulent if she does so in order to claim admission using affirmative action benefits, which some believe are reserved only for those truly deserving of assistance.... If someone suspects foul play, however innocently it might actually be motivated, their incentive to turn informant will increase exponentially. This problem is compounded by the tendency of social media users to jump to conclusions as soon as anyone posts anything remotely suggestive even if nothing nefarious is intended. There are countless examples of false allegations made after photos showing white straight couples holding hands went viral - and almost all of them occurred under the auspices of "me too." The latest example involves actress Felicity Huffman... I'll spare you my thoughts on why accusations of cheating - which tend to target middle class obliviousness rather than high profile criminals - are frequently used as political weapons instead of actual crimes committed. The point is that believing every woman who accuses someone of sexual misconduct is a good way to end up ignorant forever.
