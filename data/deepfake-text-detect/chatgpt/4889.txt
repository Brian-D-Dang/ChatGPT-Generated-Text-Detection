I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. The US was the winning side yet it began losing ground after D-Dayfirst with Operation Market Garden then later with the debacle over III Corps. By 1944 there were too many dead men on American soil for any further expansion rather than retreat; and since they couldn't declare victory until 1945 when Germany's surrender became inevitable anyway, we had more blood spilled by our own forces than simply because Hitler did not have enough troops left to keep up his delaying tactics or even defend himself against Allied air attacks: now he could only wishfully hope for an early peace settlement while we drove him into ruinwhich is what happened (albeit very slowly). The Soviet Union actually won their war as quickly if not much faster than anyone else (except possibly Japan), but Stalin just didn't want the war to be decided like that so he kept pushing forward through Europe until it ran out of resources and manpower and thus no longer mattered. In reality he never came close to achieving total victory other than on paper anyway. And I do think that probably Russia would have been better off without Stalin personally leading them towards victory. He was definitely a major part of why things went wrong for my country and almost certainly responsible for hundreds of thousands dying unnecessarily during WW2. But I don't think this should take away from Stalin's achievements. His "Stalinism" was arguably one of the most effective forms of state control ever developed and practiced anywhere in world history until recently (if indeed Mao's "Cultural Revolution" can be classified as something similar). It wasn't perfect though, clearly he massacred millions of people because of some insanely authoritarian political beliefs which contradicted everything known about human society by all scientists studying the subject before 1950, including me! And yet...the USSR really brought stability to central European countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia and also ensured the survival of communist regimes elsewhere in Eastern Europe long past when they would otherwise have collapsed without external help. As for post WWII Russian politicssociety....it has improved immeasurably since 1991 if you look carefully enough. So yes Stalin achieved some good by getting rid of that nightmare scenario where everyone might have chosen another path in 1918, however overall negative consequences far outweighed positive ones. If anything maybe Stalin deserves credit for having the courage to try and stop fascism spreading throughout East-Central Europe rather than passively accepting it by being content to let it happen and allow ourselves to become dominated by Nazis instead. Without the nuclear bombs dropped by both sides Russia doesn't stand a chance in hell. Why? Because the Soviets lacked technology necessary to make modern weapons and raw materials to fuel those weapons. They basically got bombed back to near prewar levels. Their military capabilities severely limited. History will remember Khrushchev as a great leader who ended communism peacefully, but the system still crumbled around him due to neglect. That isn't true. Those are both real issues, but the article mentions neither. Yes, Russia tried to get along with the west, and spent vast amounts trying to reach economic parity, but the damage caused by decades of isolation and repression led to massive deficiencies. You need to consider the two worlds separately, and understand that between WWII and now Western intervention helped decouple Russia from the rest of the world economically. Additionally, an entire generation of Russians grew up knowing nothing outside of Communist propaganda. Even today, Russia suffers from low morale and high unemployment rates, despite its natural wealth. Perhaps, if an ignorant population is fed lies, is defeated time and again, they may desire power less than they once desired freedom. For example, imagine living under Nazi occupation. Do you really want to live your life thinking 'well, they're occupiers..what choice do i have?' vs. 'i guess i'd rather live here'? Why did Britain declare victory soon after VE Day, well partly because it needed the pressure of fighting the Germans to push ChurchillChurchill's new allies France and Italy somewhat closer to agreeing terms. Also because the British public wanted things wrapped up as fast as possible and were tired of endless bloody battles in Northern Ireland. This happened even though the Americans were aware that it made little sense and knew that the British Alliance was built to deal with situations exactly like this. Not saying that Eisenhower completely agreed with this decision but given how the Allies managed to screw up several attempts to create peace talks by killing German civilians and bombing civilian populations in Dresden and Tokyo in late 1945 I'm inclined to agree that they had sufficient reason to keep going. After all it took years of deaths and destruction until the Japanese surrendered. I mean, power shifts hands fairly easily in 20th century warfare - France blocks Soviet advances across Manchuria Korea, Socialist China drives the Kuomintang out of Taiwan, the United States seizes Hawaii and Puerto Rico, etc. With few exceptions, none of these empires lasted more than 12 months to weeks apart from 3 to serious effects, normallyAll right?But to hold onto AABTCoalition's regularityBeB
