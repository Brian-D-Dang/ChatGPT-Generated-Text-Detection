Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my friends and family have been telling me that the only way for them to be happy is if they converted back to meat products (chicken, pork etc). I don't understand why this seems like some kind of really self-entitled attitude. You shouldn't give into people who are trying to make you feel bad about your choices. But then again, I'd rather not eat meat than force other people to eat it either so... Sometimes we just need to remind ourselves that the majority will always take our side.
