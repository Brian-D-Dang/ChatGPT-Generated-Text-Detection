First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person when it comes to parenting issues and would be happy to discuss them with you if you wish so. I understand why some parents are like this: they want their children to "do what we say." They don't allow much of an opinion into the mix, even on matters that might seem inconsequential (like whether or not kids should eat ice cream). The problem is that this is a very bad idea and can lead to all kinds of problems down the road especially if one parent has an authoritative personality and the other doesn't. It also tends to reinforce power struggles between parents which leads to all sorts of intense emotions. There's a theory called "holistic development" where there's a lot of research suggesting these things are important for having healthy minds and bodies as adults too; particularly when both parents have different styles for raising their children. One thing you could try is talking to your daughter more about her beliefs, her thoughts, etc. Her current school may help provide ideas on how to do this? Or at least suggest exercises she might find helpful. I'm sure you'd rather not deal with politics right now but maybe you'll end up learning something useful just by chatting with your daughter!
