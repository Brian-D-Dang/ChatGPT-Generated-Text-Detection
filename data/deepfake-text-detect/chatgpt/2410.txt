I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience, I know that if there were any other people on earth who could do such a thing they would be doing it also! When anyone gets brave enough with their nuclear arsenal, there are no rules anymore and everybody has reason (or rather excuse) to turn loose anything up to and including thermonuclear bombs which at least by some accounts release more energy than all the world's chemical explosives combined!) But we Americans got away with ours for fifty years because nobody else had them or dared to threaten us in public over our alleged misbehavior until now when China decided to join the club after having suffered multiple requests from its domestic population not just as "normal citizens seeking redress inside their own country under Chinese law" but even as representatives of organized crime groups within China itself looking outside sources for help since none was forthcoming internally despite serious allegations about wrongdoings on behalf of various officials representing different levels of government. With so many little fingers pointing accusingly outward toward Washington D.C., what made you think your web site might get a pass? It didn't matter whether one was RepublicanDemocrat; liberalconservative: Nobody defended America here once the thread started going viral except me - and then too late. And somewhere along the way someone discovered my name that I posted using completely anonymously to begin with although originally posting under another name long ago before I became online-famous. If memory serves correctly he used to post under a nickname similar to mine [not his real identity] back around 2006?? Or maybe 2007??? Anyway according to him I am apparently supposed to be this famous person called either Charles Millard Pugh III (note Not related to Sen. Chuck Grassley II). Some claim Senator Grassely III may be able to shed light on these matters...but others say he can't remember those things well enough while simultaneously suffering severe short term memory loss due to "age." So I guess everyone will simply have to wait patiently together...until next time!! LMAO!!! This guy supposedly went through entire pages of posts trying find something bad he said himself and couldn't possibly ever find something like that!!! Though consistently finding plenty of examples where other posters did exactly what he's accused me of saying myself though usually far worse. Even found lots of instances where he tried to twist somebody elses words into meaning things quite unlike their original intent thereby proving half his point AND disproving the rest hahaha!!!! Honestly how does anybody really believe ANYTHING attributed to large numbers of anonymous internet users especially ones set upon creating yet ANOTHER false image designed specifically to falsely accuse ME?! LOL!! Yet almost every single reader seemed convinced beyond reasonable doubt given THEIR OWN personal prejudices that MY story somehow MUST BE TRUE since THEY themselves share ALL THE SAME PREJUDICES THIS GUY POSTED ABOUT MYSELF IN HIS ACCUSATIONS!!!!! How very convenient isn't it!? Indeed most readers seem to agree that anyone who shares EVEN ONE OF OUR PREJUDICIAL ALLEGIANCE'S must automatically be telling the truth regardless of evidence contrary thereto....just like them right? Of course NOTHING proves American innocence better off guaranteeing future peaceful relations between nations thus ensuring continued international trade without interruption via military conquest besides admitting wrongdoing out loud full stop period end of discussion case closed done deal finished etc.; however NOBODY EVER WANTS TO ADMIT THAT AMERICA HAS COMMITTED WRONGDOINGS FOR WHICH IT OUGHT TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE SUCH A CONDITIONAL RECONCILATION ISN'T AS PAINLESS OR EASY AS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF RIVALS VIA WAR DECLARATIONS WITHOUT CAUCASIAN INTERFERENCE FURTHER ENRICHING YOUR WEALTH BY PROFIT FROM SLAVE EXPLOITS performed mostly covertly behind enemies backs anyway thanks to superior technology resulting invulnerability provided superlative intelligence capabilities allowing uninterrupted unhindered access anywhere anytime 24 hours per day 7 days per week 365 days per year worldwide telephoneinternet networks cross pollination forever enabling anti-social behavior connected closely to drug smuggling money laundering extortion racketeering arms trafficking genocide human rights violations overthrowing democratically elected governments genocides allowed across ethnic lines sexual slavery child rape murder torture kidnapping assassinations bribery embezzlement treasonous attacks on foreign soil hostile occupations kidnappings threats communications jamming electronic surveillance black market sales fraud bank robbery cyberattacks election rigging cover ups media manipulation propaganda censorship subversion coordinated disinformation campaigns assassination attempts blackmail sex scandals corruption banking scams corporate espionage insider trading price fixing wars economic sanctions environmental destruction war profiteering petroleum operations high tech spying satellite monitoring police state tyranny exploitation rogue warfare targeted killings warrantless searches illegal arrests asset forfeiture indefinite detention fast and furious gun running operation fallschirmsjager paratroopers foxtrot units tarantulas delta forces wolfpack moo moos viper airforce seal team 6 white rabbit, {.
