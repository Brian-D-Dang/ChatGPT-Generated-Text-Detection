Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not just the basics like proper training, but if you're providing food for themselves or someone who needs help with their business, you want them to receive some support as well; maybe you could make it easier on yourself by making sure you've got your own drinks all cleaned up beforehand? I think you can see why it would be nice when the customers have been working hard at the restaurant so far before they arrive because they know there is no way they'll leave without their tips being made back, especially since it seems everyone else has hired you out of desperation.
