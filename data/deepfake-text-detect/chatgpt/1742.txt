Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make it affordable for everybody...but a public college education has never been more expensive than right now. It's an incredible amount every year that you're paying out-of-pocket just so your kid can go to school. You sure are making great points here!
