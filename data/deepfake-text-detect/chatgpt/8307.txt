I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot someone even if heshe is in danger to save him? And here are some of my opinions: First off all we must realize that everyone has their own choices; including an ambulance driver who learns it before they can become one will decide whether let other lives die because you don't like your job so much (which may be justified) instead letting them live since taking his life won't bring back anyone's loved ones but just leaving those injured alive also doesn not mean anything as well neither does killing others for making different decisions... In fact doing such actions shows how immature our brains still look after being born... Because this simply proves there was no difference between us human beings at first place.... That basically means every person living on Earth had similar brain shapes.. which makes me feel proud sometimes when thinking deeply enough...... But anyway what i want say more than these things above actually depends upon each individual himself herself.... And based from personal experience... We should try hard work out ourselves by becoming better then trying harder again...... To achieve something good!
