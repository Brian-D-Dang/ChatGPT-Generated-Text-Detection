I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with the facts: sheep are herbivores (i.e., they have a completely different digestive system than humans), so their diet consists of grassesherbs all day long; as such there is no way for them or any other livestock animal including cows - not even if you were force-feeding these animals grains ever get high fat levels in its flesh unless that grain was first processed into some kind fatty acid by squeezing out acids from plant seeds oil using heat etcetera." Note how he has included Monarch caterpillars which also consume hay but never go through metamorphosis? And what do we make about his statement "As much at most people know" when clearly many comprehensive studies show otherwise??
