I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural challenge as you have no idea how it should be used and even worse - what's the right way of dividing up your rice. Here are my tips on using them well:1) Mastering the basics of chopstick usage- place all of the pieces in order from left to rigth (Additional tip for beginners: Only pick up one piece of food at once).2) Learn where to hold your chopsticks when eating hot dishes like Japanese curry or ramen3) Practice on an empty plate so you can get used to holding chopsticks properly4) When ordering plain steaming noodles with vegetables, keep the bowl upside down. It makes manipulating the slippery noodles easier.- My favorite dish from Thailand was Pad Thai which has always been served with thin sauce made from shrimp paste. The flavor of this peanut based condiment is unmatched by any other ingredient. A few years ago we went through some bad experiences trying to find something similar here in Germany. One option is Namsap Alley. Based out of New York they make their own blend of raw peanuts and spices roasted over charcoal. In addition, each batch varies slightly according to season. They also offer readymade sauces without MSG! Here are two examples below: The first batch above is sold under the name Khao Soi Berdoo (which means green spicy stir fried noodle) while the second version is called Laksa Papaya Curry Sauce and comes predominantly with papaya, carrot, bell pepper and lime leaves. One last thing before leaving Bangkok... Try the famous street foods...
