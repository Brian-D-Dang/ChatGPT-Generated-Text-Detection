When I see debate about'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about'evidence'. If they shift on these issues, it seems to be because they feel like it's the right thing to do or because it aligns with their values or beliefs. Why is that? Shouldn't evidence be more persuasive? There are several reasons why evidence may not be as persuasive as we might hope, especially when it comes to contentious issues: 1. Confirmation bias: People tend to seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs and discount information that contradicts those beliefs. This means that even when presented with evidence, they may be less likely to give it weight if it goes against what they already believe. 2. Emotions: People's emotional reactions to issues can play a strong role in shaping their beliefs and opinions. Emotionally charged topics such as climate change or gun rights can be particularly difficult to approach in a purely rational way. 3. Values: People's values often underpin their beliefs and opinions. When there is a clash between values, people may not be as swayed by evidence as they would be if it were simply a matter of fact. 4. Ideology: Some issues can become tied up with people's broader political or ideological views, which may be difficult to change even with strong evidence to the contrary. That being said, it's still important to present evidence and try to persuade people based on reason and fact. But it's also important to acknowledge the role that emotions, values, and ideology can play in shaping people's beliefs and to approach these issues with empathy and understanding for different perspectives.
