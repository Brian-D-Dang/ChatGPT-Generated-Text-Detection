I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends who drink it. This morning, I was sitting in the living room of my flat eating breakfast when I noticed a few guys looking at me while drinking coffee and staring straight through the window with their noses glued together as they walked by. We went over the rules: no smoking on the roof tops should be allowed indoors or around kids under age 10 years old; no drinking alcohol outside your house unless you are absolutely mandated to do so; no drinking or drinking beyond you need only your own personal drink; no underage drinkers welcome here if you're paying rent money; no drinking past 7 p.m.; no binge drinking where five people can't all hang out one night per month except for the doctor's office and the hospital; no drinking alone between 9 p.m.-4 a.m., weekends will not be permitted except during the weekdays. None drinks or food consumption after midnight. I'm sorry, but there is nothing else left that anyone could eat besides coffee. What started off very quickly turned into a little bit of a nightmare. This afternoon, after two days of bragging about our drunken hotel rooms, we watched The Simpsons episode with my mom from the couch. The episode reminded me why I hate my parents so much because they have been cruelly abused since I've arrived here four months ago - my dad has been super abusive towards them ever since I moved away from home eight years ago. We drove down to Sacramento this weekend to visit them again just before we met up with my sister-in-law for breakfast. My mom thought it would be nice to see us get together once more during our stay instead of having dinner separately every other day until my roommates began arguing incessantly about why my dad had refused dinner last Friday nights. I think my roommate told my brother she doesn't want any part of the experience anymore. She lives nearby and thinks it's best gone forever without him turning his back upon her mom. A few minutes later, my mom got angry that my brother wanted breakfast now that the tv show didn't start airing yet another season earlier than usual due to my father being sick. My mom tried explaining on FaceTime how I couldn't watch it live because there were too many commercials displaying all kinds of drama surrounding the show. My father crashed overnight knowing full well how badly the show affected our family. He says he'll forgive me whatever happens next Sunday night which means I won't hear from him until Monday morning whether we talk about it tomorrow morning or Tuesday evening anyway! After dinner, my mother took me to see a movie that her husband bought online earlier today. It wasn't terribly exciting, but there weren't lots of commercials playing anyway. We talked about our favorite show since my Dad won't let us watch it anytime soon either so it worked perfectly fine even though it ran late. Last night, my mom said something about having the evening off since my brother isn't going anywhere until Monday night. I asked what time she'd be coming downstairs tonight because I haven't heard anything from him lately. "Tomorrow," she replied. Then she added, "Oh man!" I laughed hysterically because I know exactly where she came from. My mom probably feels bad enough already with the breakup fiasco. My brother is amazed that my Mom wouldn't tell him I'm pregnant, but she shouldn't feel guilty saying no thanks. I don't blame her. I hadn't seen him since last fall as he hasn't posted pictures of himself to social media regularly, but yesterday he texted me telling me I look fantastic after having my baby boy! At times, it seems like my mom loves me unconditionally despite my ex cheating on her twice previously. But sometimes it seems like we're putting each other first which makes me wonder if it might be worth taking some time apart long term considering how broken things seem right now. Despite these frustrations, there are moments in life when you realize you actually enjoyed seeing your parents happy far longer than you imagined possible. Maybe someday everyone could appreciate the friendship more than the relationship itself?
