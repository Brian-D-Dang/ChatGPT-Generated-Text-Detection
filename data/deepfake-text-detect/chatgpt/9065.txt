I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that they are less likely to engage in sexual violence than men. And this is where the difference between a man who has been raped or who does not exist and who can be seen in public as a person and should have no right to know what he was doing and are now going through something difficult for different reasons. It's wrong to advocate more serious crimes against men because it will cause more harm due to them being not aware they're raping others. This set up is completely ridiculous. A rapist who is unaware he is committing a crime is unlikely to do anything unless he gets caught. If you want change then please get rid of the rapes on our streets. What I'm talking about is the criminalisation of rape. The intention behind this legislation remains unchanged but can only be considered if someone is guilty enough to commit such crimes so we have a system of punishing those individuals.
