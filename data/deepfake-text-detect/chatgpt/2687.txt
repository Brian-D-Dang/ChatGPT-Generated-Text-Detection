First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people . (A quick look at a few racist ads from back then reveals these stereotypes.) This is why I have no problem with Tosh.0 pulling an old sketch called "Racist Baby" off their show because they found one in their archives where one of the characters was donning blackface. They said, as you would expect them to say: This isn't funny anymore; we've come too far since this bit aired to find humor in it now... blahblahlaa. We get it. You're trying not to be bigoted any more than your ancestors were. Good job! Now move on from committing acts which never should've been committed in the first place! It's part of our shared culture, after all, so maybe there are still things about it that aren't quite right but let us walk forward together instead of dragging each other down. The fact is, however, that there are plenty of very current examples of how insensitive folks can use cultural stereotypes for laughs none of which really feature blacks or African Americans at all, by contrast. The most recent example of this sort of thing comes courtesy of Matt Stone Trey Parker, who do Comedy Central's irreverent animated series South Park. Just recently, these guys threw up a new episode entitled "Trapped In A Closet," wherein Stan gets all upset when he finds his mom is keeping him hostage inside her closet due to fears she has about gay men. His parents try to convince him that being gay is okay and just another sexual orientation; unfortunately, that doesn't go over well with young Stan. Because of course, Stan goes into full-on freakout mode and forces his way out of the closet - only to discover that everyone else had already escaped long ago. But here's the kicker: Everyone else is actually wearing basketball shorts and t-shirts emblazoned with images of white men in blackface - specifically, President Barack Obama sporting dreadlocks, Al Sharpton dressed as Wonder Woman, Oprah Winfrey decked out as Michael Jackson, etc., etc.... I mean, seriously? How does anyone greenlight something like that?! Take a moment and think about what you would feel if someone took the historical connotations of the act of painting one's face in blackface and decided to turn it loose on a 247 network TV channel aimed mostly toward children. Think of what you might imagine the reaction from the NAACP, the media, public officials across America, and even the president himself would be if such a cartoon were ever produced today. And yet somehow, nobody seems to care whatsoever! More interesting is how quickly those two episodes disappeared from YouTube once news of them broke. Sure enough, both videos featured a notice stating ..."this video contains content that may offend some viewers." Wow. That must've taken them seconds to write. What do you suppose they did before computers made headlines writing software? Oh, yes: wrote actual letters. Some poor fellow probably spent hours coming up with that. He deserved better pay for his trouble, especially considering how much time he saved everybody later by avoiding having to type out simple words rather than actually pour his thoughts onto paper and mail them. Again, wow! But again, this is nothing compared to other instances of offensive material involving minorities that manages to make its way past anyone's radar screens without triggering similar outrage. For instance, take a look at Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane's routine during last year's Oscars ceremony. I'll spare you the details, but suffice it to say that a lot of what he says falls under the category of sophomoric racial satire and ends up touching upon subjects that simply shouldn't be joked about anywhere near prime-time television. And I'm sure many thought his performance was hilarious at the time. Well, perhaps we can speak for ourselves and say that we didn't laugh particularly hard at any given joke about Mexicans eating dogs or Asian people using chopsticks. At least, not while thinking about how hurtful the jokes could potentially be towards certain groups of people whom they represent. So in light of all of this controversy surrounding Cartman, Kyle, Mr. Hankey... et al. I ask myself: Why does it seem impossible never to hear anything remotely insulting regarding minority groups until someone decides to put it on the Internet for easy access? Perhaps because society itself is self-censoring itself every day. Or perhaps, perhaps it's true that we want to project a false image to the world, believing that everything is fine with regard to race relations between whites and nonwhites alike. By allowing such deeply offensive material to remain available at our fingertips, perhaps we subconsciously attribute the same level of validity to aforementioned beliefs and thus allow them to persist within our social circles. Of course, this is only my own opinion; others disagree entirely. Hopefully though, we will eventually reach a consensus on the thethth.... lhetbettheatdethet worstontang to..king? clip. butetm blet clip. chick rel
