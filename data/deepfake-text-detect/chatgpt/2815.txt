This is a problem I always encounter when I drive on a highway. The speed limit in the most used highway where I live is 70. I usually go at least 75-80, but sometimes 90 if it's clear and I feel more confident about my driving. However, every time I pass by cops they are staring right at me with their lights flashing and sirens blaring... I get what you're saying here; the police aren't doing themselves any favors to getting people to respect their lawauthority while breaking this one as well. Just be sure that your car meets all safety standards necessary for states who have higher speeds (you can download a PDF of the specs from the manufacturer) because those will come up when they pull you over, and these might not meet requirements anymore.
