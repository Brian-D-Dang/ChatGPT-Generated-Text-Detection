This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is (and this isn't a debate) that such a prescription is not always acceptable to all people. You missed my point where it's ok to say that the growth of sexual relationships is caused by lack of consent. Consent is one thing but medical research has shown that the longer the relationship between a man and another, the more intense he gets in his desire to fuck other men. In fact, it seems even after 70 years the erector structure begins to shrink which reinforces our belief that sex works. This is partly because we believe our bodies do it anyway so now the desire for sex only exists in the form of pleasure from committing to someone else. And you will see that many times over, as well. But while I think it's important for everyone, particularly women, to have the same basic right to get off together, I can see what some might call "the idea of death" getting into every woman's head at some point during her life and that argument may simply be outdated. Many of us don't want to die, especially if we live on for the rest of our lives, so why should everyone feel entitled when they may never have had sex? I find myself thinking that it would be nice if we could stop saying these things now. It does make me wonder how we've done with telling others that their sexuality isn't in question - and just having them stay off the internet long enough to figure out what they're gaybi, rather than disowning them altogether. Of course, no matter how good your option is, you're probably not going anywhere without the consent of both parties involved. The fact that you're unable to tell who you are doesn't mean you won't still like a partner soon either. People need to realize that when it comes down to it, no one wants to know anything about themselves apart from their own genitals. There are plenty of guys that genuinely love each other and there are plenty that love others too. Just ask yourself if you really want to give those two nothing of value whatsoever! You failed miserably, but you shouldn't let this situation deter you or anyone else from continuing their friendship despite being frustrated with the outcome. I'm sorry if the thread turns negative it's been awhile since I read your post! However, a number of readers were very supportive of you. I didn't think of it as an attack on you personally, so I was pretty sure you'd enjoy reading it. Best of luck to you! It's almost as if it was your decision whether or not you wanted to continue to promote them. If you did, I hope a lot of people would be able to sympathize, and maybe they wouldn't mind seeing their friends through the lens of their personal experience. That's something I haven't seen before today.:
