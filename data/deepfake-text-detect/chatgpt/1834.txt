There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man wearing one? or more than 1 pair?). What do you think people are thinking when they see this? They're probably wondering why I'm getting all dressed up for church while running down the street naked at night.
