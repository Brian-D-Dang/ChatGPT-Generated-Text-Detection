Some Definitions Islamism - Political Movements that use Islam to justify either their end goals (ie. a religious state, or "caliphate or the means they use (ie. violence, terrorism). Islamism is distinct from both Sunni and Shia Islam as it is a political movement that uses Islam, but is not synonymous with Islam. Islamism is also distinct from Islamic fundamentalism, in that Islamism is a political movement that uses Islam as part of its ideology, while fundamentalism is an ideology that is based on literal interpretation of the Koran and the Hadith (the life of the Prophet Mohammad). Most Islamic countries are predominantly Islamic in terms of the official religion (ie. Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Pakistan) while many other Muslim countries have Islam as a minority religion. These countries may still have laws that are based on Islamic doctrine, but the laws are interpreted loosely and the majority of the population is not Muslim. The Islamic concept of Jihad is one of the most misunderstood concepts in the west. This concept is a key idea in Islam and many Muslims believe that their faith is incomplete without Jihad. The term Jihad literally means to struggle or fight. The common misconception is that Jihad means holy war, or a violent struggle against infidels or other non-Muslims. The reality is that the concept of Jihad is much more complex and much more peaceful. The core meaning of Jihad in Islam is an internal struggle that Muslims must undertake to resist their own evil impulses, such as greed, lust, and jealousy. The internal struggle can be physical, but is more likely to take place in the mind and the soul. In 1998, former President Bill Clinton signed a bill to allow the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) to open an office in Washington, D.C. The PLO was recognized by the United States government as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. This was a major victory for the PLO. In 2004, the United Nations voted to recognize the State of Palestine and to establish a Palestinian Authority, with full recognition of Palestine as a "non-member observer state." The Palestinian Authority is the government of the Palestinians, and is responsible for both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority is led by President Mahmoud Abbas, who is the Fatah party leader. Abbas is also the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, which is the political party of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian Authority is a body that was created in 1994 as part of the Oslo Accords, which was the beginning of the peace process between the Palestinians and the Israelis. The Oslo Accords is named after the Oslo, Norway, location of the signing of the agreement. The Oslo Accords created the Palestinian National Authority, which was the government that would rule over the Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority is based in the West Bank, with the capital of the Palestinian Authority being in Ramallah. In the late 1980s, Palestinian terrorist groups began to be formed, which started a terrorist campaign to attack Israel. These groups included the Palestine Liberation Front, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. All of these groups were designated as terrorist organizations by the United States government. These groups carried out terrorist attacks against civilians and were responsible for many deaths and injuries. The Fatah Party (led by Yasser Arafat) was formed in 1958 and was officially recognized as the main Palestinian political party. The Fatah Party was closely affiliated with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which was founded in 1964. The PLO has been recognized by the United States and other countries as the representative of the Palestinian people. The PLO was responsible for planning and carrying out terrorist attacks against Israel. The Fatah Party was closely associated with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, which was the major terrorist group that carried out attacks against Israel. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the PLO was responsible for many terrorist attacks against civilians in Israel, including a series of bombings in 1985 that killed 14 people. In 1993, the PLO officially recognized the right of Israel to exist and ren
