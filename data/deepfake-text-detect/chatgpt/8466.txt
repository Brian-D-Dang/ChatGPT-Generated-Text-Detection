Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one of my fiances has a really bad day and doesn't want to have sexual relations with me? If we are married should he be obligated by his religious beliefs (and mine) that our marriage is forever until death do us part?" If you forced your SO into having intercourse every time they didn't feel like it would still not make them "happy" because their brain chemistry makes this reaction regardless whether there was an actual threat present at all times during such incidents as these; so therefore if someone wants certain behaviors performed on top off consent then coercion occurs which results from people telling others what actionswords will earn negative reactions due solely upon someones own comprehension level regarding human psychology... Which means forcefully obtaining action against ones free-will can never lead anywhere other than failure 100 percent guaranteed! In essence forcing another person's hand does nothing but encourage more hostility between individuals over trivial matters etcetera... It also underlines why children who were coerced via words only grow up believing themselves entitled without question within relationships where love exists - they've learned how vulnerable adults actually react viscerally towards each breaking point outside both parties' control unless thus behavior becomes habituated through comfort levels built insidiously overtimeTo those reading please take note before attempting anything remotely similarotherwise its nature simply forces everyone involved back onto equal footing making ANY attempt plain stupidity childishness unworthy even considering let alone acting out!!
