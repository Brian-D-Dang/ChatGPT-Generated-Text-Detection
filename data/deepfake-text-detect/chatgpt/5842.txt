Oat blenders. Mini spooners. Coco roos. Honey Scooters. You know them. You see them in the cereal section of any grocery store. They are in giant bags in a metal cylinder, filled with 12 or 24 little oatmeal "scoops." What you may not realize is that each oatmeal scoop only has 10 calories. Sure, it's not much, but that's a lot of calories to get in 12 or 24 servings of oatmeal. That's a whopping 100 calories or more if you have the 24-serving size. Oatmeal is packed with fiber and is a low-glycemic food. You can also make your own oatmeal scoopers. Scooping oatmeal is not easy. You know you've used a scooper when you find yourself with oatmeal in your nostrils and in places you'd rather not be. A while back I was inspired to make my own. I found directions for a simple one online and modified it slightly. I used a small plastic cup. You could use any plastic cup, but the 24 oz. size is a good size and the handle is a nice size. Then I took some more plastic and cut out circles. I used a 2 inch plate and cut two circles. I think the size should be about 14-13 inch. Place the bottom circle in the bottom of the cup. Then place the top circle on top of the bottom circle. Make sure that the top circle fits tightly and is centered on the bottom circle. I used a glue gun to glue the bottom circle. To be honest, I probably would have just used a hot glue gun, but I didn't have one at home. You don't need to use a glue gun, but it is nice if you have one. I'm not sure if this is necessary, but I put a little bit of glue on the inside of the top circle before placing it over the bottom circle. After gluing, I filled the cup with oatmeal. And scooped out my oatmeal! And, here is the finished product. I'm not really sure who it's for. I guess I could give it to a friend and say "you're welcome" for making the scooper. Make your own and you'll never have oatmeal in your nostrils again! You can also find a pdf version of the instructions here. How much money would you save if you made your own oatmeal scooper? I am going to save the one I make and give it to my son to use at college. It's so cute and the best part is that I can make it any size. I would save about 20.00 for a 24-serving size, depending on how many I made. I just buy a 32 ounce bag of Quaker Instant Oatmeal and I use it for a week or so. That is so cute! I love the idea of making it myself. I will have to do that. I have a large container of Quaker Oats and use it for a week. This would be a great way to help save money! What a great idea! I need to try this, our grocery stores don't carry any of the oatmeal scoops, I always end up having to buy a bag of oats. I am also a fan of no-cook oatmeal, and I have a container of oatmeal in my fridge right now. I usually just scoop it out of the bag... but I can see where it would be easier to use one of these! Thanks for the link, I think I may make a few of these, I use one of those oatmeal scoopers all the time! I've got some of those scoopers that I never use... this is perfect! Thanks for the idea! I'm going to try this out, I love Quaker instant oatmeal too. I like to use oatmeal in my baking so I tend to keep a large container in the cupboard. I have one of those oatmeal scoopers from the grocery store and I use it to make my oatmeal every morning. I really like your idea of making your own. I can save a lot of money by making my own! I use the o
