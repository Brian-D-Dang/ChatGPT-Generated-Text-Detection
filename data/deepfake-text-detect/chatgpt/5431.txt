I believe that a private business should be able to deny service to anyone for any reason. For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, they could not refuse service to any person who would teach them the language or figure out what speech was offensive under the Conservative Party law as well without being accused of discrimination based on race. The government is arguing it does not support equal rights because it believes no one deserves special treatment and rules against minority groups from offending other people regardless of their religion or ethnicity.
