I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured (or forced) into using her husband's name if she prefers to keep it as hers alone...but that said, your son will probably find himself getting lumped in more than once for being "just like his dad." We considered this too and are leaning toward him having my maiden name instead!
