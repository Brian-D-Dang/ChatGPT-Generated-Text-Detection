In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals and the owners do not care. A large number of pets are being kept alive by tube feeding and other forms of lifelong support. The government has introduced a law whereby pets are not to be kept in an unsuitable environment and they have to be properly cared for and fed. In Malta our animals are treated very differently and pets are merely considered as an outdoor pet. The Animal Welfare Bill which is in discussion does not address any of the basic needs of the animals. The bill does not deal with the cruelty being inflicted to the pets by their owners. In the street the pets have no shelter from the elements. The bill only addresses the "no-cage" concept which is not a solution as the dogs and cats can continue to be treated as outdoor pets. There are no rules or guidelines in this bill which will ensure that the pets are properly cared for and fed. I would like to put forward a suggestion to the government as to how they can improve the bill and make it more effective. I would like to suggest that they can introduce some basic rules and guidelines in the bill to ensure that the pets are properly cared for and fed. In many cases the dogs and cats are being kept in sheds or warehouses. In this case they can be tube-fed or given fresh food daily by the owners. However there are cases where the dogs and cats are not fed. They are simply left in the streets to fend for themselves. They have no shelter from the elements and the weather conditions are terrible. These pets cannot regulate their meals and are starving themselves to death. As I mentioned earlier the pets can be tube-fed or given fresh food daily. In this way they will receive the food that they need. The bill should provide for these basic needs so that the pets are looked after. In this way the animals will be properly cared for. This is a more humane way of dealing with the pets and this will reduce the suffering of the pets. I suggest that the bill should include guidelines that will ensure that the pets are properly cared for and fed. I trust that the government will listen to my suggestions and act on them.
