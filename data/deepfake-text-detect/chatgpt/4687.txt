The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. Even so, I'd still say it's your responsibility to look after your own skin (and hair). And what the heck do people mean when they talk about "a great job" of doing their face? Everyone does that! They're just trying to be nice. It's like saying that someone did a good job painting their house and roofing their roof- there's nothing wrong with either of them as long as we can see clearly underneath. So, yes folks- always wash your hands in soap before eatingdrinking anything. If you don't have access to clean water then use alcohol based hand sanitizers instead. Wash your mouth out with saltwater gargle every couple hours to keep germs away from your throat and head. Drink lots of fluids: i'm talking at least 2 liters per day minimum. You should also avoid antibiotics unless absolutely necessary; most bacterial infections of the skin will go away on its' own without any treatment whatsoever. Lastly, apply sunblock everyday and wear a wide brimmed hat. A SPF 15 sunscreen protection factor foamcream would work best for me since I wouldn't want too much goop covering my entire body all the time. Soap Sunscreen The ultimate combination!
