While it may be true that winning a competition or game is a desirable outcome, it is important to recognize that participation in itself is also valuable. Giving everyone a participation trophy encourages participation and motivates children to continue trying even if they don't win. It promotes a growth mindset and teaches children that effort and perseverance are also important values. Additionally, children who may not have the same natural abilities as others may still benefit from the experience of participating and learning new skills. For these reasons, participation trophies can be a positive reinforcement and should not be dismissed as undeserved.
