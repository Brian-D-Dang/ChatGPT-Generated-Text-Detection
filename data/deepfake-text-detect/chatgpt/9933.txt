I'm a lifelong veggie, and I've been vegan for a while in the past although I'm not anymore. I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being a vegan without taking into account the ethical, environmental and nutritional benefits of a vegetarian diet. However, I still believe that veganism can be a great choice for many people and is an important step towards reducing animal suffering and creating a more sustainable food system.
