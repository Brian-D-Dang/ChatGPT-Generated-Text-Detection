For those who don't know, the trolley problem is this: You and another person are on a bridge which is over a trolley track. 5 people are tied to the track below the bridge. If you do nothing, the trolley will strike and kill the 5 people. If you do nothing, you will be killed. If you push the fat guy in front of you off the bridge, the trolley will stop and not strike the 5 people. If you push the fat guy in front of you off the bridge, you will be killed. What do you do? Well, it's a stupid question, because we know that the trolley is going to run over the fat guy. So we push the fat guy. But what if the fat guy wasn't fat? If the fat guy was skinny, would you push him? Well, the problem isn't the weight of the fat guy, it's whether or not you think you're going to be killed if you don't push him. If he's fat, he'll weight more than you. If he's skinny, you'll be dead. So, you push the fat guy. But what if the fat guy was one of the 5 people tied to the track? Well, then it's OK to push him, because if you don't, the fat guy will get killed, and the other 5 people will live. But what if you knew that the fat guy was one of the 5 people tied to the track? Well, that's different. Then you wouldn't push him, because he wouldn't die. But what if you knew that the fat guy was the only person tied to the track, and if you pushed him off the bridge, he'd be killed, but if you didn't push him off the bridge, he'd be fine? Well, that's different. That's the right answer. You push the fat guy. You push the fat guy because you're worried about yourself. The fat guy's life is not a consideration. If the fat guy isn't fat, why would you push him? You're not killing the fat guy. You're letting the fat guy die. But if the fat guy isn't fat, why would you let him die? What if he was the only person tied to the track? But if the fat guy isn't fat, why would you save him? He'll die anyway. But if the fat guy isn't fat, why would you save him? He's dead anyway. But if the fat guy isn't fat, why would you save him? The fat guy's life is not a consideration. Well, it's not a stupid question. It's a very stupid question.
