First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean I would like it. Second, this is about as close to realistic as it gets. There are no female characters in this game so there's really nothing to stress about here either. There are female characters. They're just pretty much (and understandably) invisible from the player perspective unless you know where to look for them and how to interpret what's going on. The only thing that makes up for it is the fact that they feel hot and smokinhot while doing so.
