For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system where there are multiple goals that government can set out to achieve and chooses which goods will be produced according those guidelines." The reason why socialism fails in practice (as opposed theoretical) seems obvious: if you allow people not only freedom but also power over other human beings' lives then they inevitably choose for themselves...not all great things! Yet their choices might harm society or worse yet others who have nothing whatsoever do them wrong - like children whose future has been spoiled by unwise parents trying consciously being bad role models etc.. How much better would it've worked had these same kids grown up under full-fledged socialist rule? The problem isn't necessarily absolutes either; just because some problems were solved does NOT mean every single incident was handled perfectly neither should we think so narrowmindedly about life's issues....there must always exist room enough somewhere else [elsewhere shadesrealms] on earth in heaven before anyone could claim perfection exists anywhere at anytime!! If anything perfects itself without bringing any improvements along thus making us lose what initially made our existence worthwhile.....perhaps its good thing afterall?! There comes an age when ethics stops working!!!:-O
