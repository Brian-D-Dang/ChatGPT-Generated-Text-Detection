First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are frayed in the past few years because of agriculture and farming practices caused by climate change but let that happen without any intervention from humans! Let nature do its job! I will admit I'm a bit biased towards pandas cause of the small bird population for some reason, but I don't see them as prey animals due to their size considered dangerous or aggressive animals rather than protective predators. Pandas get eaten by foxes if you give them too much attention which can lead to extinction so it's not too difficult to monitor populations when conflicts occur with these birds throughout the world; however humans have been killing off pandas lately causing conflicts over food sources also causing conflicts between humans and pandas Oh yeah zero violations here, pandas were not hunted down in the past and it was just another example of how humansnature overlap
