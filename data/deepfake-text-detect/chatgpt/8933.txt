Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better. If that is so, what is the point? I am not saying there isn't a place for fiction in our lives. Also, the fact that it helps us understand something as simple as how to create one of these versions makes me feel more educated about the subject matter and gives better insight into why certain people don't like this movie. But, when you create a version without any new facts or theories, you make yourself sound smarter by making assumptions. That's not what I'm trying to say here. When creating this version, I want to figure out how long will I be successful with it in terms of getting a rational reaction from my audience (including myself). What would have been possible if the plot had been based on true events instead of just existing in fictional characters who didn't exist during the plot arc? A story where only a few characters existed though? Or a storyline that ran forever? Something else that wouldn't require a lot of rewrites? In an era where the average person has less time than they need to write a novel, having enough free time to read a story can seem reasonable. The idea that we're living in "an age where computers have become just another tool" seems even more plausible given the breadth of research and technological advances that have made writing some form of fiction possible. Is it really that hard to imagine ourselves a bit older today, because it was after the internet launched a century ago?
