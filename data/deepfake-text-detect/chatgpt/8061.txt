Hi guys! To expand: Although I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman for example) a woman to their face and when talking about them (for the most part, don't do it often), but in writing or speaking with another person that is not transgender specifically... It's just wrong. If you are going by "transgender" as your umbrella term of choice then yeah sure; could be an issue if they prefer male pronouns over female ones - except no one should have this preference anyway so regardless what words people say during casual conversation doesn't matter really doescan mean - unless we knew each other well enough before hand where there was some basis on which even choosing gender specific terms can make sense... ermm? Yeah too much information sorry:P
