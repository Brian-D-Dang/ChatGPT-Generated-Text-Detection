It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing I find interesting in this article is how much of an impact China has on the world economy relative to other countries globally. There are also some cases where China has been instrumental in shifting fortunes for Western-based companies (e.g., finance) or even outsmarting American tech giants (e.g., Apple). Chinese technology development was especially important when Western nations were moving away from the reliance on Chinese companies as a source of capital. That trend may have actually accelerated with globalization, but it's still unclear exactly why. The biggest advantage of China now is that it allows companies to diversify their product portfolio while being more efficient than it had previously. In contrast to prior generations of Chinese startup founders who could not get a job because of the lack of quality products, after the Korean War it became easier for them. This is something we can only discuss in greater detail here: Chinese government investing heavily into high-quality talent acquisition and management programs at universities like Harvard, MIT, and Stanford during the 1980s. While the potential for foreign investment increases exponentially over time, it remains an area that interest and support must be maintained to ensure continued growth. Meanwhile, when it comes to developing both domestically and internationally, most of those investments come back to the US alone. Comparable efforts are underway at several universities in Europe, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and just about any country outside the United States. The same goes for India; relatives of many Indians bring home the goods they need to start businesses and manage their lives abroad. To conclude, I think there will always be opportunities for China to advance itself. Even if some of these times feel hard to write about, I hope you'll read through this process and learn a little bit about what our country stands for. We've created a great way to grow your business behind the scenes by writing about how China is helping your small businesses succeed - and keeping them running.
