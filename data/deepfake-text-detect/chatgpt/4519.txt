Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. These ideas were once considered scientific truths. As humans became more sophisticated and learned to cultivate civilization's first civilizing tools science and reason these beliefs took on an air of finality. But in fact cows have been doing none of the things we've claimed for them and still do so today. There is no credible evidence that even one pair of cows has ever made any kind of plan or decision regarding anything at all. Nor could there be since the only thing that can happen "forwardly" as far as the universe goes (or backward) is light, which moves with incredible speed relative to us. That means nothing travels through time from past to present but merely alters its direction of travel. In other words, every single idea about what makes cows tick isn't true. We now know, though, that this doesn't mean the truth lies hidden somewhere beyond our reach waiting to be discovered. It turns out it was only conventional wisdom because very few people thought very hard about what reality actually consists of: namely, ordinary physical objects like cows coupled together via causal interactions. The real question is how you predict something when you don't yet know where a potential outcome might come from, i.e., how many combinations of environmental factors will cause X to occur? You use probability theory to calculate such outcomes; in general terms, if two previous occurrences led to A happening then the next occurrence should lead to B occurring rather than C. And it works! So much for my claim before that scientists knew just enough mathematics to confuse themselves. The development of quantum mechanics further illustrated why predicting events requires combining probabilistic rules with statistics. This form of reasoning is necessary since each event only happens some particular fraction of the time. Quantum mechanical predictions require taking statistical averages over lots of individual particles, and the mathematical machinery used to describe those probabilities must also take into account uncertainty. In short, prediction using quantum mechanics coincidentally resembles some aspects of human thinking especially the ability to combine guesswork, intuition and empiricism into reasonable conclusions. So here's another challenge for naturalists or anyone else who wants to explain consciousness. Use mathematics instead of reducing complex phenomena to simpler ones and demonstrate that your approach can generate accurate predictions. If you can't do this work yourself, let someone else tackle the problem for you. Then show you understood the relevant math required: regressions, linear regression analysis, multivariable regression analysis, log-linear models, multiple comparison tables etc.. Once you pass this test, I think most laypeople would agree that you'd achieved success. Here's a hint - it won't help you predict where the traffic lights are going to turn red rather than green but solving the mystery of consciousness may well do precisely that...
