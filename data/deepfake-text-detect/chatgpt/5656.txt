I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually from richer families and can afford to pay for it. Public schools however have to deal with the fact that children come from different backgrounds with different income levels. The children who get placed in public schools are usually the children of the poor who dont have the means to pay for private schools. Public schools have to deal with many of these problems when it comes to their students. I think the same resources should be divided for both public and private schools. I believe that private schools should be in the same status as public schools. Private schools should be accredited by the same organization that is accrediting the public schools. They should both have the same resources available to them. It's not fair to have some children attending better schools while other children attend inferior schools.

I feel as though private schools should be funded by the parents that are choosing to send their children there. Private schools often have better resources for their students, and parents are willing to pay for that. I do not think private schools should be funded by the government.

If parents want to send their children to private schools then they should have to pay for it. I agree that tax payer money should be given to private schools but only when they are accredited. I think that all private schools should have the same rules as public schools. It doesn't make sense for them to be treated any different. I feel that it is not fair for private schools to be receiving any public money. I feel that parents should be responsible for their child's education, and if they want to send them to a private school then they should pay for it, not the tax payers.
