First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and if you've done a crime, then you should pay for your crime with some proportionate penalty. That said, I don't think "life in jail without parole" is actually equivalent to life imprisonment; there's no reason why someone who was convicted under California's three strikes law as a teenager must spend their whole natural life inside regardless of whether or not they ever commit another offense. In fact, this is an issue where we have too much discretion on how long people can be sentenced to terms which are unreasonably long but at least it has been acknowledged by courts such that reasonable cases will likely end up being shorter sentences than third strike lifers receive.
