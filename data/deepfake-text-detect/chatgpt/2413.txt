I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This doesn't mean he's a better choice than Clinton, though - I think both candidates have their own strong points in addressing racial inequalityjustice if given access to power; but this detail does not make me feel like one should vote strategically or tactically against Hillary due to her perceived racist tendencies. This sounds very reasonable
