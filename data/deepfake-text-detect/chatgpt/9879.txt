After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific sense. The idea of free will is a difficult concept to understand, as it requires an individual to act or think of their own accord, without being influenced by external forces or predetermined events. While there are some philosophical arguments in favor of free will, most scientific evidence suggests that human behavior and decision-making is largely determined by our genetic makeup, environment, and the choices of those around us. This means that free will is not a tangible thing, but instead an abstract concept used to describe the idea that we have control over our own destiny. Ultimately, whether or not free will exists is still up for debate, and each person must decide what they believe in terms of this topic.
