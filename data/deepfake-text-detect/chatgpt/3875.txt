I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit card debt run for president. See if he did this back in the 70s or 80s people would have come out and said it was a terrible idea (since then Republicans have become obsessed with checking ID's at the polls). Nowadays its just blatant racism and partisanship.
