Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word mariage, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to Latin and finally to Medieval English where it became used in everyday life. However what I find interesting is that back when marriage was an uncommon thing for women who fell pregnant. This has changed over time with men being able to get married at any age but women are more limited, however this does not seem to be considered by many people today. I think our society still views pregnancy differently based on gender - if you're female having a child outside of wedlock makes your character less likeable whereas male characters will often have their actions viewed as heroic or even romantic because they were willing to 'take responsibility' (which I know sounds very sexist). Even though we do see more equality portrayed through media now there seems to me to remain some deep rooted stereotypes about how parents react towards children depending whether they came into existance out of wedlock vs within-wedlock? Can anyone else comment on whyhow these conventions continue throughout history and i wonder if attitudes would change given enough exposure (?)
