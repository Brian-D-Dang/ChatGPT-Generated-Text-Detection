Being transgender and wanting surgeryhormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think it's really important for people who want to change their circumstances to be able to do this but not for them to have to go through the entire process of seeking gender reassignment surgery, which has been extremely difficult because there are different types of surgeries performed on women requiring hormone replacement therapy compared to men. I am very much against cosmetic procedures for women in general. It makes me sick that we treat women like animals when they basically never get any kind of experience with transitioning from one woman to another. You can't say if someone is going to do something that is 100 natural, it depends on what type of sex was used and whether or how the doctors felt about it. There's also the fact that abortions and abortions aren't legally considered medical decisions, and I don't believe that there should be exceptions for anyone just because they want to transition at some point in life. However, it's effective at addressing issues around deciding whether abortion is medically necessary - and then it takes away options for days after that. Ultimately, it's important for people to know who is vulnerable and what sort of risks will they face at the end of the day. And from my perspective, trying to protect women shouldn't be a decision made lightly. They deserve the right to make it easy for everyone else so that they can move forward with their lives regardless of whether or not they have to deal with their own gender dysphoria.
