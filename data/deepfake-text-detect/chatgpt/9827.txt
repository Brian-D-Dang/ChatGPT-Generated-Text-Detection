I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot someone who is not a threat to them? It is important to remember that police officers are human beings, and they make mistakes. They are also put in very difficult situations where they must make split-second decisions about whether or not to use deadly force. When making these decisions, officers may be operating on incomplete information, and could make the wrong call. In addition, some officers may have poor judgement, or may act out of fear or anger. It is important to remember that police officers have an incredibly difficult job, and while there are cases of excessive force, most officers take their responsibility seriously and strive to protect the public.
