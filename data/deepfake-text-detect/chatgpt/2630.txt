I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community, but when it comes down to what kind of sex people have in their bedrooms, I find monogamy preferable. As for gay men who want children (and happen to be straight) they will usually adopt. If you choose to raise your kids with an adopted child then there is no problem at all! The only thing wrong here is forcing a situation where someone has to go through adoption laws if heshe wants biological offspring...
