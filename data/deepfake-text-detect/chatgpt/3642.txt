Written hastily, but hopefully I can clarify any mistakes in comments, here we go: The Confederacy was racist according to the cornerstone speech and secession papers (tx): [Cornerstone Speech] excerpt Thank you for the additional information. Based on the Cornerstone Speech and secession papers, it is clear that the Confederacy was founded on racist and discriminatory beliefs. The cornerstone speech, given by Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens, explicitly states that the Confederacy's "corner-stone" is "the Negro is not equal to the white man" and that slavery is the "immediate cause" of their secession from the Union. This rhetoric is echoed in the secession papers of Texas, which state that "all white men" are entitled to their "inalienable right" to slavery, and that the "subordination" of African Americans is necessary for the preservation of their society. These documents demonstrate the Confederate states' commitment to maintaining a system of racial inequality and oppression, which cannot be overlooked or excused.
