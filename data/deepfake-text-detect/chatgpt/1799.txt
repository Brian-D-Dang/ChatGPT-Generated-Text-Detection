For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to my friends' experiences with it (it's brought up multiple times during our conversations). So basically what you're saying is that if anything sexual happened between me and two women or more than one woman at the same time then they should not have any regrets?
