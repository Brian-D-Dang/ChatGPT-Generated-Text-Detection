Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from rec). My experience was that there were very few girls who played and even fewer good ones. So in high school I focused on track field because of how many female athletes participated compared to soccer (like 40:1). This has given me an honest question for you - what are we losing by having more males than females play sports? Good topic! Also check out this talk about leadership in education:
