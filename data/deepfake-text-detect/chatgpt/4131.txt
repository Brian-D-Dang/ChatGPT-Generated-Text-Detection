First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and know for a fact what has been going on there lately. I have two sons who are both involved with Boy Scouts of America (BSA). My oldest son is 13 years old now and will be entering his first year as an Eagle Scout next month. He began scouting when he was 9 years old and nearly half a century before being able to vote or drive! My younger son is already enrolled as a Cub Scout. While we haven't gotten confirmation yet, I sincerely doubt they are cutting Scout troops - this may all just be rumor mill talk. The fact remains that it's all happening right under our noses. My guess would say that the BSA is trying to control the number of boys coming through their doors because they can see how big the demand is for them. They are also getting more and more involved in coaching sports and other extracurricular activities which they expect to expand over the next few decades. They do not want to get left behind! There is a lot of money at stake here so you can bet your bottom dollar that they want to make sure kids come through their door every single time. In my opinion, the BSA appears to be losing ground every day by allowing this sort of thing happen. Now that I've expressed some feelings on this issue, let me give a brief summary of the issues facing Scouting today: Scouting For All Boys: The new "universal" Scouting program that gives a three-year membership to anyone between 6 and 17 years of age is clearly designed to create an exclusive club where only the most select elite members can go out into the world to earn badges. Unfortunately, this model does nothing but divide up the youth along classifications like "high achiever," "elite athlete," etc. Instead, this kind of isolation creates a culture that puts more emphasis on peer approval rather than merit badges. When young people grow up lacking confidence in themselves or their abilities, they don't find the right outlets for those inclinations. A variety of ways are available for adults to influence their youth and encourage self worth and self esteem. More parental involvement in their child's growth and development is one such way. But instead of using that power to inspire and motivate children, the new universal Scouting program makes it seem like a contest to prove who can be the best! It is interesting that this type of environment seems to be prevalent even amongst priests, doctors, judges, teachers and military leaders; however, these individuals manage to work together in order to accomplish great things while remaining humble and focused on the mission of truth. Scouters for All: This program eliminates the distinction between men and women scouts. Everyone - male or female - can become a scout if they wish. This leads to a very blurred line because it doesn't really matter whether or not you participate in Scouting, from the point of view of a kid, if you join it after high school. To add insult to injury, the gender distinction is eliminated once they begin taking girls. Why? Because "scouting can change lives." No problem there, right? Well...I mean, maybe. If a girl joins after she graduates from high school, then she must still meet the same requirements that apply to her boy neighbor. And since boys girls meet different standards during scouting, why wouldn't they run into logistical problems later on down the road? I think that every adult needs to ask themselves a question every single day, either aloud or silently - What do I care what happens to others? Do I truly care enough to be concerned about the outcome of what happens around me? Do I value the friendships and relationships I love too much to allow myself to worry about someone else's happiness? Or, should I try harder to understand others and empathize with them? Which one is better? When was the last time I was genuinely happy or fulfilled in my life? That's the important question. Hopefully you answered yourself long ago. If not, then this might be an opportunity for a refresher course!
