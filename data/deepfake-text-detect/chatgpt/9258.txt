I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by "on this one," but I can't think it's worth potentially potentially ruining a friendship with another person over, and I don't think it's worth potentially compromising the line between friends and acquaintances." It is an important topic, but I don't think I'm so far out on this that it's worth potentially wasting the time or friendship that person has with you for enough potential fun to a potentially prank-worthy person (a rival that is not a friendfriend) just for the sake of potentially destroying a relationship with someone else).
