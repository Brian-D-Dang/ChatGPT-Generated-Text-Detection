Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from my hometown youth program). I was very passionate about the sport and put a lot of time, effort and money into making it to the next level. I never really had any injuries besides one broken finger, but my dream was to play in college. I ended up getting into a D3 school and loved it! I still played and even made a few all-region teams. But to make a long story short, after 3 years of D3, I quit soccer. I wasn't really being recruited anymore (no D1 schools were interested), and I felt like my passion was gone. Too many injuries and being away from family, I wanted to be home. I do not regret my decision though. But I have always wondered if I should have stayed at D3 school. I'm not sure if this would have helped me get a full ride at a D1 school (I don't think it would have since I was never getting any offers). But my question is, would playing D3 be a good choice for CMV kids who really want to play college soccer, but don't have the talent to play at a D1 level? Or is it worth just sticking with the youth club program. I would love to hear your opinions. THe girl with the CMV is now a junior in high school. She was in 2nd grade when diagnosed and was in a wheelchair for most of her life. She can now walk a few steps without using her walker but still has CMV symptoms and has been diagnosed with vestibular problems. She is a very active girl and plays volleyball and basketball for her school. She was never athletic until she was diagnosed with CMV. She wanted to play sports with the other kids but wasn't sure what she could do. But she is a fighter and always works hard at everything she does. She has excelled at school and sports. She has a 3.6 GPA and is on the Honor Roll. She has been asked to play basketball for a local college but is unsure if it is a good idea. She is also a good student and would love to go to college. She would like to major in business. She has never been to a college game. Any advice for her? My daughter was diagnosed with CMV in 2011. She was a freshman in high school at the time. She had been a very active child, playing volleyball, basketball and ran track. She had no idea how sick she was until she started getting sick. She went from being an all star volleyball player to having to quit. She was never the same after that. She had to quit basketball too due to her recurring infections and severe sinus infections. She has always been a good student. In high school, she was in the advanced classes and took AP classes. She was on the Honor Roll and received a scholarship to play basketball for a D3 school. She is now a sophomore in college and has been asked to join the team again. But she is unsure if she wants to do it. I know it would be great to be able to play sports again, but she is also very smart and wants to be successful. She is having a hard time deciding if she should play. Any advice for her? I was diagnosed with CMV when I was a senior in high school and was asked to join the basketball team. I was the first player they had asked to join the team since the previous senior graduated. I was a good student, had a 3.8 GPA and was a very athletic child. I played volleyball, basketball and ran track. I was a very popular kid, but was never really the "cool" kid. I wanted to be. I wanted to be a cheerleader and would have done anything to make the cheerleading squad. But I was never asked, not because I was a CMV kid, but because I was kind of a nerd. I was always picked last in sports and was never a cheerleader. I was one of the "good students." After I was diagnosed, I was never the same. I could not keep up with the other girls. I had a very hard time doing anything. I became very depressed and always felt sick. I just wanted to give up and not have to keep working so hard at everything. I was a 4.0 student and always took AP classes. I was on the Honor Roll every year of school. But I became very moody and angry, and
