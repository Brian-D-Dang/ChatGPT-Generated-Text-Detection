Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for either side though... Manuals are good on hills because of the gearing; you shift a lot slower than an automatic and your pedal travel is more consistent even if it doesn't have as long to provide power. The main thing auto wins out by is being able to go into reverse without having to lift off the gasbrakewhatever, but that's pretty minor compared to no extra gear at all.
