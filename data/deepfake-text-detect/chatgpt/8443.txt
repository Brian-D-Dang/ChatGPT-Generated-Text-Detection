I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the fact people think this is justifiable behavior. Do you have any idea how expensive it can get? Now let me tell y'all about my visit with Dr 2 (the guy in question). He "went overboard" as well when he tested every single part of her body from arms all downwards under what was apparently his wifedaughter-in law supervision or something like so because she had some sorta weird phobia problem involving cranes (!), but anyway they concluded there were no illnesses involved according their test results which coincidentally showed up negative upon review! They did not perform even one blood analysis nor said anything out loud concerning say mercury poisoning...but still charged 1k!!! But now since being faced agains lawsuits we're paying them more money than before - plus lawyer fees too YIKES!! Anyway folks turn your backs away cuz here comes thistardy slop makin dumbass McBiscuit whore manna falling right behind....YUMMY!!!!
