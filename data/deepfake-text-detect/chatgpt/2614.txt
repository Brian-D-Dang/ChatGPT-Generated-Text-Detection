Let me start off by stating what I believe the reddit basic income theory is. From what I have read from rbasicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society there will be no money and everyone will live happily ever after (or something like that). This is not at all my belief. Basic income is the least important of any issue facing our current generation. We are trying to solve problems which require billions of people living without sufficient food or water or any other number of issues. All we need now is some means for these people to survive until they can find their own solution, and it doesn't matter if this survival comes through making art or working as an accountant. All we need now is some means for these people to survive So you agree with communism?
