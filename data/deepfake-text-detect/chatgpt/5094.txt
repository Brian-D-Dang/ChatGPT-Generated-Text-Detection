EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one should try it at least once for the sake of clarity if you don't have other interests than just watching videos or reading articles about SEO on YouTube, which is where I am from anyway." The professor also told Forbes that he has struggled with blogging since leaving MIT Media Labs because his academic work was mostly done online so he wasn't sure what the right process would look like when dealing with a large amounts of traffic including social media posts as well as Google AdWords campaigns. "I've been trying to figure out how best to manage these types of pages," he said. The professor explained he doesn't know whether Google Ads Manager will replace Google Analytics management - and whether advertisers can rely solely on Facebook ads or if they need assistance finding more suitable sites to advertise their content too. But he noted that Facebook ads likely wouldn't succeed unless advertisers could find a way around Google's ad monitoring system. In fact, the professor said this might require monitoring Facebook ads by using different algorithms such as Google Analytics instead. "Google does not want advertising revenue sharing between websites; therefore, there isn't any reason advertisers couldn't use Google Analytics to monitor ads within Facebook" he added. "Creating an API for ads targeting mostly depends upon understanding its meaning before deploying them" - and learning more about how the program works - but if Google AdMob detects that ads are being targeted by ads programs, there may not be much advantage over Facebook AdWords. "Using AdMob could give us full control over our audience data without compromising personal privacy."
