I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. I grew up with a rich father and a poor mother. The latter spent a lot of money on college, and the former was careful not to borrow. I want a future where my family will never have to worry about debt again.
