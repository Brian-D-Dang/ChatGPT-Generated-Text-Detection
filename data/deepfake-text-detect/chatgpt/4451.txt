Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the law, it's no longer enough for someone to just tell "a materially false or fictitious statement under oath or affirmation made during an investigation of specified unlawful activity;" they must also know their statements are false and intend them as such when making those lies under oath (or affirm). But you can be prosecuted even if your story may not have been totally untrue, told with total ignorance for the whole truth by lying while under oath, like this: While testifying before Congress about ClimateGate, Michael Mann was asked whether he had ever falsified data on graph that appears to show global temperatures rising steadily since 1880. He said no. Then Rep. Bart Stupak showed him the temperature chart and pointed out two areas where there clearly were anomalies - one in , and another in 1998. That is when Rep. Gottheimer interrupted and put his finger over both parts and demanded to hear from whoever prepared the charts use what happened around 1980 because that is directly related to climate change. Since Mann wasn't involved in preparing the charts, we never found out who did but his answer to this question gave us some clue. Instead of admitting to something very serious, he lied about being involved with the preparation of the graphs showing global temps going up like crazy, all without knowing anything about how hard work our entire country does every year trying to figure out why global temps seem to suddenly go down using long term historical records. His lie could cost him millions at tax payer expense. If only Congressman gottheimers in congress hadn't done something really dumb, then maybe this would all make sense....but hey...you gotta take away rights first before you give anyone else liberty..... Remember my post yesterday? The IRS announced today that income earners who claim certain deductions for items like haircuts, clothing, grooming expenses etc will now need to provide receipts to prove each expenditure i.e. if I get my hair cut once every 3 months for 8 weeks straight, I'll better bring proof that shows me doing so AND I don't spend 50 per haircut! This applies to ANY deduction the taxpayer claims. For example, let's say A B file jointly, and they claim itemized deductions. Let's further state that B hasn't worked outside home lately which means she gets child care support from her parents, and has borrowed money to pay off credit card debt thus far. She wants to buy a new car ... So A takes the hit for her child care costs, says to herself that the money comes partially form family members who wouldn't want to see her fail financially, and therefore lets B borrow 5k against the value of their house. Are these justifiable reasons to deduct this amount from their taxes? Well according to this new rule, B can just stop borrowing money until 2013! And A won't owe back taxes for 5K plus interest charges, cause they didn't report the full amount paid towards purchase of vehicle. But wait..there's more!!!! A will still have to submit documentation proving child care payments totalling 10 of household income OR 15 of AGI income for 2012 otherwise they're liable for underpayment penalties!! This ridiculous requirement is set forth in paragraph 202 (b) of section 6700 on page 111 of Publication 1771 here It doesn't matter if B isn't living paycheck to paycheck nor does it appear that she is supporting A in anyway - if she makes less than 80 of A's adjusted gross income then she needs to start paying alimony back to A after a year if they file jointly!!! Here's the last part ....Anytime A files separately or heads into bankruptcy, B is automatically required to pay back half her share of joint liability along with interest accruing monthly starting January 1st of next calendar year. Remember folks..this goes against everything the U.S. Constitution stands for. Freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom to marry who you choose, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, and most importantly FREEDOM FROM UNWANTED INTERVENTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INTO YOUR LIFE!!!!! Now do you understand why the feds feel entitled to determine ALL KINDS of things BEFORE citizens have a right to due process? They believe that this IS property owned implicitly by SSA. Even though people are considered civilians here in America, and cannot own guns except police officers, military personnel, LEOs, NROs and others whose jobs require firearms training and carry permits ....yet somehow SSA feels its ok to decide and interfere with society whenever they deem fit. Not unlike Stalinist Russia when citizens needed permission from government officials to live freely within habitat. 'really working in topnotation.
