before you guys bombard me with downvotes I would simply like to point out that I am not saying this is true. I am just expressing my conditional views that if it were, then the following things should happen: The entire human population of Earth must be moved. An entirely new planet needs to be created for them to live on as there are no resources available in our own solar system which can sustain life. Because they have never had a chance at living by themselves before and we know what happens when little children grow up without parents or family around (i.e. abuse, drug addiction etc.) - so take care of your kids younglings! In order to give each child their very individual set of eyes, hair colouring and facial features you will need some sort of cloning technology... right? Wrong! There are already co-operative breeding technologies within the animal kingdom for everything but humans require an even higher degree of intelligence in order to function properly; therefore, since cloning has been proven impossible once again, we're screwed. So forget about it. Our only choice now is to get rid of all these troublesome people who are ruining the world because everybody knows someone else's kid is healthiersmarter than yours. They won't cause any problems anyway. It'll feel good knowing that you've taken action on something important and done something to improve society! You could also make us work harder through forced labor camps and bad working conditions but why bother? Let's just kill them off now while we're still cool with doing such horrible things. And don't worry 'cause after the culling process is complete, all those who remain alive are going to start volunteering to get sterilized in exchange for lower taxesfees due to having fewer descendants. But wait, let's go one step further here and see how much more humane we can be. The best solution would probably involve shipping everybody from the whole planet into space where there aren't really any other habitable planets nearby anyways. We might end up needing terraforming to create another home for humanity though, so knowing that beforehand doesn't help anything. Once everyone is relocated away from Earth, we send them off immediately into orbit until they turn 18 years old, whereupon they may return back to Earth for the purpose of studying various sciences that pertain towards genetic mapping. Now let's check whether or not your opinion was based on reality: "I'm sure many people today wouldn't agree with Darwinian theory, believing instead that God put man upon earth to rule over beasts."
