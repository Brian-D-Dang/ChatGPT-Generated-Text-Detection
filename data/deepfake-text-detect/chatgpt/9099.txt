I believe this comic expresses the argument most cogently: Now, to my wall of text: I run a small software company that's reasonably successful. I've been doing this for the last five years. We're growing from 20 a month to over 30 per month. It was a win-win situation because we have a lot of money that goes into products and services and customers can use our platform to buy their products and service by simply clicking on one button on the web page. So we don't have many issues with traffic when people are actually buying from us, but it really helps keep up with the competition. How did you get started in this venture? My starting point is "Salesforce" which means Salesforce.com - the same as in business software companies like Salesforce.com or Salesforce.net. The goal is to leverage sales data from Salesforce.com to transform businesses and increase productivity Heading Up! With such an enormous amount of data, how do you find what makes your product or service more effective than others? Is there any common ground between advertising and marketing? Where do you rank your own software developers? What measures measure effectiveness compared with other enterprise companies? How does it affect customer loyalty? These questions will help you decide whether it's worth the effort at all. I think we should start by looking at the way different methods work. If you read about the differences between a traditional ad campaign and affiliate programs, then it might be interesting; if you take that idea and apply it to a new form of social media platform, then it'll make sense. For instance, the majority of social media apps look the exact same (or maybe slightly different) but they are basically the same thing. There are quite a few things you could use to improve your content. These include blogging, video sharing, music, content filtering (what's in front of your face), digital sales teams, content marketing teams, video ads, etc... But even though these examples aren't perfect, they certainly give you enough information. That said, for now, just focus on improving your mobile app (and the SEO and content management systems). What advice would you give to someone considering writing for a career-long blog post? Always try to leave no comments, but if someone writes something good, use their name instead of yours. Also, make sure you cover a variety of important topics in order to make a difference. Yes, everyone needs to know the concept behind what he or she is saying so they can see exactly where his or her message fits in the story. Create a credible title and name on each line of content that drives your point across. Do you want to start a tool of your choice? Can you share a couple of ideas about how to create one? The best way to build a tool is through collaboration and collaboration is key. Without it, you won't know what kind of impact your messages can make. A great tool to have is to publish your own content, including links to specific themes or formats. And if you already know some of the tools out there, you should consider learning them. If you haven't already, consider creating several websites using one of these tools. One site will likely generate hundreds of thousands of unique visitors over time, while another will probably only draw about one million-two millions a day.
