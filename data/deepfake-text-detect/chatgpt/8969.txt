Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of being around our 3 kids we've found out that some people find it hard to carry around a 6 year old who has had multiple jabs so there's no such thing as "safe" vaccines I don't think they would do anything about it if they thought it was a good idea. Hate or love, a vaccine is for everyone.
