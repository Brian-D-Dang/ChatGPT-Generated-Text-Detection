This CMV was sparked by the reaction to Donald Trump from the right in the recent GOP Candidate Debate but extends to everyone who intentionally used political incorrectness for personal gain. The fact that it's common and accepted among many means we need a new 2nd Amendment, not an interpretation of what is meant by "well-regulated militia" as defined at the time when there were no semi automatic weapons or high capacity magazines available on civilian markets. As long as our laws are based solely upon or made up completely out of emotion then they will never be respected any more than those who make them up feel they deserve respect themselves.
