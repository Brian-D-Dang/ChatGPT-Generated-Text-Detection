I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand that this is why school sucks for me but it's hard to deal with because my teachers think i don't care about learning which they keep telling everybody How can someone be good at something without putting effort into doing so? It always comes down on how much time you put forth working towards your goal versus enjoying yourself or having fun while being lazy most of times
