This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I 've noticed that along with the CERN experiment there is another one where people who do not understand quantum mechanics at all show an incredible amount of expertise in physics and that has led to some very interesting discoveries about other dimensions, new worlds, etc... I can't see how a reasonable minded person would be able to dismiss a mechanism which seems so incredibly useful; it may even bring us closer to understanding our universe itself!
