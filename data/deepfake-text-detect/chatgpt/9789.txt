I believe we should all be held accountable for our actions, both verbal and non-verbal. I believe folks say hurtful and mean things online that they wouldn't say we're they face to face with the person. That being said, I believe that people should be held accountable for what they say online just as much as if it were said in person. We should all be responsible for our words and actions, especially when those words and actions are directed toward someone else.
