Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on with their daily lives. However, there are things you can do to help prevent future executions: 1. Educate yourself and others about the death penalty and its flaws. Learn about the racial disparities, the risk of executing innocent people, and the high costs of capital punishment. Share this information with your friends and family. 2. Support organizations that work to end the death penalty. There are several organizations that advocate for the abolition of the death penalty, such as the Death Penalty Information Center, Amnesty International, and the Innocence Project. 3. Speak out against the death penalty. Write letters to your lawmakers, attend rallies and marches, and post on social media. Every voice makes a difference. 4. Advocate for criminal justice reform. Address the root causes of crime and push for reforms that promote rehabilitation and restorative justice. 5. Volunteer your time and resources to organizations that provide legal assistance and support to death row inmates and their families. By taking action, you can help make a difference and work towards a world without the death penalty.
