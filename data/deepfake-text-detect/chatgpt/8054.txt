A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that region of North America; for example Spanish and its variants is often considered as a first world [official] second-language to many Mexicans due largely from USCanada influence on their culture since NAFTA was signed which created an economic boom between these countries with massive migration happening at both ends - what passes off there now even though it's been over 27 years ago but still holds true today I would like this answer more focused towards Europe's native languages than any other country listed above because they are closer geographically speaking so let me know if you have another suggestion about how best we can approach answering questions relating specifically European heritage religions Also please note - while some may argue whether Islam really qualifies being not only minority religion here given sizeable populations across UK, Middle East etc., however considering all religious practices around Islamic faith seem geared toward encouraging conversion then yes i do consider Muslim practice disingenuous when compared against Western Christian Judaic beliefs where those who decide such matters tend be less inclined especially where interfaith marriages become involved
