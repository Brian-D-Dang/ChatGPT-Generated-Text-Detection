I am a 23 year old male Indian American male. I have never held hands with a girl, been kissed, or obviously had sex. I have never even asked someone out on a date. It's not that I am uninterested in girls, but I have always been shy and nervous around them. I have also been focused on my studies and career, which has made it harder for me to put myself out there in social situations. If you're interested in meeting women, one thing you could do is to join social clubs or organizations that align with your interests. This could be anything from a book club to a running group to a volunteer organization. You will have a better chance of meeting like-minded individuals who share similar passions and hobbies. This is a great way to connect with people and build your social skills. You could also try online dating, which is becoming increasingly popular and is a great way to meet people from all walks of life. Remember, it's okay to feel nervous or shy when approaching someone you're interested in. Confidence comes with practice, so keep putting yourself out there and don't give up. Good luck!
