I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are very close to what they do in Turkey. I've been to the UK few times for holidays and I've experienced how it is to live there and how people act. Also, I've been living in the Netherlands for 2 years and I've also been here for 2 years. But I've never been to the US. My question is, where should I live in the US (and why)? I know there are many factors to take into consideration but I am really confused about this. United States study-abroad It depends. You can't possibly answer this question with the info you have. - Alexander - Reinstate Monica Jan 12 '18 at 21:33 A lot of things to consider. Size of city, urban or rural, climate, landscape, industry, job availability, housing options. Also, very important to note is that the US is not a single country, and it has many cultures. - chrylis -on strike- Jan 13 '18 at 0:13 Could you please clarify if you want to stay in the US permanently, for work, study or just visit? - Nicolas Raoul Jan 13 '18 at 7:11 While I think this would have been a good question for another site, I would say you should look at the various aspects of each state and determine where you think you would be most happy. You have lived in Turkey, the Netherlands and Dubai. You have a strong connection to the Islamic faith. This is a broad question that would require several pages to answer. However, I will try to answer with a broad brush and point you in the right direction. If you are looking for a large city, you would find New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles to be three of the most Islamic friendly in the US. However, you must consider the price of housing, the cost of living and the type of job you are seeking. Some states are more costly than others. In the southeast, you will find Muslims that live in the US that have a strong connection to Turkey and an Islamic faith. Some of these areas are not as welcoming of immigrants and this could be an issue. Some cities have a large Muslim population. However, the Midwest is often seen as being more welcoming of Muslims. This includes states such as Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. I would also recommend looking at some of the Midwest states that you may be unfamiliar with. For example, Minnesota has a large Muslim population that is very active in the community. If you want a smaller city, look at places such as Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Kalamazoo, Michigan and Erie, Pennsylvania. If you are looking for a more rural life, you could try places such as Columbus, Ohio, Birmingham, Alabama and Nashville, Tennessee. When you ask where should you live, you need to consider the lifestyle you want to live and where that lifestyle will be the most available to you. I'm sure you have already looked at some of these things, but I would strongly recommend looking into the type of jobs that are available to you. For example, if you are looking for work in a large city, what type of jobs are available? Do you want to teach English? Do you want to work in a hospital? Do you want to work in the education system? If you are a doctor, do you want to work in a hospital? Do you want to work in a clinic? Do you want to work in a medical school? If you are a teacher, do you want to work in a school? Do you want to work in a community college? Do you want to work at a private college or university? Do you want to work at a technical college? Do you want to work at a public school? Do you want to work at a boarding school? If you are looking to teach English, do you want to work in a large city? Do you want to work in a small community? Do you want to work at a private school? Do you want to work at a community college? Do you want to work at a public school? Do you want to work in a university? Do you want to work in a private school? Do you want to work at a public school? Do you want to teach ESL? Do you want to teach conversational English? Do you want to teach English in a
