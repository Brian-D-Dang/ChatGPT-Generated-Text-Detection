I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was not prepared for what is going on with the other characters of this movie. Overall: A very entertaining experience that ends spectacularly before you know it!
