It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing leads another: China's rapidly growing influence in the world economy could very well be a boon for the Philippines because it will help bolster its position internationally if it gains more support from international institutions like the IMF or any other willing partner country to encourage other countries on the island nation at home with reduced costs of living. In addition to the benefits to the Philippines being able to speak more freely abroad due to higher wages attained through trade deals negotiated by other countries which would require less money spent overseas instead of paying taxes domestically so as not to count against Philippine income tax collections, also there are advantages such as flexibility befitting another member state like Indonesia where Asian economies tend to have lower taxes compared to neighboring countries such as Japan owing to its proximity to Asia Pacific countries despite having no dependence upon foreign governments since they do pay taxes annually worldwide. Indonesia has been an important regional investor but it too is seeing growth slowdown thanks to the rising number of Chinese investors who prefer to invest abroad rather than placing their bets locally, a move which seems beneficial especially considering the Philippines' reliance on imports while Japan remains stuck overseas under pressure from Japan's declining reputation among foreign investors amid high import tariffs imposed by Japanese companies over recent years resulting in rising commodity prices and increases in the cost of imported goods costing consumers around the world some 600 billion per year (1 trillion). Then there was the growing controversy involving its recent decision to drill offshore oil drilling rigs off its coast adding fuel to the speculation that the Philippines might become a dumping ground for Chinese ships releasing crude products into the ocean. Article content The Philippines had already seen a spike in exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) produced elsewhere during the last decade. LNG generally refers to liquified petroleum gases produced from fossil fuels including coal, gasoline sold via ship and jet engine manufacturers like Schlumberger Ltd., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Mitsui Oasis Inc.. But the latest news has pushed LNG sales across Southeast Asia towards zero according to industry sources citing government data showing a decline in imports and a drop in U.S.-based liquification plants to 3-4 million tons this fiscal year ending June 30th 2021 after import duties rose nearly 1 percent YoY during October 2020. While some analysts argue importing LNG could help Manila maintain stability in dealing with low energy price fluctuations local producers can't provide cheaper electricity cheaply, others warn bringing LNG closer to domestic markets may lead to trickle down effects impacting the Philippines in future due to increased consumption demand arising out of trade disputes between strong neighbors like China and India, notably China's increasing tariff threats against Philippine industries hurtling toward a unilateral anti trade action rules forcing the Philippines to impose further tariffs without incentives in place to offset unfair retaliation by complying with WTO rules banning unfair tariff charges. Moreover, import duties levied by foreign carriers on imported goods increase when exports decrease due to natural disasters like typhoon Haiyan and floods caused by Typhoon Haiyan similar to Japan's actions led by Jardines International Holdings Group Inc. The Philippines needs to take advantage of stronger bilateral ties with China both economically and culturally strengthening its standing globally now only to see developing nations lag behind in their development driven by growth rates expected within decades unless AsiaPacific economies strengthen their own competitiveness which will benefit them greatly given the growing importance of the Philippines regionally, said Luis Felipe Pinasco, a professor emeritus and former chairman of the Philippine Institute of International Affairs (PIAA), addressing the media briefing event alongside Philippine Ambassador to China Richard Forcillo. Pinascon argued China should play a greater role vis versa saying the pair need to develop relations and cooperate even beyond China itself currently facing issues interlinked with the Philippines regarding trade sanctions imposed on Beijing over Hong Kong protests in 2019. He added that China must make efforts necessary to reduce tensions over Taiwan, such as upholding its sovereignty and maintaining peace process opening up dialogue with Taiwan based on the principle of "one country two systems." Pinascon noted the Philippines suffered consecutively from trade conflicts inherent in its traditional ties with China once again noting Duterte administration failed to curb mismanagement and corruption causing mass unemployment affecting rural poverty filled with social unrest. "China needs to face up to its responsibilities badly," he said before adding China deserves credit due to its free flow of investment pushing Philippine economy forward thus motivating China to anchor stronger positions whenever needed. Duterte kicked off his first Presidential Propaganda Day celebrations earlier today launching Philippines News Network online channel through Facebook Live broadcast along with Philippine government officials like presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella Jr. President Rodrigo Duterte welcomed China's initiative to improve relations which would improve bilateral cooperation hence helping expand ties nationwide notwithstanding rising tension with India particularly amid its increasing trade war spurred by China. During his inauguration speech Duterte thanked China for supporting him politically still speaking. Hindi language media reported that Duterte recalled having signed Memoranda of Understanding with China which will allow him to share information concerning Beijing and expand communication channels besides pledging cooperation jus soli.
