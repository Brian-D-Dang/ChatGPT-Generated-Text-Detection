I can only see socialistic systems (The harder variety that imposes 90 tax rates and such) work out in ethnically, culturally homogenous societies like the Nordic states, or certain Orthodox Slavic countries.

It is so deeply ingrained in white culture that you will never find many nonwhite people being racist towards other races, but everyone knows racism exists regardless of skin color! Yes there's a world where things could get ugly between blacks and whites. But we don't live inside one yet. The last thing we should be doing is trying to build the perfect society through legislation... That wouldn't even make sense for an international company like FIFA - which is after all a very small part of our needs as human beings. As long as no-one is hurt from something stupid someone else saysdoes, why not let them say what they want? And furthermore... a sport event is actually better off having less than 20 teams if it means that more players are given their chance on stage rather than being restricted to roles determined before birth based on skin colour. We're all humans first, and secondly posters here seem to forget that when making bigoted comments about certain groups of people.. It'd take years before racial discrimination disappears completely, but there's certainly still time to change people's opinions with little incidents instead of enacting laws against those who hold different views.
