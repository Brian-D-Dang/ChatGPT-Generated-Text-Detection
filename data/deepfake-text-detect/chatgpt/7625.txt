I respectfully disagree with the opinion that if you have to defend something as free speech, you're probably wrong. Free speech is a fundamental right enshrined in many democratic societies' constitutions and laws. People have the right to express their opinions, ideas and beliefs, even if they are unpopular or controversial. Therefore, there will always be situations where people are challenged or criticized for their speech, and they need to defend their words as exercising their right to free speech. Furthermore, throughout history, many people who stood up for free speech and fought against censorship were considered wrong at that time. For example, Galileo Galilei was ostracized for his ideas about heliocentrism, which eventually proved to be correct. Likewise, Nelson Mandela was jailed for his beliefs and later became a revered figure in history. In conclusion, simply having to defend one's free speech does not imply that the speech is inherently wrong. Rather, it is a demonstration of exercising a fundamental democratic right and standing up for what one believes in.
