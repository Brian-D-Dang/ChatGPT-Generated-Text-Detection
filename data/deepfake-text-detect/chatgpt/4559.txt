I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say "entertainment," but I think it's more than just that. Most works of fiction are meant for us as a people to reflect upon ourselves. We read them in classes or at home, with one another. Then through the process of experiencing something new, some part of you has changed. And because most books don't really change your behavior (aside from books like The Road), they become part of who you are. They make up who you are. This makes me feel sad sometimes. Not only because many people spend their whole lives reading nothing else, but also because even though when I'm done reading all my favorite authors I still see myself exactly how I did before I began, there will be no significant changes made by those other books within me. As much as I would want that to happen I mean if someone reads War Peace, then suddenly becomes better behaved or finds themselves enraptured by loveit doesn't work. Novels aren't magic pills; they're artifice, an imitation of life. Still, I believe all novels are important, and hopefully, that belief is translated into action. If not, well....that hurts too. It hurts that so few people ever come close to escaping the confines of mediocrity, and worse yet, being satisfied enough to never try again. But I digress. Back to the point: Why do we write? How does it serve this country? In answer to these questions, let's step back into history. Before the invention of writing, humans were only capable of expressing thoughts verbally. With spoken language comes emotion, which isn't always expressed appropriately on its own, nor aimed correctly towards others. This leads men of great intellect to blame their emotions for ruining perfectly good ideas. So before words can convey our feelings, each individual must learn how to express himself properly. Which means he needs practice. Eventually, however, the ability to communicate oneself successfully gives both individuals AND societies power over each other. When two opposing sides agree to talk to each other without fighting first, the chances of war decrease significantly, crippling the military capabilities of nations until peace reigns supreme once again. Think about it next time you go out shopping and start arguing with the cashier instead of her manager. That brings me full circle to our current situation. No matter how intelligent or powerful any nation might be today, they've got problems. Problems caused mostly by poor communication between races. But beautiful things occur when different cultures meet head-on and begin talking together. That's what happened during World War II, after years of animosity had accumulated. Suddenly, young Europeans had access to American culture, and vice versa. For whatever reason, Americans felt compelled to tell stories, and eventually, Europe wanted to hear them. England led the way...but America took off, spreading civilization across the globe. It caught everyone else up faster than anyone expected. While the idea of mass transportation wasn't entirely new, Americans brought stability to infrastructure construction. Roads paved highways, railways helped usher commerce along, and air travel allowed stay-at-home citizens abroad easier accessibility to friends and family. Culture spread worldwide via radio waves, television, film, and now, the Internet. The world is connected and sharing ideas. Our reality is globalized. Countries like Russia and China receive their information directly from Western sources first, rather than having to rely solely on state propaganda filtered through cultural bias. Other countries share truths from their experiences, such as Vietnam's Tet Offensive. Finally, children everywhere now have constant exposure to technology. Thanks to computers and cell phones, knowledge has been democratized. It costs little money to find answers to almost anything, and most importantly, competition has increased exponentially. Even underfunded public schools offer excellent material literacy compared to fifty years ago! Now a student can choose among numerous high schools based on his interests and aptitude for specific courses. He can earn college credits while taking community college preparatory courses online, saving thousands of dollars. Or perhaps you prefer to remain independent and attend private school where tuition is far lower than the cost in urban environments. Because of all this, people around the planet know about what goes on here. Sure, nobody knows everything, and there's probably stuff going on right beneath our noses none of us suspect (like nonstop UFO activity). However, every second person on Earth is aware of individuals like Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, and Jeffrey Dahmer. Their crimes went undocumented, thankfully, but their deeds weren't unheard of here, either - both Black Dahlia murderer Elizabeth Short and serial killer Colin Ferguson killed women in Los Angeles, then mailed letters explaining away the murders as suicides. John Wayne Gacy murdered thirty boys and buried twenty-nine of them in his crawlspace before police found him in 1978. Though technically ruled natural causes, his trial gave insight into the murderous mind of a pedophile, making more parents wary of trusting strangers.
