I don't even know where to start. I am generally a happy and healthy person. I was raised Catholic. I am not a strict Catholic. I enjoy the community of my friends, but have no interest in joining any church or religious group for that matter (except maybe when it comes time for me to buy a house). But if you ask about faith? I'll tell you what: without an ounce of irony, I say this with all sincerity there is none better than mine. No other religion can touch the depth how deeply rooted in me are beliefs concerning God. It's like he molded himself into each inch and every hair on my body; ditto his fingerprints throughout history from the beginning until today. You cannot find another belief system out-of-bounds as far as love goes."
