First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from someone's desire or need to get out there in front of people and sell them something. This isn't inherently bad but I find myself protecting my children by not letting them watch videos like these... I agree with you on some level - it feels a bit clique-y at times - but if we stay true to our mission, awesome content will be shared, regardless as to whether or not they are self promotion or not!
