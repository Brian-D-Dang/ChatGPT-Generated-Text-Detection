I'm referring to this news story about the incident at the community pool in McKinney TX. You can reference it here, the video is down the page and is approximately 1 minute longer than the original source. In addition, I found a video of what looks like the incident about an hour ago on Facebook. This may be because I have not been able to get a copy of that video from my phone, but if you look through the link below, you will see that I posted it earlier today: In the event that you are not sure whether or not it's real, the Houston Police Department has put out a press release regarding the shooting. The police department said they were called to a pool on May 20 around 2 p.m. by members of the Community Pool Management team while responding to a man who was unresponsive when he got into his vehicle. No injuries were reported and the pool manager quickly responded to the scene. However, after being contacted by law enforcement authorities, officers located a male younger than 30 years old with gunshot wounds to the chest. He died at the scene. This week also marks the beginning of June, which is just one month away! What started as a simple matter of having a quick shower and getting dressed brought a whole lot more happening for the community pool managers. As you might know from our articles, we still worry about all types of issues during the summer months and many people have already noticed how difficult it could actually become for them to handle the season-long pool maintenance. It's another reason why it's important to make sure your plans aren't impacted.
