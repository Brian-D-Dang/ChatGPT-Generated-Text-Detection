While it may seem like a harmless or even progressive idea on the surface, legalising polygamous marriage has the potential to perpetuate and reinforce patterns of patriarchy and gender inequality. Polygamy often involves one male having multiple wives, and this arrangement can lead to the mistreatment and marginalisation of women. In many cases, women in polygamous relationships are forced or coerced into accepting their position as secondary or subordinate to their husband's primary wife. Legalising polygamous marriage could contribute to the normalisation of this harmful, unequal dynamic and may also make it difficult or impossible for women in these relationships to seek legal recourse or escape from abusive or controlling situations. Therefore, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences and impact of such a policy change before making any decisions about legalising polygamous marriage.
