Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news x] , [x] after delivering a speech in which she said that "for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of black and brown children often provokes feelings of fear or unease. They are not taught to see these children as our equals." As with many recent articles on racial issues: we have no idea what's behind this statement how much research went into it? How carefully did they examine their data? And why does race come up at all here? Totally unscientific response: I think there is some truth about certain types of elite whites being uncomfortable around non-whites; but for other upper class elites (and most working class whites) there is very little discomfort. The social problem is one of segregation rather than racism because those schools happen to be segregated by wealth level, not skin color. I'm personally far more concerned when white kids go to school with poor blacks and Latinos who live right next door, even if it means living farther away from my own home. If you want your kid to learn to love diversity then send them to a wealthy neighborhood where there aren't any minorities; instead of trying to force children to make themselves comfortable amongst different races through -isms like forced integration. You can teach them tolerance without forcing them to respect the humanity of others just because they're human beings. So let's stop treating public education as an instrument of political correctness and try to get rid of segregation so that all kids don't end up growing up hating each other naturally due to ethnic differences.
