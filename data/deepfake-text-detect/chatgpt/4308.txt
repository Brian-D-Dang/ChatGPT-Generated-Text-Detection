GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a car yet 2. My parents won't allow me to smoke weed 3. They are religious people 4. My dad always makes fun of the way I walktalk so he doesn't let me go out very often 5. Also no car means no social life at all I've got 2 cars and 6 bikes in my garage... you're not alone OP
