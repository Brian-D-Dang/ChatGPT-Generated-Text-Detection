While there are valid arguments against state-sanctioned marriage, it's important to consider the potential drawbacks of excluding the state from the process. First and foremost, without legal recognition of marriage by the state, couples would not be able to receive the legal benefits and protections that come with marriage. This includes access to health insurance, Social Security benefits, and tax breaks, which can all be incredibly important for financial stability and security. Additionally, when the state recognizes marriage, it helps to protect vulnerable individuals who may not have the resources to protect themselves. For example, in cases where one spouse dies, the surviving spouse may face challenges in accessing inheritance or other assets without legal recognition of their relationship. The state also provides a legal framework to protect individuals in cases of separation or divorce, ensuring that both parties are treated fairly and equitably. Ultimately, while there may be valid critiques of state-sanctioned marriage and alternatives like civil unions or domestic partnerships, it's important to acknowledge the benefits that legal recognition of marriage can provide - particularly for vulnerable populations.
