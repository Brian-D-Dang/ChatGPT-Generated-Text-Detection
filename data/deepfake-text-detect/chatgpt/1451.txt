Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just leave it at that for now (I'm sure people will be able to find other threads if they want to talk about the matter further). You're being rude because you'd rather debate than let others decide what's true? Maybe in an alternate dimension where facts had no weight or impact on how we live our lives. You can disagree with me all day long, but until someone is willing to list 10 biblical passages that contradict each other then I remain unconvinced of your point here.
