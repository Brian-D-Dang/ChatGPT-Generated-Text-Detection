Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if a single atom were misidentified as C-10 (which is impossible given all known knowledge of organic chemistry) it wouldn't matter much because no one would be able tell they had gotten anything wrong! I now realize there are other ways for labeling "methyl branch" than methyl groups substituted onto an alkyl chain at various places along its length; instead this could also refer simply mean substitution on any carbon atoms or carbons adjacent by 1 bond away from already existing substituents which actually leaves more possibilities open but doesn't enthrone those specific ones either... still looking into these options though:
