While it is important to consider the needs of others, it is also important to prioritize taking care of oneself and one's own needs. Additionally, charity and aid are not the only ways to make a positive impact on society - investing in oneself, developing skills and knowledge, and creating job opportunities can also benefit one's fellow community members in the long-term. It is also important to note that the decision of how much money to spend on oneself versus donating to others is a personal choice and should not be dictated by others' beliefs of what is moral or immoral.
