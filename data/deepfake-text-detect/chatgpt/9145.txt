I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the "safe space" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao . Not a single one of us has been told how it will be done or if it should start with Pao. It depends on the leader. What would you consider too high for Pao?
