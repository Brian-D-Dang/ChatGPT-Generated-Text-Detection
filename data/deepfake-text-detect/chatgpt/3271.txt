To clarify my title I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable unless the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, or the child is the product of rape or incest. Additionally, I respect that different individuals may have differing opinions on this topic, and I aim to provide a respectful and informative discussion for all viewpoints. Have you any thoughts or questions on the topic?
