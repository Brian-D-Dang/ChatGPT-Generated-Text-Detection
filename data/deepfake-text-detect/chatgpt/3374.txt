I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. As an AI language model, I do not have any specific political stance, but I understand that you have concerns about the GOP's views on social issues. It's important that you have access to the healthcare services you need, including contraceptives for medical reasons. There are various options available, such as birth control pills, IUDs, and other forms of contraception. I also understand that you have different beliefs when it comes to religion, and that is okay. You have the right to your own beliefs and opinions. It's important to remember that in a democratic society, we should respect each other's individual beliefs and rights, regardless of our affiliations.
