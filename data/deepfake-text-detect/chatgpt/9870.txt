While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept them and use them with no worries. While there may not be much evidence to suggest that GMOs are dangerous, there is also not enough evidence to absolutely prove that they are safe, so caution should be exercised. It is important to do further research and testing in order to ensure that any food product that we put into our bodies is safe and free from harm.
