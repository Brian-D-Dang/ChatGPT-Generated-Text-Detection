Now in the spirit of fairness - I believe this to be true for all governments, but in this case I'll touch upon the U.S. gov. First of all [Lusatania] was armed, and that is very clear to me. The question is, was it armed for service or was it armed for service and resupply? You know the Germans were very much afraid that the United States would intervene in the war, and that is why they were determined to sink this ship. The Germans were under the impression that this ship was carrying munitions for service of the British. [Official report of the Lusitania: "This ship was armed with one 6-inch, 14-ton gun in the foredeck, one 12-pounder, 12-cwt gun in the forepeak, two 3-pounders, 12-cwt guns in the waist, and one machine gun. "It is now beyond question that Germany, in the last resort, was the author of this world war. It has been found to be true that the German Government, since the beginning of the conflict, had directed and encouraged the whole of the German people in the prosecution of the war, not only in the field of military operations, but also in the general conduct of the war. To this end the German Government had made use of all its means, and it had made use of them in a manner unparalleled in the history of civilization. The German Government, acting through the German Embassy and the German Consulates, had in various ways encouraged, assisted, and supported the enemies of the United States in the prosecution of the war against the United States. It had given and promised material and financial support to the enemies of the United States, and it had taken steps to increase the difficulties of the United States Government in prosecuting the war and to make possible the defeat of the United States. It had engaged in a persistent campaign of false statements and misrepresentations designed to delude the Government of the United States, to seduce the people of the United States, and to bring about a breach between the two countries, and it had engaged in a systematic campaign of espionage and spying designed to obtain military and naval information concerning the United States. It had committed acts of violence against the United States and its citizens, and had waged unrestricted and indiscriminate warfare against the commerce and shipping of the United States." - From the official charge of the Allied Powers against Germany, 1915 Here is an excerpt from a book I read recently by a British historian. "As time went on, the British government was to be increasingly concerned about the role of the United States in the war. In July 1915, the American government had declared war on Germany and entered the conflict on the Allied side, but it had done so with great reluctance. In early August, it sent a fleet to Europe to augment the British navy, and in October the United States army began to arrive in Britain in large numbers. The British were wary about their ally, partly because they were keen to see it maintain a low profile, partly because they were worried about the effect of a large American army on their relationship with France, and partly because they had no wish to see the United States entangled in a prolonged European war. This war would be a long one. The British government and public were aware that it would have to be so, but most British people were reluctant to face the prospect of a long war. In July 1915, the British prime minister, Herbert Asquith, had been replaced by David Lloyd George, who formed a coalition government with the Conservatives under Bonar Law. The new government was to be under the command of Asquith, who retained the post of prime minister and head of government. In addition, the new government was to include three members of the Conservative Party, one of whom, Andrew Bonar Law, was to become the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The government was to be described as a coalition, but it was not to be a coalition in the normal sense of the word, which is to say that it was to be a government formed by parties who were in opposition to one another. Indeed, the new government had no common platform. The Liberals and Conservatives were two separate parties with very different traditions and agendas. The Liberals were committed to democracy and to an expanding welfare state, whereas the Conservatives were committed to the maintenance of the British Empire and to the power of the established Church of England. In fact, the only things they did have
