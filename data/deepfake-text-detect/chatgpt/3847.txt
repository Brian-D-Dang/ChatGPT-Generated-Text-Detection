The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely than women not to be charged with a crime and given a hearing date for their case, if they've been accused of causing 5,000 or less damage at home. This doesn't seem fair, but it seems like the system just works better for men - and I don't think there's any reason to change this practice. There are other ways to reduce violence: fathers can move out immediately after the birth; stay put until the police arrive so as not to leave their children vulnerable - which would be a good thing anyway because then you won't have to hear about how awful your kids were treated by an abusive parent all over town; fathers need to get help from professionals immediately after the birth when both babies are safe inside you; and mothers should be allowed to take care of themselves until some time between questioning and arraignment. That second part sounds terrible, but it really makes sense. Fathers often don't go into these situations with the same amount of self-confidence and knowledge of what to do that mother does. These things, however, wouldn't happen unless men had access to legal representation and support services. What's even worse is the way that prosecutors use exceptions to make sure that men are getting preferential treatment - particularly in rape cases where female victims are expected to testify against him no matter what happened to her before she filed a claim against him. "I didn't consent," he said. "He broke me." The victim was forced to relive her trauma on the stand under oath and committed perjury herself to protect his name. It'd be one thing if Mr. Jacobson got off scot-free by saying "Well, I didn't consented to having sex with her either, but we OKed it anyways ..." But he says he did consent and wasn't raped and therefore deserves a free pass on everything else. He also gave another woman false information during her testimony, which led to yet another acquittal. And prosecutors use this kind of trickery when a man gets bail despite his record. They will say something like, "OK, well, he knows he'll never win a trial, so why ruin his life?" In most states defendants would be entitled to bail regardless of future history - and many courts don't understand this and let people walk away without ever actually being tried. Actually, the only exception I found for rape charges in New York is for medical reasons. Under state law, "no person shall be punished for any act done within 100 feet of any residence occupied by another person." Murderers aren't protected under this rule (which is probably why they don't get prosecuted much). If someone commits murder while in prison, he can still be convicted of murder if he breaks out unless he was posing a danger to himself or others. However, since police officers cannot charge anyone with assault while they're investigating a murderhomicide, they may view Jacobson's alleged sexual misconduct as evidence of sexual assault. Which means that if he pleads guilty, he could end up going to jail instead of prison for quite a long time. Jacobson denies it, and the district attorney is investigating him for lying about if he ever shared personal photos online with anyone. I wish the DA's office would send people to interview him and find out exactly what exactly he did wrong, including whether any other women took nude pictures of him - but this would require him to admit to sexually assaulting three women. What's interesting about this scandal is that while Jacobson went from a relatively unknown groupie to a candidate who might beat Diane Feinstein, he was campaigning on lowering the legal age for marriage to 16. At least now he has to defend those comments.
