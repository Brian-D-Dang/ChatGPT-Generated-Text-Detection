Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocents, and that is indefensible from the moral point of view. A just conqueror does not kill civilians who have done him no harm (just as he would not mutilate or torture them). The Germans had many opportunities for surrender which they consistently refused. They fought until their last man was dead and their country destroyed; even after all the death camps were discovered it took them some time before they were willing to admit that civilians could die in warfare. Even when they did finally acknowledge civilian deaths there remained an inconsistent attitude towards how those people should suffer - the Japanese wanted them killed quickly but they weren't going to keep forced labor alive if they didn't work. The Allies eventually won because victory was inevitable while Germany couldn't win, so we shouldn't look back at the WWII era with rose-tinted glasses. To quote Monty Python's "V for Vendetta": 'We don't let things slide'. You may think today's problems are worse than what happened during World War II, but they aren't - you're comparing apples and oranges.
