Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if violent video games can cause short-term aggression, there is no convincing evidence they are causative of long-term violence or suicide.] I don't know why you're being downvoted for this because it's true.. The only argument against your claim I've seen on here has been an article from a biased source (The Daily Mail) which did not provide any sort of credible research whatsoever into the matter but instead tries to discredit the entire study with bullshit sensationalist headlines like "Playing graphic war game increases aggressive feelings."
