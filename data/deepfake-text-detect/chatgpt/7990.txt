While it is true that demand is a significant factor when determining pay rates for athletes, it is also essential to consider the underlying societal issue of gender inequity. Historically, women's sports have been undervalued and underfunded, leading to minimal exposure and lower revenue generation. This cycle perpetuates the underfunding of women's sports, which further perpetuates gender-based pay disparity. Therefore, it is critical to address and correct the root causes of gender inequity in sports to attain equal pay for male and female athletes. Additionally, there are examples of women's sports that generate significant revenue and interest, such as women's soccer and tennis, proving that demand disparities are not the sole factor determining pay rates.
