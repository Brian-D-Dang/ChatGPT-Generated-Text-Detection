First of, this is only talking about people who are vegetariansvegans for ethical reasons. If you are a vegetarian for any other reason, this does not apply Being a vegetarian is not cause to hate veggie meat and eat less than someone who eats meat because they ate the first time around or something else but it could be guilt-tripping feeling that they just aren't eating enough meat at all in their life now so please do not take offense if someone complains about how much meat consuming there isn't veganism as well (although it might make them feel guilty). It also cannot hurt to ask why they choose not to go vegetarian though I guess when it comes down to it since most people won't tell anyone what goes into their diet anyway unless told by someone like yourself! Good luck. I'm sure you'll find out soon enough:) I was thinking more along the lines of people who have had nothing else now suddenly being vegetarian. Like there's no reason anymore to get upset over it and it makes them forget about whatever else went wrong with their previous lifestyle choices...
