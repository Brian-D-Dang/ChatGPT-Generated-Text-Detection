I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer want to carry out his duty when he can be shot at any time? This is my theory: If we are having this many shootings by cops who just don't know how deadly their weapons really are... it will make them more paranoid than they already were over whether or not someone had the wrong idea (that they could potentially kill an unarmed person without repercussions).
