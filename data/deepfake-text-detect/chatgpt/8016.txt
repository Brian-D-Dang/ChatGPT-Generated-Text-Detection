Counter-argument: The assumption that unions would become powerful players in a libertarian economy is based on the idea that unions thrive in a climate of government intervention and protectionism. However, in a truly free market economy, unions would have to compete for workers' voluntary membership, just as businesses have to compete for consumers' voluntary patronage. This means that only unions that provide genuine value to their members would be able to thrive and remain relevant. Furthermore, in a free market economy, businesses would also have to compete for workers, leading to higher wages and better working conditions overall. This would reduce the need for unions to act as mediators between workers and employers. Therefore, it is not necessarily the case that unions would become omnipotent in a libertarian economy or lead to a reestablishment of a welfare state.
