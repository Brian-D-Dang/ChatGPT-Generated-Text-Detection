I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This means that the majority of Americans will not vote for Sanders, who has no presence in the Democratic Party because of his previous positions on issues like immigration reform or abortion rights or taxation policy. Sanders isn't going anywhere anytime soon unless his supporters decide it's time to give up their faith in the man they believe is the best candidate.
