Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as a foreigner living here for quite some time now - even after the fallout in 2008 which saw me abandoning Hungary because everyone seemed so angry at each other all day every single-day that second weekmonth was terrible...I still think our culture is worth saving (even if just by preserving what we have). So when you asked about Canada's national anthem or flag: You can't blame them too much; although being sure not be very Canadian themselves anymore from then on;)
