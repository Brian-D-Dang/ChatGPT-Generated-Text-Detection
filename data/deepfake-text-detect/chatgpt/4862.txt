This is something that's always bothered me, all the way back to when I was a kid. I never understood why it was considered polite to say "bless you" after someone sneezes, or even just as an expression of sympathy for somebody who has got colds andor flu. When people do this they are actually saying two things: "Thank God he didn't catch my illness," which may not be awful but makes them feel better by doing so; and then also thanking him (and sometimes her) specifically for catching hisher cold. So in essence, if you were sick with a contagious disease like the common cold and some random person said bless you at such a time, it would mean one thing - i.e., "I'm glad your cold isn't getting passed on to everybody else." That seems very strange to me because anyone knows how easily a sick person can spread their germs around. Why should we thank them? It appears the only reason this custom exists is to make people feel good about their health. But it doesn't seem healthy since there really could be lots more illnesses going around than only the normal ones...
