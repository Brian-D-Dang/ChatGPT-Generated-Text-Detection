For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to the fact that two or three partners have decided to leave their spouses for work. I am not suggesting that all marriages are terrible by any means, but that most relationships with more than 10 partners are going to end badly. I believe one should expect at least some degree of improvement between marriage and divorce if you do decide to marry someone from another state over a different partner's law. It may take a few years before we see it make a difference in your relationship from where you live. And I think even if marriage didn't work out, most couples would continue to get married regardless of the circumstances because many people would still want to be together after they've met each other, and that is what I am trying to emphasize. The main thing here was just that since a lot of women feel like marrying only to find out they can't keep their families with them, there needs to be hope and encouragement for marriage - especially now when so much support is available for people who don't know how to cope with divorce from a divorced spouse.
