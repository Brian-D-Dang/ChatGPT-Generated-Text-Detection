First lets make a couple of things clear: I do not necessarily believe that government spying on its own citizens is ok, and thats not what this post is about. All I am saying here is that there needs to be some limits put on the power and discretion exercised by national security agencies. Secondly, lets talk about why we are so concerned with the legality of such surveillance. There have been many instances where governments have tried to use laws (such as those in the United States) which they themselves had no intention of applying to justify or circumscribe their powers. This has led to many constitutional challenges being brought against these regimes because simply reading the constitution does not give a right to spy on people who know nothing about you other than that your name and address appear to match an intelligence ID number issued by government agencies. The judiciary has found in several cases that these acts violate the First Amendment's free speech clause, even though it was clearly intended to protect the rights of criminal defendants. Such cases were referred to as national security letters, and in 2005, 538 judges decided that these practices violated the Constitution. Even if the issue did not arise directly from the Patriot Act, others say that they feel that it has made us more susceptible to terrorist attacks since it allows for more invasive wiretaps without requiring probable cause - to take just one example; the FBI reportedly used 17,000 warrantless phone taps in 2004 alone. And finally, let me touch upon the question of "why government should get to decide how much privacy it deserves?." To start off with, there are plenty of examples throughout history when governments have taken liberties when defining private rights that exist outside of their control. For instance, the Roman Catholic Church actively took away the liberty of certain non-Catholics living in Rome during the 800 year rule of Pope Clement VII. In addition, the 20th century witnessed governments deliberately limiting freedom of speech through various repressive institutions like the Soviet Union. Now, all of my arguments are based solely on our current political climate, but obviously if one had held similar views back then, they would also not be considered constitutional today. As far as society goes, this may seem like a difficult question to answer. However, I think it can be fairly well answered using the less controversial concept of American exceptionalism - namely that America has always had the willingness to look outwards instead of inward. As noted on another forum last week, if you read David Brooks article about Snowden's leaks, he says something along the lines of - 'when a nation looks at itself, it sees flaws; but looking outward, we see opportunities and potentialities.' It seems that the Americans perspective has been rather different over time, especially after it came to prominence following World War II. With this in mind, consider the following. In order to understand these issues properly, we must begin to look into the past. We need to recall exactly what happened at the end of World War II and remember what both sides felt afterwards. Had Germany won the war, would humanity still recognize the same country today? That is certainly highly debatable. But perhaps that is a moot point anyway considering what happened next. After the war ended, the US government began to develop a strategic nuclear strategy known as 'Project Plowshares' under President Dwight Eisenhower's administration. Prior to WWII, the US military believed that self defense could only come from conventional means within a defined area - thus a blockade against Nazi Germany seemed necessary to ensure that peace wasn't restored before the Soviets arrived. Since winning the war, however, a slew of new technologies developed gave the US the ability to strike almost anywhere at anytime. As such, American policymakers realized that they needed to build up their capabilities beyond the confines of a small enclosed space and therefore prioritized development of their home grown arsenal in order to ensure permanent deterrence of any future aggression. Thus, they conceived of the 'nuclear umbrella' policy that became known as Project Apollo, which was designed to allow the first atomic weapons to be delivered to the US mainland by 1950. Consequently, the Cold War essentially began and while the world was divided between communismstalinist China and capitalismAmerican imperialism, every historian will agree that the Soviet Union emerged victorious. And after that, most historians argue that the US eventually lost the Cold War due to its rapid decline economically and technologically, especially in the years leading up to the Vietnam War after which the US saw an increase in popularity among youth. Regardless of whether or not we want to go down that road, I feel that its important to reflect upon the very fact that the US Military dominated the entire globe until 1973, most likely in part due to having the largest population on Earth. Sadly enough, the public memory of this period tends to focus on the Vietnam War in particular despite the fact that the rest of the decade was actually pretty promising financially for the US economy. And now we are in a situation where our government appears to be obsessed with building up a massive, untourerned and unaccountable, socialist trajectory stannqu Lynch.
