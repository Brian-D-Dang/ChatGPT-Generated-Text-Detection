In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing whether this is true or false but rather why do you consider them equivalent? Because they were both once illegal That seems like a poor reason and one of many reasons to oppose LGBT rights. Slippery slope arguments are very common conservative talking points. It's another way of saying "the world will go mad if we legalize homosexuality" (which I can't imagine anyone actually believing). If all Christian churches stopped practicing homophobia tomorrow, well then maybe polygamy wouldn't be unethical anymore either!
