I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with that statement and challenges it, then you should be open to having a dialogue with them. Free speech is an important right, but it isn't a shield against criticism or disagreement. If someone challenges your opinion, you should be able to respond intelligently and respectfully in order to foster productive conversations.
