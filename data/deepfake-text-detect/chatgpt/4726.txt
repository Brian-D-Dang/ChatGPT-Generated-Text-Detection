Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word mariage, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to marry simply meaning to take someone into your home and have sex with them until death do you part. Although most Americans are at least aware of how marriage works in their own state (duh), we still see it's usage being thrown about by some much more than others. Couple that with USPTO patenting "marriage equality" or the rhetoric of Prop 8 judges towards gay couples. One could make an argument about why no one should be forced to marry somebody they don't want to but really this is all moot when considering our current climate on guns now and whether gun law reform is even possible. When politicians talk about getting rid of assault weapons people often get defensive about what such bill would mean for us. The reason it sounds hollow is because none has ever been proposed yet (no one thinks big enough). This conversation never happens without millions thinking first thing about if I need a semiautomatic AR15 so my wife can shoot ducks. Meanwhile, just think how many times per day thousands upon hundreds of thousands of men are making jokes like "my girlfriend got me a machinegun for Christmas because she said I couldn't find anything better! She was right man! That's my whole setup!!!" Now imagine those same guys, who laughingly buy AR15s every year, carrying multiple pistols instead of rifles without any opposition whatsoever? It seems really unlikely. If there were something similar to "assault weapon" laws that applied only to handguns then someone might actually start talking about removing American citizens' rights to self defense. But since we don't hear specific proposals for handguns let alone semi-auto long arms - well - nobody cares. We've already bought into the idea that it won't happen here so probably shouldn't worry ourselves too much about the hypothetical future where it does. When you consider the fact that over 50 of marriages end up in divorce within ten years, why are we not concerned about the family unit being broken apart by political expediency? Is it worth taking away civil liberties needed for freedom by ensuring potential criminals cannot have access to firearms for protection during troubled times? What will become of the children once parents are arrested for being caught having extramarital affairs on Facebook messages or driving drunk hours after drinking adult beverages with friends? Aren't these problems likely to grow exponentially with time rather than diminish? Do we know what kind of legislation the USA needs to prevent social ills outside of the realm of marriage? Would outlawing hate speech or violent extremism stop other things or provide stricter punishment once they're committed? Will banning violence against women or treating domestic abuse as real crime suddenly reduce rape rates or murder crimes? Is'marrying' really necessary if society can afford to enforce strict codes regarding child custodyvisitation, financial responsibility etc.? Are we doing the best job we can balancing individual freedoms while protecting individuals from eachother? Shouldn't our governments concern themselves with keeping peace between groups if Americans keep putting unnecessary stress on relationships between genders and races? How are divorces handled? With torture? As public executions? Or simply amicable agreements? These questions may seem ridiculous but this is exactly the way that lawmaking works. Laws exist for good reasons; i.e. stopping bad things by force. These are often debated heavily before being adopted, sometimes changing dozens of times. There are also unintended consequences, which are largely intractable, almost always left unchecked due to cost constrains. So far, the biggest problem with homophobia and anti-gay sentiment is that its proponents cannot demonstrate why gays deserve special treatment above the rest. They rarely give examples of unequal treatment, mostly relying on emotional arguments like "I'm offended!" "It goes against my faith!," "They're going to take away MY religious beliefs!" Yet given that everyone else gets in line behind them, saying they're entitled to hate anyone because it's unoffensive makes absolutely zero sense. Of course, they hope eventually to change societal norms and the majority will follow along. Some say the effects of government intervention in business are almost impossible to measure, however, most agree that history books show clear results of market forces that didn't involve affirmative action. Government involvement in free enterprise doesn't appear to stem decline in democracy within countries nor cause military success in foreign wars (some argue all the latter should count though) e.g. Spain in 1500 vs today despite Roman Catholicism remaining strong. At the local level, some cities have responded positively to competition among businesses via economic development programs while avoiding corruption scandals along the way (see: LA Clippers San Antonio Spurs). Even prisons have been shown to help rehabilitation rates, especially drug addiction (yes, I did read the article linked below) in spite of material incentives. How does government aid work compare to private charity? Why don't we use tax money to fund charitable organizations? For example, the Catholic Church funds food kitchens worldwide out of sight Tabsite (but free to load apparently dangerous cast baristas to keepers. To test. Checkout participant profile with I: (Don
