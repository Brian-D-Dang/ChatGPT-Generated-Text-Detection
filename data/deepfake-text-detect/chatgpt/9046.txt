First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't change the fact that i'd be ok with nudity in public unless I was a nerd or whatever. But it does make me think about why my opinion is so much less important than how someone else's view of me might affect others' opinions on things like this. I don't understand the "gender" thing. You're saying you want to enter into an online relationship without being aware of your gender? That would mean no sex for you or anyone else?? Isn't that what men are supposed to do?
