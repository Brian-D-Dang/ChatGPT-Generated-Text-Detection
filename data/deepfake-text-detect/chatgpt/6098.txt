I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info:) Now, while I definitely agree that this is an injustice, I am not sure that comparing the salaries of top women soccer players to top men soccer players is the correct way to go about fixing the problem. At the top of the food chain, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are paid millions of dollars a year. Why are they paid so much? Because they bring in money. They have millions of fans that watch them play, and so therefore, sponsors and television networks pay them big bucks. Now, the top women soccer players are also very good, but they don't have the same level of fans. Even more so, they don't have the same level of male fans. While it's not fair that they're paid less than men, it's not fair that they're paid more than their male counterparts. The reason they're paid more is because of the amount of sponsors and television networks that are willing to pay them. In this sense, the best way to fix the problem is to promote women's soccer, not men's. The pay should be spread evenly, but it shouldn't be the women being paid more. There's a reason why the men are being paid more. It's because they can bring in more fans. If the women can bring in more fans, then they should be paid more. But that's only true if they can bring in more fans. So, the goal should be to get more people to watch women's soccer. That way, the women can get the same amount of sponsorship money as men. Because of this, the first thing that we need to do is to stop telling the women that they're not as good as men. This is just giving people a reason not to watch. The second thing is to make the competition better. This is why FIFA created a women's world cup, and this is why they're planning on having a women's world cup every four years. Now, it's true that the best men are still better than the best women, but it's also true that the gap is closing. And FIFA is doing this because they see a future where the best women are better than the best men. And the third thing that we need to do is to market the women's soccer team. We need to make sure that we're getting as many people to watch them as we can. So, instead of being angry at FIFA because they pay the women less than the men, we need to be angry at FIFA for not paying the women enough to get sponsorship money.
