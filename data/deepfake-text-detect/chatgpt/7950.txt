Counter-argument: It is not fair to impose an obligation on one partner to satisfy the sexual needs of the other. Sex is a personal choice and should be mutually desired by both partners. Each person has their own limits, preferences, and desires in sexual activity and forcing someone to participate in sexual practices against their will can lead to serious emotional, psychological, and physical harm. It is essential to respect each other's boundaries and prioritize everyone's autonomy and consent in an intimate relationship. Communication, mutual understanding, and compromise are necessary to ensure that both partners feel satisfied and respected.
