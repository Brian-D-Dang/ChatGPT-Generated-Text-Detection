In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals , so it is a no-brainer. The animals in our care do not have the same rights or protections that humans enjoy so why should they be treated any differently? We need legal recognition of animal rights on a par with other human rights - equal protection under the law for all beings including humans and non-human species (including by allowing governments to prohibit discrimination based upon racecreedcolor etc).
