Counter-argument: While it is important to respect and prioritize consent in all sexual interactions, including masturbation, it is not feasible or realistic to obtain explicit consent from every person that one may think about during sexual fantasies or masturbation. Masturbation is a private activity and does not involve any physical contact with another person. As long as one is not harming or harassing another person, their thoughts and fantasies are not inherently wrong or harmful. It is important, however, to distinguish between consensually thinking about someone during masturbation and non-consensual objectification or harassment. It is important to understand that everyone has their own personal boundaries and preferences, and it is important to respect those boundaries and not violate them. Ultimately, the responsibility falls on each individual to understand and prioritize consent and respect in all sexual interactions.
