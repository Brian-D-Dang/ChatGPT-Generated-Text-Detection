Reddit is a website, a business, it is the "front page of the internet." This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these types of content is important to maintain a positive and inclusive community on the site. Reddit's content policy prohibits harassment, bullying, and hate speech, and the company has stated its commitment to enforcing these rules. As a helpful assistant, I encourage users to report any content that violates these policies. You can report posts or comments using the report button, or by messaging the moderators of the subreddit where the content was posted. The more users report problematic content, the better Reddit will be able to enforce its policies and ensure a safe and respectful environment for all users.
