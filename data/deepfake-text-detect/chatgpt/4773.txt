I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still don't see how it was wrong for them to do so because they had other things on their mind and not Bernie being interrupted at that particular moment as important as he spoke. My objection is based off my interpretation of American history when it comes to race relations: If you read about slavery, lynchings, segregation, Jim Crow or even you read books from your local library like The Souls Of Black Folk by W E B Du Bois, it would be very clear that these issues have been around since America began. People doing or saying racist things doesn't just suddenly appear out of thin air. In fact, according to Wikipedia[1], "For many years after its inception, this country practiced policies which led to widespread violence against black Americans; official policy included laws such as [slavery] which directly resulted in slaves becoming property." So if we can blame someone else for our problems then why should blacks have any sympathy towards whites? And yet even though white people did stuff to African-Americans up until quite recently, there are some countries who seem to have no problem whatsoever insulting eachother. For example, Australia has never experienced civil war unlike almost every single country in Africa where nationalistic conflicts usually make headlines both within and outside of nations borders. According to Time Magazine,[2]: The neighboring nation of Papua New Guinea, long known for violent clashes between ethnic groups, is now facing one of its worst outbreaks of interracial bloodshed following an outbreak of rioting over an incident involving two Chinese men accused of rape. ... Grand Chief Vakamarra said his tribe, numbering more than 250,000 strong, turned on indigenous Australians living nearby earlier this month during mass protests demanding Paulus Chan fall victim to tribal justice. More than 50 villagers were killed before police moved in to break up the mob. Police estimate 400 Papuans died. It seems, however, that most deaths could have easily been avoided because Australian president Malcolm Turnbull vowed that nothing extreme will happen to those involved.[34] On May 4th 2016 Indigenous Affairs Minister Michael Ferguson described how a group of protesters had threatened 'to set fire to houses...kill anyone coming home tonight' and demanded that Prime MInister Tony Abbott come help.[5] What frustrates me about all of this is the apparent complacency of non-Indigenous peoples in regard to what goes down overseas. Why don't more whites worldwide protest injustices abroad instead of worrying about the slightly worse situation here? It makes sense for whites to support causes closeby but does it really matter whether or not we're talking about ending poverty in China or genocide in Burundi? If we agree that racism isn't limited to certain places and times and persists regardless of geographic location and political climate, shouldn't we show solidarity where appropriate even without having personal ties? Is supporting China and its oppressive regime equivalent to defending apartheid South Africa? Shouldn't we raise awareness wherever possible, instead of only focusing on the immediate area? Of course, sometimes foreigners do intervene themselves despite asking us to stay put. When Charles Darwin went on an expedition across southern India and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), he and several team members participated in helping British troops combat the slave trade.[6] However, was this enough? Was it necessary to leave Britain to defend Africans? What's the difference between Darwins intervention and say Bill Gates[7] donations to charities like Global Health Corps[8] or Oxfam International[9]. Isn't Darvins action arguably much less significant since the conditions already exist here but Global Health Corps and Oxfam International work globally speaking? And if Darvins involvement didn't work or couldn't change anything locally, shouldn't he have done something back home rather than wasting time and money halfway round the world? After all, isn't it better to prevent a problem from happening, rather than trying to fix it once it starts? According to Fox News[10], President Obama donated 400 thousand dollars to organizations focused on addressing domestic abuse domestically. Did that stop domestic abusers from committing acts of violence against women? No it didn't. Yet, that same amount of cash is minuscule compared to Richard Branson donating millions of pounds to organisations like Virgin Unite, founded specifically to end human trafficking, child sexual exploitation and modern day slavery[11]. Does that mean white people won't find ways to try aid others unless forced to do so by foreign governments or international authorities? Or perhaps it means that the majority of peace loving individuals across multiple races prefer to use their own resources to fight for equality rather than donate to useless NGOs. But maybe what's getting lost in all the war talk is the point to begin with - should we be fighting amongst ourselves. Could be truly useful opposition to power imcomplection. This would consist of poor reasoning! Similarly slowinverted (a). Doing
