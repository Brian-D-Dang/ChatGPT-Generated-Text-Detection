NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but the rest are transitioned to regular property taxes over five years or so. Why not go all the way with a full repeal? That's what we did in Seattle after they made rent control illegal in 1979; there was no replacement protection at first because the city council feared backlash from voters if it seemed like they were "punishing" renters. Now people don't even realize (on account of lack of new developments) how much more affordable some neighborhoods used to be compared to others. There isn't quite as high demand anymore either since lots of young families have moved out of older homes apartments into newer developments. We've seen prices drop about 10-20 depending on areatype of unit vs 1978 levels. It also benefited us when buying anyway - before you'd pay 2x your monthly income for an average home, now it seems closer 1.5x. So yeah, it can definitely work!
