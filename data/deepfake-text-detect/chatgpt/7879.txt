While it may be true that fork and knife are traditional and effective utensils for cutting and spearing food, chopsticks offer several advantages that make them superior utensils in some circumstances. Firstly, chopsticks are more hygienic as they don't come into contact with a person's mouth and don't transfer saliva or bacteria as easily as a fork or a knife. Secondly, using chopsticks requires a certain level of dexterity and patience, which may help slow down eating and promote mindfulness while enjoying a meal. Thirdly, chopsticks are often made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, whereas cutlery is often made from plastic or metal, which can be harmful to the environment. Therefore, it can be argued that chopsticks are a great alternative to fork and knife, especially for those who prioritize hygiene, sustainability, and mindful eating.
