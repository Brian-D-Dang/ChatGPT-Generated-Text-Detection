I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites That's great to hear! Data science and machine learning are booming fields with lots of interesting opportunities for programmers. If you're interested in learning more, I'd suggest starting by learning about the basics of statistics and linear algebra. These concepts will form the foundation of much of the mathematics used in data science and machine learning. You might also consider learning one or more programming languages frequently used in data science and machine learning, such as Python or R. There are many resources available online to help you get started with these languages, including free tutorials and courses. Finally, consider solving some coding puzzles and working through some real-world data sets to put your skills to the test. There are many websites, such as Kaggle, that offer data sets and challenges for data scientists and machine learning experts to work on. These can be a great way to learn and to showcase your skills.
