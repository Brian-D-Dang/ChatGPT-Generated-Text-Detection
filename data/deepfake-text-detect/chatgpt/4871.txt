First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and do not serve a valid purpose or protect anyone but rather exact an undue cost on society as a whole. I have also been following Ron Paul for some time now, and find his stance even more objectionable than mine in regards to this topic. In addition to being against the general idea of incarceration, he is adamantly anti-drug policy. A lot of people think there must be some sort of logical explanation behind these stances when taken together; however, according to Paterno's article they seem strangely inconsistent with each other (excepting one paragraph). What exactly does Ron Paul believe? That drugs should be legalized so we can study them without fear of prosecution? Or that you should never use anything unless it has both a prescription from your physician AND the approval of the FDA? This strikes me as pretty close to outright hypocrisy considering what most libertarians support regarding healthcare reform, which was basically nothing at all. The fact remains, no matter how libertarian someone pretends to be, if their position towards drugs changes drastically after supporting policies of "tough on crime" then something needs to give. Is he simply lying about his beliefs or missing out important information? Are those two points even contradictory given the context? Let us examine the substance of his claim shall we? 1) He claims that legalizing marijuana would create a new market based around vendors who sell synthetic pot instead of an existing black market associated with dealers who offer far less quality products with unknown testing methods. However, this argument doesn't make sense because if legalization leads to an influx of users buying cheap weed from questionable sources, why wouldn't this increase demand only strengthen the current system? And if it did lead to significant decreases in violent behavior stemming from increased availability, isn't it likely this wouldn't apply just as much to alcohol which is legal in every state except Iowa? If we look at the situation today, Colorado makes huge profits off its liquor stores while New York City police officers infamously cited young African Americans for possessing small amounts of marijuana before arresting them for felony charges such as assault, robbery, rape, etc., none of which were actually committed by any of those individuals. Do you honestly think that legalizing cannabis markets could avoid similar problems faced by alcohol? Marijuana is illegal due to prohibition practices used during the early 20th century which ultimately led to the creation of organized criminal networks who later spread into our nation's prisons. It seems like President Obama may be advocating for a different approach in his own words "We've got 40 percent unemployment across the boardyou don't hear anybody saying let's go back to Prohibition and bootstrap everything." Then again, man really hates having to pay taxes:) There are several interesting things going on here. First of all, where does Dr. Paul get the statistics concerning the number of prisoners per capita? Second, what if Dr. Paul gets his facts wrong? Thirdly, hasn't federal law enforcement already set up numerous diversion programs whereby middlemen broker these transactions between growers and buyers? Fourth, Dr. Paul goes along with the common misconception that cannabis consumers buy high grade strains grown indoors. While this might account for slightly higher prices, it certainly doesn't mean that farmers selling indoor bud aren't using pesticides to grow these plants. ( even though the majority of America still supports medicinal cannabis use, legislators appear reluctant to pursue national recreational legalization proceedings until 2012. Meanwhile, California recently passed Proposition 19, allowing adults 21 years old and older possess up to an ounce of herb on private property. After 12 months, "If the legislature fails to act on medical marijuana implementation, voters will decide whether to legalize nonmedical recreational use," said Randy Dunn, chief executive officer of CannaCraft Inc., Santa Ana (Calif.), makers of 10 brands including Urbn Leaf. By contrast, in Washington State last year, Initiative 502 failed narrowly 56 - 44, despite polling showing 64 of registered voters supported making possession of limited quantities of marijuana legal over eighteen, leaving advocates disappointed. Instead, Washington State enacted regulation limiting commercial sales and cultivation to licensed dispensaries, and requiring growers to obtain permits issued through the Department of Health.] [Let me add that the link above offers plenty of reasons as to why Prop19 didn't pass, among others]. Another thing worth mentioning - another prominent Libertarian voice, Lew Rockwell joined the chorus urging passage of prop 19 in CA last year, despite the fact he sees marijuana as inherently harmful, claiming it causes schizophrenia. Further highlighting that it is a fanatical minority of Libertarians who push this line.
