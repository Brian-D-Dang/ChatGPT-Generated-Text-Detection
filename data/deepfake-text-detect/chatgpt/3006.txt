For those who don't know, the trolley problem is this: You and another person are on a bridge which is over a trolley track. 5 people are tied to the tracks above you by a magnet. There's an electric current running down that line, but it isn't connected anywhere else in town (the power station has been shut off). The other end of your wire connects up with something you really want to save from being hit by the train at the trolley stop below- what would be the right thing for you both to do? What I find hilarious about this question is everyone can agree how they'd act if there was no repercussions. In reality though most everyone would go "fuck it," just jump out as soon as possible.
