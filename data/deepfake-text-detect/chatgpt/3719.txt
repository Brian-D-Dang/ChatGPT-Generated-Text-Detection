I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was a bit disappointed to learn that the character of Joan Clarke, who was portrayed as a significant member of the team, was not actually given the recognition she deserved in real life. Despite being one of the few female codebreakers at Bletchley Park and playing a key role in the Enigma decryption process, she was not initially given the same level of security clearance or salary as her male colleagues, and was even required to leave her job after marrying. It's a reminder that even in successful and inspiring stories, there can be overlooked perspectives and voices that deserve greater attention and recognition.
