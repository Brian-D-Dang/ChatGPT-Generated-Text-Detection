Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if you do get infected, it's usually just a mild case with no serious consequences or death.[1] In any event, building software is hard enough without bugs like these getting into production code (or worse!) [1]: (I'm not saying this isn't a bug; I'm just pointing out that many people are looking at things from this perspective.)
