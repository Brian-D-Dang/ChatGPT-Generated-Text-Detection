"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the far future then we must act now to ensure that we have the best possible chance of that happening. Secondly, it is a natural consequence of our view that robotics and artificial intelligence will continue to develop until they are equivalent to, or even better than, human level intelligence. In the context of this article, and in the spirit of the above quote, we will take the position that we will never outsmart our creations, rather we will create our successors. To do that however, we first need to look at some of the challenges that we face today. The challenge of loneliness Whenever we look at the future and the challenges that it will bring, we need to firstly look at what challenges we have today, so that we can gauge how far we have to go. In the case of loneliness, it is estimated that 300 million people in the world today feel lonely. This is not surprising when you consider the modern world and the way that we live today. We spend more time communicating with our virtual selves than we do our physical ones and our physical needs are being met by devices that don't have empathy, that don't feel the same emotions that we do and that don't feel lonely. This is why we need to create robots that do have that empathy. The challenge of overpopulation One of the biggest challenges facing humanity today is overpopulation. With over seven billion people living on the planet and that number increasing by roughly 80 million each year, it is a challenge that we need to address. The easiest way to tackle this would be to simply reduce the birth rate. Unfortunately, we have tried that and it has failed. The second way to tackle it would be to remove people from the Earth, but that would cause another huge problem. We need to find a way of creating a sustainable population and ensuring that there are enough resources to support it. One way of doing that would be to colonise other planets, but we have looked at that too and it doesn't work. As we have seen with the Mars One project, there is no way that we can get there and set up a functioning human settlement with what we have today. So we need to find a way of doing it that works. This means that we need to create robots and a civilisation that will continue to grow and evolve long into the future, long after we are dead. The challenge of energy As with the case of population, we need to find a way of solving this problem that is sustainable. Simply relying on fossil fuels is not an option, but neither is solar energy, despite what many of the renewable energy enthusiasts out there may have you believe. The problem with solar energy is that it works best when you have sunshine. It is not a reliable source of energy and it does not provide energy around the clock. To provide that level of energy around the clock, we need nuclear power. The problem with nuclear power is that it is very dangerous and that it has the potential to be used as a weapon of mass destruction. If we want to provide a reliable source of energy for our future robots and civilisation then we need to find a way of making nuclear power safe. It is possible, but it is not easy. The challenge of space exploration Space exploration is the exploration of outer space by means of two-way communication with artificial probes, which are usually called "spacecraft." This article is not about space exploration as such, but rather about the fact that we need to find a way of creating a robotic civilisation that will continue to grow long into the future, long after we are dead. This means that we need to find a way of taking our robots out into space. We have seen that it is possible to send robots out into space, but to create a functioning civilisation that can continue to grow and evolve would require something much more. It would require a robotic version of the Great Mandela Effect. The Great Mandela Effect refers to a phenomenon whereby people are aware of an event in their past, that they are sure of, but are sure that it didn't actually happen. The Great Mandela Effect is currently being studied by researchers at MIT. Researchers have found that certain people are experiencing the Great Mandela Effect on a regular basis and that it is being caused by a kind of glitch in our memory. This glitch in our memory is caused by the fact that we have two copies of our memory, one in our short-term memory and one in our long-term memory. Our short-term
