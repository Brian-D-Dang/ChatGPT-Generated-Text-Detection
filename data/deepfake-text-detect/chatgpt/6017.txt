I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning. It seems to me that we have developed from an early human culture that was rather collectivist, and the modern interpretations of gender are a result of that collectivist culture. I can't really find anything that explains why this view is incorrect, though I do have a lot of personal experience that I believe would be better explained by something other than a collectivist view of gender. I have two children who are now 6 and 8 years old, and they are both boys. My wife and I have two older sons, who are now 22 and 24 years old, who are also both boys. I am the only person in my family that has ever had a daughter, and we have only ever had one daughter in our family. My wife and I have always had a very good relationship, and we have never had any marital problems. I never had any problems with my parents when I was a child, and I never had any problems with my in-laws when my wife and I were married. It is very difficult for me to imagine any way that the above could be the result of the modern interpretation of gender. I don't know if I am making any sense here, and I apologize if I am not making much sense. I'm a bit confused as to the question. It seems to me that we have developed from an early human culture that was rather collectivist, and the modern interpretations of gender are a result of that collectivist culture. I'm not sure what your point is. People have always had a gender. I can't really find anything that explains why this view is incorrect, though I do have a lot of personal experience that I believe would be better explained by something other than a collectivist view of gender. Well, it certainly isn't contradicted by your personal experience. That would be an argument from personal incredulity. I have two children who are now 6 and 8 years old, and they are both boys. My wife and I have two older sons, who are now 22 and 24 years old, who are also both boys. I am the only person in my family that has ever had a daughter, and we have only ever had one daughter in our family. My wife and I have always had a very good relationship, and we have never had any marital problems. I never had any problems with my parents when I was a child, and I never had any problems with my in-laws when my wife and I were married. I'm not sure how your personal experience, or lack thereof, is relevant. As for your speculation, I would point out that you have a failure to distinguish between correlation and causation. I would also point out that the people who hold your viewpoint believe that there is a causal relationship between the two, but I think there's no evidence to support that view. It's not necessary to think that there's an innate difference between the sexes to believe that people are generally suited to different roles. Well, if it's innate, it's not suited to anything. I disagree that people are suited to different roles just by the fact of their gender. It's a little hard to separate out the effects of gender from the effects of other factors. For example, men are more likely to be interested in sports than women, and people who play sports, especially at an elite level, tend to be more competitive, aggressive, and willing to take risks. Those are qualities that are also prized in many occupations, and we often find that people who have those qualities are more likely to enter those occupations. So it's hard to say that they are innately suited to their occupation, and they may not be suited to their occupation at all. We also tend to find that women, on average, have lower levels of testosterone and aggression, which may also be part of the reason why they are not well suited to those occupations. Your view is the same as the view of a lot of people. And they are all wrong. I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm just saying it's highly improbable. I'm not sure why you think it's improbable. I'm saying that it's a contingent fact that people are suited to certain roles, and that those roles have historically been filled by one sex or the other. It's only a contingent fact that people are suited to certain roles, and that roles have historically
