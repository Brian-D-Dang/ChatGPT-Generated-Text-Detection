To get this out of the way early: This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk. An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation. I'm going to give you my opinion, just like you are entitled to give me yours. This is not a debate, it's an opinion. This is also not an article about the merits of skiing. This is not about how this is the best thing ever and everyone else is stupid. This is not about how everyone else is stupid and only I am smart. This is not an article about how people who like to ski should listen to me because I'm a genius. I'm going to keep it simple and sweet. This is an article about what I think of PCMR. It is by no means the definitive article on the topic and if you want to debate me about it, I am probably not going to engage. To be clear: I like PCMR. I think that it has good terrain, a good mix of terrain, and it is a well-run ski area. However, it is my opinion that PCMR has been driven into the ground by a combination of short-sightedness, a lack of vision, and an unwillingness to engage the community in honest, open discussion. When PCMR was first built, it was a resort. A ski resort. They advertised it as a ski resort. It was a ski resort. The resort was a large part of the reason that the ski area was built in the first place. When it opened, the resort had a large number of activities and a large number of amenities to draw in non-skiers and other guests. When the resort closed, PCMR did not adapt. It was replaced by a free lift ticket. A free lift ticket that only offered skiers 20 of the skiable terrain in the resort. Now, I am not going to say that the closing of the resort is entirely the reason that PCMR has been driven into the ground. The economy has had a role to play in all of this. The economy has also had a role to play in the fact that PCMR is so cheap. The reason that PCMR has been driven into the ground by a combination of short-sightedness, a lack of vision, and an unwillingness to engage the community in honest, open discussion is because of two things. PCMR has been pushed as a ski area, while it is really a day resort. A ski area is a place to ski. A day resort is a place for other activities that happen to have a ski lift. PCMR has never marketed itself as a day resort. This is a problem because people go to resorts for activities other than skiing. PCMR has been pushed as a ski area, while it is really a ski area for beginners. PCMR is a great place to learn to ski. I started skiing here. It is also a great place to learn to ski again, which is what I did when I went back to skiing after an eight-year hiatus. PCMR is not a great place to ski. A great ski area is not necessarily a good place to learn to ski. A good place to learn to ski is not necessarily a great ski area. That is all. I am just going to take off my opinion hat and put on my honest hat. This is all my honest opinion. I do not want to engage in debate. I am not a fan of this subreddit because of how things have gone here, but I am very interested in a civil conversation on the topic. This is honestly an excellent point. The resort was a great place to learn to ski. Skiing in the resort was something that everyone could do, whether they were beginners or experts. The resort had a variety of terrain that people could enjoy, regardless of skill level. Now, the resort is a glorified mound of snow. It is an excellent place to learn to ski, which makes it a great place to learn to ski. It is also a good place to ski. The problem is that it is not a great place to ski. I do not want to discuss it, but I think it is worth noting that I think PCMR has a lot of potential as a resort. The ski area is great. If they add more trails and more lifts, it will be amazing. I think that it will be a great place to ski. However, it is currently not a great place to ski. The resort is great. If they add more trails, it will be amazing. I think that it will be a great place to ski. However, it is currently not a great place to ski. I do not want
