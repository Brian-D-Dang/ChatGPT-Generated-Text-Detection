It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be kept in their natural habitat. A situation like this would allow the animal to live as it would naturally (at least for a period of time). Also according to my understanding of communities and nature, wild animals should not be domesticated or raised by human beings. As far as I am aware there are only 2 exceptions where an individual has been taken into captivity; one was Helen Keller and another was Tommy, from "Finding Nemo." Humans cannot completely understand what these creatures feel or how they behave because we lack emotions. We do not have the same sensitivity or instincts that such a creature does...and without those qualities, a person must truly want to know about something before heshe will care enough to learn more about it. So with all of our faults, we humans are better than most other species regarding caring for others. Take Stephen Hawking, for example; his brain is being tested on now at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine's Center for Neurodegenerative Science[2] and researchers hope to develop drugs to prevent deterioration of muscle paralysis due to ALS.[3] This test aims to find possible ways to restore motor function, which also implies that people could use means to help them walk again after becoming paralyzed. There is nothing wrong if someone wants to see a tiger up close, even though some visitors may get too carried away with their curiosity and forget about the well-being of the tiger when entering its cage. Imagine how many millions of dollars of money were spent to build that zoo. Who else knows the story behind why certain enclosures had gone unused? And who knew that tigers actually prefer to fend for themselves rather then to rely on food provided by humans. They don't need any special treatment except the normal day to day life since birth till death that every other animal enjoys. Look, whether you agree or disagree with anything said here, respect your fellow man and try to spread love and kindness instead of spreading hate and anger towards each other. Life isn't worth living if you take yours and others' lives away just so you'll put others down.
