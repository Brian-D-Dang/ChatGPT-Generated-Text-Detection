I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community, but I do believe that we must also be careful in our beliefs about sexuality and gender identity. When you are engaged with an LGBTQ person online, your thoughts are usually distorted, and they can take on a completely different meaning than those expressed back home. This is especially true when you have some form of communication with the individual who created the materials for your article: "Whatwhy was lesbianism really envisioned?" The real issue here is whether or not homosexuals are truly participants in social constructivism, and how it operates. To understand why this might be so, consider what an orientation is actually meant to mean: It is something other people do not want others to know, and which can lead to their own prejudices. A gay man has a partner, he may feel safe enough to flirt with her in public, but if she is attracted to another guy, then there is no point in it anyway, because she will never get married! So, find out if it is okay for someone else to engage in sexual activity with someone you don't deeply love. If you aren't happy with yourself, try dating someone who doesn't want to get married. On the face of things, the benefits of having sex would seem inconsequential to most people. But, it's undeniable that homosexuality is a major function of our society - whether heterosexual or homosexual - and we all live differently. In fact, I find myself asking myself questions about homosexuality over time as I look at my own life and see exactly how much I can change. That being said, I found it difficult to make any headway until a few years ago. Sure, I had friends that were openly homophobic (and often kept them around), but they always wanted me to (mostly). And now I am quite open about it, admitting I really do enjoy enjoying what I do. Even though, sometimes it seems difficult, it is worthwhile. People should keep themselves informed and keep up with the latest trends, so they don't burn bridges during difficult times. More importantly, they need to understand the impact that this type of behaviour could have on young men and women in general. Unfortunately, LGBTQ people living in Western countries are used to seeing this sort of discrimination, even when it isn't explicitly stated by any of our fellow human beings, and it's just too easy for them to ignore it without acknowledging it. What many Westerners forget is that homophobia exists in various forms, including de facto racism and against race... It's appalling that these attitudes are still prevalent today, and we continue to be taught to believe that the only way to prevent such situations is to find solutions. In an effort to decrease inequality in the world, however, it is important that everyone takes steps towards making equality known through education, healthcare and other means (including getting involved in youth organizations) to rid ourselves of this destructive attitude.
