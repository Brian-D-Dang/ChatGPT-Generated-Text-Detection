Thought about this for days, and I can't think of one aspect of the FPH community that made Reddit better: - They are ignorant: Proven by the overwhelming number of posts by the same user, as well as the inability to read. I don't mean to sound harsh, but it's true. - They are entitled: They feel entitled to everything, and complain when they don't get it. They use the phrase "It's not fair" way too often. - They are ignorant about how to use the site and rules. This is my biggest gripe. I've seen people get banned for posting memes, and yet they have a good post history. I've seen them getting banned for posting in the wrong subreddit. They complain about this when the person is not banned. - They are not creative: For a community that prides itself on creativity, I'm disappointed with how little new content I see in the sub. I'm not counting posts from people who can't post on the main site, or people who repost memes from other subreddits. - They are not helpful: One user actually told someone to contact a support agent if they have issues. I don't understand that. There is a section on the front page for support. I've also seen people act like they have an issue and make false reports. - They are lazy: This is a huge problem. I've seen people asking the same question in the same subreddit, and they never bother to look for the answer. I've seen people claiming they have an issue, but there is no evidence. There is a lot of effort that goes into supporting the FPH community, and it's not appreciated. - They are terrible: There are a lot of people who are just bad people, but I'll keep this one short. I'm talking about the people who act like they are better than everyone else, the people who act like they are better than the site, the people who act like the site is for them. I'm talking about the people who have never posted anything of value, and instead complain about the site. These people are not the issue. If they weren't here, the community would be just fine. They may be annoying, but they are not a problem. There is a lot of great content in FPH, and I think that people are making this community worse. Please don't take this as a personal attack. I'm just talking about my experience. Luke 185 5h10m I think you have a really good point there. I have noticed that the majority of posts on the front page are just complaints. People do not seem to understand the rules and are just complaining about a post that was made by a moderator. I have noticed a lot of complaints on this subreddit. People are just making a post and saying "I think this should be removed from the front page" without actually providing an explanation or solution to the problem. People just seem to be ungrateful. There are a few posts on the front page that I really appreciate. But a lot of the posts are just complaints about something that the moderators have done. Kevonisx1 20 6h32m Some of the stuff that is posted on the front page isn't even fucking real. I like how this entire thread is a bunch of unsubstantiated claims with no specific examples. If you think there is a problem, give specific examples. I don't know how to respond to this, because you are just making up things. This is the thing I was talking about. It's not fair for you to claim there is a problem with the community without actually providing any evidence. It just makes you look ignorant. I don't need to provide evidence. It's a community discussion, which means it's up to the members of the community to decide if it's fair or not. If you have a problem, let people know about it in a post that actually details the problem. But you are the only person who has commented on this thread so far. That means that you are the only person who gets to decide if it's fair or not. There are a few people who have commented, but their comments are all misinformed or lack evidence. The number of people who have commented does not determine the validity of the claim. I am the only person who gets to decide if it's fair or not? No, I'm not. I'm just the only person who commented, which means I'm just one person. You may be the only person to comment on this thread,
