Country music was not always bad. There were legends such as Johnny Cash who defined what country music was. However, today the country music culture is full of songs about partying and nothing more. When asked about it, many artists like Luke Bryan just deflect. If you ask them about the actual meaning behind their lyrics, they just say they are just party songs or that they are just having fun. But that is not what country music is all about. It is supposed to be about the struggles of life, the highs and the lows. People like Luke Bryan are taking country music and making it just another genre. When we were younger, we had plenty of songs about drinking and partying, but these were not the only songs.
