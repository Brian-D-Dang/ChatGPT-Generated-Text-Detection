I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need to smoke? I don't agree with banning cigarettes or chew. Sure, it may not help you in the immediate future, but there is a difference between what is healthy for me now, and what will make me healthier later on down the road. If someone wants to grab some cigs after work. I'm gonna let them do it as long as they dont start smoking daily like many people here seem to want.
