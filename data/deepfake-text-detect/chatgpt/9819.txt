Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of research and reading up on both sides of the argument, I'm still undecided as to which is the right choice. I think it's important in this situation to recognize that both sides have compelling arguments for why they believe what they do. It can be difficult to make a decision when you don't feel like either side is completely wrong or right. That being said, I think the most important thing to consider when making a decision is what you believe to be the safest option for you and your family. You should weigh the potential risks and benefits of both sides and determine which one will provide the best protection against serious diseases. Ultimately, no one can make the decision for you, so it's important to understand all the facts before coming to a conclusion.
