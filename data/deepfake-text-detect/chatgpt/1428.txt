I am a fan of many sports, and all of them seem to take a lot of skill. But golf has always been the one I hated. It's always been easier for me than tennis or any other sport that takes more effort (and time) on my part," he said in an interview with The Associated Press last year. "It was difficult because you're playing against yourself, not another player. So what matters is your own score."

He started by winning four matches - including halving the 18th hole with Englishman Sam Horsfield, who will become his caddie this week - before losing 43 to Chilean Joaquin Niemann, whose only loss so far came when the pandemic forced him home from South Africa before he could defend his title. The 43-year-old Westwood is playing under a new name: Ian Poulter. He got into golf soon enough, but says "golf never really grabbed hold." At 16, he played football instead; then went to college baseball, where his passion remained baseball until he switched again toward the end of college to try golf. Westwood successfully defended his Masters title two years ago, coming within inches of holing the final putt. More recently, he had chances to win majors that were taken away because of bad bounces off trees. Was he disappointed? Yes and no. "There are times when things aren't going quite right... but there have also been some fantastic experiences just being able to get up and down 72 holes without bending your backside," he told Golf Digest magazine earlier this year. "When I hit good shots and they go in, it feels like 'Wow!' And if I make bogey, well, obviously that doesn't feel great either! It can be very frustrating sometimes. That's life though. You've just got to keep rolling those dice and hope something goes your way."
