If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean can have its own benefits as well. For example, these languages are spoken by a large number of people and are important in business and trade. Additionally, learning a language like Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean can also open up opportunities to travel, study or work in East Asia. Ultimately, the decision to learn a language should be based on personal interests and goals.
