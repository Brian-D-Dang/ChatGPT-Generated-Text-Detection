The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it doesn't appear to be on a national level at all. As far as I recall, Bill Nye the Science Guy has been given an award by the IHSA for his work as a "national consultant" on abortion issues in the U.S., and he also provides access to one of IHSA's web sites which specifically addresses the question of whether or not Roe v. Wade violated human rights. The website addresses each question with some commentary: But what if abortions are designed more literally than merely leaving patients sick? And how can we take advantage of this ambiguity when many clinics provide just a few abortions every day without any hassle? Because unlike Roe V. Wade, we do have access to care from our physician services. Abortion is only legal in certain cases where, after a successful procedure performed on an indigenous alien or woman who was conceived with rape on her mind, an autopsy results show she had no conception again. We would be legally able to terminate a pregnancy if it was medically necessary, or they were found to cause serious bodily harm to the woman. I use the phrase "abortion is illegal under 18 U.S.C. 1152" because I consider abortion "legal" in some clinical contexts (for example, in the United States), but not in others - even though our laws are so strict that doctors do not need to carry out an abortion or abort in order to perform it. In essence, the distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. So why does it matter? One thing about abortion is that if you're being charged with murder, no amount of time will mean anything. You'll most likely end up in jail, no matter what your case may involve. There simply isn't much evidence to back these claims up; however, there is something intrinsically wrong with demanding that physicians and other health professionals be allowed to remove abortion from their practice, including requiring them to operate in state hospitals for whom abortion is not legal in most states. The right to choose should be protected in all circumstances, including those involving minors and people with diseases that might otherwise define themselves before a doctor could provide treatment or care to them. If abortion is somehow illegal under 17 U.S.C. 1152, then the federal government has no place to regulate its activities, unless Congress allows the removal of such an act. So if you want private entities to enforce rules that violate human rights while doing business, remove abortion from your practice. In my view, it's the institution of the U.S. Constitution that fundamentally protects us against the tyranny of law at all levels. It serves two purposes: first, it protects individual liberty and Second, it makes clear that the country as whole is a democracy running through a system of checks and balances. What difference does it make that the judiciary, which controls the executive branch, cannot impose justice on citizens?
