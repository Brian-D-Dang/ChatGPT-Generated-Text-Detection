While it may be true that not everyone sees lack of consent as a compelling argument against zoophilia, it remains a valid and important argument nonetheless. Consent is a fundamental aspect of ethical and moral behavior, and any sexual activity without the clear and enthusiastic consent of all parties involved is unethical and potentially abusive. Moreover, the fact that some individuals may not see a lack of consent as a problem only underscores the need for more education and awareness around issues of consent and sexual ethics. We must continue to promote and uphold the values of consent and respect for all living beings, including animals, in order to create a more just and ethical society.
