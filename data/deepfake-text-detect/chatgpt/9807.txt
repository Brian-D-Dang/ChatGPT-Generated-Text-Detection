Alright, so, I was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while I am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, I think it's a good idea. The challenge is to create a game that requires no money and can be played with any number of people. One idea I had was a game of charades. Players would take turns acting out different scenarios or words, while the others try to guess what they are trying to portray. This could be done in teams or as individuals, depending on the preference of the group. The game could also be adapted for different ages and levels of difficulty, so it could be enjoyed by people of all ages. Alternatively, a game of Pictionary could also be played without any money, as players draw out their clues for others to guess. Another game that could be fun to play without money is a game of truth or dare. Players can either choose to answer a truth question or accept a dare from another player. As long as you come up with creative questions and dares, this game can be entertaining and can involve any number of people. Finally, a game of Werewolf could also be played without any money. This game involves players taking on certain roles, such as werewolves, villagers, and seers, and trying to figure out who is who during the night phase. This game can be modified to fit any number of people and is a great way to have fun with friends and family.
