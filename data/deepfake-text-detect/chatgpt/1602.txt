I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically we're talking BWR vs boiling water reactors given today's technology, which means there are still draconian safety standards when it comes to decommissioning old Nuclear Power Plants (or anything else). But if you look at things like this study on waste generating rates for thorium reactor fuel rods in various countries... well then your worries start to seem more real no?
