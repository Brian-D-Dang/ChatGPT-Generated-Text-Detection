The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, but not why or by whom - some say God created us all from nothingness (Big Bang theory), others believe there was something before our Universe existed; a creator who made everything out of mindless matter which automatically formed into starsplanets etc., through natural processes! This is what I ask you: can anyone explain WHY? How could an omnipotent Being exist if He knew His creation would go wrong because he didn't create mankind as perfect beings since perfection doesn' t come for free...and so on..
