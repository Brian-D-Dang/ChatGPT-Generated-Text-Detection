I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I would be interested in hearing other opinions on why it's not worth their timeeffort for men to make themselves presentable and put some effort into grooming? My wife (and her friends) think they are physically beautiful already; they have all had several compliments about looks; if you don't like them as they are then leave! They appreciate being asked out but just try to remember that every person has different tastes so maybe you should give someone else a chance because your type might not be theirs. The one exception was when we were at an event where there was a formal dress code. These people looked amazing with how much attention they got from others. Being attractive doesn't mean you can get away without any of these things: good hygiene, no bad breath, well groomed eyebrows eyelashes, clean teeth, a nice smile, pleasant personality, humor and intelligence to name a few. If they only want sex I suggest finding someone who will treat you better than most women ever do (like me!). ...what a cop-out answer. It's sad that many men resort to such a pathetic excuse. You're saying "It's hard work changing yourself." It may seem that way. But then again, it's also hard work losing weight or improving any other aspect of your life. You know what happens though? People notice you look nicer, ask questions like "Hey man did you lose weight?!" And then you realize you DO care about looking good, even if you didn't used too before. That's part of growing up. Besides, fashion really isn't expensive anymore. Besides earrings and necklaces, everything except fancy shoes and suits can be picked up for cheap.
