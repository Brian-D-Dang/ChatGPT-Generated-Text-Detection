While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems. I believe this way to be the most moral and ethical way of dealing with problems. It is also the most practical. In this paper I will explain my view point on this topic. I believe that human beings are the cause of most of our problems. We are greedy and lazy. We destroy the environment and the resources. We are selfish and uncompromising. We kill each other in wars. We kill animals in the name of sport. We overpopulate. We have little regard for future generations. Human beings are no longer thinking about the greater good, they are only thinking about themselves. We are the cause of most of our problems.
