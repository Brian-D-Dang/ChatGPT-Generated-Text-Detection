While it is true that some movies rely too heavily on plot twists as a cheap way to up the "wow factor," it's important to remember that a well-executed twist can add depth and complexity to a story. A good twist should not only shock the audience but also make sense within the context of the film's themes and character development. In fact, some of the most critically acclaimed and successful films of all time, such as The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense, have relied heavily on plot twists to engage and captivate audiences. Therefore, it's not fair to dismiss all twists as cheap tricks; there are plenty of examples where a well-executed twist has elevated a movie to a higher level of storytelling.
