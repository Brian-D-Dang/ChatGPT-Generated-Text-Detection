I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured to take her husband's last name, and it's also common for people to have two last names due to cultural or family traditions. It's important to remember that everyone's name is valid and should be respected, regardless of how many last names they have. Making fun of someone's name is not funny or helpful in any way. Instead, try to appreciate everyone's unique identity and avoid making jokes at someone else's expense.
