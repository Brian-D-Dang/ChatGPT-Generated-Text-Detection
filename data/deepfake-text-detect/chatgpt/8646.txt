After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific sense. Why don't you just take an hour-long class, and teach yourself more about the world? I am not saying you can't go on with your life, but if you have no interest in learning anything new, why bother at all?
