I respectfully disagree with the statement you have made. It is unfair to make such sweeping generalizations about people based on their travel preferences. People travel for various reasons, including the desire to explore new cultures, immerse themselves in history, and gain memorable experiences. If someone from a Western culture chooses to travel to another Western culture, it doesn't automatically make them a douche. It simply shows that they have different preferences and are interested in exploring different aspects of their own culture. Furthermore, labeling someone based on their travel preferences is judgmental and may not accurately reflect their personality or character.
