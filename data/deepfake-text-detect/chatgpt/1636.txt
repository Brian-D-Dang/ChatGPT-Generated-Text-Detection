Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich or poor. However these ideologies will never succeed because they can't be enforced evenly across the country so rather than trying to force equality of outcome you just opt for a more egalitarian society with some achievement based tests that determine if someone gets into university (or anything similar). I'm not defending socialism by any means but I think it's important when discussing socialist ideas to distinguish them from communismsocial democracy which are very different things.
