It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. I believe the time spent on developing such vehicles can be better spent looking at ways to reduce automobile accidents while improving mobility. This could include more research into making automobiles safer, smarter, more efficient or less hazardous for pedestrians (such as driverless taxi cabs). As long as these technologies remain experimental there should not be any regulations about them being used unless it concerns road safety. It should also be noted this technology will affect persons who work in industries related to vehicle manufacturing or even those employed by the privately owned auto industry so regulation of usage must take this factor into account if they hope to limit damage done to humans from using vehicles built with such tech yet at the same time provide improved access to resources through having easier means of travel available
