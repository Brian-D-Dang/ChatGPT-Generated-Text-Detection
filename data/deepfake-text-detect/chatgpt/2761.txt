Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. Let's cut the cynicism for a minute and acknowledge that our country has been through some serious shit recently, we're not going back down this road of being fucked over by corporations again What exactly are you talking about?

Of course with tax breaks companies avoid taxes anyway which doesn't help anyone
