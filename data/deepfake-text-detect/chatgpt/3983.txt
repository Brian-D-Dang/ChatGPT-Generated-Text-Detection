This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced by saying that I am not a scientist; only a layman interested in answering questions about my own scientific knowledge and background. In the past five years, we have seen exactly what happens when you let off the gas pedal for too long on global warming: The worlds temperatures rise, and they are going up very fast. There are two primary reasons why the world's temperature has been increasing so rapidly over these last few decades. One, it seems as if there is no end to fossil fuel pollution or human-caused climate change. Unfortunately, though, due to our inability to see beyond the short term (even at a large scale), that may well turn out to be true. Two, there is also something called "climate feedback" wherein rising temperatures cause more drastic changes than would otherwise be possible and which can make things even worse than they already were. Because of the rise in temperature, we are seeing extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, hurricanes, fires, etc. We do know that humans did contribute some small amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, however, most scientists argue that this cannot be considered a major factor since other factors such as natural variability, ocean currents, volcanoes, firesstorms, and many others which affect how the earth functions on a daily basis played much larger roles. Some of these effects include less precipitation which results from increased evaporation rates resulting from higher temperatures, and increased ocean acidification which means that sea levels are changing faster than predicted by scientists. Now, before anyone jumps to conclusions on this issue (and please don't!), know that I am an avid advocate of the use of renewable energy sources like wind power, solar panels, hydroelectric dams, tidal streams, and geothermal resources, as well as conservation efforts including recycling and reusing materials where possible. I believe that saving energy is a good thing and should always be encouraged. To prevent further damage from climate change, though, we need to find ways to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels both domestically - especially coal and oil - and internationally. Some articles about the subject seem to indicate that rather than cutting back on fossil fuel usage we are actually spending more money on unnecessary government programs designed to encourage individuals to buy more expensive cars and other consumer goods because they get heated by burning these products. If we really want to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels, then we need to save them, not spend trillions building new roads and bridges every single year instead.
