I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends . Try a different kind of coffee next time you have one? Or just drink it black straight up and don't think about it too much, or go buy some coffee beansground and make your own delicious stuff!
