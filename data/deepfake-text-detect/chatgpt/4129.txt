The reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using the word "hard" in the title it takes a lot of energy and commitment from you as well as others. This will make me seem like an idiot for saying all the things I am about, but this game has changed everything about how we think, feel, and act, and if your not ready or willing to be part of its revolution then you should definitely just stay out of its way. At least they have some brains though!:D
