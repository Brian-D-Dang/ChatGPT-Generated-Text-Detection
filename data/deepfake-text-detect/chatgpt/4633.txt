I don't particularly hold this view dearly, I just expect there might be some budding historians on Reddit with more information! It was influenced mostly by [this article] , which is why the title of my post is 'The original reddit' There's also a lot less fuzziness about it in that one. Reddit started out as an academic project created for a class at Stanford University (where else?) and then later spun off to become its own thing. They have been slowly adding features and developing their business model over time ever since. This has expanded into everything from software development to web design to brand awareness. In fact, whenever you hear someone talk about how much they hatelove certain things on the website, chances are it comes back to them hating or loving something to do with reddit itself - because it's all part of what makes reddit so special The central themes of reddit are: Flexibility Diversity Neutrality High standards of quality Leave the personal stuff aside And here we go...
