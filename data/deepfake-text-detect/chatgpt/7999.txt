There is no denying that having a language regulator can help standardize the language and make it easier to learn. However, it is also important to note that the lack of a language regulator has allowed for more creativity and flexibility in the English language. English has borrowed from various languages and has evolved over time, adapting to the needs of its speakers. This has allowed the language to be constantly changing and growing, making it adaptable to different contexts and cultures. The beauty of English lies in its ability to be versatile and expressive, and a language regulator could potentially stifle its growth and creativity. Furthermore, with the advent of technology and globalization, English is becoming more and more of a global language, and having a centralized governing body for a language spoken by millions of people from different backgrounds and cultures could prove to be difficult and controversial.
