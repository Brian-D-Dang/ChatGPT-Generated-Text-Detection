I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that they can't be held responsible for the actions of their assailant. It's true that victims of rape cannot be held responsible for the actions of their assailant, and that it is not their fault. However, it is also true that they are not helpless victims, and that they can take precautions to prevent themselves from being raped. I feel like there is this weird belief that, once someone is raped, that person is helpless and victimized for the rest of their lives. It's as if once someone is raped, they are somehow ruined for life. When really, they are no more "ruined" than they would have been if they had just broken their arm in a car accident. Yes, they have been victimized, and yes, it's terrible. But they are still a person, and have the ability to do things to prevent themselves from being victimized again. When I talk about rape prevention, it's not about advocating for women to take all the risk out of going out into public, or that they need to be terrified of the world around them. I think that's an exaggeration. It's about teaching women to be aware of their surroundings, and to do what they can to prevent themselves from being victimized. For example, it's not practical to carry a gun around with you, or wear a bulletproof vest, or never be alone at night. But it's not unreasonable to carry pepper spray, or to avoid walking down dark alleys at night, or to avoid walking through parking garages. Or to ask for an Uber, or to call someone when you get to your destination. It's about taking steps to reduce the likelihood that you will be victimized, rather than feeling powerless and like a victim for the rest of your life. And it's about teaching women to do those things. I don't think that people realize this, or that it even occurs to them that women might feel that way. Whenever I say something like that, the response I get is, "Well, what about if someone breaks into your house in the middle of the night and rapes you, then?" Yes, there will always be people who will victimize others. It's a sad reality of the world that some people are evil. And it sucks that this happens to other people. But it doesn't change the fact that you can take steps to prevent yourself from being victimized. I think that when we talk about rape prevention, we need to talk about it in a way that doesn't make people feel powerless and victimized. But instead, we talk about it in a way that makes people feel guilty and like they're responsible for their own victimization. We talk about it in a way that makes people feel guilty and like they're responsible for their own victimization. We talk about it in a way that makes people feel that they can't do anything to prevent themselves from being victimized. And we talk about it in a way that makes it seem like all women are helpless victims, and that it's a man's fault if they're raped. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel like it's not only their fault, but that there's nothing they can do to prevent themselves from being victimized. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel guilty. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel like it's their fault. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel like victims. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel like they're helpless. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel like it's their fault. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel like they're powerless. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel like they have no control over their own bodies. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel like they're victims. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel like they're helpless. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel powerless. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel like they're not responsible for their own actions. And we talk about it in a way that makes people feel like victims.
