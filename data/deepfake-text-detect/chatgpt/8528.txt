I feel like they're acting and it often feels very campy. I don't like how they say "well my brain is more feminine," like excuse me that's something that women can have but men cannot, therefore we need to make you into a woman with surgery so society views us as normal? That sounds ridiculous! The only thing the show gets right about trans people comes from its transgender characters who are not played by cis actors - which also contributes towards making them seem unrelatable or even less real than their non-trans counterparts (the firing of Caitlyn Jenner for example).
