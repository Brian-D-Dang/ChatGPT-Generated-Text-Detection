In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they do not consent is considered a serious crime known as sexual assault or rape. It is important to always obtain clear and enthusiastic consent before engaging in any sexual activity. Engaging in sexual activity without consent is not only morally wrong but also illegal and can lead to severe legal consequences. It is crucial to respect and honor one's autonomy and bodily integrity, and never engage in any sexual activity unless there is clear, enthusiastic and ongoing consent from all parties involved.
