When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Tatooine, they encounter Watto, a junk dealer who owns two slaves, Anakin Skywalker and his mother Shmi. When Qui-Gon learns he cannot buy them, he is determined to find a way to liberate them. Meanwhile, the boy is fascinated by the Jedi and the force, but Watto wants nothing to do with the Jedi, whom he perceives to be greedy and dishonest. Anakin is thrilled when he learns that the Jedi can read his mind, but Qui-Gon cannot tell if he is telling the truth. When Anakin accidentally burns Watto's hand, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan must decide if they are justified in liberating the boy from his master, even if it means removing him from his home. The film has many outstanding elements, but the main strength of this film is the relationship between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. This movie makes it very clear to the viewer that they are best friends, and they really seem to enjoy each other's company. In the novels, they seem to tolerate each other and occasionally argue, but there is no sense of closeness. This is probably one of the biggest reasons I enjoy this film. Another great aspect is the way Qui-Gon learns about the force and how Obi-Wan is very fond of the young Anakin. These are all great elements, but the best thing about this film is the depiction of Anakin. Anakin is portrayed very well in this film. He is a boy who wants to be a Jedi, but he is also an innocent young boy who is often frightened by his new experiences. He is also shown to be very observant, which will become an important trait throughout the series. The other great part of Anakin is how much he wants to learn about the force. He is constantly asking questions about it, and when he is able to see the future, he is fascinated by it. This will become an important trait of Anakin Skywalker, and it is good to see this characteristic in the movies. Mace Windu is also introduced in this movie, but he doesn't have much of a role. He shows up to watch over the Jedi and is briefly mentioned in the dialogue, but he is only shown in a few shots. He will become a major character in the prequel trilogy, but this movie only shows a few glimpses of him. This movie is rated PG for some violence, but there is no nudity or other mature content, which is why it is rated PG. The violence is not excessive, and it is not gratuitous. The special effects are good, and the set designs are creative. The costumes are also creative, but the only thing I really didn't like about the costumes was the fact that Yoda has a nose. This seems odd to me because in the comics and books, Yoda is described as having no nose. The story is well written and very interesting. It is easy to follow and moves along at a brisk pace. This is one of my favorite episodes of the series, and it is definitely one of the best. This film is definitely a must see for Star Wars fans, and it is also enjoyable for those who have never seen the series before. This is one of the best Star Wars movies in the entire series. It has a great story, good acting, and good character development. It is a wonderful movie. This is one of the best movies in the Star Wars series.
