I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, right? But our eyes somehow seem to know that life is more than just black and white (no pun intended) because we see shades of gray sometimes and even though they're hard for us to understand or describe with words, we can still feel them. Is there any word on how people came up with these concepts "goodevil," "blackwhite," etc.? I was wondering if anyone has an idea about when people started using those terms. Is there anything that influenced their usage at all?
