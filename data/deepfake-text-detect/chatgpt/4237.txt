I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience with nuclear weapons, we know that they are not a deterrent or an effective method of taking out vital targets. They can cause and serious degree of damage which is often associated with mass fatalities. While these effects can be mitigated or reduced through careful planning, they cannot be eliminated completely. Having accepted that I believe it would be better for our citizens if the US use conventional arms rather than nuclear weapons. As stated earlier, they have been proven time and again to be ineffective at any level as well as being very expensive and difficult to maintain. Nuclear weapons also produce harmful radiation that has grave health impacts on anyone who may come into contact with them. Further, once used, there will always be another generation of humans willing to learn more about how to make them even more powerful, making them far less secure. In my opinion, the decision should ultimately rest with our elected representatives in Washington DC and their constituents.
