Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a "curved" piece of metal, and now I need to know how to cut a 90 degree angle from a flat piece of metal, which is much easier to bend. Hey all, I need to cut a 90 degree angle from a flat piece of metal. I am trying to get a bit more precise with my measurements, and I was wondering how to cut this into the metal? 1. Mark the cut line on the piece of metal. 2. Cut the metal using a metal cutting tool or file. 3. Use a metal bending tool to bend the metal into a 90 degree angle. 4. File the cut edges smooth and paint. The way I usually do this is to just cut it using a metal file, and then bend the metal into the shape I want using pliers. Or can you find a better way? This is really hard to do with a metal file, you have to try and hold it really still while cutting, but it's pretty easy with a metal bending tool, which is what I will use this time. Can you use a different metal cutting tool? This tool is actually a way to help shape metal, but I have also found that it works pretty well for cutting metal into a 90 degree angle. Here is the metal cutting tool.

Can you use a different metal cutting tool? I have tried using a metal file, but it's really hard to cut straight, and I can't really get it to cut a 90 degree angle.

Cut it in sections using a hacksaw or a handsaw. It'll be easier. You can get a T-square for cutting metal. It's one of the most useful tools you can have. If you have a sheet of metal, you can easily cut it with a tin snips. I know you can use a hacksaw or a handsaw to cut metal, but I was really trying to make it as precise as possible. I haven't tried a T-square for cutting metal, but I have a hack saw, and tin snips, and I was wondering if I could use them?
