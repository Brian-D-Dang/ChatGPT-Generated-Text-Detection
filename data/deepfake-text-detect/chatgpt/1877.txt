Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move right along. Despite all of this coming out in public and even some of the victims relatives being interviewed there are still so many questions remaining unanswered by those who should do their jobs better than anyone else other than God himself (and maybe a few journalists). One such question has to be why wasn't his death as quick an execution? Another following thought would also need some explanation: Why did he wait until after Obama left office before executing him? If you believe in heaven or hell what's the point if someone like Osama bin Laden isn't punished for murdering 3 thousand Americans AFTER Bush leaves office instead of during it. The obvious answer might lie with the fact that the new president doesn't want any part of killing terrorists but let me ask again... What's the big deal exactly putting a guy like OBL behind bars anyway?? In my opinion they don't really deserve much more punishment than just spending the rest of your life in prison. Even though this makes no sense and may sound crazy to most people at first glance think about this for a moment.... Suppose we had 8 billion dollars sitting around somewhere already from the oil spill investigation where BP supposedly was supposed to pay 20 Billion into a fund used to clean up the mess they caused! Would it not make more sense to use that money to go burn down BPC headquarters headquarters rather than letting them continue to run around freely causing damage while getting off scot free?! This entire case seems way too fishy to ignore especially since the government knows they screwed up and acted so irresponsibly yet continues to try and cover up their mistake without admitting fault!! The whole thing stinks everyone involved needs to step aside get rid of the problem and start over..... But sadly only certain political party officials will ever admit wrong doing because their true agenda is to keep us enslaved forever which begins and ends with complete control over the population.... And every single person from everybody else must bow to their wishes so long as they're compliant.
