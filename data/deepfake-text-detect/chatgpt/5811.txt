The Earth is constantly changing and moving in predictable patterns and cycles. The water cycle and nutrient cycles (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, etc.) are Earth's metabolism. The Homo sapiens component of the Earth's biology is the only one that can measure and record the patterns and cycles. The sustainable use of the Earth's resources and the sustainable use of the Earth's energy resources are the same thing. The Earth's energy is the energy required to maintain the temperature and the water cycle and nutrient cycles. Sustainable use of the Earth's energy means keeping the Earth's temperature constant and not disrupting the cycles. Sustainable use of the Earth's resources means using only those resources in the cycles in amounts that do not disrupt the cycles. Most of the energy consumed in a modern economy is used to maintain the temperature and the cycles. The rest is used to do things the cycles cannot do: create and deliver the materials and products consumers want. The amount of energy consumed to produce a product is roughly proportional to the amount of energy consumed to use that product. Sustainable energy is energy that is not consumed by the cycles. Sustainable energy is available to be consumed to do things that the cycles cannot do. Sustainable energy is energy that can be consumed to produce and deliver the materials and products consumers want. We can increase the sustainable energy capacity of our economy. We cannot increase the sustainable energy capacity of our economy by consuming energy that is not available. We can increase the sustainable energy capacity of our economy by using energy that is not consumed by the cycles. We can increase the sustainable energy capacity of our economy by consuming energy that is consumed by the cycles. The most sustainable energy is energy that is not consumed by the cycles. The most sustainable use of energy is the use of energy that is consumed by the cycles. The use of energy that is not consumed by the cycles is not sustainable. The use of energy that is consumed by the cycles is sustainable. There is no sustainable use of energy that is consumed by the cycles. The best way to use energy that is consumed by the cycles is to use as much of it as possible. The more energy we use, the more capacity for energy we create. We can increase the sustainable energy capacity of our economy by using energy that is consumed by the cycles. We can increase the sustainable energy capacity of our economy by using energy that is not consumed by the cycles. We can increase the sustainable energy capacity of our economy by using energy that is consumed by the cycles. We can increase the sustainable energy capacity of our economy by using energy that is not consumed by the cycles.
