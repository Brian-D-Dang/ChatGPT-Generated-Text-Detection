From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have his faults. He was infamous for being an egomaniac and doing stupid stuff, but he also had some great ideas, and was very good friends with many founders (including Washington), so that say something about him as well. AJ- I am sure you are right in saying this. However, I do think it important to understand that only one of those people never owned slaves. Regardless of their other flaws, they did make major contributions to our nation and culture; we should be proud of them. The person who never owned slaves is George Washington. I agree wholeheartedly with what you said regarding each of these men. Although Jefferson, Adams, etc. frequently disagreed about policy issues during their time together at the White House, particularly concerning slavery, none upheld or supported slavery. They all believed that if states could decide whether or not to permit slavery within themselves, then they were free from federal interference through government action. In legal terms, however, if slavery exists under state law, even though it may be contrary to public policy, Congress has no authority to interfere by passing legislation forbidding such a practiceit must simply enforce its own laws against anyone convicted of violating state law, regardless of how heinous or benign the alleged offense might actually be. This statement originates from a conservative interpretation of justiciability, which holds that while the Supreme Court can invalidate unconstitutional acts passed by Congress, when presented with a challenge based upon an act conflicting with a provision of the Constitution itself, the court cannot determine if the constitutional text applies because there would be nothing before them to interpret! Another example arises out of the 17th Amendment, where the intent behind allowing citizens to vote directly for Senators instead of voting indirectly via state legislatures was also controversial. Debate raged over whether senators elected by direct suffrage were "representatives" or "delegates," etc., and thusly whether they were bound by any rules governing representatives. Ultimately, no particular answer will ever be found to this question, since the U.S. Senate operates according to different rules than most other national legislative bodies do, and doesn't come under the purview of Article V. If someone slaps an amendment onto the constitution denying women the right to vote, or giving corporations more rights than human beings, there WILL be an occasion wherein some judge will readjust the meaning of words as defined in the document, and declare those things unconstitutional, although few readers realize that when the U.S. Federal Court declares an Act of Congress null and void, it does NOT automatically set aside everything else contained therein: Acts passed after the date specified remain operative unless another subsequent amendment specifically repeals them. That's why Congressional statutes often contain language granting discretion to agencies, such as requiring approval from congress before approving certain projects. Yet once an agency has made that decision, they CANNOT change course without congressional permission. You see, if the executive branch makes decisions, even ones as trivial as deciding what color socks to wear, it generally MUST follow up by either implementing whatever programdecision it decided upon, or obtaining specific authorization from Congress. This allows both branches of government to operate independently, yet still maintain checks and balances between them, thereby preventing abuse. Thus, while much debate swirls around presidential assertions of power today, historically speaking the president isn't really supreme here, nor is the legislature: it's always been understood that Congress gets first dibs on matters of domestic concern, followed by the courts, and finally the presidency. So that's kind of my take on the subject of judicial review today, when compared to the past. But thanks for your comment, I find yours quite interesting. Wow, you guys sound like serious historians!! Maybe now you'll stop arguing with me...lol xD Not that I don't appreciate the insight, mind you. The above post proved useful in understanding some aspects of the law surrounding money bills. Now let's turn back to the topic at hand. Your last two posts are summed up perfectly in this quote from Adam Smith: Most politicians believe that you ought to have freedom of speech except for when it comes to criticizing somebody in office. Actually Mr. President, the Founding Fathers wanted to abolish slavery too, but unfortunately due to political infighting they gave way to Southern interests anyway. And yes, the Southern interest won out. Despite being somewhat cruel, labor intensive, low paid, dangerous work that basically involved working yourself into near death conditions until you broke down completely from exhaustion, and ultimately, produced far less product per worker than slave labor. Its sad, i know, but thats life...and sadly nobody seems overly concerned about the lost lives - including atypical former slaves, unemployed men, single mothers, old age pensioners, disabled veterans, children, or poor housewives.
