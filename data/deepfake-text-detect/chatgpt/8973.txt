I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with it, don't they ban you? Well that depends on your political views. Unless otherwise stated, any person who says something hateful or racist towards others will be banned by the police, as well as from government services.
