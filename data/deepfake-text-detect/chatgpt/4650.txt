Oat blenders. Mini spooners. Coco roos. Honey Scooters. You know them. You see them in the cereal section of any grocery store. They are in giant bags in a metal cabinet next to that little conveyor belt where they sell boxes of Frosted Flakes, Wheaties and Grape Nuts. The ones I'm talking about here aren't those. Those will be on top of my list, though you can never go wrong with either. These pictures below might make more sense after you read this: The Oatblender is an odd, clever bit of design from Erik Spiekermann which was recently featured at Lifehacker. It looks like it should fit right into someone's kitchen counter but instead it goes on top of said counter as shown above. When turned upside down (to create an oatmeal blender), a small bowl slides off its base until it rests flatly atop the surface. That makes for easy mixing, folding or stirring whatever your recipe calls for. This machine tends not to get incredibly hot since there's no motor inside, so don't worry if yours gets dirty quickly - clean up time won't take too long because of its compact size. There's also one built-in cup - nice touch! This handy gadget essentially turns your coffee maker into a makeshift French press. Set it up and fill it with fresh grounds when making espresso drinks, use your regular coffeemaker method when brewing tea, add baking soda to water for lemonade squeezing ... the possibilities are endless. Sure, the tiny plunger may look awkward sticking out of the side of your Keurig, but rest assured that it does what it says it does well enough. Plus, who doesn't love having extra room to hide around their home? If you have a favorite flavored K-Cup, you can even pop open some pods ahead of time and scoop all of your ingredients together before hitting brew. Still not sure how it works best for your needs?

While it doesn't do quite everything Copley does - the only thing it's really missing is preprogrammed schedules. And while I wouldn't say GoWise lacks functionality, Copley definitely provides better value. But GoWise has many features including a central monitor display that shows real-time temperature readings along with alerts and warnings. A similar screen displays other data such as humidity, light levels, and alarm status. GoWise also includes a high security lock box rated IP44 and superior tamper protection.

Just push yourself away from your computer every few hours, roll it over to an empty part of your desk, then pull the cord to raise the height back up.
