There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is that if you're willing to donate your vote against the establishment and trade, don't give it directly into the hands of the democratic party or the insiders," said Danielle Diaz, executive director of VotePAC. Diaz added: "Also, you can check out VotePAC online at www.votepacific PAC website." "We understand the issues people want to hear about on Election Day but we also need public awareness campaigns where voters feel like they've been overlooked in congress,' Diaz said. "People are concerned about whether Republicans will get what they deserve after 2016 because there was no campaign finance reform legislation before." Contact reporter Bernard McFarland at or .
