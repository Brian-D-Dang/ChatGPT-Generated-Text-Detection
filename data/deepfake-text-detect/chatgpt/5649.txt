I recently saw a video on why the Republicans [can't win] the 2016 election. If we go by raw numbers, Hillary will most likely win the next election. This got me thinking. Is this really the best way to pick a president? So I came up with this idea. Here is the concept. Today, we elect a president who will serve for four years. But what if we only get to vote for each president for 1.5 years. The first part of the term is the first half of the four years. The last part of the term is the last half of the four years. I call this the first and the second half of a four year term. Here is how it works. The candidates have to campaign for half of their first term. This means that the president has to campaign for the first half of his four year term. Once the candidates are chosen, the people vote. The second half of the term, the president will have to campaign to the people in a new way. The people will choose the president. This means that the president has to campaign to the people for the second half of his four year term. This way, we could have a president who really wants to serve the people. He will be campaigning to the people twice, and we will be able to see how he interacts with the people twice. In addition, there will be two campaigns for the people to see how the candidates interact with the people. In a way, this is like a reality show. If you watch a reality show, the participants will try to show their best side so that the audience will like them and vote for them. If you watch The Apprentice, you will see Trump giving the people advice to help them sell their products. In addition, we will see how the people interact with the candidate. I think that this would be a better way to select a president. The people get to see how the president interacts with the people. This will give the people a better idea of who they want to lead the country. I am not saying that we should not have debates. The candidates will still have to debate and answer questions from the audience. But they will only have to debate and answer questions for half of the term. This will give the candidates a chance to see how the people think. I am not saying that this is the best way to pick a president. But it is an interesting way to pick a president. It would be interesting to see how the people interact with the candidates. I am not saying that this is the best way to pick a president. But it is an interesting way to pick a president. It would be interesting to see how the people interact with the candidates. What do you think?
