We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been "thin shamed" or "skinny shamed" by another woman. I don't see how that is possible in American society, where the average weight of a person has increased since the 1970's. How can someone say you are too skinny but not fat? What about people who work out more than most and eat well with healthy portions yet still don't gain muchany muscle mass?
