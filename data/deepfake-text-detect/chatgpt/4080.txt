I been using Google Chrome as far as I remember (probably since 2010) and it's been my default browser on all the computerslaptops I've used. Chrome was fast, reliable and a joy to use when browsing the web. It is not perfect but it does everything most other browsers do better and faster than Firefox or Edge can ever hope to achieve. However over the last few months I have become increasingly irritated at how the latest version of Google Chrome works. In particular Google has introduced a patch that breaks some functionality in several ways making it less usable than before. There are other bugs too - so much so there must be hundreds of millions of people who find this annoying issue very frustrating. The first problem with the recent update is that it broke support for the unsupported extension API across multiple sites. Some sites will now stop providing extensions because they no longer accept them which means you will need to manually change your bookmark list instead of having it automatically updated by Google every time you leave a site. This is very inconvenient if you often visit different websites and want certain features pre-installed onto your bookmarks toolbar. Another bug affects users who have disabled the AdBlocker plugin. The AdBlocker plugin uses JavaScript code to prevent the display of advertisements from third party content providers while still allowing authors to earn money through ads displayed within their website. The new Chromium build on top of earlier versions of Chrome blocks any third party adverts except those running directly from the publisher. To understand why this feature is important consider the fact that many websites rely upon third parties to allow them display advertising for free. For example Amazon would only show you ads via links purchased directy from the retailers' own site whereas FacebookGoogle etc requires additional data like'shares' on social networks to process advertisements. So what happens if you disable Adblocker and the display of advertisement continues? What if you also remove the Adblocker plug-in completely and suddenly you can't watch videos on YouTube anymore without subscribing again to the site? So if these changes mean advertisers won't receive revenue then what is the point of advertising in the first place? Well, the answer is obvious actually, you get paid more money if you sell an ad through a publisher rather than an advertisment to the general public. If publishers don't agree to pay anyone for ad space on their sites then nobody will search for and buy ads. Without advertising income sites cannot function and many sites fail. Also note, Google does offer voluntary subscription services where you can keep receiving advertising, however nobody makes money out of these unless people sign up for another year! So why is advertising dead? Well, imagine going into a shop and seeing two coats available; one which costs 10 and the second costing just 1. Now let me tell you about something called price discrimination. When we see what items cost in shops the prices may seem odd compared to online stores due to online sellers taking advantage of the small differences between the products sold in shops vs the online ones. However, price discrimination doesn't work here either as buyers are paid based on how they compare the prices offered by different vendors. Price discrimination results in higher prices being charged to consumers by shops even though they are priced lower by online merchants. Brands therefore cease selling goods online and start focusing on subscriptions aimed primarily at the consumer market. As we have seen with Voxel, it isn't enough if you take in the right amount and deliver it quickly and cheaply to pay the same amount to traditional media or broadcasters. You'll need to make sure the people you're delivering the product to do in fact care about the quality of your service. Once you've got that sorted out, it's finally time to switch to digital advertising and take the lead yourself.
