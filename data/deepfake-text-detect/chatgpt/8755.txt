I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with that statement, you should not be allowed to speak your opinion on the matter. That said, even people who disagree with me wouldn't mind my saying that it was reprehensible. I admit that its bad because i saw many of them in person and was so enraged by their actions that i just stopped going looking for them. Like it or not, there were no signs of violence at all. If there were any evidence of violence, they would have left immediately. So what? The point is: the comment made by you isn't something you can change unless you're willing to face some kind of repercussions from anyone.
