Variable tax, or at least they way the US does it, is poorly done, inasmuch as it often discourages extra labour from people who may very well need the extra money. I'm not sure why you think this. Whether or not variable tax is good or bad, depends on whether or not the government can properly structure its taxes. I think you're overly sensitive to the idea of a progressive tax. It is part of the natural order of things. People who have more, should pay more. I'm not going to get into the details of how to best structure it, as that's a completely different discussion, but I will say that I think the way the US does it is poorly done, because it often discourages labour from people who need the money. I'm not saying people should be taxed less. I'm saying people should be taxed less when they have less, and more when they have more. By taxing them the same rate, you're punishing people for doing the right thing, which is, getting ahead. I'm not saying that's the way it should be done, but I am saying it's the way it is done, and I think it's badly done. It is part of the natural order of things. It's interesting how many supposedly left-wing people seem to think that the natural order of things is that you should pay more in taxes the more money you have. This just seems like an utterly wrong-headed and backwards way to look at it. It's like saying that the natural order of things is that the more you kill people, the more you should be paid. So you think it's ok to take money from people, whether they have more or less, and give it to people who have more than you? I'm not sure what you mean by "give it to people who have more than you," as it's a bit vague. The way I see it is that the government, in general, provides services to the people who live in that country. And if someone does more, then they should be paying more for it. Some people need the help of the government, more than others. And the ones who need it most, are the ones who need it the most. I agree that it is better to help people who need the most help. The problem is the government is very inefficient at helping people who need it the most. That's why the government doesn't have money to help people who need it most. I think it is a better idea to tax people more when they have more, and less when they have less. You're making a big assumption there. You're assuming that the government is efficient at identifying who is rich, and who is poor. You're assuming that the government is efficient at spending the money that it has. You're assuming that the government is efficient at helping people who need it the most. And you're assuming that the government is efficient at helping people who need it the most. You know what you're saying is wrong? You're saying that the government should be like a charity. The government shouldn't be a charity, it should be a government. And that's not what a government does. A government is responsible for making sure that the economy is stable and that everyone has their basic needs met. A government is responsible for making sure that there is no organized crime, and that everyone has the opportunity to succeed. A government is responsible for making sure that everyone has the opportunity to live a full, happy and productive life. A government is responsible for making sure that no one is abused or neglected. A government is responsible for making sure that no one is physically or mentally injured. A government is responsible for making sure that no one has their rights taken away. And if you think that the government is so inefficient that they can't even do that, then you should look for a better government. I'm not saying that we should have a new government that is better at helping people. I'm saying we should have a better government. A government that is actually effective at doing what it is supposed to be doing. But the government we have now, isn't. The government we have now is corrupt, it's incompetent, and it is not doing what it is supposed to be doing. If the government we have now was competent, it wouldn't be incompetent. It wouldn't be corrupt. It wouldn't be abusing it's power. It
