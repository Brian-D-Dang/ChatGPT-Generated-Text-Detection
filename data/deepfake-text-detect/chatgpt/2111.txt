I know this is a very controversial subject, and many people disagree with me, and I have to admit, I am not the perfect judge for this. A little background: Today my daughter's class was discussing bullying in school (the topic of another blog entry), when her teacher announced that they were going to do some writing on what she would like them all to do if someone started saying mean things about their weight or how fastslow they walked. She asked each child individually where they'd go. My daughter thought it over carefully before raising her hand. "Well," said Katie solemnly after thinking deeply about this question, "if anyone ever says anything bad about your looks, you should punch him right there." We had quite an interesting discussion today at our house! She did get one thing correct no matter who it happens too, we can't let these comments affect us so much that we develop low self - esteem. It just makes sense to be tough sometimes; don't take crap off other kids. Some days are harder than others... As most parents probably realize by now, homework has been getting steadily more difficult as the years progress. Our six year old doesn't really even need help doing math anymore because he understands concepts better than his teachers give credit for. However, spelling tests? Those are still impossible. And, unfortunately, English composition assignments, which used to come naturally to both children, have become increasingly challenging. Last night Josh gave up first place in the family spelling bee when Ben spelled "murder" correctly. Although Edna didn't make any high level errors yesterday afternoon while giving Miss Mowat her written assignment (she wrote three sentences describing her weekend) last week Ms. Sleet made several mistakes during reading practice and then couldn't answer simple questions such as What color shirt does Kat wear in chapter 1? Yes, it seems clear from those examples that every day brings new challenges in learning to spell and write properly. By far though the greatest challenge lies ahead: college admissions testing!!! The SATs aren't until next spring but the ACT includes two sections taken together: Analytical Writing and Critical Reading. Both involve detailed questioning regarding grammar usage relating specifically to whatever text selections were provided along with multiple choice answers to test comprehension skills. Based upon past exams given in preperation for national competitions students will tell themselves that since they've seen similar material previously that they'll ace tomorrow's exam. Wrong!! Just ask Mr. Bill Wilson, Camille Coxe or Donnie Barnes none of whom saw their scores improve significantly once they reached junior highs without extensive summer study. There must be something else.... hmmm.. perhaps mom could buy marked up practice versions of the actual texts??? Time will soon reveal whether my suspicions prove accurate.....
