The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. I think the post you're talking about is like 2 years old. Since then I've started to work on self acceptance and love and have come to realize that my issues are not so much the shape of my face, as much as it is the depression and anxiety I've been dealing with. It's not so much my face that needs fixing, as it is me. But yes, I think if you're born with extreme asymmetry, you're not to blame. But for everyone else, it's about acceptance.

I think I just want to point out that having those feelings is normal and that you are not the only one. I think that it's easy to believe that other people do not feel the same, but the truth is that everyone feels a certain amount of insecurity in one way or another. The trick is to find ways to deal with it and to not let it hold you back. My partner and I have a similar problem (me with a large forehead and her with a prominent chin). For me, I'm getting used to it and learning to love it. For her, she has a strong hatred for her chin. She doesn't want to accept it as her own, and she has been working hard to change it by buying and using different chin makeup and products. Recently, we have had a falling out and it all stemmed from her believing that I was being unfair to her and not seeing her side of the argument, because I had mentioned that she should accept her chin. I have since apologized for being insensitive, but I honestly felt like I was right and that she was being overly sensitive. I realized after the fact that she has a low self esteem and a very strong body dysmorphia, which is a combination that is toxic. I have had a lot of time to think about this and about how I can help her with her issues. I have been working on ways to help her work through her feelings of insecurity. I think that she really needs to be able to accept herself and her body, and the first step to doing that is by not blaming her self esteem on other people, and that includes me. I have been thinking of ways to help her and to tell her that she needs to learn to accept her chin and herself. I have been thinking of ways to talk to her about this without hurting her. I have also been thinking of how to deal with her negative feelings. I think that the key is to make her realize that she has control over her thoughts and feelings, and that she can choose to change the way she feels by changing her perspective. It is important to me that she knows that I am on her side and that I do not mean to hurt her. I want to help her, but I also want to make sure that I am not contributing to her negative feelings in any way. I am hoping that this can be an opportunity for us to grow closer, but I am also worried that I will fail and that it will only cause more pain.

The truth is that we don't have any choice in the matter, we have been born with the face that we have, and the fact that I do not like it is more my own fault than anyone else's. The following users thanked this post: Unique, L17, BFG, kaos That's an interesting question and it's definitely something that a lot of people struggle with. I think that we can make a choice about whether we are going to let our insecurities control our lives or whether we are going to work towards improving our lives in spite of our insecurities. We need to learn to choose the path that is going to lead us towards happiness and that is going to lead us towards growth rather than focusing on the things that we can't change. I think that we need to do what we can to improve our lives, and that we need to realize that it is not our fault
