Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my friends have told me that I don't know how to cook enough to keep up with animal choice and nutrition requirements so I am very interested in learning more vegetables as a lot of people say I need to eat more than vegetables (I'm not sure if it will be possible). I plan on going vegan for quite some time ahead of time though! A few months back, my husband got sick, and went through the transition from not being able to see his family regularly due to illness which just made him feel inadequate again when he was out partying all day long lol. A friend said Tyson Foods' vegan menus aren't even complete without meat foods because they only serve meat foods including chicken or fish meals: (It's been tough watching myself try everything. Thank you for your congratulations!
