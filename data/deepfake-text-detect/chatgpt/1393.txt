I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a cheap used car seems both insane and stupid. Yes you can resell them for more, if the car is less than 2 years old at least...can't say that about most new cars? Maybe they want the car above all else or their budget allows it, which makes sense since its probably under 10k right now
