Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I am not transphobic in any way; however, the term genderqueer is a very specific thing that has been used by people who identify with nonbinary identities for quite some time now, so those gendered terms should have had more consideration before being deemed "new" or "creative." But we're going far beyond just gendered language here: there's also an issue within the culture itself when it comes to nonbinary identity, which is something my friend Mikey posted about recently on his blog. The problem with what he talks about (and others) is the idea that nonbinary people don't exist because they can be "cured" - but also the fact that other trans individuals who do experience dysphoria will often try to invalidate our experiences based off their own. This isn't only exclusive to members of the lgbtq community either - it happens pretty much everywhere else as well right along side cisgender privilege (which I've discussed here). It seems like if you want to end up somewhere between femalemale, you just HAVE TO BE one or the other, even though most of us know full well that isn't true at all... As someone who identifies outside of these binaries myself, I'm starting to get really tired of seeing how everything I feel doesn't fit into these boxes gets dismissed. And yes, sometimes it feels good to validate yourself without anyone questioning your validity, but deep down, everyone wants to belong somewhere - whether it's through family bonds, friendships, work relationships, etc., and people with genderqueer or nonconforming identities simply deserve to be able to find where they can truly call home, too.
