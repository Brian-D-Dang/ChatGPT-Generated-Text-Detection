First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. Of course, I understand. In that case, it is always a good idea to show kindness and respect towards others, especially those who may be more vulnerable, such as the elderly or disabled. If you are physically capable, it would be courteous to offer your seat to the elderly woman so that she can sit comfortably. It's a small act of kindness that can make a big difference in someone's day.
