I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other artwork, find something that looks good to them - then go get an amateur artist to stick whatever pictureidea onto their skin forever without any thought into what is going on in there." It's not just about finding someone who does quality work for less money either. It also requires doing your research before hand too...
