This CMV was sparked by the reaction to Donald Trump from the right in the recent GOP Candidate Debate but extends to everyone who intentionally used political incorrectness for personal gain. When I interviewed a friend of mine during her senior year of college, she said that people like these would be free to create their own theories without fear or favor of political correctness. It is important to note that this kind of rhetoric does not necessarily equate with true "political correctness." It means that true political correctness consists in identifying what constitutes as "fake news" and then treating it as such, even if it does happen. The original idea about "fake news" came only after the media began to label news that contained information that had caught them on purpose. Some things are fake: they could be informative, interesting, humorous or even harmful; some items may actually be amusing to others. Those stories do have some truth behind them. But all of those very moments were faked. It is possible to find ways around that sort of bias in politics, especially in a subject which has rules against censorship. The goal of 'censorship' is to keep us away from attacking each other and our perceptions of reality. That includes suppressing critical thinking. If we disagree with something, we can rightly look to "the guidelines of science," which prescribe the standards of scientific independence we need to live in order to protect ourselves and our worldview, and treat everything else as objective. We should also reject the seemingly basic principle of equal rights for every race, religion, ethnic group, gender, sexual orientation, caste or creed. In fact, private property rights in America should have been the basis of any civil liberties. All life should be protected equally, regardless of whether one's sexuality or gender identity is open to interpretation. This is why the concept of "equality," like social equality, is so dangerous because it is fundamentally illusory. Republicans must understand the problem when they steal money from business leaders, politicians, judges and journalists. They need to challenge the theory that corporations are good at stealing money from people from whom they can make a profit. Whether the Republicans will actually provide an actual solution lies entirely with liberals who believe they cannot attack anyone on a moral level without giving them deeper scrutiny.
