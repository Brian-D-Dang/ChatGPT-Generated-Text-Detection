To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to go to those who identify as LGBT people. I do not believe that gay marriage should only allow same sex unions or relationships; it must also include opposite sex couples to ensure equality between them too. However, I would like to point out some of my reservations with this ruling: It doesn't take into consideration how important religious freedoms and the family unit will still remain for many families - these kinds of rulings will clash with the lessons we learned about religious freedom at various stages throughout history. The ruling does nothing for women's reproductive rights (especially since it doesn't address them), nor does it address race discrimination against gay people which is very real. It involves redefining "marriage" from a legal document with specific responsibilities and exclusions into an institution where you don't even need to sign anything to declare your commitment! This can significantly increase costs without improving outcomes, help perpetuate racist stereotypes about homosexuality by simply granting legal recognition to married homosexual relationships, and deny some of our most vulnerable members of society the right to marry. There was never any intention of legalizing same-sex marriage so long ago when gay rights were introduced. In fact, there were attempts to ban all forms of sexuality or gender expression entirely; they weren't accepted but were completely ignored in favour of marriage being seen as a private matter rather than something that affects public policy.
