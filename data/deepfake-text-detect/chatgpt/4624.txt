Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in academic achievement compared with its peer countries. I've read through some of these recently, including this study by David Coleman: In summary, he asserts that U.S students are not taught well enough for them to learn new information; grading is overly harsh on poor performance (thus discouraging good work), and our curriculum lacks sufficient breadth or depth in certain areas. He goes so far as saying, "The idea that we need more 'rigor' may be true - but it's wrong." First, let me say I completely agree with him about school quality in general. It is shocking how poorly our public schools perform - especially when one considers their funding levels. Many years ago, my wife worked at an elementary school, and was shocked at what she saw daily in terms of learning skills vs. student behavior problems discipline issues. She said things were really out of control, which led us into another discussion about education reform - something that has captured the minds of people like Bill Gates and others who want change but don't see any easy solutions. But, if we're going to spend money improving educational outcomes here in America, we can do no worse than use David Coleman's framework from his book called "Teaching Matters" and apply it within existing systems! My question then becomes: What data supports his assertions from this research report? Is there anything concrete regarding this issue? Some of the core ideas he discusses seem pretty obvious, such as using rigorous standards instead of arbitrary grade cutoffs, reducing time spent on teaching young children grades 5th-8th, etc. The rest seems much less clear IMO, particularly since most of the American population still lives outside big cities or doesn't even get basic primary schooling due to living right next door to rural poverty (examples include some Native Americans). So, where does the evidence lie behind his assertion that standardized testing is a huge problem and that teachers should focus on helping develop critical thinking skills rather than memorizing facts? Does anyone have insight into this? [UPDATE: Thanks for the Blog readership, folks. There is now a link added below.] How sad, because although he makes valid points, I think he also misses important issues related to cultural models and values. One example would be that perhaps too few parents understand or support high quality science instruction, leading to too many kids taking AP exams while failing to grasp concepts once they leave home. Another might be that college prep courses are often seen as just "more homework," resulting in fewer latter day geniuses choosing this route! Then again, maybe we could look closer at why the desire to "prepare" students for later life decisions isn't necessarily ideal, given America's historical views of immigrants coming over here seeking greener pastures (which certainly didn't turn out too great for those early arrivals!). But yes, there IS cause for concern with respect to K-12 education system overall in the US. Thank goodness someone brought up the topic though, otherwise I'd never get around to doing so myself!! ) Posted By mike Sep 9, 2008 at 10:29 PM PT Wasn't Coleman interviewed last year by Steve Jobs in Education Nation, talking about all the same stuff? And wasn't Jobs quoted several times in that piece? Oh wait.... I remember.... Jobs told everyone to shut up about edu crap.. I guess that article hit close to home considering Jobs had a father who left the classroom after 6 months without having learned shit (he got fired). everybody knows that apple products suck.. Posted By autobotvirginia Oct 3, 2008 at 4:15 AM PST Although I totally disagree with Mr Coleman. I feel very strongly about this subject and actually came across some articles and books that challenged just about everything that he says. For instance raising test scores will only take a small percentage of the kiddos off of remedial help. And part of the reason for the increase in remediation is that lower income families cannot afford nanny costs during summer break. They don't live near the city,they don't go to fancy private schools,and sadly most come back broke. On top of that, the rich simply won't send their childs away to expensive boarding schools. If youre lucky your kid gets into the parochial school down the street but thats rare. That doesnt mean every parent cant educate themselves and teach their own kids at home. Or consider this fact that only 1 out of 2 middle class homes has cable tv, yet almost everybody uses computers nowadays. Yet 80 percent of lowincome households dont even have internet access! How isnt that astounding?? Clearly an argument against standardization tests have absolutely hypothetical 10 exam pattern tests sucks, give it gives birth to hold George set has second chances takes ickis false success rate tests: posts
