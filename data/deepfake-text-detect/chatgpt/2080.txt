Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking that he is dead (he's not). If you don't know anything about this story or have seen any previews for the movie, stop reading now and go watch it before they take down YouTube! Or read some other review if my spoiler-filled one doesn't appeal to your geeky heart's content. It was an interesting but epic novel written by Andy Weir with great humor mixed in as well as zero science fiction jargon. So what could possibly make it into Hollywood? Well...a lot actually. But even more so than most big budget sci fi movies are these days: Romance, Drama, Comedy, Action, Adventure - the only thing missing from the film adaptation we were given last weekend at Regal Cinemas Champaign Stadium 10Xanadu 8 was 3D glasses and tons of explosions. And yet all those things made sense because the storyline wasn't necessarily trying hard to be realistic anyway. In fact, there plenty of ridiculous moments where characters did something outlandishly stupid like throwing away their food rations after three years without eating them all so as to save weight; making robots using potato chips instead of circuit boards; and having Matt Damon use MacGyverish skills to improvise everything else including growing potatoes inside himself. A few people may think that moviemaker Ridley Scott seemed lost while directing this picture (and perhaps rewriting large chunks), especially since many key plot points differ greatly between both versions of the screenplay, such as how long did it really take the astronauts aboard the Hermes ship traveling back home to Earth get here? Which begs another question: Did Scott ever see 2001: Space Odyssey before shooting Prometheus? Apparently not enough to realize its importance within the exposition of The Martian either. Well hey, who am I kidding? This isn't 2001 anyways right!?;) On the plus side though, cinematographer Dariusz Wolski does create gorgeous visuals whether depicting vast landscapes covered in dust storms or stunning vistas showcasing various flora blooming throughout the planet's surface. He also got a chance to showcase his talents through the lens during the final battle waged against the Martians forcefully attempting to invade our world. But somehow I can still remember Apes beating up humans way better despite taking place decades ago versus watching someone fire water rockets aimed towards Red Planet's core hoping to blow off escape pods being shot overhead. Oh wait - I'm talking about Gravity again aren't I?! Deciding whose fault it truly was would probably require me doing research first then writing a dissertation afterwards. Either way, let us focus less on why certain parts didn't completely work and try focusing more on enjoying the good times we had seeing the movie itself. And yes, enjoyable portions indeed do exist despite the obvious flaws littered throughout. At least the cast certainly worked together pretty smoothly considering each actor faces playing drastically different roles compared to others' past works. Of course everyone knows Matt Damon best from Bourne Supremacy Trilogy along with Mystic River Alexander Payne's Election among numerous films. However, the real standout performance came courtesy of Melissa McCarthy who plays former botany professor turned engineer Abby Hendrickson overseeing the efforts to keep her charge alive. Her character grew tremendously over time starting out as somewhat reserved, prickly and stubborn whilst realizing the gravity of keeping Watney safe and sane. There seems to always been controversy surrounding casting decisions regarding female actors although in hindsight perhaps we should've known earlier due to the story telling perspective used for this project. Yet unlike male characters whom readers typically root for regardless of gender, audiences seem much harsher toward females portrayed poorly no matter what kind of backstory producers concocted prior to release date. Despite lacking actual plant biology knowledge whatsoever, director Scott allows for viewers to form opinions based solely upon "gut instinct" rather than scientific facts - which sometimes gets annoying when dealing with fictional stories. To sum up nicely overall: If you're looking forward to The Martian primarily for space exploration and action sequences filled with lots 'o bad guys blasting around everywhere gunning stuff down left n' right, look elsewhere cause you won't find very much of that. Instead you'll witness human beings learning profound life lessons amidst dangerous situations involving limited resources hurtling through outer space far above ground level under constant threat simply surviving day to day mostly relying on themselves - usually resulting in several face plants occurring every single week. That said however, if audience members want an enjoyable drama full of beautiful locations set in deep space showing two unlikely heroes joining forces for survival across hundreds of pages worth of words, then come on board already!! You're going to love every second spent exploring new worlds alongside Mark Watney played brilliantly by Matt Damon surrounded by equally brilliant characters sharing witty banter amongst endless obstacles on whatever journey awaits them next...
