While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established professionals to be a bit offensive and even patronizing. I appreciate the sentiment of "let us know when you're ready," but what does that mean? When you've had your 200th real world job? When you've reached the first-year anniversary of your first real job? When you've had your first two years in the profession? I'd like to think that my freshness and naivete has helped me, rather than hindered me. Being young and untarnished has given me the chance to question everything and open up to new ideas that I might have overlooked if I were older and more set in my ways. A lot of the time, I find that, when working with someone who has more experience than I do, I learn from them. I learn not only the basics of how to do my job but the ins and outs of how to approach my position and how to live and work in the city that I'm in. I learn a lot about how to live life and how to be an adult (which I've definitely struggled with in the past). I think, as long as you're taking advantage of your experience and learning as much as possible, you're doing fine. You have no reason to "earn" respect. If you are, in fact, going to the job for the money, and not the experience, then I don't know what else to tell you. As I have gotten older, I've found that I appreciate the freedom and the opportunity to learn that young people have. I hope that people are able to respect my position and give me the opportunity to share my knowledge with them. Maybe I'm not as pissed as I thought I was. This is something I've been thinking about a lot lately. I've been in the workforce for almost four years and I've been working my tail off to keep up with the fast pace of my job and the company I work for. It's rewarding and challenging and it's been great, but it's also taken a toll on my personal life and I'm exhausted. I've been thinking about this a lot lately because, while I am proud of the work I've done, I want to be able to take a step back and breathe for a minute. I want to be able to work on my projects and put my heart and soul into them without feeling like I have to be on call 247. I've found that I'm tired of being yelled at and having to work weekends. I'm tired of having to make myself available to help out at the last minute. I'm tired of having to tell people I'm busy because I can't just go out to lunch whenever I want. I'm tired of feeling like I have to be the first to step in when something goes wrong, and tired of being the first to hear about new projects and ideas. I'm tired of feeling like everyone else's workload is lighter than mine. I want to take a step back and take a deep breath. I want to slow down and focus more on my personal life. I want to work for a company that respects my time and understands that I don't want to work 247, 365 days a year. I want to work for a company that allows me to take the time I need to do the work and not just pile more and more on me and then ask me to work weekends because I can't handle it. I want to work for a company that allows me to be me and not expect me to change who I am to make them happy. I want to work for a company that will be supportive if I want to go to grad school or take a short break to travel. I want to work for a company that understands that I don't have to be at my desk all day to get work done. I want to work for a company that understands that working 12-hour days, 6 days a week for 2 years straight is not sustainable, that it's not healthy, and that it's not good for anyone. I want to work for a company that understands that if I don't take care of myself, I can't take care of my clients, my co-workers, or my work. I want to work for a company that doesn't think I'm a burden because I want to leave for
