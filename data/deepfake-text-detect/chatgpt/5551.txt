I don't personally feel that the arguments against meat eating (morality, sustainability) have enough depth andor meaning that directly affects me or others around me to make me feel as though I should quit eating it. Though, I have a cousin who is a vegetarian (he eats dairy products, but not meat) and he's a personal trainer and body builder and has always been extremely healthy, so there's that. That's a very good point. I don't feel that the argument is as strong when you're just a bystander. For instance, I personally do not believe that it's wrong to eat meat, but that doesn't mean I want to eat it. There are plenty of people who simply do not care whether or not what they are eating is ethical or not. The012thMan But is it right to eat meat? I'm not trying to be argumentative or anything, I'm just wondering if you think that it's right or wrong. It's a really difficult subject. I think it's wrong to eat meat, but I don't feel strongly enough about it to become a vegetarian, or even to try to convince people to become vegetarians. I think it's a valid point though that it's a bit hypocritical of me to say that it's wrong to eat meat, and then to eat meat. I've been thinking about it, and I've come to the conclusion that I'm not a vegetarian, because it's not as if we're killing the animal in vain. If we killed the animal for no reason at all, then I might be a vegetarian. But we do need to eat to survive, and I don't think we should starve ourselves. So in conclusion, I'm not a vegetarian. You are still better off than you were before, assuming you're vegetarian. Ok, but would you say that a vegetarian diet is healthier than a meat-eater's diet? You have to be careful with meat. I was a meat-eater until about four or five years ago. I ate meat, vegetables, fruits, dairy, etc. I ate all of these things. I did my research on eating habits before I decided to become vegetarian and it seemed like the healthiest option. It's not really a "lifestyle choice" that is healthier for the environment, it's just that you're not taking an animal's life. It's a life style choice, because it is made as a conscious decision. What about if you don't make that decision? The012thMan Okay, I understand that you are not a vegetarian, but you are still a bystander. Me personally, I do not eat meat because it is not a necessity for my survival, and I do not want to kill animals. I'm not going to get into a philosophical debate, but I feel that if people can live a good life without meat, then they should. This is a very basic and simple rule that we should follow. Reeseh Where do you get your protein from? I know that my vegetarian diet doesn't consist of a lot of animal products, but I also know that I'm still not getting enough protein. The012thMan Did you know that the reason why we eat meat is because it's the most readily available source of protein. If you eat enough vegetables, you can get all the protein you need. Protein deficiency is a huge problem in many countries, as far as I know. Reeseh I was a vegetarian for 6 years, I only started eating meat when I decided that I needed more protein, I was getting protein from other sources, but they weren't enough. I do think that the world would be a lot better off if everyone stopped eating meat. But we have to remember, that the consumption of meat wasn't always this high. When I first started researching vegetarianism, I read something that really stuck with me. It said that the average amount of meat eaten in 1900 was 100 pounds a year. In 2011, the average was 226 pounds a year. Reeseh I have been vegetarian for about 13 years and I feel no better than a meat-eater. I get enough protein, and eat more than most meat eaters. I'm not saying that it's bad to eat meat, but I do think it's a bit hypoc
