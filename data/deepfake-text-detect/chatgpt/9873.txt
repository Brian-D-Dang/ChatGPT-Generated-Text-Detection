In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn't work that way. In the real world, puzzles come with pictures of the final result so that you have some idea of what you're building. The downside is that it can be hard to figure out where to begin, and it often makes the puzzle easier.
