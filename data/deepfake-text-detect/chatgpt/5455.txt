When I see debate about'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about'evidence'. If they shift on these topics then we hear a lot more discussion of the political views held by groups that are not as well known. The problem with this is that no matter how much we disagree with each other there's always going to be some overlap between us - and everyone wants to talk about themselves anyway so why not discuss what makes them different? And if we get together we can agree without necessarily having all those differences Why do you think they're divided up into divisions over guns?? They'll probably discuss it but not gun control at least for now.
