It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet. I've always found it annoying to be around someone who has a noisy vehicle, but at least one of the vehicles is not mine, so I just keep away from them. For me, if you have enough money for car payments on two or three nice cars then why do you needwant another? You either have disposable income where buying a new car every year makes sense (rich) or your finances aren't in check enough to buy multiple cars without severe financial issues (poor).
