My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother spanked him with a broom handle (very hard too) for not finishing his lunch. It was about 8:30am and they had been eating since 7:15 or so, and he just wasn't done by then. So she said that? Is there any way to contact school officials regarding this? I mean it's pretty asinine if you ask me
