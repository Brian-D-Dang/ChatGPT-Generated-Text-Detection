Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of being raised to believe in vaccines and go to school every day with them it's hard for me not to be confused about some things I knew a kid who worked at walmart who went home to his mom regularly because she wouldn't let him get autism vaccine shots on his own so he could work there. It took over 2 months before he finally had enough (like, physically he couldn't keep up) and left.
