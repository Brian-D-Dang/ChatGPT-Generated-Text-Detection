In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they do not want to is called rape. Now, I would argue that forcing another to do something with their bodies is wrong, even if it's something the other person wants to do. Forcing someone to do something is always a violation of their autonomy, because it means they are not the one in control of their own actions. Now, in this case, I am arguing that it is a violation of the autonomy of the fetus to force it to gestate inside of the woman. As a fetus, a person has no control over their own actions, and it is inevitable that they will die if they remain inside of the woman. It is entirely possible that a woman could be pregnant with a child who she does not want, a child she wants to abort, but the fetus, like any other human being, has no choice in the matter. It is a violation of their autonomy. So, if we can agree that it is a violation of a fetus' autonomy to force it to gestate, then it is a violation of the mother's autonomy to force her to gestate. By RebekahS (not verified) on 02 Feb 2015 permalink I've had several conversations with people I've known my entire life and they still can't seem to grasp that women can be pro-choice and not feminist, anti-abortion and not anti-women, etc. They seem to think that their world view is so superior to all others that they don't realize that they can change their minds on something and still respect those who disagree with them. I would just like to say that I am NOT a pro-choice person, nor a feminist. My stance on abortion is that it is not moral, but that I would never take it away from a woman. I am a Christian, I believe that God created human beings, and that includes the unborn child. I am also a woman, who has gone through many health issues which have made me question if I would have been born. It is hard to say whether I would have wanted to be born. What I am not is an idiot who cannot see the contradiction in the claim that I am a woman, and that I support women's rights, but that I believe that abortion is wrong. As for the pro-life people, I would just like to say that while I understand that your intentions are good, and I am glad that you are out there trying to save lives, you are going about it in the wrong way. Just because you believe that life begins at conception does not mean that you should force your beliefs on others. While I respect your right to your own beliefs, I do not have to agree with them, nor do I have to respect them.

I think I'll use this analogy in the future. Thanks! By Stephanie Zvan (not verified) on 02 Feb 2015 permalink So, if we can agree that it is a violation of a fetus' autonomy to force it to gestate, then it is a violation of the mother's autonomy to force her to gestate. Just to be clear, what is the violation of the mother's autonomy? The forced gestation? The forced pregnancy? The forced pregnancy, which she would not have had if she did not force the forced gestation? I am not trying to be difficult, and I do see your point, but I am not entirely sure what you are saying here. By Jason Thibeault (not verified) on 02 Feb 2015 permalink I think you just answered your own question.:) I don't have a problem with Lia's view of abortion. I don't think it's morally wrong, but I don't think it's acceptable. By Giliell (not verified) on 02 Feb 2015 permalink I am anti-abortion. I am anti-murder. The fetus is a living human being. It is the choice of the mother to decide to take it's life
