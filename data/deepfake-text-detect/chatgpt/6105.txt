While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established professionals around you to be very stifling. I'm a senior at a university in the US, and there are definitely plenty of students and recent grads in my area who are older than me. I've met a few people in my program that are in their mid-20s and have been working for three years. The other day, we had a meeting with some faculty members, and one of them said "I'm sorry to hear that you're not getting jobs right out of school." I'm 24. My first full-time job (in the same field as my program) was at 21. I've been working for three years, I'm about to finish my master's degree, and I was a senior at my university (30 credits, and a 3.9 GPA). While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established professionals around you to be very stifling. And I can see how this attitude could make it difficult to advance in a career or form lasting professional relationships. Is there a way to handle this situation without offending the professor? I would say this: "Well, I did get a job that was related to my field of study and I'm getting ready to start a new job, so I don't think my career is necessarily derailed. I understand that I'm not getting a job in my field immediately out of college, but I'm still quite young." A short and sweet "I don't feel I have to earn your respect. I don't feel that I have to prove anything to you. I know that I'm capable and am continuing to grow professionally, and that's all that matters." You will have to understand that people who are older than you are going to look at the world through the lens of their experience. They are going to come from a very different place than you, and that's okay. You're going to get a little bit of pushback, but it will be helpful for you to develop your ability to deal with it. So, when you say something, you have to understand that you're in the minority. Most people will not appreciate it when you say that you're "not getting jobs" or that you "didn't get a job" in your field. People look at things through the lens of their experience. If I'm in my mid-20s, I might have a different perspective than you on what it's like to find your first job. I'm a little older than you, and I have a job. So, I'm going to have a different perspective. I'm going to say "Well, I did get a job that was related to my field of study and I'm getting ready to start a new job, so I don't think my career is necessarily derailed. I understand that I'm not getting a job in my field immediately out of college, but I'm still quite young." I'd say that to the professor. So, the way that you deal with this is, when you're in a situation where you have a less experienced person than you, you can say something like this: "Well, I did get a job that was related to my field of study and I'm getting ready to start a new job, so I don't think my career is necessarily derailed. I understand that I'm not getting a job in my field immediately out of college, but I'm still quite young." You have to understand that people who are older than you are going to look at the world through the lens of their experience. They are going to come from a very different place than you, and that's okay. You're going to get a little bit of pushback, but it will be helpful for you to develop your ability to deal with it. When you're working on a team, you're going to get pushback from other people on your team, and if you can deal with it appropriately, you'll be able to grow and thrive in your career. There are a few different things you could do. You could say something like, "I get that you're a little bit older than me, so I understand that you're going to have a different perspective on these things. That's fine." Or you could say something like, "I'
