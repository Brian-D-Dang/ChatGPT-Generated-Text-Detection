Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself more money if it was so important to me, but clearly not as much as the people who actually write laws and enforce those laws are getting paid! sarcasm I'm sure they will be able to deduct their "business expenses" on itemized deductions so they won't have any tax liability.
