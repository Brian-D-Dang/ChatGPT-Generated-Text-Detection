I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with the basics. 1. In a large skillet over medium heat. Add milk if you have one. Add onions and garlic and cook for another minute then add in all of the beans and mushrooms or whatever to make a paste that is much thicker than your regular milk. I usually use about 14 cup of brown sugar or so. You can also give some more liquid into it just to help keep the mixture moister. (Don't put any other ingredients in the pan). If you're using same recipe you will need to put something else around maybe to soften up the mushiness. 2. Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until the green pepper is translucent. Add in good food coloring and stir well. Let cool down and bring to boil. Add in a little bit more water until you get decent consistency. Make sure you don't leave out too much water. Set aside to cool completely. 3. While still cooking, remove any remaining prawns or crabmeat from the pan and sprinkle them onto the outside cover. Place them inside a container in a dark place. Cover and let stand at least three hours before serving.
