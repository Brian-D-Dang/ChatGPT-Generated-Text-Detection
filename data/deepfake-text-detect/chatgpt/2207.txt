I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for selling weed, I think they deserve that opportunity... You can't just throw people away and say we don't care about them anymore when all these other countries are saying 'we want you.' We need to start talking more openly as Americans - not only celebrities but regular citizens - about what it means to be an American citizen because there isn't automatic citizenship with us. There needs to be some real discussion among our communities so everyone understands.
