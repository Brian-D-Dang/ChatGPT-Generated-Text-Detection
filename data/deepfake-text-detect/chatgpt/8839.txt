Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for "sleeping around," and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of attention she deserves. But what about women who don't sleep around? If we are talking about girls sleeping around at times, then I believe that men need to accept this as well, especially if they have physical characteristics like being close to girls or having sex with them. It's difficult to accept women having sexual interests that are incompatible - rather than just physically attractive (which isn't always possible) - but the way their bodies work makes it necessary. If you think about it, any girl whose only interest was her own sexuality and who doesn't want to be alone might be better off bedding down or helping out. I'm not saying that all women should be comfortable with this, but this article seems like something someone who has been living most of their life would do. Sure there can be some exceptions; maybe not everyone likes sleeping around too much, but it certainly shouldn't be a requirement.
