Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make that number go up a little bit more than it currently is. However, when you get down to who exactly would be able to afford college in 18 years? Also, what percentage of people born today will actually not have an opportunity for higher education (not just income)? Currently we are at about 50. Is that going to change or stay steady? If so, then why? Also again, let's say it goes up by 5, which seems like quite a lot considering how current issues occur with such major changes in costs for everything else. A simple increase from 10 current to 15 doesn't seem too extreme given the other factors involved. I'm sure there are many questions that could come out of all these discussions, but here they are. Any thoughts on any one question?:) A: This response assumes that increased economic activity will cause your average person's standard of living to rise over time. That assumption may sometimes hold true historically (for example during periods of rapid economic growth), but has been challenged recently because of the recent slowdown in U.S. GDP growth; see my answer here. If increased investment causes unemployment rates to decline faster than job creation can keep pace, labor force participation gets squeezed, and working-age adults generally face lower incomes potentially making college unaffordable even if their wages were unaffected. This 1976 academic paper shows contrasting outcomes based upon different assumptions regarding future employment trends. The authors infer a "sizable" effect of wage increases on household income.
