I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our government has a credit card limit of 300 billion dollars). However I am afraid we are past this point. It now appears as though all discussion will be about how much tax money can go into wasteful programs without causing substantial harm - it seems like none want any cuts at first but then they do not mind them if there's no other alternative - so why bother? We have become dependent on social security benefits for retirees living off their savings or pension plans from years working in some field when interest rates were high enough many decades ago [eg: you could invest 30kyear growing 7 over 65yrs would give 290K]. Is anyone else horrified with these numbers?? The shortfall between what workers pay today vs prior generations should scare everyone awake! And yet people talk out loud saying "CUT MONEY"!!!!! When did America turn socialist?! Let alone an entitlement-state??? Who authorized such tyranny???? Nevermind... That ship sailed long time back..
