Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from recreational leagues) and it was a big part of my childhood. While I loved it and made some great friends, I also witnessed parents who were overly invested and sometimes even aggressive towards their children and coaches during games. This made me wonder if parents who push their children towards competitive sports are doing more harm than good. On one hand, sports can be a great way for children to develop discipline, teamwork, and a host of other valuable life skills. On the other hand, when parents place too much emphasis on winning and competition, it can lead to burnout, injury, performance anxiety, and harm to the child's mental and emotional well-being. What are your thoughts on this? Do you think parents should encourage their children to play competitive sports, or is it better to let them make their own choices? And if parents do encourage their children to play sports, how can they do so without becoming too overbearing?
