I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites, do some linear algebra, and then create a report. I've done some Googling around the internet, but am having a difficult time finding the right resources, which I suspect may be because I'm not sure exactly what the right resources would be. Anyways, I'm pretty interested in what a career in data science would look like. I don't know if I'd want to do a PhD or anything, but it's an option I'd like to have. Would it be feasible to do a PhD in data science, or is that even a thing? Or, would it be better to do a PhD in computer science, and then work in data science? (The latter seems to be more common, but I'm not sure why.) I'm also open to moving to a new city. Thank you for your time, and any advice is much appreciated! There is no such thing as a PhD in Data Science. Data Science is a subject that you would go to grad school for, and then use the knowledge gained for a Data Science job. You would be doing research, and then applying what you learned to a job. Depending on the program, you may need to take classes in Machine Learning, Linear Algebra, and Statistics. You will also need to know R and Python, along with SQL, and the ability to use the UNIX shell. I'm not sure what you mean by "data science." Is that machine learning or statistics? If you're talking about machine learning, you could do a PhD in either machine learning or computer science. (The latter would be a lot more useful for an industry position.) If you're talking about statistics, you could do a PhD in statistics, but it would be difficult to get a job afterwards without experience. Alternatively, if you're just interested in learning, you could do a master's degree in either machine learning or statistics. egingroup Thank you for your reply! Is the ability to use the UNIX shell a requirement? endgroup - CoryCross Jan 20 '17 at 17:31 egingroup It's a good idea to learn at least the basics of Unix commands. However, I wouldn't say it's a requirement. endgroup - D.W.

It is a broad discipline, which spans a wide range of topics and approaches. As such, it cannot be studied on its own. It can be studied as part of a wider programme of study, however, which I recommend you do. I agree with what others have said about the need to learn the basics of statistical analysis, such as linear algebra, matrix decompositions, and some basic statistical analysis. You also need to learn how to do data visualisation and manipulation, and have a good grounding in computer science. I would recommend that you consider studying for a Masters in Data Science. It gives you the opportunity to study a wider range of topics, and pick up knowledge in the areas that you need to learn, without necessarily requiring you to pick a specific specialisation. I would also recommend that you look at the Python Machine Learning Library, and the R programming language. Both of these are frequently used in the field of Data Science. The Python Machine Learning Library is also the basis for a number of other machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn. In terms of career development, I would recommend that you consider applying for jobs in a number of different areas within Data Science. Some people are focused on academia and want to be researchers, others are interested in industry and want to do applied work, and others are interested in a mix of the two. These are very different areas, and working in one doesn't preclude you from working in another. I would also recommend that you consider working in a range of different companies, in different industries, and work on a number of different projects. Not the answer you're looking for?
