My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother was an immigrant from Mexico, and she asked if she could help translate something for this mom, which my gf thought would be fine to do since it was not about herself...so, they go over to the house (the mom speaks no english) where there are two little girls waiting at the door. As soon as the teacher gets there though, the first girl starts spitting up on the ground but covered with "dirt" so that you couldn't see what had happened until the mom cleaned off the mess. Then when the second child comes out, she only has one shoe. This went on all day long: every time the sibling left or arrived, another incident occurred like this. At some point I think the mom got frustrated enough by these occurrences that she came outside into English speaking country and offered money for any assistance given regarding the childrenbut then the abuse started again once the gf left. Something tells me our friend here didn't really need translating.. That story should end, ..."and now we'll leave for real."
