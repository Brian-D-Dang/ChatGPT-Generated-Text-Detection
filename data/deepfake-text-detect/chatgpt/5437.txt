I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that criminals are not rapists. But sexual assault is a choice made for rapists where the victim chooses to act against her wishes or desire; most sexual predators choose to prey on others because they want someone else's life ruined behind closed doors. "For many women these kinds of discussions have been going around for decades," says Dr. Arnold Kolkovich, who has published studies showing how rape victim versus perpetrator networks influence decisions regarding whether to report rapes, sexual assaults and other forms of harassment through denial attacks - and that's why their voices matter so much more than those from victims of crime. "It really boils down to one thing: history shows which group you're speaking out against isn't really protecting you." While many survivors of sexual violence oppose protections against attackers - especially when it comes to threats toward young girls and young women - researchers say there needs to be better understanding between perpetrators and victims if perpetrators can expose themselves as well as investigate coercion into criminal behavior committed against them. In a study published online Sept. 26 in the Journal of Sexual Assault Prevention, researchers found that a calm acceptance does not necessarily mean silence but rather allowing consenting adults to make the decision together without concern over consequences should be an option available only after receiving explicit warning signs such as unwanted kissing, inappropriate comments from strangers outside the room wearing dress shirts, passive aggression directed at children, words exchanged along gender lines resulting in physical contact or retaliation which result in injuries to another person and acts of restraint that affect sexual identity based on gender identities. It's important to recognize the risk factors involved before committing a violent offense like assault, says Siri Scully, who researches gender identity issues and competes for sexual crimes convictions in New York City. Scully specializes in engaging sex offenders' families, helping parents convince their sons to avoid having sex offenses perpetrated upon them. There also need to be changes that involve legal processes ensuring justice for sexual offenders while minimizing risks involved in pursuing crimes that harm children under age 13 years old, says Ellen Houggemaker, co-director of the Sexual Violence Crisis Center at Mercyhurst University in Lakewood, N.J., noting that it would serve both victims and perpetrators alike best through prevention programs aimed at preventing sexual abuse then mitigating future cases. The researchers suggest creating policies designed to recognize victim blaming practices seen among perpetrators and encouraging parental control of supervision responsibilities instead of punishing abusers may help reduce prejudice in society during sentencing hearings. Men have long accused women of being sexually predatory towards them, and many resort to trying to make excuses for pedophiles by claiming that victims aren't believed until proven guilty. In the case of Harvey Weinstein, Weinstein has denied wrongdoing but has settled lawsuits brought against him alleging sexual misconduct. In addition to exploiting underage girls, sexual predators engage in a range of behaviors including stalking, bullying, intimidation and blackmail attempts involving older men and children who identify as female. Many survivors experience guilt over what happened inside their homes, often presenting themselves wrongly as victims seeking comfort ahead of their own punishment due to domestic tensions surrounding sexual abuse allegations against their abuser. Studies show that mothers live longer lives compared to fathers whose daughters were raped too early in childhood despite reporting incidents within weeks of each other. Research suggests that fathers neglect childcare duties related to child rearing leaving little time for their daughters. Women appear to feel less protected due concerns over feelings of guilt associated with unwanted attention and humiliation transmitted via social media posts followed closely by accusations sent directly to friends or family members. According to research by Stanford University professor Daniela Sinatra, who studied online dating profiles between 2016 and 2018, 73 percent said responsibility was placed on younger females even though they existed alone. Women of color face further discrimination when it comes to hiring, educationally speaking. While Black girls didn't receive equal representation in the workplace according to a 2012 study conducted nationally by the University of Michigan Student Association, only 39 percent of Blacks reported employment opportunities beyond college level compared to 42 percent of whites. While most white women seem willing to take voluntary roles requiring unpaid work to support children, 60 percent of black women told researchers that employers discriminated against them prior to joining the workforce. Researchers suspect some perpetrators carelessly consensual intercourse will continue unabated regardless of community norms. "You don't see individuals taking advantage of kids anymore simply because there seems to be no accountability here," Scully says. "We know that typically boys perceive girls as objects whereas girls perceive boys as equals." According to research compiled this year by researchers at Boston College's School of Public Health, rape awareness campaigns promote positive attitudes toward victims. Researchers found that medication-assisted treatment led to improvements in self-esteem following infection symptoms caused by sexually transmitted infections (STD) outbreaks. Similarly, researchers found sexual predator deterrence efforts targeting adolescents helped curb recidivism rates by reducing childhood sexual assaults used discriminating ideologies stemming from rape culture. Sexual violence causes serious physical damage to victims days after exposure begins leading to significant emotional trauma and psychological distress later on.
