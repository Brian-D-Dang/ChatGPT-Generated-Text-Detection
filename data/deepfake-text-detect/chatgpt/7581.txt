While it is true that the term "natural" is vague and can be difficult to define, it is not entirely meaningless. The term is often used to describe products and processes that are not artificial or synthetic. For example, organic food is typically regarded as "natural" due to the absence of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. Similarly, natural remedies and therapies often rely on plant-based ingredients or other natural sources. Furthermore, the term "natural" can also be important in terms of health and safety. Many people prefer products that contain natural ingredients or are made through natural processes because they believe them to be safer and less harmful than synthetic alternatives. Studies have shown that certain synthetic chemicals can have negative effects on human health and the environment, which is why many consumers seek out "natural" alternatives. Therefore, while "natural" may not have a concrete definition, it is still meaningful in terms of the products and processes it describes and the importance it holds for many consumers in terms of safety and sustainability.
