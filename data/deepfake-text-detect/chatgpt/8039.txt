White girls very rarely date Asian men. Even in Asia white men are much more popular than Asian men. Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white women, he's still not going to let his guard down and get close enough with her so she can see the real him." I don't think I've seen that before but it makes sense (more on this later). The main thing is: you're sharing your opinion here which isn;t bad at all especially as some of us really do need help sometimes..and we count! Keep up good work man...now go out there be happy!!:)
