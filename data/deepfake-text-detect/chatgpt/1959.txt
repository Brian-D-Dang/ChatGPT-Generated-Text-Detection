Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a war between two communist countries with both having their own version of freedom or what "freedom" means to them (in Vietnamese culture). If you were against one country's idea of what they wanted for themselves, then it made sense that we would not want communism there as well...even though neither side really had free elections nor did either have true democracy in place..the US went into Cambodia after Laos because Pol Pot killed thousands upon thousands of his own citizens. The problem here? We dropped so much fucking shit on these poor peasants trying to get rid of him which ultimately ended up killing millions more before he even left office! So if someone comes at your house shooting guns all over the place looking like an idiot who doesn't give a fuck about anything but himself...you can assume its gonna be bad news....and let us never forget how afraid civilians became when our bombers flew overhead. The reason why politicians are always scared to admit what happened during WWII was due to Nazi Germany being infiltrated by communists from Russia long ago, starting right around WWI. This ideology led to Hitler wanting to become stronger than Stalin so that way Europe could stay under German control rather than Russian. Now allow yourself some time off, go watch "Inglorious Bastards" starring Brad Pitt Quentin Tarantino
