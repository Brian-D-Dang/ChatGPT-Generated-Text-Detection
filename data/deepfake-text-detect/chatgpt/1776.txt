Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never been to either one but am planning on going this year, though not sure where yet... I think it has something to do with the fact that they are in New York City
