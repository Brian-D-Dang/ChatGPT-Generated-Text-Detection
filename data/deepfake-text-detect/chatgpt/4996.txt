So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion. The reason why now that subreddit exists should be noted too because it only allows for a certain amount of traffic and has low viewership so maybe it could get noticed here by people who don't care about what's going on with LoL? The reason why now that subreddit exists shouldn't be noted too Which isn't really true at all..
