While some may argue that Edward Snowden should be pardoned for his actions in leaking classified government information, it is important to recognize that Snowden's actions have likely compromised national security and put many people at risk. Snowden's decision to release sensitive information without proper authorization has undermined trust within the government and potentially jeopardized ongoing investigations and intelligence efforts. Furthermore, Snowden chose to flee to Russia rather than face the consequences of his actions, further raising questions about his motives and loyalty. While some may sympathize with Snowden's intentions, it is important to uphold the law and protect national security.
