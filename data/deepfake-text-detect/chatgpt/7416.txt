One counter-argument could be that the law should reflect moral values and principles. If a significant portion of the population views abortion as morally wrong, then it would be unjust to pass a law legalizing it. In this case, lawmakers have a responsibility to consider the moral implications of their decisions and ensure that the law reflects the values and beliefs of the society they represent. Additionally, allowing something that is morally wrong to be legal could have negative consequences for society as a whole, and undermine the government's ability to promote public welfare and the common good.
