He's intelligent and wealthy and adaptable apparently. I think the majority of Gotham's problems could've solved with smart investments in social programs and industry and the police force which Bruce Wayne as a wealthy philanthropist has the potential to provide. He could use his resources to fund programs for education, job training, and mental health services that can address some of the root causes of crime in the city. Additionally, he could make strategic investments in local businesses to create more job opportunities and improve the economy. As for the police force, Wayne could use his influence and resources to push for reform and better training, as well as investing in new technology to improve their effectiveness. Overall, there are many ways that Wayne could make a difference in Gotham beyond his efforts as Batman.
