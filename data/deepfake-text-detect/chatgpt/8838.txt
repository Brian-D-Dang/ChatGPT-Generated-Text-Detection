I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have livedcurrently live there, I could not be more dead set on living here. My love of New York is as well - the art scene is always the most amazing thing for me, it's my new home! I am a big fan of all things city-wide, so when we lived up north in CT, I was pretty much living there too.
