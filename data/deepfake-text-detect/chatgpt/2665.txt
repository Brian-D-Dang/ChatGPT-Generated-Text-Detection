As a gay man, I can be extremely wary of other people for my own protection. I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate or kill another person because they are different than you and not obeying your authority figure (s). I don't understand how homosexuality relates? Has someone tried killing or hating on gays in this forum before?
