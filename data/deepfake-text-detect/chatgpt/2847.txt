First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised. Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, and if there are any health benefits of being uncircumcised (such as the supposed increased sensitivity) then they do not outweigh my personal experience with circumcision. What's your take on this? I'm happy you don't have to deal with the downsides...but why is having an elective cosmetic surgery without asking for input from one's parents "a right"? It doesn't matter where or when someone gets their body parts amputated. You should be allowed to decide what happens to them after infancy.
