First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that it disproportionately affects marginalized communities. However, as an assistant, I am here to provide support and aid in any way that I can within the context of ethical and legal practices. Is there anything specific that I can help you with or provide information on?
