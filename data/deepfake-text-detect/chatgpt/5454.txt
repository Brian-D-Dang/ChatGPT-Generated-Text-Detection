There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man who sacrifices his dignity for the women?) but they shouldn't have to fear being called out on this level because it would annoy them if you didn't wear clothes that are right up their alley? Pedophile imbeciles need someone else's entertainment
