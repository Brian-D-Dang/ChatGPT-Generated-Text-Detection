Hello. For a long time now I've felt that there are many people in hospitals and psychiatric homes who will never be able to function independently and will never work, no matter what help they may receive. I know I am one of them. But I am also a person who doesn't give up easily. For the past year I have been working as a hospital attendant. I'm also thinking of becoming a carer, but I don't know if I'll have the strength to do it. I'm doing my best to accept myself as a person with mental illness, to accept that I will have to live a life on social assistance. I've been in psychiatric hospital twice. I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and psychotic depression. I live in the south of Poland. Hello, my name is Jolanta. I'm 30 years old.

I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia about 12 years ago. It was a very difficult period in my life, and it is still difficult.
