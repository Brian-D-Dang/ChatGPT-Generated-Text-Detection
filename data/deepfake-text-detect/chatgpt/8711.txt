The word 'natural' implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless we're creating these "natural" things that aren't even natural then why call them "natural"? I think it's more analogous to saying "humans being a part of and derived from a tree." If you can create things out of an animal but not into another creature then what does the tree mean? That doesn't make any sense...
