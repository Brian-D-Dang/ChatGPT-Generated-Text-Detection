Actually, this is a harmful and baseless statement. It overlooks the complexity of mental health issues and the fact that suicidal ideation is a serious symptom of certain mental health conditions. Suicidal thoughts may arise from traumatic experiences, chemical imbalances, or a wide range of mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety. Seeking help from a suicide hotline is a responsible act and shows that the individual is taking a step to prioritize their mental health, which is a vital aspect of overall wellness. Suggesting that these people are not legitimately suicidal simply because they reached out for help is not only incorrect but also perpetuates harmful stigma towards people who struggle with mental health challenges. Suicide is a serious issue and we should aim to support individuals who seek help in whichever way they can.
