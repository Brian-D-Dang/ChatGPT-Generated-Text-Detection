With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned like many Gawker employees do, then people could get away without calling out sexism or racism in public because they knew there would be little consequences for doing so openly within their own group of friends and coworkers - which fostered an environment where harassment was rampant among users who were rewarded by rising to positions as mods at various subreddits (iirc). In short: The problem isn't just one man's actions - It represents every person participating here when hidden behind anonymity regardless if you agreedisagree his behavior should have been tolerated[1]. As such we can ignore those claiming "he himself said he did nothing wrong" until some sort [2]of transparency occurs regarding how things are run inside these private communities.[3] (and i'm not saying anything about what happened from other reddit administrations)
