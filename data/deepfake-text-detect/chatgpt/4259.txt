The goods and services we consume are made possible by the abundance of cheap resources and labour that the west gets out of underdeveloped countries. The West has no reason to fear this, because it can't produce anything in return for its own wealth - it is not a capitalist society (it doesn't even have capitalism). Any country developing its economy or looking at ways to improve their economic situation will be investing more time with less money. "But there's nothing wrong with the west doing what the east does." Blankety Blank! It isn't right mate! You need to work on your English. Read this: "There's something intrinsically wrong when a nation develops along an outdated development path while another comes up with new ideas that are better than the old ones." These are the words used by Professor Peter Singer in his book 'Animal Liberation' who explains how western sciencetechnology gives power over nature and therefore over human beings. He also argues for a world without industrial agriculture which would mean we would all live co-operatively and peacefully instead of exploiting animals to make products like leather, cotton etc. And no one should have any idea that anyone else's animal product consumption is good for them! But yes, if you're caught eating meatanimal flesh as part of some ritual then I guess it is ok, but generally speaking most people don't eat meatanimal flesh unless they have to. Most people abhor eating meat. That's why most people go vegan. If you want to do business in ChinaEast AsiaIndiathe Middle East, you'll find them very focused (read: arrogant) about their beliefs around fooddietary habits. Most ways to eat meat are quite disgusting compared to healthily cooked veggie meals so you'd be surprised where Chinese takeaways come from. If you think that you can exploit non-human life forms just because they're not sentient enough to understand our greediness and cruelty to other species, then you're mistaken mate. We are all animals, made of organic matter (not that the term 'organic' means anything nowadays) and we are meant to be used in the natural manner. Being left alone to exist naturally underground is actually preferable to being killed off wholesale by humans because they kill us through the excessive use of chemicals etc. without telling us anything about those chemicals except that they know how much they poison us and force us into slavery. Even if it meant sacrificing a few insects to save thousands of lives, I'm sure the Chinese would consider it worth it for the long run. And since they've got the resources to feed themselves now anyway, don't tell me they can't wait until the rest of humanity dies out first.
