I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. It is by no means clear how the US went about its war policy differently than it did in 1941, but history is not always easy on us or anyone else. If the US were using nuclear weapons against Iraq, its soldiers would have been killed first because they were SO unsuccessful at killing Saddam Hussein and the rest of the Muslims they hated. That is exactly why the terrorists who killed the Iraqis were great. They knew they had no chance. They took the wrong strategy. And so did the rest of the world - even those who thought it was wrong to kill them for the sake of their own good. All that happened just months after the 911 attack came out. If these people on the other side of the aisle decided this was all to save themselves from that horrible event, then what now? The idea that by killing innocent civilians and destroying homes across Afghanistan, allowing civilian casualties, knowing that if you didn't kill enough innocent civilians, the American military could be saved from such atrocities while doing nothing to stop them? What do we know about the extent of the economic damage done to our country as a result and how we can prepare for future wars? We don't know much about how many more Americans died before the United States finally defeated ISIS. But the fact remains that most people here today remain ignorant of what was going on in Iraq. The US, of course, does not support any force whatsoever to overthrow the regime. A united front will not prevent this. A left-wing cabal that has consistently pursued this goal cannot give up without sacrifice. As long as the US continues pursuing this desire for control over the Middle East, there are still millions of people alive who may want to fight the Iranian government, but that doesn't mean fighting Iran's power. Historians and historians clearly disagree with this assessment, but I have seen an increase in this view among former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Both routinely recommend US policies in order to justify the use of lethal force against Iran when it should be deploying nuclear missiles and other advanced warfare systems. Their views are often both contradictory and contradictory. In 2005, however, Bush announced his intention to "not put a U.S.-Iranian border in place." In 2012, Obama said he would "never question" the right of Israel to use forces there to suppress religious information. Obama admitted in response to criticism by some within Congress last November that the US would strike Israel unless it wanted to. This same week, Obama declared: "We've got to make sure that the United Nations Security Council understands that we're going to take action... to protect the Jewish state. We'll never ask [Israel] to use its third-party role in maintaining peace, security and stability." The Republicans' argument that the only reason the US has to engage Iran is that Hezbollah is threatening them - or at least one of them - is a bit disingenuous. Bibi Netanyahu threatened the Saudis, whom Trump seems to prefer over him. On January 12th 2017, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, met with President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two leaders discussed ways for Saudi Arabia to combat Houthi rebels in Yemen, and agreed to pursue a single strategic option.

Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas called Trump's decision "unilateral" and vowed to press ahead with beginning development on a deal with Tehran over the weekend. There are no guarantees that the cease fire will provide any lasting impact, but the Palestinians seem determined to keep trying regardless.
