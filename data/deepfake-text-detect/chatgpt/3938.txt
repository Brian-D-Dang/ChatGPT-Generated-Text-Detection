The word 'natural' implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless one says that evolution doesn't exist or something like that then what makes the difference between human and animal? Because animals can reproduce in ways we cannot (humans have to be impregnated). Biology teaches us that biology is all about survival of the fittest - if you want an engineer with children, look at the males rather than females.
