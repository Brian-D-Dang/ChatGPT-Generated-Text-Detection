If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs and fewer opportunities will be created post-industrialization. In that case, it would require a massive increase in employment (i.e., artificial intelligence) for retirement savings to pass through the pension system. That should probably happen before then. If you're a former student on your way out of college - what do you have? A 401k? A long-term investment account? Another luxury car? So far the divide between the rich and poor is pretty significant: One out of every three people on earth has an education, with many being young adulthood-a second half as many having graduated from high school than working or running a business. In other words, if you can retire early enough, even just a little bit earlier, life could become very different. The bottom line is this: If we accidentally screw up by not investing enough, the world will end around now, and people will finally wake up to see how smart they really was. It won't take much more than a few years to make this happen.
