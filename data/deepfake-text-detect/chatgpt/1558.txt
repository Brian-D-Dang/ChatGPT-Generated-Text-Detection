The Earth is constantly changing and moving in predictable patterns and cycles. The water cycle and nutrient cycles (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, etc.) are Earth's metabolism. The Homo sapiens component of the human body literally grows from a single cell to an adult when it is born, dies or spends its last days as an astrocyte after being transplanted into another host organism. Earth is not static. It oscillates between plateaus and troughs on a periodic basis that follow certain rates determined by what is happening at each individual level: atmosphere, ocean currents, global weather systems, ice sheets, hurricane track shift, volcanoes erupting, earthquakes occurring - not only within the continental crust but also under mountain ranges; hot spots like Yellowstone volcano erupting which caused massive glaciers for thousands of years melting away along with enormous floods whenever volcanic material reaches the surface causing major upheavals around the world including tsunamis and other catastrophic events. We know how our planet works because we can observe changes over time. We have instruments gathering data all across the globe that give us an accurate record of where everything stands relative to one another today compared to 150-200 million years ago during the Paleocene Epoch, 100 million years before the advent of Homo sapiens. That was enough to send alarm bells ringing ever since. New discoveries about our planet suggest that the current temperature rise may be even more rapid than previously thought. A new report published in Nature Climate Change claims that warming has already doubled every 50 years. If so, then humans will see their temperatures double again next year if emissions continue unabated. Can you imagine? An average person living 60 years now sees hisher life span shorten by 15 years due to climate change alone! And scientists warn that this could happen much faster unless all nations come together to control global heating. Unfortunately, there appears no sign of any collective leadership anywhere else except among some small islands that were hit directly by hurricanes recently while most others dodged bullets. Therein lies the problem. Most people do not realize they live right below the edge of a supervolcano spewing molten rock from deep inside itself with a slew of accompanying eruptions resulting in extreme weather conditions capable of wiping out entire countries and continents. Indeed, most large cities lie just beneath these kinds of active volcanos. This brings up yet another important question: Is anyone going to protect them once a disaster occurs? What kind of response would governments make toward protecting citizens who lived near such volcanos? Would they evacuate those regions first followed later by evacuating everyone else? What happens if a city gets destroyed by a tsunami - don't forget, many coastal towns lie just above hydrothermal vents responsible for sending lava flows deep underground and eventually rising back up with devastating consequences. Scientists predict that Hawaii may soon become uninhabitable due to these factors combined with sea levels that keep rising relentlessly due to global warming. Such disasters should serve as wakeup calls to all humankind concerning the growing dangers posed by global warming. But unfortunately, nothing is really being done. Some experts think that future pandemics will affect humanity far worse than COVID-19 did. While COVID-19 seems to bring serious harm mainly to middle aged people, those who suffer severe cases of pneumonia often develop heart attacks. Allergy season comes early too these days especially when pollen particles scatter everywhere during wind dispersal leading to inflammation throughout the body. Many stem cells migrate towards inflamed tissues around the lungs and brain killing off surrounding healthy tissue thereby triggering cardiac arrest further aggravating the process. Even antidepressants trigger similar problems thus leading to sudden cardiac death leaving patients unable to breathe until help arrives. Just ask those whose hearts stopped beating suddenly in front of doctors due to long term use of antidepressant medications. How does chronic stress contribute to cardiovascular disease? Perhaps the saddest aspect of this terrible virus outbreak given the fact that social distancing measures had been meticulously implemented worldwide surpasses anything I've seen in my lifetime. People flocked to malls and shops without masks whereas airport staff looked down upon shoppers wearing protective facemasks. Of course, authorities tell us that mankind cannot withstand prolonged isolation due to psychological effects. However, when a highly infectious respiratory pathogen begins spreading rapidly through society, fewer distractions seem to me preferable to me rather than watching several thousand people die either sick or dead. One thing is sure though - as long as we choose chemical toxins instead of natural healing remedies, suffering will remain part of our existence forevermore. Here's to hoping there will always be someone looking forward to improve health and wellness not suffering as he faces the ravages of aging with the hope of prolonging his lifespan beyond old age.
