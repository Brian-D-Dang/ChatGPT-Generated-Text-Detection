Reddit is a website, a business, it is the "front page of the internet." This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these websites is a great way to demonstrate some of the internet's most prominent features. You may find these sites incredibly popular, and others are too often biased. If you have an idea for which site to go through, and are doing so, I would consider it a good idea to try that.
