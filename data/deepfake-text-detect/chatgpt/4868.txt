I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was completely shocked at the amount of historical inaccuracies that were present in this movie! In no particular order:1) Alan Turing's life story is not what you think - he has been portrayed very unfairly in this documentary2) Contrary to popular belief, Alan did NOT discover how to break German Enigma during WW-II3) It would have taken him AGES more time than 2 years4) He didn't actually use his solution on any enemy transmissions or at least wasn't successful5) His famous bombe machine was via all accounts perfectly functional6) We are led to believe by some scenes that his work with code breaking had direct impact on the outcome of WWII7) All along from start, this man DIDN'T want to be homosexual8) During WW-II he was treated horribly for his sexual orientation9) That "lonely room" where he supposedly cracked enigmas? Not true10) There isn't even one mention here of Bletchley Park11) This couldn't be further from reality12) TOP SECRET information was actually easily accessible to Hitler13) Churchill himself knew nothing of his accomplishments14) NO ONE knows this much about his contributions15) TWISTED facts that hurt his reputation16) HE WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT 17) He wasn't actually convicted of these charges18) He died of stomach cancer19) As far as anyone can tell there was never a trial20) If we wanted to bash gay people, why don't they ever get mentioned?!21) There aren't enough mentions of individual heroes like Dilly Knox22) And finally, an actual error regarding which university first admitted him23)...And then...IT GETS WORSE!!24) After leaving school he worked on early computers that weren't built correctly and tested them out on unsuspecting postal workers25) When he helped try to fix their faulty machines, he sent detailed exploits to American computer magazines26) One such magazine printed most of his exploits THIS IS JUST TO NAME A FEW OUT OF MANY!!! This could go on forever but hopefully my list will suffice! Please help me find references within movies as well so I can add those points to my list too! Any questions feel free to ask. Thank You!:) Thanks for your post. However, please note that none of these are factual errors, the ones you've listed above are merely fictional exaggerations. In fact, they're similar to things celebrities sometimes saydo when making themselves look better than the truth. Of course, if you'd prefer the entire history account be altered to make yourself seem less important, it certainly seems possible (and probably worth doing, since IMO you did indeed contribute quite heavily to Allied success during WWII), but only someone who doesn't know anything else should decide whether that's best or not. - Robert FeldmannJul 27 '17 at 19:04 The correct way to view this scene is that the numbers represent "miles per day." So Turing's breakthrough happened every single mile. Oh, yeah, and the US government kept track of exactly how many miles per day Turing broke codes. They reported it back to everyone involved, including Churchill sic. Similarly, the figures for the number of messages broken by the British seemed extremely high perhaps overstated, despite being mostly accurate until it turned out they averaged around 20 messages daily. (thanks Robert Feldmanman): sic]: Actually, given on average each message took typically 10 days to decode, and Bletchey staff estimated that Turing had successfully broken some 6 of one month's traffic. Thanks again!:D (or-more-than ...] ] - Murchie Jun 28 '17 at 13:02 These comments all come down to "it makes the character likable." Plus its fun to imagine ourselves moving through time with other characters, imagining conversations etc... If these are real events, they might bring up real ideas and controversies. But a fiction writer must play fast and loose with history. Its part of their job. Like a good novelist tells us in college textbooks, "write what you experienced, write what you remember, create what you wish existed!" For cinema makers it works differently because at times the plot lines need to move quickly and the audience needs to stay engaged. So they compromise with History. What matters does not!
