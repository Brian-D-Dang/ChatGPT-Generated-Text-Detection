First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue in general that some people want to avoid long distances and others like me are very happy with a shorter route via public transit or just driving out there so we can walk around if necessary. A lot of places have banned cars from sidewalks (when you drive no one cares). The added benefit of having more space helps pedestrians too.
