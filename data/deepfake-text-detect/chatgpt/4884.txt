This one seems so obvious to me but I'll provide the basic points: It is a person's right to do whatever they want with their own body so long as it doesn't physically harm others. This means that abortion is legal and these pro-life groups are extremists who merely oppose such things on moral grounds. It seems like this argument would be more applicable if someone were trying to keep people from going too far in the direction of abortions, for example by making sure women can only get an abortion when they're up against life or death situations (which I think should probably happen anyway). But there's no denying that most people have some kind of sexual activity before marriage, which will result in pregnancies even though contraception was used; therefore the government has less reason to intervene here than other areas where there might not be much choice involved. There shouldn't just be laws preventing murderno matter how insane we feel about what happened after conceptionbecause you could always save yourself from committing suicide...or self-murdering because the world sucks; laws prevent killing for justified reasons. So does a ban on abortion mean society won't allow any form of birth control? No but there's still been "justified" killings throughout history without our law enforcement acting upon it (e.g. Herod II) and we don't need laws banning all forms of abortion either; yet people do go through them anyway. The point remains: Abortion isn't necessary given modern medical help, and there are better ways to deal with unwanted children. If someone wanted a child badly enough they'd adopt instead. To say otherwise is a hypocritical stance against babies' livesand living beings in general. Even Hitler allowed his soldiers to take over countries; he didn't force people into breeding programs, nor did he try to destroy every baby born as soon as its head developed outside of its mother's womb, let alone kill them at various stages during pregnancy. He took over entire nations despite the fact that the average citizen wasn't willing to cooperate with him, and killed off millions of innocent civilians rather than having them compete for resources; yeah, I'm pretty shocked he managed to accomplish anything considering that. And look at Europe nowadays; many places aren't allowing Muslims to immigrate anymore despite Germany being able to support everyone already inside those borders. These restrictions seem utterly senseless except for the purpose of preventing immigrants completely from entering those lands until deemed worthy or expelled. That should be applied across board internationally as well; then maybe people wouldn't start complaining about America's acceptance of illegal immigrationthere's plenty of space in Canada, Mexico, Australia, etc.if those countries stopped letting people come to live among us simply due to us refusing to recognize their cultures and customs. Most people descend directly from the Middle Eastern peoples anyways; why not stop impinging upon the indigenous culture while keeping the common bonds between humanity alive? We all came from the same ancestors after all; messing around with bloodlines? Idiotic! The best part is that whenever they make rules out of fear of terrorists, they open themselves up for further attacks. They set a precedent by using military power to punish citizens for the actions of criminals. How long until this becomes acceptable? Will they use drones to spy on our homes? Eventually it may become easier to shoot down planes crossing US airspace than ask permission first from Washington DC. And once the gloves are off in terms of large scale weapons, they'll inevitably decide to mow down protesters demonstrating against environmental crimes (we've known about global warming since 1998!) or something equally ridiculous. Motherhood runs counter to human nature and understanding God's creation is difficult at times; but to put ourselves above everything else and create structures designed purely based upon manmade logic is truly paradoxical. The Bible teaches respect for authority and obedience regardless of whether those authorities are good or evil; it also spells out facts regarding warfare within states. After seeing the destruction machines collapse, these rulers really had no choice. Yet they chose extermination of innocents over compassion. Doesn't sound very Christian now, eh? I know they claim people have religious beliefs causing them to commit acts such as terrorism, but isn't this exactly what Islam claims? Why not condemn all religionsbeliefs as inherently dangerous, especially ones promoting war? Is religion free speech or whatnot, so we can't criticize certain sects? When Christianity spread westward initially, did it bring along rape and pillage and slaughter? Wasn't Jesus supposed to be coming back in two thousand years? Weren't there wars fought on behalf of Christendom by Christians? Didn't Crusaders burn Saracens? Isn't that what ISIS follows, precisely? Does crusades stand a chance of becoming popular again if we avoid talking about them openly? Where are all those old movies with Satan declaring victory over mankind and doing horrible deeds!? We see where this leads sometimes, so why leave the door open by ignoring past abuses committed by our faith leaders? Maybe if we acknowledged that truthfulness, compassion, family love, humility, honor, and charity goes hand with effortless slow development (the rest of its principles), and in parallel with this new world view, we can offer our special to observe channels on our pie
