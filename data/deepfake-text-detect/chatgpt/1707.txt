Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. I mean.... if it was a real issue what would be the solution?.. but on the flip side... why do we care so much in the first place and how does our society function without those satellites around? Also am I supposed to feel bad for these guys who test their rockets only to have them crash into other countries' stuff while being pretty high up there anyway?? (sorry for lapses of logic)
