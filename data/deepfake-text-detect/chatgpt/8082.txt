It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing you can't buy in this world: trust! And I think there are more things than politics for Chinese citizens who feel insecure with their government - like food safety issues or environmental hazards etc., which affect them directly on day-to -day basis."
