Posting on my secondary for obvious reasons I grew up in a extremely abusive house. I dreaded coming home and the site of my mom made my heart skip a beat, but more often than not she was being shot at by his gun or had been beaten with it that daynight before. She would wake us all from our bed to tell us things like "I hope your dad is dead today" and such... It just sounds crazy now to say something along those lines, but when you're 7 years old.... You were probably lucky he didn't kill her too!
