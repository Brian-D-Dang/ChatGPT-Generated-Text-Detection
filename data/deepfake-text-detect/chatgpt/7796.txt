The recent Supreme Court ruling regarding same-sex marriage does not necessarily lead to the legalization of polygamy or any other non-standard marriage arrangements. Each type of relationship carries its own set of legal, ethical, and social considerations that must be evaluated separately. Moreover, legalizing same-sex marriage actually helps to define the concept of "marriage" and "family" by recognizing the diverse relationships that exist within society. The argument that legalizing non-standard marriages would have a negative effect on society lacks evidence as there is no clear correlation between types of marriages and societal outcomes. Ultimately, individuals should have the autonomy to choose the relationship structure that best suits them and their beliefs, as long as it is consensual, safe, and based on mutual respect.
