It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be provided with a safe, secure environment and can be studied in order to help understand their behavior and develop strategies for conservation of their species. Zoos also provide an important educational resource for people, enabling them to experience animals up close and learn about the threats they face in the wild. In addition, when managed properly, zoos can give back to the wild by reintroducing animals that have been bred and raised in captivity.
