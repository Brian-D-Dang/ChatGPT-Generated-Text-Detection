I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too stark for me to see as anything other than an annoyance. Yeah, that's what i was thinking. It seems like such a boring place where you dont get to hang out with friends or make any new ones.
