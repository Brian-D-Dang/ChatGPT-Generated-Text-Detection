I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say "entertainment," but I think it's more than just that. Most works of art are also meant to educate people on a topic or subject matter in some way while still maintaining entertainment value for the viewer (s). Ahh okay yes you're right! Thankyou
