I'm not a cop hater. I like to think I'm a relatively reasonable person but I'm honestly not even 100 sure how I really feel with the constant barrage of stories in the news about policemen getting away with doing some incredibly fucked up shit. I feel like I'm sort of tired of the conversation. I feel like maybe we're sort of approaching the point of diminishing returns. I mean, it's nice to be outraged and stuff but like, at some point it's just not going to change anything. It's just gonna get exhausting for everyone. Like, I am just really tired of hearing about it. And at the same time I'm just not even sure how to feel. I'm sure there's a million articles out there about how to talk about this stuff. I'm sure there's a million videos on YouTube about how to talk about this stuff. I'm sure there's a million think pieces about how to talk about this stuff. I don't really know how to talk about this stuff though. So, maybe I'll just do the thing where I talk about the few times I have experienced police brutality in my life. I grew up in the suburbs of Los Angeles and I'm sort of just sort of white enough to be able to pass for Latino in most parts of the country but sort of brown enough to be questioned about it in Los Angeles. I never really had to deal with it too much because I grew up in a relatively wealthy neighborhood. I went to public school and I was not part of any gangs and I never really did anything to stand out and generally speaking I was a pretty respectful kid. I think I got a few speeding tickets in my life and I got arrested once for a petty theft but I didn't really do anything crazy. I'm also a pretty small dude and I grew up pretty thin so I never really intimidated anyone. And I think that's part of it. I never really intimidated the police either. I never really did anything to draw the attention of law enforcement. And the only two times I've really experienced any sort of police brutality in my life were both in LA. The first was back when I was in high school and me and my friends were driving home from a party in a friend's car. We were stopped at a stoplight and the cop who pulled us over, who I'm sure was probably an asshole to other people who got pulled over, was a total asshole to us. He was a dick to my friend in the passenger seat and he was yelling at us and he was yelling at us and he was yelling at us and he was really sort of just yelling at us for a really long time and we were all pretty terrified. And then he just sort of looked at me and he was like "what is your name?" And I looked at him and I was like "well, I'm sorry but I don't know your name." And he was like "well, you're in a car without a license plate." And I was like "well, we're just a bunch of 16-year-olds driving home from a party." And he was like "I'm sorry but you guys are going to jail." And I was like "okay." And then he told my friend in the passenger seat to get out of the car and he did. And then he told us to get out of the car and we did. And then he took us into the back of his car and he just kept yelling at us and he kept yelling at us and he kept yelling at us and then eventually I was like "I'm sorry, sir. I'm just really scared and I don't think I'm gonna be able to get a lawyer and I'm just really sorry and I'm just really sorry." And then he was like "well, I'm sorry but I'm just doing my job." And I was like "okay." And then he was like "well, I'm sorry but you guys are going to jail." And then we went to jail. And then we went home and my parents were very upset but we all survived. The other time was when I was in college. I was in college in a weird, weird area that was sort of an island in LA where the LAPD had basically taken over policing. And when I lived there it was like 80 Latino but then after we left it was like 90 Asian. I was just a college kid living on his own and I was still kind of a skittish kid
