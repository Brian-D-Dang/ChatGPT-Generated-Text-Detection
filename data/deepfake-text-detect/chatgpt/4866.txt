I recently discovered rAnglish. Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots. The result is a language that not only sounds like English, but seems to be used by Romans as well (see the Eudemian Definition II:1). Some might say that this kind of thing violates Occam's Razor or at least comes close to it; I won't argue against either point here. But what interests me most about these linguistic experiments is their potential for improving people who speak L2s in ways they don't even realize are suspiciously unnatural. Two examples come immediately to mind. My wife learned Spanish many years ago with special emphasis on conversational conversation. She came away with very little idea how she could get her students to sound natural when speaking English. One of my favorite Latin teachers was similarly oblivious to how much his students were "treading water" around the topics he taught them. In both cases there was no inherent difficulty with the material itself just the fact that it had been delivered so reconditeally that few of their learners realized what they'd really mastered. The first example speaks more clearly than the second, which comes from Peter Schutz' book How We Speak Now. It has nothing to do with grammatical construction per se. Rather, we're dealing with intonation. This captures perfectly the problem that all nonnative speakers face when learning Standard American English tout court. Even those with relatively good command can seem old fashioned because they aren't native speakers themselves. As long as you want your learner to speak completely naturally, you have to give up some degree of control over every aspect of their speech production. Ostensibly, that means teaching them things they never thought about before. For some time now, linguists have known that languages tend towards producing certain syllable patterns in stressed words. If I've heard any one story too often lately, it's about someone trying to learn Arabic without realizing they weren't supposed to pronounce the word tarabah (meaning "spoon like tharaba chicken. They may not consciously know why they should use the vowel a instead of e, but once you put two phonologists together, it usually takes less than an hour for the penny to drop. And then the rest tends to follow rather quickly after that. All we need is a small clue offered right off the bat and we'll start making sense out of everything else our learners raise. We don't always take such clues seriously enough. A number of years back I met a young man named Zakir Yusufzai who, despite being fluent in several European languages, decided to study Russian at university along with his Chinese and Japanese classes since that seemed like the best way to broaden his horizons. When I asked him about his written work, I noticed that while his compositions were generally quite competent, he produced strange lexical combinations none of us would ever make ourselves. For instance, one day he showed me a paper in which he wrote "majiggy." At the same time, he was also writing "jacquard," although neither item looked familiar to us. His papers were full of nonsense phrases like "Zhukov's death," "Borodin's gait" etc. He kept coming up with items that sounded vaguely Eastern European until, finally, somebody pointed out that majiggy came from a children's cartoon show called Majika. This isn't exactly surprising considering the kid's background in Western Europe. What surprised me though was when he explained the origin of the utterance himself. Turns out, he'd taken part in a program where kids went through various fields dressed up as medieval peasants complete with hats, plaid kilts and fake mustaches. Apparently, during playtime, kids used to ask each other questions like 'What kind of bird does jacquard hunt?' and they built sentences with combinations of answers based on probability. Because of its popular appeal among parents, however, Majika emerged as a frequent answer choice. Looking back upon the incident today, over half a decade later, I'm still amazed that Zak didn't notice what was happening at the time. Surely if the phrase hadn't worked twice already, he couldn't help noticing something odd about his own output. Yet as far as he knew, the whole thing happened without his knowledge. My experience with Zak illustrates a rule of thumb for developing foreign accents. Start early. The earlier you begin working on pronunciation, the easier it will be to master. There are plenty of occasions where nonnatives slip into unworkable variations of Standard U.S.A. until they're corrected midstream. By contrast, latecomers sometimes become so accustomed to bad habits that they build up defense mechanisms that inhibit progress. Armed with that knowledge, let's turn to the topic at hand...
