A counter-argument to refute the opinion that there is only "good" and "bad" in the world is that there are many shades of gray along the moral spectrum. Human actions and behaviors cannot be easily categorized as strictly good or bad. Different individuals and cultures view moral conduct differently. The notion of morality is also subject to situational context and environmental factors. Therefore, it is oversimplifying to claim that there are only "good" and "bad" deeds in the world.
