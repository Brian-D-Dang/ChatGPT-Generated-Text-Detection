So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor ethnicity (unless they're black). Reverseblack oppression is wrong in the same way that institutionalized discrimination against whites was illegal until a few years ago when we became too politically correct to say anything offensive anymore so now reverse-racism does exist but only if your own race attacks you for being racist towards them... I don't really know where my confusion comes from since it's basic logic at its best! If someone discriminates based on something else than an individual choice then why would anyone be allowed do whatever he wants regarding his life? Aren't laws meant as protection or regulation?! That said; sorry guys:D Thanks again:) Best Regards!!!!!! Atticus Empiricus!!
