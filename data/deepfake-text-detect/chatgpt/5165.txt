To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. I agree with you, although I've never heard of anyone saying it's a lie and whatnot before this. But what do you mean by lying? It wasn't a lie until this past Monday when more people claimed it was false. Just looks like you're trying to justify your own stupidity.
