I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost useless to have names for these things. The only thing they're really good at is making your computer explode:) But here we are with some real-life element named after someone who made them famous! And even though unshapely might not be very nice (how would you say "your shape"?) he was influential through his work leading groups of researchers so maybe this name will help us remember him:P
