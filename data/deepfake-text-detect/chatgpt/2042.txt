From his personality to the way he handled Southern Succession there is nothing to dislike about him. He had intelligent, moderate religious views, he was compassionate and held the moral high ground with all people no matter their race or nationality. Had it not been for a few intransigent African Americans who were determined on destroying America rather than trying to make something better of this land we could be living in an even more prosperous country today as our society would have progressed further along without those unnecessary distractions which came from these minority groups that were denied rights they deserved but never took advantage of them until integration became necessary. Emmett Till (who wasn't killed by whites) does NOT represent black oppression; he represents HATE! It has always amazed me how many blacks don't see Emmett Till being tortured before death shows ignorance stupidity at its finest!! You are right history IS being whitewashed...just like your comment!!!
