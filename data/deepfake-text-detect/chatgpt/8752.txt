I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before the industry was even alive to his thought process. Boeing's design allowed it to be powered by a couple of lithium-ion batteries and it did not contain any chemical info needed for propulsion. The company did use a lithium alloy catalyst to achieve its power goal, but this was soon eclipsed by a series of other unconventional methods like carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide, which were relatively easy to produce after they had been tested in certain locations. At one point, a nuclear reactor was used as an aerial refueling station, but that plant operated on extremely low speeds until late 1950s when NASA invented the first lithium-bronze fuel cell. The new technology was discovered at the Gerald E. Ford Research Center in Dearborn, Michigan (now known as Western Energy Laboratory), a huge industrial complex whose size has grown from 250 acres to more than 1 million square feet. It includes various DOE facilities including a large Ford facility with about 11,000 employees scattered across four counties. For decades, the battery storage facility housed the batteries for NASA and Boeing, making it possible to store all their components remotely and charge them at a lower voltage than conventional lithium injection. These days, most batteries are charged using power supplied by external powers. But at the same time, there is no power supply available for charging these batteries because they discharge too quickly. Each battery is typically priced between 10 and 20 for a single charge. By contrast, a battery costs 80-100 per unit. While the battery storage facility holds 2,500 batteries, NASA said it could only recharge 900 per day for up to 8 hours - or about 80 percent of its capacity. As a result, the battery storage facility with the largest number of battery storage units could last 4 to 6 months. This means that while the battery storage facility's actual lifespan may depend on how many batteries are being stored in the facility, it would probably take a year or two for the storage facility to output enough data to run out of batteries. So, if the batteries kept up the average usage rate, the cloud computing startup Blue Origin would make millions off of the exploding battery storage facility. That's exactly what happened when the company launched the idea of building a battery storage facility early in 1969. The idea began with the idea of building a battery storage facility capable of storing a significant proportion of the human species' energy needs. But as part of a larger effort to improve the space race, and especially the health care sector, the company also wanted to develop a battery storage facility that could serve humanity well for decades to come. By 1968, however, the problem arose. When NASA made the decision that its research center should have a backup battery storage system, it immediately became clear that it was time to build a comparable facility. Then on January 25, 1971, the space agency announced that it was defunding the fledgling project entirely. But that meant that Lockheed Martin engineers who worked on the program were forced to leave the program altogether. In 1972, NASA sent a letter to General Electric outlining the path forward. The Pentagon believed that if it continued funding the plan, it would pave the way for the sort of massive savings that would allow the future to fit into that current proposal. Meanwhile, the move prompted some companies to pull their stock options, and higher prices were inevitable. Even though NASA planned to keep the battery storage facility operating "for longer," investors believed the cost saving would be disastrous. After all, solar arrays were expensive. And the new battery storage facility is still developing, and while it can continue generating power, it will never be able to meet the initial demand. The real question now is whether or not the huge savings that would sustain the battery storage facility for several hundred years would even be sufficient to justify replacing the existing facility with something else.
