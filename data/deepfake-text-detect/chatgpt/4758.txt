While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept them. With studies such as this one, we just don't know if these companies have their act together or not from a microbiological standpoint. Given how many people trust Monsanto with our food supply, it would behoove us to do some research on GMOs before deciding whether or not they should be allowed in our country.
