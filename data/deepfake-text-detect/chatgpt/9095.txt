This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this is definitely not experimental. This model isn't a simulation of real footage (and neither are the "I" videos). There's much more involved than that with how it was filmed and edited. We've got several other CMs going on to do the same thing with the video though.
