IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say "preposterous" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more people (or at least not sound like a complete idiot)? I think the only time I've seen preposterous was on Law Order SVU in which Olivia Benson always yells out preposterous! Preposterous is an excellent word for describing someone who says something completely outrageous that doesn't really seem plausible even though others may actually believe them. It also works as a synonym of ridiculous, as they mean exactly what each other do but there are slight differences...Ridiculous describes a minor fault or flaw while preposterous describes something much worse than ridiculous... Personally I find preposterous very useful in most situations because it describes how absurd an utterance sounds; this gives me plenty of leeway to use it without sounding too clever. In terms of usage I'd go with preposterous over ludicrous if one hears preposterous, then it'll probably bear some immediate negative implication such as nonsensical or farcical, whereas ludicrous merely means silly or light-hearted. The former implies something wrong in itself, while the latter simply points to the absurdity of whatever is being said. Katt: my point about prepostorous isn't that preposterous has been read into it (since it hasn't), my point is that prepostorious suggests status quo, i.e., it's a thing that happens in society now. And since preposterous usually connotes an idea counter to societal normsstatusquo, using it instead would be a way of implying status quo rather than criticizing it. For example, we wouldn't call someone preposterously happy, we might call that person ridiculously happy, but we wouldn't call himher preposterously sad, no matter how hopeless his situation is. In any event, I agree with your usage comments - preposterous should definitely work well here. As a writer myself, i understand why authors want to avoid certain words and phrases. After all, every single word gets filed away automatically by Google search so it becomes increasingly important for writers to craft their own sentences that won't trigger those pesky algorithms. However, sometimes it may become necessary to include these words for audiences who aren't familiar with technical jargon. That's where a good author will step up to the plate and create memorable text that rises above the fray to get noticed.
