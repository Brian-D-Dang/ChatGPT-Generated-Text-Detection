While accuracy is important in historical films, it is not always feasible or necessary for films to match exact historical events. Historical films are often created for entertainment purposes and should not be expected to provide a perfect portrayal of history. Additionally, artistic liberties are often taken to create a more compelling narrative, and outright banning films for not matching exact historical events would limit artistic expression. Instead, viewers should approach historical films with a critical eye and use them as starting points for further research and discussion about the actual events they depict.
