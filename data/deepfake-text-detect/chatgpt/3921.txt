I am a young black male, who is torn between both sides of the aisle regarding race relations in America. I have experience racial profiling and understand that there is much more to it than just looking at a person on their skin tone or ethnicity. My dad has a history with the police which led him into some very dangerous situations where he was treated like an enemy by officers based solely on his wealth. It's hard for me not to be fearful when I see those kind of reactions from the white community but always try my best to remain calm while getting punched in the face by cops because if I say anything different people will call me racist! The only thing I can do now is watch all news channels and read every news article available online about what happened to that cop in Ferguson Missouri yesterday. After watching multiple videos posted on youtube over the last couple days, I've found myself confused as to what exactly happened during this incident and how does the system operate in such cases? How are they able to "hold" you up without calling 911? This seems the most important question... There's no way one person could possibly overpower another. If someone pulls you out of your car how would you attempt to fight them off? Have you ever heard anyone actually get shot by police? In 1996 just 6 blacks were killed by police officers (64 Black Lives Matter). So how in the world do they think that one man had enough power to physically overpower a group of people? Again how can one individual even hurt so many people? How did he know to pull over, shoot several times and then escape? Why didn't the officer try to arrest this guy? What makes him special? Is he a super hero? He doesn't look like any superhero I've seen. Did the officer ask permission first before shooting him? Or did the shooter grab the officer's gun first by accident? You never hear about these things happening to heroes. They take cover behind their shields and hide until the invader retreats. The amount of force used against this guy is beyond ridiculous. As a father of two boys, I've been through similar experiences dealing with questionable situations. However, I believe that the fact that we see our son being taken away in handcuffs may have made me angrier than normal! Just imagine having two small children in the back seat of your car and seeing them getting arrested!! Nowadays it seems like the bad guys always win: kids playing in front of schools, protesters getting arrested... All of these factors seem to suggest that police officers don't really care about the safety of citizens; instead, they're just trying to make a buck. This case reminds us once again why we need laws in place that regulate use of deadly force by law enforcement. We need measures that protect rights, rights must also mean that you cannot kill a citizen unless absolutely necessary. Also, universal background checks should be mandatory, we should have body cameras on all officers (that way they'll realize mistakes and learn) and let's get rid of 'no knock warrants' (so cops won't be allowed to enter homes illegally!). These measures would help combat instances of excessive force and allow citizen accountability. What went wrong here? The most obvious point is that the situation escalated rapidly from witnessing a minor traffic violation to something very serious. How does a kid so little know better than to run from a plainclothes cop?! You wouldn't want to catch a criminal like this would you?! Instead, it appears that the police department got involved and decided to escalate matters using stop sticks and tear gas. The reason I bring this up is because it calls attention to the need for training procedures to come into play here. Police officers should be trained in situations like these - specifically in terms of handling kids. One child shouldn't escalate a crime scene situation that quickly! While I respect their desire to defend themselves, they need to remember that sometimes you need to give in to certain threats. Treating children like criminals will NOT solve society's problems.. At least, not in the long term. We need to start taking steps towards training our officers and teaching them how to handle these types of situations properly. Character building skills are needed too so the officers are equipped with the right tools when faced with difficult circumstances. Wednesday, August 10, 2016 It's crazy to realize that today we live in a time and age where little kids still die because cops aren't trained correctly. This wasn't even supposed to happen! A few weeks ago a 15-year old boy was shot dead by an Illinois State trooper. He was pulled over for smoking marijuana and the officer said that he smelled weed. According to police, the teen complied and tried to walk away from the officer, who then opened fire. Unfortunately, the victim died instantly. It's hard to wrap our heads around the fact that cops are killing unarmed youth. As an African American father of 2 sons, I'm disgusted by the thought of placing innocent innocent lives at risk simply for following rules and regulations.
