Climate change or global warming as it previously was known as is a hot potatoe and not a very clean cut science to predict. There are thousands of climate scientists across the globe with various opinions on how fast, what direction, in which regions this will occur. The whole thing has become politicized over time much like evolution did when people started having different beliefs about where we came from rather than just accepting that God created us all. Well, I think you're probably right. But man made CO2 emissions aren't bad for anybody except those who want to make money off carbon trading schemes.
