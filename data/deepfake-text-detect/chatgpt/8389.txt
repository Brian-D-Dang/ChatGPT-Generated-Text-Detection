Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. I mean if it did get in our way and we had a ship blow up wouldn't you think there would be more than one instance of someone having their craft destroyed by junk? How can some random piece out here not only survive but become an obstacle for many crafts headed into the goldilocks zone??? It seems like every time they tell us how dangerous outer-space actually IS....the solution becomes "just leave" instead being proactive with technologysolutions!!??!?! What gives????
