Just as the title says, I firmly believe that the modern interpretation of the hipster does not truly exist and never has. I'm going to link an article from two years ago, but I think it's still relevant: The article argues that the original concept of the hipster was a countercultural movement that was anti-consumerist and anti-establishment, and that the current mainstream portrayal of hipsters as superficial, trendy, and conformist is a distortion of the original meaning. The article also notes that the mainstream adoption of "hipster" style and cultural signifiers (such as craft beer, fixie bikes, and mustaches) has diluted the meaning of the term to the point where it lacks any real substance. Overall, I think the article raises some interesting points and challenges us to reconsider our assumptions about what it means to be a hipster. While there may still be individuals who identify as hipsters and embody some of the original values and aesthetics associated with the subculture, I agree that the term has become so watered down and overused that it no longer holds any coherent meaning.
