The host country thing has run its course. Organizing the Olympic games is financially ruinous, blatantly wasteful and the procedure favors corrupt regimes willing to put themselves on the map. As a result of this my opinion about hosting other major sporting events or even international conferences in countries with poor human rights record will decline precipitously as well (I would never go there). The arguments that these venues bring jobs are also very misleading if you consider how much money they cost for no gain at all... Think Iran 2012 project - 20 billion spent without any results not counting security costs which might be an order magnitude higher than simply going through US airports nowdays!
