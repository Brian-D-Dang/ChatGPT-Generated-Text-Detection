I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually from families that can afford to pay the high tuition fees, which automatically creates a divide between the wealthy and the less affluent. However, private schools may offer some advantages in terms of smaller class sizes, individual attention, and specialized instruction. They can also provide access to resources like state-of-the-art facilities, technology, and extracurricular activities that may not be available in public schools. Ultimately, whether private school education is beneficial or not depends on the individual student and their unique circumstances.
