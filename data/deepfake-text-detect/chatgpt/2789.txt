First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I have no idea if there is any relationship between privatization in these areas or not so it may be entirely unrelated to the topic at hand. The history of medicine is one of continuous progress since ancient times when Hippocrates was thought to have discovered how illness worked and inaugurated medical theories about the "four causes" - food habitstoxic waste; emotional upset; hereditary factors (though this part has been disputed); environmental pollution. The modern medical profession dates from the Italian renaissance as Tuscan and Florentine aristocrats set up private clinics where they sought cures for their ailments on a pay basis. This kind of practice became more widespread after Louis XIV made France into what some say was the first true modern state with central control over education, economy, and social life. So far we can see that the concept of Western medicine developed independently of scientific development, even though most of its principles came out of chemistry, physics, etc. During the past 150 years science has opened new pathways to understanding disease processes and treatment. Today, virtually all diseases occur due to biochemical reactions within cells. The modern approach emphasizes prevention through immunization against infectious agents like smallpox and polio but also focuses increasingly on dealing directly with chemical imbalances caused by stress hormones such as cortisol and testosterone, which lead to chronic inflammation and heart attacks, respectively. It seems clear then, that medicine will continue to develop along scientific lines - the question being whether those developments will become accessible only to wealthy individuals? Will medication demanding more than 100 per pill keep millions of people around the world suffering without access while pharmaceutical companies profit handsomely off research grants provided by governments? Or could basic drug discoveries potentially reach the developing world via international organizations like the World Health Organization? On to education: With America's emphasis on individualism, will our schools remain free institutions open to everyone regardless of income level? On the other hand, does anyone really believe teachers should earn less than doctors? And now, consider how much potential wealth lies locked away inside university libraries that aren't available at low cost online because universities prefer selling books. There are many potential scenarios, but my point here is simply to suggest that healthcare and education certainly do seem connected. Since the 1970s American higher ed tuition rates have risen steadily to today's levels of nearly 10,000 per year, despite increased government support. As a result, students graduate saddled with debt, limiting society's use of educated young workers. Meanwhile, China is investing heavily in college educations at home and abroad, while Japan is combining higher Ed with business and making greater strides towards opening up opportunities for lower skilled jobs. So why hasn't the same happened in America yet?
