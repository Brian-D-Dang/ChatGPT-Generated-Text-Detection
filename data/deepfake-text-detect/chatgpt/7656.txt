I understand your concerns, but it's important to remember that being a feminist means supporting all individuals who identify as female, regardless of their biological sex or how they express their gender. Just because someone was not born with female anatomy, it does not invalidate their experience or understanding of what it means to be a woman. In fact, trans-women face unique struggles and discrimination that cis-gendered women may not fully understand or experience. As feminists, our goal should be to uplift and unite all women, regardless of their background or identity.
