Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, The New York Times has a piece on the issue that is well thought out and well written. In my opinion, it is something that both the federal and provincial governments should do, and should get done as soon as possible.
