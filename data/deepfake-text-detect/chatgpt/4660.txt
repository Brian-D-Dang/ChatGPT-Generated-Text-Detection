Firstly- I'm a Brit, so if I'm missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies! While having a conversation over the phone about a movie (the name of the filmbook) while my friend was in town, he remarked that it sounded like something out of DC's catalogue. He hit upon Batman and Robin as an example of this sort of thing, which is very true; but also bears noting that both these characters have only been around since The New 52 rebooted the character line back in 2011... So what makes a superhero? How did we come to accept such creative mashups? And who were those people at the time when they came up with them? I've read somewhere where Batman wasn't really considered a superperson by his successors for fear that someone would create their own copycat- so how have so many different versions of superheroes emerged from our comics instead of just one or two main ones? Or are there actually multiple examples of heroes coming into existence and then being coopted immediately afterwards by others? As a brief aside, after doing research on the whole DC Rebirth and Convergence storylines, I don't think the notion of Superman or Wonder Woman becoming tainted due to the use of other property has ever occurred before now. Which leads me to believe that even though mainstream comics may be more "family friendly" than before, anyone can still get away with almost anything legally now.... There must surely be tons of great comic books etc. out there I haven't read yet right?! So please do share any book titles you're particularly fond of, regardless of genre (which if not specified above will obviously include manga). Thankyou. Cheers. P.S I know nothing about Japanese culture, hence why I asked about Japanese creators rather than American creators. Sorry if that last bit was unclear. Thanks again.:) PS2: Just found another interesting snippet while researching this topic! This seems to suggest that a lot of early superheroes had already appeared in pulp magazines before appearing in comics, so perhaps there ended up being dozens of them all jostling for position, eventually creating enough confusion that someone decided to claim ownership of the original source material and start stamping out the competition... Superman creator Joe Shuster reportedly stated "The most important single element in making quality stories is first rate characterization" whereas writer Jerry Siegel said "If you want to put together good fiction, you should never attempt writing without knowing your hero inside out, and vice versa."
