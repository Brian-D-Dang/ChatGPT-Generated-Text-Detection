First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of interviewing Robyn Polster, a local 10-year-old girl who lives in my town. Robyn was a typical kid, and her family was typical as well. Her mom and dad both worked, and her older brother and sister were involved in many after-school activities. Her mom even made homemade apple pie from scratch every Friday night. My first impression of Robyn was that she was a normal kid, and her family seemed like a normal family. The more I got to know Robyn, the more I realized how unusual this was. According to the media, Robyn was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome when she was in the third grade. Since then, doctors have told her that she needs to take medication every day for the rest of her life, and that she will most likely be completely nonverbal. Robyn's parents have informed her school that she may not be able to participate in any after-school activities or sports. Robyn's school district has refused to allow her to participate in any extracurricular activities. She has been put on academic probation, and they are threatening to take away all of her privileges
