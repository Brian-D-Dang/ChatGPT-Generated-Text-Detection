So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training , but first-amendment rights don't stop at the fire department's property lines and there is no doubt in anyone mind how much more effective even one person with some sorta weapon could be than dozens or hundreds people standing around together wo any means to protect themselves." I'm sure you can see where this goes... "Well gee Mr Fire Fighter! If only we had an armorer here every time someone called for help!" One day....;)
