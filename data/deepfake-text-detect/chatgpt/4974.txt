In spite of the imperfections of the USA and Europe, it still remains a truth that pretty much all of the most desirable places in the world are run by people who live their lives perfectly happily. It is hard to believe that when they choose not only to wake up every morning, but also notice no one else awake at night except themselves paying attention: Americans have been taught this is what America and Europe do best for years now despite our ideals of free trade and freedom which make us appear beyond belief; we see our liberties as decreed by God rather than an indulgence for selfishness or greed (i.e., think of the ancient Roman Empire versus the British Empire), and even though we admire the English-style freedoms of our Founding Fathers we cannot avoid these mistakes anymore either because the world has moved on from being the world's greatest country (.pdf). We seem to be losing sight of the fact that young Americans look around them through mirrors - and that there may be many more mirrors out there waiting outside the window where ordinary citizens might enter into life without fear any longer than in America itself - but there seems little evidence that they care enough about mirrors to stop looking upon them with suspicion if someone looks behind them. The idea that we regularly let people overlook the opportunity cost of our own failures instead of overlooking those of others makes sense once the wheels come off the train wreck known as Trumpism - which will certainly destroy entire countries like ours again after Trump wins reelection next month. This is why America must remind ourselves that the most frightening thing Americans can say about Trump - that he stands for nothing except his racist views - is true.
