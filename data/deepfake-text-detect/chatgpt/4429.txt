Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from pee wee through high school). Now that I have graduated college and moved back home with my parents for grad school, it is time for me to find work in one of those jobs where you can be paid by an hourly rate rather than a yearly salary. How would hiring somebody who has played competitive sports affect their interviewing skills? It seems like they may have better hand-eye coordination or something else which could make them more efficient at what they do. My concern comes mostly because I know how competitive people are so even if I don't play I want to try to appear that I am working hard since this job will pay well... I am looking into getting into Physical Therapy but haven't talked about any certifications yet other than PTSA etc.. I also tried being in sales but hated dealing with customers all day long. So now I just need some advice on what I should look for career wise. Any feedbackadvice would help! Thanks, Sean A: First thing's first - congratulations on wanting to go into physical therapy! That decision means you're interested enough in the field to learn stuff and figure out whether you enjoy doing it. Way to start off right there. You'll hear many stories about medical careers being thankless; once upon a time even my father was under the impression it was a "nobody gets rich" profession. He retired early after only two years of practice and did nothing until he got his MD degree. The key difference between him and the vast majority of practice partners I've known at various stages of life is that he had no desire to treat patients. If someone came to see him at 6am in severe pain he'd tell them the problem wasn't his specialty and leave with no sense that anything had been done. After he died many years later I learned why - he assumed when a patient showed up for treatment it meant she wanted to heal and didn't realize her primary care physician had referred her specifically to him. This attitude is pervasive in our society and makes pursuing health professions the worst job choice on Earth outside of maybe teaching English. While happy hours abound after 4pm on Wednesday nights at most clinics it doesn't mean much unless the staff knows how to handle difficult situations without being thrown to the wolves afterwards. In short, it takes a lot of personal interest and attention during training to avoid burnout. Best wishes for your future.
