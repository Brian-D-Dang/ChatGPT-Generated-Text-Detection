First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from a public policy perspective and also as an academic exercise to help me better understand what's going on with cities like Pittsburgh." The study found that people who drove had nearly twice as many destinations within two miles than those traveling by foot or bike (about 4 percent versus 2 percent), received more work-related phone calls while driving compared to those using transit systems such as light rail and buses, were much less likely to report waiting longer in line due to traffic congestion during morning peak hours - about 25 percent vs 90 percent - have higher levels of stress when they arrived at their destination and are more frequently cited for speeding violations. "I think these findings provide evidence that current transportation policies mean we're encouraging users to drive," said Urban Studies professor Julie Paine of Penn State Harrisburg, director of the Institute for Public Policy and Economic Development Research Center based there. "It suggests that our efforts could be directed toward providing alternative modes so it doesn't make sense just to build roads but instead provide options other ways of getting around."
