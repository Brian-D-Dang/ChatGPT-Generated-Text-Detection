WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in the community write with an incredible degree of detail and I've always struggled to be able to do that, so I'm going to try my best to write a detailed post on my progress so far and the things that I've found helpful and frustrating. I started doing ketosislow carbhigh fat diets in 2014 in order to control my type 1 diabetes. I was having very high glucose levels in the morning so I started going to bed with a large dose of insulin to try to control my blood glucose levels overnight. That failed miserably and the next day I had a blood sugar level of 31 mmolL. I started doing some research and I found that the best way to keep my blood sugar levels under control was to do a very low carb diet. I started by doing a ketogenic diet (less than 20g carbohydrates per day) but I quickly felt exhausted and extremely hungry all the time. I started to become extremely irritable and I was having a lot of trouble with my insulin pump. I was having episodes where my blood sugar levels would rise to 20 mmolL or higher. I started to do some research and decided to try out a very low carbhigh fat diet (50g carbohydrates per day). This way of eating is called the "Zone diet" and it is very similar to the Atkins diet (still uses a lot of protein and fats, but eliminates sugar and most carbohydrates). After a few months I was feeling much better and my blood sugar levels were still under control. I was still having trouble with the fact that I was extremely hungry all the time, so I decided to try to eat a bit more carbohydrates and see how my blood sugar levels would respond. For the next few months I was eating a "low carb" diet (100g carbohydrates per day) and I was having trouble with high blood sugar levels and poor insulin management. I found that I felt better when I was eating a very low carb diet. After a few months of struggling, I decided to try to go back to a very low carb diet (50g carbohydrates per day). I was also tracking my carbohydrate intake with the MyFitnessPal app and found that I was getting around 50g carbohydrates per day from my diet. I knew this was not enough and decided that I needed to do a very low carb diet (25g carbohydrates per day). I also started a ketogenic diet in June 2014. I started by doing a very low carb diet (20g carbohydrates per day) and found that I was having a lot of trouble with my blood sugar levels and my insulin pump. I was also feeling really hungry and my blood sugar levels would sometimes be extremely high. After a few months, I decided to try to go back to a very low carb diet (100g carbohydrates per day) and found that I was having a much easier time controlling my blood glucose levels. I have been eating a very low carb diet (100g carbohydrates per day) since June 2014. I have been able to control my blood sugar levels and my insulin pump has also been working much better. I have had a few episodes where my blood sugar levels would be extremely high (20mmolL) but I have not had any episodes where I was extremely high and I did not feel very well. I did have an episode recently where I felt very tired and was having a lot of trouble breathing. My blood sugar levels were also very high, so my doctor put me on a low dose of insulin and I was able to control my blood sugar levels again. When I first started this diet, I was also using a very low dose of insulin (1 unit per 25g of carbohydrates). I was able to control my blood sugar levels with this dose of insulin, but I was having a lot of trouble. I was having a lot of low blood sugar episodes and I would also have
