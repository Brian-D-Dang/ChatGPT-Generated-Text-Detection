First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and if we are going to discuss something, we should at least look into it. I don't know how you feel about your husband. Sounds like he's just trying to settle your daughter down for an arrangement. He wants her to stay with him while she goes through some divorce proceedings. He is really trying to keep his marriage afloat financially so he can buy back his house before she gets married again later on.
