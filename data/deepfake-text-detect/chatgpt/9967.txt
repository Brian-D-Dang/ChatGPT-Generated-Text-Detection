Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if the problem were as bad as I thought it was, it wouldn't be too difficult to deal with. I still believe that the problem is worth considering and addressing, but it may not be as dire a situation as I previously believed. Thanks for the helpful comments so far!
