While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established developers dangerous. My opinion is based mostly on my personal experience as a developer who has been around for about 10 years now - A lot more than many here have by any reasonable measure (I started when it was possible to learn something in an evening or two) but still certainly far from original contributor ranks like those involved with CLRJVM.NET development... And yet even at this relatively young stage people are constantly forgetting what they used up until recently didn't know how much trouble there would be if we took advantage: programming languages don't exist unless someone builds them; all code isn' t equally good nor written equal quality standards without knowing where its coming form). "You only get one chance" doesn " really help me sleep better during nights after reviewing some new guy's crappy attempts . On top-side our respective work ethics can differ vastly too - so please keep these things firmly outta mind before throwing accusations back into faces:D
