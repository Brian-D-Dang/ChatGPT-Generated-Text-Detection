GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job or anything to pay for all of this myself 2. My town is very accepting of gays and 3. everyone here knows me personally 4. The fact that only the straight girls would be allowed in without their date kind of makes it obvious when people are cheating on each other 5. If you're going to cheat anyways why even go? I just really wanna hear your reasoning behind not living by 4
