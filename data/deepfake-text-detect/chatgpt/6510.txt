The first one is about the nature of religion, which is a religious belief, and the second is about the way in which feminism is regarded as a philosophy. The third and last one is about the way in which feminism is seen as a political ideology.

The fifth is about how the Church treats the church, and how that religion has been used to engage in some kind of religious activity. The fourth is about how feminism is viewed in Christianity.
