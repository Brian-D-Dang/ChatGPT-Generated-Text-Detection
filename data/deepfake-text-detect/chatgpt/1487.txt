I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter. My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy to do it - especially if sent a text message or email with instructions andor links pointing them in the right direction... It's also not completely impossible that people might prefer using their existing emails phone numbers instead of creating new ones (e.g., younger voters). I'm just wondering why we haven't thought about this before...
