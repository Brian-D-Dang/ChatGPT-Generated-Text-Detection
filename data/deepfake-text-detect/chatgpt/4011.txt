Hi, I'm new. So the greeks are complaining about the EU's imposed austerity measures, the terms of their countries increasing debt problems, even going as far as to boycott german exports - how does this affect everyone? When a bunch of groups want something they all have to do it together. If you don't like what is being done then join that group and force them into doing what you think should be done.
