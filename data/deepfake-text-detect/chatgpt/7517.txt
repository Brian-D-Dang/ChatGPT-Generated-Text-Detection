While it's true that mandatory paid maternity leave may not be beneficial to women who choose not to have children, the argument fails to consider the broader benefits of such laws. Paid maternity leave helps support women who do choose to have children, ensuring they can take time off after giving birth without financial hardship. This can lead to better physical and mental health outcomes for both mother and child, and ultimately benefit society as a whole by promoting healthy, well-adjusted families. Additionally, while paternity leave is certainly important, the two issues are separate and can be addressed separately, rather than holding one back because the other hasn't yet been addressed. Ultimately, enacting mandatory paid maternity leave is a positive step forward in supporting women and families, even if there are still other important issues to address.
