After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific way. The popular view is that choice only exists within the confines of our own minds, which is why actions are sometimes described as being 'impulsive'. But what about all those people who just seem to have an intuitive understanding for certain things? For example I'm not much of a football (soccer) fan but when watching my brother play each week there's always something new happening on the pitch that I haven't seen before or noticed from another player. It may be small details such as where they stand during kick-offs etc., but regardless these players know more than me; yet we both sit through 90 minutes of matches every weekend. If evolution taught us anything its surely how important observation can be to survival... So does this mean that they're actually 'playing' against themselves somehow? Is their self-awareness limited by them playing with different parts inside their head? I don't think so either, although it would explain why everyone has a distorted perception of reality at times. When you read all those forum posts asking if someone should upgrade a graphics card because they've bought into the hype surrounding one game title then maybe you start to question your perceptions too.
