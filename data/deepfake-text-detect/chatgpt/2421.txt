Before I continue, I would like to start by saying that I am not a pedophile and that I am strongly against the sexual abuse of children. My view is based on my own personal experiences as well research into pedometer studies conducted in recent years which seem to support my views rather than any preconceived beliefs or opinions being held from things people have said about me. I think it's important for parents to be aware what their child will see when they take part in these types of apps because kids are very impressionable at this age. Even if you feel your kid isn't going to understand how an adult can find them sexy (which seems wrong), then just imagine seeing other little girlsboys who may look up to you! In addition there is no real way to control whether someone else could access the account without permission especially with today's internet security issues. If anyone wants to do so, all one has to know is where to search online to garner information concerning specific individuals including pictures of those individual (ren) along with biographical data such as name, birthday etc.. This can easily lead to extortion through blackmailing or even harassment.
