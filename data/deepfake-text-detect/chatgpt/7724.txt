While Michael Scott certainly has his moments of humor, it's important to recognize that his behavior is often inappropriate, offensive, and even harmful to his employees. He frequently makes offensive comments based on race, gender, sexuality, and disability, which would be considered completely unacceptable in a real-life workplace. Additionally, his lack of professionalism and managerial skills often lead to chaotic and unproductive work situations that ultimately negatively impact his employees' work and personal lives. While some may find his antics amusing on a TV show, it's unlikely that most would enjoy working for someone like Michael Scott in reality.
