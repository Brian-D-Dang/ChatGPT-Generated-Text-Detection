While rchangemyview might be a well-moderated community with guidelines for respectful and constructive discourse, it's not the only safe place on Reddit to express any viewpoint and play devil's advocate. There are other subreddits that prioritize respectful discussion and debate, such as rDebateReligion, rNeutralPolitics, and rTrueAskReddit. Additionally, one could argue that the concept of a "safe space" is subjective and varies from person to person. What might be a safe space for one individual may not necessarily be safe for another. It ultimately depends on the individual's own experiences and perspectives.
