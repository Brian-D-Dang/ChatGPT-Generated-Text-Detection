While the cost of college tuition is a valid concern, it should not be the only determining factor in bringing a child into the world. First and foremost, children are a blessing and should not be reduced to a financial burden. Additionally, there are many ways to finance college education such as scholarships, grants, and student loans. Moreover, a child's future success is not solely dependent on a college education but on skills, talents, and passions that they possess. Therefore, it is unfair to limit the potential of a child based on financial constraints.
