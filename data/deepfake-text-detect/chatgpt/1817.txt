Although I'm conflicted about all aspects of Justice, Inc., I would be happy to see [this kid] rot in a cell for decades. Making examples of people like this is the only way we'll ever restore some reasonable values back into society." "We need more kids to speak up," says Kendall Young-Sang Lee, who was raped when she was 14 years old by an adult member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and later sexually assaulted at 15 while attending BYU.
