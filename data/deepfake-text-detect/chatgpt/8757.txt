First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" should be used to describe modern women. I'm not saying all feminists are bad, just some of them. This has nothing to do with feminism being sexist or racist; there's just an extremely large amount of reasons why they're wrong in this case.
