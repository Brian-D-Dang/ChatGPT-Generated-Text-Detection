After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the debate starts up, it is the same two sides, Republicans and Democrats, arguing the same old thing. The gun rights lobby is always against any gun control laws and the video game industry is always against any link between their products and violence. They are the same two sides who were arguing this debate after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. What is missing from this debate are people willing to compromise. People willing to make a deal to reduce gun violence. Senator Chris Murphy, D-Conn., is one of the few people who has tried to reach a compromise on gun control. After the Sandy Hook shooting, Murphy introduced a bill that would prevent anyone on the terror watch list from buying a gun. Murphy's bill has gained bipartisan support and he has been working on a compromise. The deal that has been made is that the government will keep people on the terror watch list off the no-fly list and will alert law enforcement if they attempt to buy a gun. Murphy has also said that the final bill would also prevent people from buying a gun if they are on the terror watch list. Even though the deal has been made, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has not allowed a vote on Murphy's bill. McConnell is a huge advocate of gun rights. A person on the terror watch list can be placed there because they have watched terrorism videos, made statements supporting terrorism or even because of their race. Murphy's bill would not keep a person off the no-fly list if they were not a terrorist. Murphy's bill would also not keep someone on the terror watch list from buying a gun if they were not a terrorist. This is why McConnell is holding up Murphy's bill. McConnell is not the only one blocking this bill. The National Rifle Association has gone so far as to say that no one on the terror watch list should be able to buy a gun. The NRA also has gone so far as to say that a person's name being on the terror watch list is enough for them to be able to buy a gun. The NRA is the most powerful lobby group in the United States. This debate has been going on for a long time, but it has never been resolved. It has been a debate between two parties. The NRA and the gun rights lobby will never compromise. They are set on their way of thinking and will never compromise. The video game industry has also shown that they will never compromise. The video game industry has said many times that there is no link between their products and violence. There is a lot of compromise that could be made to reduce gun violence. The bill that Murphy has proposed is a start. The government should have the right to know if someone on the terror watch list is trying to buy a gun. It is not like the government is going to arrest them for buying a gun. The bill that Murphy has proposed is a compromise that could reduce gun violence. It is a compromise that should be passed. Another compromise that could be made is to limit the number of guns that a person can own. People should not be allowed to own an arsenal of weapons. A person should not be able to buy all the guns that they want. It is not like people who own guns are being attacked by rogue armies. Only the government is big enough to do that. People should only be allowed to own a small number of guns to protect their home and family. The compromise that could be made would be to limit the number of guns a person can own. The biggest compromise that could be made would be for the government to hold off on passing all of these gun control laws. It is not like gun control laws are working right now. Gun control laws have not stopped all of these mass shootings. It is not like the government has been able to reduce gun violence. All of these gun control laws are just getting on the backs of law-abiding gun owners. There should be no gun control laws. All the gun control laws are doing is making criminals out of law-abiding gun owners. Gun control laws are making it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and their families.
