I recently saw a video on why the Republicans [can't win] the 2016 election. If we go by raw numbers, Hillary will most likely win the next election. This got me thinking about the role that demographics and voter turnout play in elections. It's true that the changing demographics of the United States, particularly the increasing number of minority voters, have shifted the political landscape in recent years. However, voter turnout is also a critical factor that can affect the outcome of an election - if young or minority voters do not turn out to vote, their impact will be limited. It will be interesting to see how voter turnout and demographics play out in the 2020 presidential election.
