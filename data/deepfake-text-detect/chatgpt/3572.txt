I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any kind of oppression or coercion preventing individuals from leaving, that would indeed be concerning and unethical. It is important to respect individuals' autonomy and freedom to make their own choices, including end-of-life choices. However, it is also important to address any underlying issues that may be leading individuals to consider leaving the world, such as mental health struggles or lack of support systems. Ultimately, it is a complex issue that requires empathy, compassion, and a commitment to individual autonomy and wellbeing.
