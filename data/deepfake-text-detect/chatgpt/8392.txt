While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to win the nomination. Now lets say Hillary was running against anyone besides Donald Trump; she'd be unstoppable at this point in time! But again let me repeat: If you are already voting for her...why bother? She is going down no matter how much people want or hope otherwise..I know there will always remain that small percentage who still can vote their conscience but don't kid yourself about your own honesty if do so because all decent folks should take action now by siding up beside Jill Stein (my choice) .....and help get our country back from corporate America's grasp out right before its too late...whats done cannot ever really been undone!!! You cant put Humpty Dumpton together after they fall off wall....if we dont stop them falling first!!
