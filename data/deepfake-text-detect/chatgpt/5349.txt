Edit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) This isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a little bit disappointed that they didn't know better lol You are so wrong. There is no lion's paw or lioness in this picture: (Well yeah, I agree with you there...I was just saying he hasn't changed his views on killing predators...just cause more people think we should kill them doesn't mean they're not around anymore:) I am not even sure I have ever seen a lion...and not because of the lionesses stance;)
