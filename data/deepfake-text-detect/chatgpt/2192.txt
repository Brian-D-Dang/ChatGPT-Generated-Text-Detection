One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one, and it might actually lead to less innovation because people would have fewer opportunities for mentorship or collaboration with others who think differently from them (Inglis et al., 2011). The study's results suggest that even when race-conscious admissions policies are in place at top universities, they do not always produce more black students than would otherwise attend college; instead, these programs may simply change which colleges select students based on their racial identity (i.e., many selective schools now recruit using diversity criteria other than SAT scores such as acceptance rates by socioeconomic status; Anderson Chingos, 2000; Schellenberg Voorhies, 2012). This conclusion runs counter to claims made frequently about top institutions like Harvard University: In fact, there has been no increase among undergraduate African Americans attending elite universities since 1978 (Zuckerberg Initiative Data Portal) even though over half of American high school graduates identify themselves as being either white or Asian (Friedman Sullivan, 2015), while 11 identify racially as "other." Even at two Ivy League Universities where blacks comprise only 4 percent of undergraduates - Cornell College and Princeton University - black enrollment remains low relative to the percentage likely recruited under similar standards used elsewhere (Harvard, Yale, Brown University, etc.). The exclusionary practices, therefore, did not end once students were admitted but rather continued throughout their education. Instead, it appears that presences at prestigious schools functioned almost exclusively as networks through which members could advance professionally via personal connections to alumni donors, faculty mentors, administrators, trustees, board members, and fellow students. These networks help prospective graduate students gain admission into doctoral degree granting programs within ivy league universities along with positions upon graduation. Thus, what I argue here challenges well established beliefs regarding access to higher education. It suggests that students enrolled in highly selective colleges often face little discrimination during their time there due to limited accessibility to spaces beyond campus life. Rather, discriminatory attitudes persist outside the university gates preventing black professionals from gaining entry into powerful social circles known to influence careers and research funding later in life (McKenzie Taylor, 2017). Hence if we hope to reduce anti-Black racism, then efforts must focus on eliminating those structural barriers situated far away from campuses across city blocks and neighborhoods both inside urban areas and outlying suburbs. To achieve this goal requires acknowledging the role private actors play shaping inequality in society today and implementing strategies aimed specifically addressing how institutional structures perpetuate systematic marginalization against historically marginalized groups including minorities, women, LGBTQ individuals, disabled persons, religious communities, racialized peoples, immigrantsrefugees, Aboriginal Peoples, new Canadians, incarcerated populations, and residents experiencing homelessness. Doing so will require an approach rooted firmly in equity theory -an effort simultaneously critical yet hopeful seeking solutions grounded in intersectional understandings informed by lived experiences-as opposed to ones influenced solely by utilitarian principles focused primarily on individual outcomes. Equity can inform decision making at any level from local community councils all the way up to federal governments without sacrificing accountability nor autonomy. Taking this step forward acknowledges first and foremost our shared responsibility towards living democracy. As citizens, we cannot afford to assume someone else will take care of everything important to us. We need to show commitment toward building inclusive societies capable of sustaining democratic values especially given examples indicating another world war isn't impossible. And most importantly, we should strive to take back control of our own lives recognizing that each act ultimately affects everyone around us whether intended or unintended. While systems likely exist that support oppression regardless of intentions former President Barack Obama spoke forcefully about America needing to evolve its thinking and stop treating those different from ourselves as somehow separate, as lesser human beings unworthy of empathy or compassion. There needs to be greater understanding between opposing sides of issues that divide us leading to effective dialogue built on mutual respect. More engagement and discussion means having difficult conversations explaining why certain actions matter or don't, listening carefully before responding so you fully comprehend your interlocutor's point of view, encourage conversation by asking questions about things people want changed, make compromises, develop creative ways to build consensus, create forums surrounding common interests, use humor whenever possible because laughter helps ease tension, move past stereotypes held onto long ago, set aside old prejudices and misperceptions, recognize differences aren't necessarily negative, don't allow temporary disagreements become permanent obstacles, cultivate tolerance and fight bigotry wherever found starting locally supporting organizations working tirelessly committed to repairing harm caused by prejudice and promoting equality such as Black Lives Matter Toronto and fighting intolerance everywhere by participating actively in movements demanding justice against hate crimes perpetrated anywhere targeting anyone including Muslims following Quebec City attack or Indigenous rights protecting water protectors from militaristic police forces ignoring treaty agreements at Standing Rock protesting pipeline projects threatening sacred lands.
