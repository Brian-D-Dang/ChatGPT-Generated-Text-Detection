As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They 're fun and well thought out designs that will make people smile as they ride their bikes around town or try on helmets for free - just look at this picture from the front page! And last but not least: these helmets offer much more than just protection against head injuries along with amazing durability specialty construction features such as a handlebar strap - the GPS tracking system keeps track of cyclists who wear them so you know where your bike is parked next time it's raining. The only drawback? They cost 100 each (depending on what brands) which isn't enough money when compared to several hundred dollars worth in helmets. How does that help prevent accidents?!? Since most helmets come with helmets installed by companies like Cyclist Safety Inc., we had no idea how common this would be until we looked up the price tag When we asked Cyclist Safety INC about it during our regular monthly survey visit, the company told us that half the bikes added to its fleet were new models manufactured before the price tags began dipping below 200. That means those bikes have been priced since 2011! We plan on purchasing more bicycles over the coming months if we don't see prices drop another 50 percent off the current sticker price as someone suggested earlier today. If you buy cycling accessories based on price alone, you may regret buying a helmet sooner rather than later. Don't forget to check out our guide to bicycles here.
