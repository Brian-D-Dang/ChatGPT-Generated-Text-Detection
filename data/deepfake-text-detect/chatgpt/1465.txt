So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor heritage? Or am I missing something here One race is inherently better than another when it comes to the human experience. It doesn't matter if you're racist against people with darker skin colors because they are inferior based on appearance or your racist against whites (which don't actually exist) because that's an outdated thought process that hurts both groups equally as humans
