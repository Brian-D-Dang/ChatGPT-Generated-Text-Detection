I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal products either. I only own one pair of shoes (though they are comfy) that have real fur on them because it's just really warm and my feet get cold easily so fur is needed in colder months for me. But what I don't understand about vegetarians who say things like "I can tell you don't consume meat" or "you look healthy!" after looking at pictures of celebrities with their veggie diets isn't this: how does anyone know if these people actually ARE eating meats? I mean, there was even an article floating around yesterday where Zooey Deschanel said she eats chicken nuggets occasionally... doesn't sound all too vegan friendly now does it?! It seems as though some celebs are capable of making up any excuse possible to avoid admitting they're not exactly perfect when it comes to diet and health! On another note: while being vegetarian is awesomely healthier than regular eating habits, it is still difficult sometimes to find good food both inexpensive and convenient. My roommate is from England and every time he tries something new here in America he says stuff like "You Americans really love your cheese!" but in reality we do love our cheese (among many other fatty cheeses), especially since its not nearly used as much overseas; most meals simply don't contain enough fat to make it worth consuming. Therefore dairy is very important to us and adding lots more into foods makes them taste that much better. I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving last week. We went over to spend the day with Brian's family then headed home afterward and ate leftovers until we were sick... which wasn't hard considering everything tasted delicious and there was tons of it. We decided to go to Daytona Beach this past weekend for funsies and go out on Friday night while we were down there. Friday turned out pretty well and we basically got smashed with my brother's friend Chris' cousin Dave and his friends Mike Matt and hung out downtown near like 3 different bars clubs getting wasted before going back to the hotel room at 4am each morning. Saturday we met up later with Chris Dave and walked along the beach till sunset, hung out poolside, drank some cocktails, took loads of photos, watched fireworks, etc. Fun times were had by all! The reason why it was warmer outside than inside the majority of places due to South Florida holding onto heat during the fall season like nobody's business. It was 80 degrees Farenheit on Saturday despite the fact that November 1st should be a chilly 60 degrees. You see, we weren't aware of the temperature change between indoors and outdoors - we figured once the sun started setting, the air would cool down to comfortable levels. So the walk we did required long sleeves and pants yet we were soaked through within minutes without sweating profusely, running around in sweatbands (we couldn't seem to keep hats on!) and trying to stay dry by dancing jumping around in circles huddled together. The humidity was horrible... awful... gross... stifling.... damp... sweaty... hot..... So yeah, we ended up spending most of the evening inside drinking and talking with our goggles pushed way up looking miserable instead of enjoying ourselves and seeing what the city had to offer. On Sunday afternoon we drove down to Miami to meet bPosted by
