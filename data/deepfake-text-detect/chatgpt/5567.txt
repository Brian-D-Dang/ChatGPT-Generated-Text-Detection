Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for a manual in the case of the Prius. Last edited by LS1; 12-21-2012 at 06:02 PM. I just picked up my 2013 Prius Three today. I was in no rush to get the car and since it was 32 degrees outside I waited until today to pick it up. I got the Prius with the Touring and Advanced Technology Packages. I got the car with the 17" wheels and I was originally going to get the 16" wheel option with the Prius. The wheels look great on the Prius and I think they really dress it up. The white paint on the car looks great and really pops against the dark color of the wheels. I got the car with a black interior. The black looks great too. I like how the black interior matches the outside of the car and the wheel. It just looks sporty. I also got the moonroof option on the car and I got the new Prius v rear camera. The rear camera is a bit of a learning curve to use since the screen is mounted on the dash and you have to look down to see the rear view image. I got the moonroof option and I also got the window defogger option. The defogger is great. The rear windshield defogger is much more powerful than the front windshield defogger. It really works well and you can barely see the defogger when the defogger is on. I also got the audio upgrade package on the car. I upgraded from the base audio system to the 6.1" touch screen with the JBL GreenEdge sound system. I really like the sound of the JBL system. It sounds much better than the base audio system. The 6.1" touch screen is much easier to use than the base audio system's 2.2" screen. It has a much better interface and is easier to use. I'm happy with the car so far. I will be keeping the Prius and driving it for a long time. Congratulations on your new Prius! I've been a member here for quite some time. I've seen a lot of Prius's come and go. I think this one is the best looking. The trunk is huge compared to the previous generation. I was also surprised to find how spacious the back seat is. I had an 08 with the 1.8 engine. I ended up selling it due to the poor MPG. I had it for about a year and only got about 46 MPG. The last tank of gas was the worst with 38 MPG. I was ready to move on to something better. I bought a 12 GTI and my MPG there were much better. I got about 45 MPG. I was hoping to get more but this was a surprise. After about a year with the GTI I started looking for another car. I couldn't find anything that could beat the MPG of the Prius. I came across a 2013 Prius that was in really good shape. I was a little hesitant since it was a brand new model. I had never owned a Prius before. I've heard a lot of good things about them. The reviews of the 2013 model were mostly good so I decided to get it. I picked it up today. It has the Advanced Technology Package. I got the 17" wheels and the black color. The black color is really nice. It looks sporty and it looks like a car that I want to drive. I didn't want to go with the white one that has been so popular lately. I like the black one better. I also got the JBL GreenEdge sound system. I've always liked JBL speakers so I was happy to get them. I also got the rear camera and the defogger. The defogger is great. The rear windshield defogger is much more powerful than the front windshield defogger. I'm happy with the car and I think I'll be keeping it for a long time. I just love my Prius! It is the best car that I've ever owned!
