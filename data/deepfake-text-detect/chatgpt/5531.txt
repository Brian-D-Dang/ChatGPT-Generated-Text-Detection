Human sentience (or consciousness, or sapience, or whatever term you like) is an emergent behavior of neurons and their interactions, which can be replicated in non-organic systems, i.e., computers. Thus, when we attempt to define what is human, we are actually defining a pattern. The pattern is not unique, and the pattern is not what defines us as human. We are human because we have that pattern. In other words, we are human because of the set of rules we follow. The rules are not special or magical. They are simply a way of interacting with the environment, which is made up of the same interactions and rules. It is tempting to define the pattern (the set of rules) as the definition of what is human. The pattern is the result of the rules, but the rules do not have to be part of the pattern. Thus, the set of rules (e.g., the human rules) is not the essence of what is human. It is tempting to define the pattern (the set of rules) as the definition of what is human.
