First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" has. So in order to help educate myself on feminism more fully for my own personal benefit (I've already got the best part!) I'm going to translate an article from uladyjeanistrenger. The article addresses some very important points about women's rights. Check this out! Egalitarianism: Language with equal emphasis on both men and women. It aims at equality between all human beings regardless of gender or race - even those who are deemed not worthy by society of any attention whatsoever. An egalitarian society would be one where everyone could freely express their ideas without fear of reprisal; anyone can join and participate in political life as equally as possible. This goal is achieved when women hold positions of power in public service, such as that which carries significant responsibility regarding social welfare. Even if they do so reluctantly, under certain circumstances women will still be expected to participate in debate within the government. Although they may take over and run the show themselves, there should never be a situation where it becomes impossible for them to openly discuss major issues with other politicians and bureaucrats. In addition, women should also be allowed to be professional athletes and executives in the private sector. Feminism: Writing down the same things said here but adding two words...It started as a group that was focused on re-asserting the roles of women themselves first, through political action and then through the courts. Feminists were a vocal minority until a few female characters began appearing in stories like Cinderella and Snow White and became seen as heroes. Then they demanded full representation of women throughout the media including art and literature where the usual representation was limited to males. And now we're mixed up. We lose our arguments because we want to argue when we shouldn't. And we need to stop arguing when we aren't really sure whose side we're losing. This is why feminists work hard every day to become better educated about the facts and why they continue to get involved in politics and activism. People underestimate us.
