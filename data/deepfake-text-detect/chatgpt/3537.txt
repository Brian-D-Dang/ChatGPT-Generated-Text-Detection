This CMV post is partly inspired by this rrelationships [post] I came across earlier today. This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had the opportunity to discuss it with others, so I thought I would start a conversation here. The topic I want to discuss is about the importance of language and communication in relationships. Specifically, I believe that communication skills are a critical component of any successful relationship, romantic or otherwise. To give some context, the post I referenced earlier was about a woman who was frustrated with her boyfriend's lack of communication during a difficult time in her life. She expressed that she felt unsupported and unheard, and that his silence made her feel even more alone. This situation is not uncommon - I think we've all been on one end or the other of communication breakdowns in our relationships. However, the reason I feel so strongly about this topic is because I believe that communication is not just a luxury in relationships, but a necessity. When we are in a relationship - whether it's with a partner, friend, or family member - we are not just sharing physical space, but emotional space as well. We are sharing our thoughts, feelings, and experiences with one another, and the only way to truly understand and support each other is through open, honest, and compassionate communication. On the other hand, when communication breaks down, relationships suffer. Silences can be misinterpreted, assumptions can be made, and resentments can build. When we don't feel heard or understood, we can feel disconnected and even isolated from the people we care about. This can lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and even the end of the relationship altogether. So, I believe that it is important for individuals to take responsibility for their own communication skills, and to actively work on improving them over time. This might involve reading books or articles on the topic, attending communication workshops, or simply being open to feedback from our loved ones. Similarly, when we notice breakdowns in communication with our partners, friends, or family members, it is important to address them head-on, rather than letting them fester and potentially harm the relationship. In summary, I believe that communication is essential to any healthy relationship. By actively working on our communication skills and being open and compassionate in our exchanges, we can build stronger, more fulfilling relationships with the people we care about.
