The argument that there is no moral framework in which it is permissible to eat meat but not to have sex with animals is flawed. Eating meat is an act of sustaining oneself whereas having sex with animals is a violation of their autonomy and consent. According to most moral frameworks, humans have a duty to promote animal welfare and minimize animal suffering. While animal welfare advocates argue that consuming meat and other animal products is consistent with this duty, having sex with animals is not. In fact, in most countries, it is considered animal cruelty and is illegal. Therefore, it is morally justifiable to eat meat as a way of meeting human needs, but it is not morally permissible to engage in sexual acts with nonhuman animals since it involves infringement on animals' rights and is not a necessity for humans.
