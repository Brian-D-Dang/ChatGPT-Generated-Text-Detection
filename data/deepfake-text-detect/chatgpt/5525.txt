So first of I am danish. That means that I follow american politics, much in the same way I follow german politics. Somethings are importent for me and my situation, and somethings are not. I can still appreciate good analysis, and I do. I am also a software engineer, I have written political code in the past, and I will do so again in the future, so I have my own ideas about what a good voting system is. So far I have not been a fan of e.g. Clintons. I am not a huge fan of Trump either. The thing is, that I don't know which one I would vote for. So how do I make a decision? Trump has better ideas in my opinion. But I don't think he will be able to implement them. Clinton is a good candidate, but she has a 17 year long record of failed policies. The thing I don't understand is why people are not comparing the candidates. They should compare their plans, not just the sound bites they have been repeating for months. So I made a list. All the things I want to know about. - How do you protect my family from terrorism? - How do you protect my family from the extreme weather we are going to face in the next 100 years? - How do you protect my family from health issues? - How do you protect my family from crime? - How do you protect my family from overbearing government? - How do you protect my family from a failing education system? - How do you protect my family from a failing healthcare system? - How do you protect my family from a failing government? - How do you protect my family from overbearing taxes? I am a software engineer. I have written political code in the past. So if you think you can run a better platform than the other candidates, feel free to tell me. I am sure I would like to hear what you have to say. I don't need another 1000 soundbites, I need solutions.
