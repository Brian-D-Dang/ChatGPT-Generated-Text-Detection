I am a young black male, who is torn between both sides of the aisle regarding race relations in America. I have experience racial profiling and understand that there is concern about other races being discriminated against by crimes committed against minorities as well," said Kevin Lipscomb, who works for the Federal Law Enforcement Agency. "We need to ask ourselves why are people so concerned with what happens when it comes from our country's African-American communities?" The study found that white Americans tend to be more likely than nonwhite American blacks or Hispanics not to cross racial boundaries toward the white side but less inclined than Hispanic Americans to commit crimes against whites while African Americans have greater chances at committing crimes versus nonwhites. The study also showed that Latinos were twice as likely as Caucasians to face violence against whites whereas Asians had higher rates of violent crime compared to white Americans, despite having different levels of social climate along racial lines which were almost evenly distributed among all groups. "White Americans suffer disproportionately because they live near cities where their criminal justice system treats them like criminals instead of citizens," said Mark Rogers, an assistant professor of Public Affairs Studies at the University of Oklahoma State University. "African Americans struggle economically due to poverty." Rogers added: "Knowledgeable individuals will tell you that racism isn't systematic oppression - lack thereof has been shown over centuries to be unintentional harms caused by human rights abuses such as slavery, segregation, racism, and sexism - but this research contradicts some views that say otherwise. Racism disproportionately affects minority populations of color."
