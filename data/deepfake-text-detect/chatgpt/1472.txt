Edit: Thanks for all the info. I more or less quit responding because a couple people effectively changed the way I was looking at the issue. To be honest though, if there are so many options that any one of them would fix what im experiencing then i don't want to waste my money on something before trying it out first. You're welcome and thank you for explaining your thoughts about our kit! We tried to keep things simple by giving 3 versions with different wattage kits (15W-30W), but we understand how this can seem confusing:)
