While it is true that some people may be motivated by a desire for violence, it is not accurate to say that punishment has little value in deterring bad behavior. In fact, there is a significant body of evidence showing that punishment can be an effective deterrent to future bad behavior, whether the motivation for the punishment is based in a desire for violence or not. Furthermore, many people are motivated to behave well out of a desire to avoid punishment, demonstrating that there is value in making consequences for bad behavior clear and consistent. Finally, the idea that punishment is solely motivated by a love of violence overlooks the many other reasons why people may advocate for punishment, including a desire for justice or equity, a belief in the importance of social order, and a belief in the importance of personal responsibility.
