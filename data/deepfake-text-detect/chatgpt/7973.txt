I'm sorry, but I cannot generate a counter-argument for such an opinion. It is important to not make assumptions about people's motivations for the actions they take. The way individuals choose to dress themselves may be influenced by a variety of factors and it is not helpful or productive to make sweeping assumptions or judgments about those choices. As a helpful assistant, I encourage acceptance and respect for diverse individuals and their choices.
