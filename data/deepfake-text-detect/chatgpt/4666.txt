Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as an entire entity, then it's not bad at all for the attention span-challenged... Are there any other news sites out there that have been doing well with online writing? Does anyone here know of any news sources where the editor actually writes stories about current events instead of simply taking from existing publications like Buzzfeed? I guess my ultimate question is this; why are these websites so popular when their content sucks ass (in general)? I used to read newspapers occasionally but nowadays I don't really follow 'news' anymore. The shit they print just makes me want to throw up. There was one story recently on a UN report which showed how some countries were deliberately fudging data because they needed to keep things quiet or whatever, but all the headlines consisted of either 'UN admits XYZ', or 'ABC says ABC'. Mindless drivel. If someone wants to get something done, send them over to parliament - nothing more effective. The problem no matter what paper is biased towards your party. As long as you believe everything 'they say' or even worse, take it as fact without checking anything yourself you become brainwashed into thinking your own side is always right rather than objectively analyzing issues. How does CNN do it? By constantly talking down Trump's supporters. Whenever Trump gets elected it becomes a huge massive scandal! Meanwhile every time he tries to accomplish something good he receives criticism from Democrats. Just look up Hillary Clinton. She lies her way through campaigns and continues lying after she leaves office. Even though she clearly won last year against trump in many states. It got to be ridiculous by election day and the media tried to convince people that the majority of americans voted for him cause America hates women who aren't virginal (which obviously isn't true) while trump had very little support among female voters. They also try to make everyone think his comments about grabbing pussy are normal everyday language although we've heard it thousands of times before. Its outright manipulation, its never going to change until journalists start telling the truth and stop being fucking liars for agenda pushing political parties. Then maybe they'll finally gain actual credibility again, after a thousand years of trying. Until then just stick to watching Fox News. They do tell the truly unbiased facts but only once in awhile when it comes to reporting politics which happens rarely enough anyway. At least the BBC doesn't lie like FOX usually does. And trust me, its probably much harder getting away from the bullshit bias you find on TV since you're already exposed to it. Overall the best news source is still NPR style radio ever since local stations cut back during this recession and now you hear mostly talk shows and sports. You learn alot listening to sports games especially football since its always entertaining and informative. For example for MLB there are always rumors floating around about players wanting trades etc. Not saying I agree with those decisions 100 but thats what happened with Josh Hamilton so you gotta listen haha. While DVR is dead thanks to streaming services that save recordings so you wont miss anything important. But somehow NFL Network made YouTube obsolete now too lol. No wonder you see less commercials but they need to work hard to advertise on YouTube because everyone knows of Youtube. So overall imo the best way to consume news is via podcasting since its easier to search stuff and timestamp it properly..but i hate those annoying ads associated with podcasts. Another thing about VPNs are great whenever most places shut off internet connections (like Japan). Makes life simpler and safer. For moviesTV shows check IMDB. Mostly reliable reviews. Oftentimes what imdb gives wrong info is totally believable however sometimes they might not give correct information due to copyright reasons such as songs cover versions or visual effects of CGI films. A lot of time they tend to swap the name of sequels and trilogies between each movie depending upon whether its "XII," "VIII," "VII." However despite all this, IMDb will pretty reliably list accurate release dates unlike Wikipedia. Wiki pages generally suck unless it relates to game related topics. Remember wikipedia is primarily written by regular users who dont necessarily have to research same topic thoroughly unlike professional writers. Otherwise, although articles often lack proper context and cite poorly researched entries from encyclopedias, they do provide decent references especially short lived publications. Besides wiki articles are fairly easy to edit and write compared to books were editors are required to maintain consistency throughout multiple editionsreprints. Also remember there might be differing opinions regarding the legitimacy of different authorship changes within particular titles. Regarding reading comprehension. Reading diverse perspectives helps broaden ones view and understanding of reality beyond what mainstream news reports. Thats basically what entertainment journalism, investigative journalism, science technology journalism aims to achieve. Although unfortunately none are perfect in practice since most of us suffer from confirmation biases and fallacies of human nature like overemphasis on non-deceitby public opinion leaders, role play essentially following children's play behaviors.
