First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a negative view point or an anti-social attitude towards others. It's hard to feel positive about what you see on your front page because there are so many people with different experiences than yourself. Fair enough! This place has definitely been through some bad times recently but we're hoping things will improve soon
