Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a different issue. I think that if we say "no" then it's reasonable not point out what you asked about specifically; otherwise there is an implicit bias against answering questions which share some common characteristics with other well-known examples and so don't need their own answers - ie people won't want to answer them since they will be seen as duplicate by those who know already!
