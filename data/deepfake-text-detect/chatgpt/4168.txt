I attribute my agnosticism to this very theory. Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in the universe before the Big Bang, and everything is related by causality. But if you have no prior knowledge of causality, how do you know what exists? The answer is simple: we don't. This gives rise to an interesting philosophical problem about whether the existence of God should be regarded as contingent or non-contingent on the existence of causality. If you are aware of the causal connection between cause and effect (as it stands now), then why would you not regard God as contingent before he existed? Wouldn't "before" imply "before"? If so, isn't "God" just another causeeffect relationship?
