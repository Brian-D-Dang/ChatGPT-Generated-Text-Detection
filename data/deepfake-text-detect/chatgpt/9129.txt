Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news x] , [x] after delivering a speech in which she said that "for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a man sitting on a toilet and having sex with another man was just too much to handle. So he went out, got married, had kids, then went back to Japan." Hilary also says that her father is a surgeon and one day in his work turns into anesthesiologist: And this is what I tell him: "It's going so well. He'll get better. It will be okay. That's our goal as surgeons. Just don't worry - not worry about how many prayers you have left in your soul because we know when it's time for prayers, everybody starts praying. Every prayer counts. And when these prayers are working, you're going to feel good because you can hear them. You're going to feel like you're giving thanks to God."
