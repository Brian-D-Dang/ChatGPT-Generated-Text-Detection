Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as a strong patriot myself and could see that things were starting to get out of control right here in Hungary I started looking for the answers elsewhere, mostly in America where we have freedom of speech where people can speak their minds freely without fear of being thrown into jail or worse. If you are an American who believes there is nothing wrong at all about Islam then keep reading... If not please look away now before your eyes burn off from staring so much!
