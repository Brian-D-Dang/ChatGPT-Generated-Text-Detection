Improv, as an art form, is a medium almost exclusively to be enjoyed live. SNL, while having improvised elements, does not fall in this category because most skits are rehearsed That's correct! Improv is a form of live performance where performers create scenes, characters, and dialogue off the top of their heads without a script or a predetermined outcome. While some shows like SNL have some improvisational elements, they are typically rehearsed and scripted which sets them apart from a traditional improv show where everything is made up on the spot. Improvisation is unique because it relies heavily on the energy and reactions of the audience which can vary from night to night, making each show a unique experience.
