I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural experience. For me it was and still remains an acquired taste like whisky or macaron chocolate (although in my case dieting now stands between those two). Recently there's been one more thing adding on top of all this: watching Charlie Chaplin movies which make people laugh with their feet instead fingers; pointing ones while talking away merrily using hands - something funny comes up again! This just adds another new dimension for Asian cuisine culture when folks get together eating everything above sitting around tables made from banana leaves..
