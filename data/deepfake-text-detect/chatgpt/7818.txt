A valid counter-argument to this opinion could be that there is no substantial scientific evidence to support the existence of God or any extra-dimensional entity responsible for the Big Bang, nor is there any empirical data to suggest that such a being played a role in our existence. The scientific community acknowledges that the concept of "creation" falls beyond the realm of empirical observation and cannot be tested or validated by the scientific method. Additionally, the theory of evolution has been proven using scientific evidence and observations, which provides an alternative explanation for the origins of life on Earth that does not necessarily require the existence of a higher power or entity. Therefore, relying on religious beliefs to explain the origins of the universe and humanity is not a scientifically sound approach.
