First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from an outsider's point-of view and not as someone who might be affected by such a scheme in practice (eg: too many people driving to work). If you are only concerned about mass transit then why can't we just build more railbuses? Why does everyone have cars if they aren;'y using them right now anyway - isn there any sense that our city could actually become walkable without forcing its residents into car dependency over night! That would cost money yes but it seems like one way or another spending will need some consideration when growing outwards again so maybe let us spend on making public transportation better instead?"
