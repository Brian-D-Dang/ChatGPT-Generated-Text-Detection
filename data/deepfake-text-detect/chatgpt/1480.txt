From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on social issues and generally focuses their criticism towards those who they feel do not share their beliefs or values; this type of liberal may be described as being more concerned with "bigotry" than feeling a need for self-defense in order to resolve these conflicts peacefully (Spencerism). The second group argues that individuals should only act when it serves their own interests, rather than acting to fulfill a larger objective; this kind of conservative tends to hold moral absolutes such as morality law and even religious teachings against others.[21] This last category includes many libertarians and radicals within each party, although sometimes individuals will take different stances depending upon whether it benefits them personally.[2223] While there are certainly instances where people use violence under the banner of political ideologies, most cases occur because of frustration that no matter how much they agree socially, some aspects of politics just don't work well together. While individual liberty would likely provide far greater opportunities for everyone involved if all sides were committed to peacefully resolving differences through discussion, the reality is that the conflict between conservatives and liberals has been around since the beginning of time and will continue until either side decides we've had enough, at least locally. Although there exists an opportunity here for some form of compromise instead of war, someone still needs to make concessions on behalf of another before any progress can truly come about.
