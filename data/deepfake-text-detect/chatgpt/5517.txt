I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the "safe space" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao or anyone else who wants it back. I think anyone citing the internet should be scrutinized here because they're idiots and shouldn't be trusting Reddit with their voting decisions (which seems obvious). There are many reasons for this, but blogging about it publicly might help explain why no one believes in it anymore
