I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically it seems like we've got this under control at this point in time where there's no reason to be panicked or anything. My main concern is what happens if something goes wrong while they're operating? How do you go about cleaning up radioactive material that has leaked into surrounding areas? What are some good books on this subject (it would obviously help me understand better)?
