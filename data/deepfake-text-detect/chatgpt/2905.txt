I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry atheists would think. No one's saying you can't practice your religion and no one is forcing you to go against what it says in your "Religion." But you're free to not use lots of public services that are available because of its policies if they don't agree with them. Just like how black churches exist but avoid using city or state funded things for example
