I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to religion and everything else under the sun Then there is another side who says "oh well I don't know why they are so upset about one animal, what's the big deal?....there are starving children in Africa." So let me ask you...why not go out into your local jungle or desert area and help feed those kids? Why do these problems only happen where humans live? Is it some kind of cruel joke on us to kill something we can never be replaced by, if that was possible anyway. It just seems like everyone here wants to keep their lifestyles as normal as possible while ignoring any other atrocities occurring around them, even when maybe they could actually make an impact on things. The problem with taxidermy is how it takes animals away from living and being free creatures...we should leave nature alone, yes even wild nature, rather than taking part in its destruction just for our own pleasure. We need to start caring more, we need to stop thinking so much about ourselves and think about others..like Kenya. If someone has had hisher heart broken over losing a pet perhaps now would be a good time to try to learn tolerance instead of trying to fit back together shattered pieces which will most likely fall apart again. Tolerance does not mean accepting bad behavior but understanding that everyone makes mistakes and can grow from it. There is no such thing as perfect so if we want to work towards becoming better then we must accept this imperfection and try to change ourselves and become better at learning how to forgive and love less harshly. Are feelings hurt easier than having lost pets or counting up every dollar spent in order to save lives elsewhere? Inhumane treatment could occur anywhere including home and office settings but we seem to ignore it here until it happens somewhere close enough to threaten our lifestyle. A friend told me today about her son getting Pokemon cards...another child was playing away from him when he got caught stealing two packs of pokemon cards. Couldn't they teach he child respect and use positive reinforcement? He didn't steal nothing, he needed them for school and said so himself along with several attempts to get the card back but he still stole them and went straight home without telling anyone. This shows how little effort he made to take it back, also showing a lack of empathy or morals on behalf of the person teaching and reinforcing this poor attitude. So who really cares whether lions or street dogs die??? Should everyone sit idly by and pretend life doesn't exist; meaning eat meat freely as long as you are willing to play games, pay taxes, watch movies, buy products and so on? Does cruelty towards non-human beings count for anything? Who knows what happened between man and beast before mankind came to walk upright yet many grievances continue to come about due to ignorance. People forget that we are each unique individuals who deserve freedom and happiness, not subjugation for entertainment or money. Maybe we'd find more compassion for each other if we weren't blinded by greed and power (no offense) In short, whatever gave birth to you needs more loving attention than you are giving right now. You're different than other human beings...don't ever feel ashamed of it!:) We may share 99 of DNA with chimpanzees and monkeys, but the remainder gives us identity as uniquely human.

For those interested in helping reduce suffering worldwide through World Animal Day: Watching lion videos online is easy to understand. However, viewing images of dead lions affects viewers differently than watching video footage. Although we cannot control the emotions of those who see photos of injured wildlife, we hope to provide information about keeping safari photographs private. Photos taken by professional photographers can retain quality and beauty after hours of exposure manipulation simply because photography professionals have experience using tools correctly. These specific techniques allow for creative expression by maintaining image integrity and resulting in valued works. Through our collections, we hope to educate on proper photographic practices for effective conservation. Before bringing a new species into captivity, we already spend a great amount of energy researching optimal conditions, health management, breeding, feeding requirements and personality traits. Specialized zoological facilities include extensive resources and infrastructure devoted exclusively to housing captive animals according to standards designed for their survival. All research data collected during field studies assist with preservation plans. With dedicated staff members trained specifically to manage animal habitats, animals receive necessary protein intake, water sources and veterinary care. Conservation efforts also depend greatly on public education regarding safe handling of exotic animals within local communities. Without behavioral patterns associated with domestication, or similar cultural customs, interventions focused on protecting endangered wildlife populations are often based upon results built.
