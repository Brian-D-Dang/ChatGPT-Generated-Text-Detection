I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at their hands onscreen (or even off screen). I love typing using my phone and tablet because it allows me freedom while working from anywhere but as I spend more time with typists around me, there are some things they do which help me when I'm learning new words or phrases! 1) Learn word abbreviation systems When you're learning a new language like French, German or Spanish for example, your brain will naturally begin to look up any unfamiliar terms its searching for. It'll search by reading then, read next until finally it finds what it needs, so if the term is 'bulls eye' or 'mehrfach' it can find these easily. However, this doesn't happen instantly - it takes quite a long time to get used to doing this yourself and forgetting about it. This means we need an easy way to remind ourselves where our feet should be going before every letterword appears on-screen. Luckily, many modern keyboards offer built-in cheat sheets that can save us a lot of time over the years. They show all possible abbreviations which may appear on a web page or text document, allowing our brain to become accustomed to them quickly, making those first few seconds spent typing much faster. In fact, these cheat sheets exist before we've actually started typing a single line; instead of having to wait several minutes just knowing what weird symbols might come today, these guides will already tell you exactly what letters to press. They give us instant gratification when we hit the right keystroke and leave us free to focus on other matters. To learn if yours does this check if you see one of the following icons: . If not, go ahead and download an app made specifically for this purpose such as Abbreviate Pro here. 2) Know the websites you visit often IME stands for Interactive multimedia environment. A good IME works for multiple languages types and platforms: desktop, laptop, mobile phones, iPads, Android tablets, etc... So obviously, most English learners know that Google Translate exists since 2004 and currently features around 400 million users in 150 countries. But what about Bing Translator? What sites are worth our attention for learning, and why? A good internet browser has lots of default settings including bookmarks, history and favourites which allow us to navigate through hundreds of millions of pages super fast. We don't normally use them though unless we want something specific. For instance, bookmarking 19th century novels isn't usually useful except when you plan to write an essay about them later on. Likewise, keeping track of everything we read online makes less sense than remembering books we wanted to buy and forget afterwards, or articles we meant to research into later. The reason why this becomes important is because when we start writing longer pieces online, we tend to develop bad habits. Typing "this parrot" only reminds us of our friend who taught us about birds and how she was unwell after eating it. By contrast, creating categories within our Kindle library containing titles related to bird watching or avian medicine could prove particularly useful as we'd hopefully remember to add these once, rather than each individual title every time we logged onto Amazon. Equally, putting "goodreads" between two sentences would make it easier to recall later. All this sounds simple enough however none of these behaviours occur automatically and require conscious effort. Therefore, whenever someone asks "what site am i on?," create a list of 10-20 sites we frequent regularly and ask yourself the question: Do I really need to open another tab? Why haven't I visited this site lately? Is it interesting? How recent was last time? You probably have a couple ideas, and being aware of why we were visiting particular URLs helps build stronger connections mentally when we log back into that website. No matter how sophisticated the software becomes in future, remembering the above examples will always remain accurate. For businesses, it's also handy to know which companies we trust - whether customers complain about a company, or negative reviews exist online. Global brands underline this point by providing customer service numbers which state clearly brands are constantly listening. Learning about the services provided is great for finding out what kind of questions we're typically asked or answering the same ones differently depending on products. Having smart defaults installed which avoid questions we won't understand anyway can take away a stressful feeling, especially for impatient individuals who dread asking embarrassing questions. Not understanding why certain options are greyed out is unfortunately common amongst ESL students trying to study abroad during early stages and leads to anxiety. Switching to Google Chrome recently increased my productivity massively. Before Chrome, I struggled with choosing tabs very frequently. Despite having clear labels showing what apps were running, I found myself selecting random ones randomly which wasn't consistent enough - hence, an application introduced many timeshaire-trungaried digits, saysUsing leading business approach current, while designer's biggest, taping idaose
