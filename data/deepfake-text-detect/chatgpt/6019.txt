It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing that is often overlooked is the Chinese culture. Sure, China has an ancient civilization which is second to none, and it has an impressive heritage. But the Chinese culture is still changing today, and it is changing fast. How fast it is changing is largely a function of how quickly the technology is changing. The Chinese culture is malleable, it can be easily changed, and the younger generation is leading this change. In fact, it may be fair to say that the younger generation is the driving force for the change. But what is the driving force behind this change? It is the internet. The Chinese have grown up in the age of the internet, and most of them have grown up using the internet. The internet has become an integral part of their lives. They are the first generation that has grown up with the internet, and they have grown up using it for work, and for play. The internet has become an important part of their lives, and it has completely changed the way they live. The Chinese are also the most internet savvy people in the world. Most of them are using the internet. They are using it to interact, to communicate, to play, to learn, to share. They are using it for everything, and they have already changed it into something useful and important. These people have a deep impact on the Chinese culture and they are the ones that will shape the future Chinese culture. They are the ones who will change the way the Chinese people behave and think. They are the ones who will decide what the Chinese culture will be in the future. The internet has also impacted the Chinese economy, but that is another story.
