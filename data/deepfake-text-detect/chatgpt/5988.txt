I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. I often find myself staring at a mug of black liquid, wondering what it is I am supposed to be drinking and why. I've asked countless people for coffee recommendations, and always end up getting the same generic "cafe au lait" suggestion. Sure, it tastes fine, but it's not quite the experience I'm looking for. So I was intrigued when my friend Matt sent me a link to this guy's blog post about his "coffee adventure." He spent a month trying every kind of coffee from around the world, and he even managed to record a video of himself trying all of them at once. The process of making coffee is an art form. It's about how you drink it, what it is you drink it with, what sort of cup it is in, how you hold the cup, and how you prepare it. It's all these variables in play that make a difference in the taste. This is why I'm looking forward to making my own. I'm not really sure how to make a French press, but I can't wait to figure it out and try it out. Do you have a coffee making routine? What's your favorite coffee brand?
