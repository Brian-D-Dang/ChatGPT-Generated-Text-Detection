In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they are not ready or in the mood can cause serious harm, mainly because it leads sexually active persons to experience physical pain and discomfort. Although there do exist legal protections for women who seek abortions, these protections do not protect from sexual coercion by male partners. Forcing an unwilling partner to engage in unwanted sexual activity itself may violate their bodily autonomy. The law recognizes the right to consent, but only if the other party agrees with the decision (that is, agrees to participate). A woman who seeks an abortion cannot force her partner into having sex against his will; however, he could be forced by the court system or medical professionals to perform an abortion under certain circumstances. Sexual coercion is defined as "unwanted sexual activity." Sexual coercion can occur when both parties consents to sex, yet the initiator does not actually initiate the intercourse and instead uses threats or violence to pressure the 'victim' into performing the act (this typically occurs during an encounter where alcohol or drug use is involved); this form of coercion has been described as "non-consensual rape," though violence alone is not sufficient reason to consider it such. If the subject feels threatened, physically harmed, or "intoxicated" then the consent given would no longer be valid. However, some courts do recognize that the consent might not always be voluntary and infer that the consent was part of the coercive process rather than non-consent - for example, even when a man claims not to have wanted to have sex, women sometimes claim they didn't want to get pregnant despite being aware of their contraceptive options, menstruation being a common side effect of many contraceptives, and that sex can make men feel anxious about childbirth. There is also a wider definition of consenting to sexual behavior: being unaware or unresponsive at all times. When there is a level of intoxication, sexual conduct becomes so inappropriate that it represents a threat to health (as opposed to merely being potentially dangerous), which means any kind of sexual contact should cease immediately. This includes a number of actions - such as kissing or fondling someone without permission - which are considered illegal even if the subject does not intend to perform those acts on purpose or under duress.
