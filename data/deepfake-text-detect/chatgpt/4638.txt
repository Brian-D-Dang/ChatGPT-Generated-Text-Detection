One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one, since it would lack many dimensions and challenges. But diversity can also come at great cost in terms of effort expended on trying to maintain such an environment. There are two ways to create a diversified environment; you could either make sure that certain groups receive more attention than others or ensure that all possible options for interaction between different groups exist (which means both actively recruiting them and passively being exposed to their ideas). The first method has been heavily debated, but with the second there's not much controversy left due to the high heterogeneity created by widespread media access. Policymakers have thus turned to the latter option because they want to incentivize openness without spending too much time or money on outreach efforts aimed specifically towards minority communities. Yet while this might sound good, having everyone present might actually lead to less social progress overall because people will end up repeating old patterns rather than learning from each other. And if we're talking about people who aren't already socially mobile, then even'more exposure' won't do anything. In fact, these policies may well reinforce inequality if: - The same problems remain unaddressed over and over again. - These new opportunities never existed before. - There isn't any support available for anyone else wanting to use those benefits once someone gets something out of them. This is why although I don't necessarily object fundamentally to strategies like affirmative action, I dislike them when applied to individuals that need help getting ahead anyway. For example, students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds should not only get better education resources, scholarships, etc., but also training programs so that after graduation they'll have skills that make work easier. Because, ew...
