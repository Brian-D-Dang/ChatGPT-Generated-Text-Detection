While it is understandable to want to restrict the dissemination of false information, criminalizing all lies published in any medium is ultimately untenable. The existence of laws criminalizing lying would be unfeasible to enforce, and could easily be abused to censor or silence those with dissenting opinions or those that expose truths that some may wish to hide. Additionally, the subjectivity of truth makes it challenging to define what constitutes a lie, further complicating the issue. In a democratic society, it is preferable to prioritize educating citizens about critical thinking and fostering a vigilant press to combat misinformation, rather than relying on heavy-handed laws that have great potential for authoritarianism.
