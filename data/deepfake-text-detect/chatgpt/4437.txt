To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, it's now a crime to "fornicate with your own brother or sister in law." If we were arguing about whether or not to outlaw murder, this is an argument that might be used by those who want certain forms of prostitution legalized (which could include sexual acts between humans outside of wedlock). Of course, one may go further down the rabbit hole than this - if polygamy was legalized, then incest would be legal without being considered immoral. However, there seems to be a certain type of person out there who feels they can simply declare something illegal because their morals say so; they also feel free to change said laws as though nothing else has happened since 1982, which isn't exactly true either. In short, just because someone wants to legalize something doesn't mean that you should do likewise. Accordingly, incest is definitely unacceptable behavior regardless of what anyone thinks about its morality. Take for instance this bill proposed on C-377 whereby an individual would be able to petition hisher parents for permission to marry whomever she wished. The bill proposes that both sets of consent must come from within the family unit before granting such a request legally binding. This is not only absurd but dangerous too. Both adults need to agree for these marriages to take place. So why does it suddenly become okay when it comes to gay and lesbian couples? It's simply wrong to treat homosexuals differently, especially considering the fact that everyone agrees that gays and lesbians enjoy all the rights afforded to heterosexual males and females. These bills will serve no purpose other than to embolden bigots who wish to persecute and marginalize them. There is even less justification for legalizing pedophilia however. Pedophiles engage in sexual activity long after adulthood is reached and they don't always manage to keep their victims underaged children safe. When I hear people talk about how much they love kids, I often wonder where they get off feeling this way knowing full well what kind of damage they do. Yes, some women and men may seek affection through sexuality at an early age. But unless he or she is actually physically harming another child, it's still abuse. Such matters aren't open to debate. Any efforts taken towards preventing these types of relationships are aimed more at protecting innocent children rather than making room for naive adults who think that their younger counterparts will forever remain unharmed. As for those families who adopt, these children grow up into psychologically healthy youths and begin having sex around the time they reach puberty anyway. Adoption shouldn't be looked upon as a cure for unwanted parenthood and neither should incest be allowed. On top of everything else, adoption costs money...money that could be better spent on things like food stamps, health care and education. With so many young girls and boys stuck in foster homes unable to live a normal life, should our tax dollars really be given over to help raise a bunch of children whose parents didn't bother raising them properly in the first place? Furthermore, most American jurisdictions already ban bestiality...what makes us different? I mean, let's face it - there's nothing sacred about human sexuality anymore. Hell! Homosexuals today resemble biblical figures far more closely than straight folk ever did back during Christ's day. We're supposed to be modeling ourselves after Him of all people?! What He'd think of us today is anybody's guess. Putting aside literal idolatry, just consider that the Bible clearly states that homosexual acts are sinful no matter what context they occur in. At least the church understood this back then. That's part of the reason why Jesus had to die. Nowadays, one can find churches and ministers willing to condone any behaviour as morally good. No questions asked. Their messages of tolerance have gone utterly unchecked for decades now. How long until "Jesus loves gays" becomes mainstream Christianity? Allowing incest and pedophelia while banning gay unions smacks of hypocrisy. There is absolutely no sense in attempting to justify such contradictory policies in order to make themselves appear reasonable it's right for me! or to further divide society along lines of gender. Surely, we've grown past trying to rationalise away our irrational prejudices enough to focus instead on living harmoniously together. After all, legislation based on logic alone is completely contrary to natural law and thus cannot exist. And yet, here we are again debating the existence of a God. Just try telling me that His moral standards haven't changed throughout history! Once we concede logical consistency of God's word, we automatically validate the legitimacy of His intent. This is no small achievement indeed! However, once we acknowledge His authority over mankind, we are obliged to follow His directives lest we risk being condemned as evil sinners ourselves. Human beings owe God nothing, nor vice versa according to Romans 1. Having children of one's own ties of special cases of all sorts of rare casecase2
