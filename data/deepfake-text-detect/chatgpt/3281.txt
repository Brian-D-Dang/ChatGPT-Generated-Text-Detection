So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training Yes, volunteer firefighters receive extensive training and are qualified to respond to emergency situations. While it may seem strange to rely on volunteers for such an important task, many small towns and rural areas simply cannot afford to hire a full-time professional fire department. Volunteer firefighters often have other full-time jobs while also serving their community, and their dedication and sacrifice should be commended. Additionally, many professional firefighters began their careers as volunteer firefighters and gained valuable experience and training that allowed them to transition to full-time positions.
