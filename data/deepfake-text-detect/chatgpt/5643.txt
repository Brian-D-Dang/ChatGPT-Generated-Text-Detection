I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too stark. For those of you who have never lived in a village, I'll tell you a bit about my experience. You have to walk everywhere. There's no bus service. There's one shop in the village, and that sells a limited selection of food and drink. The nearest town is 5 miles away, and that's the only place where you can get anything else. There's no internet, which makes things like looking up information for uni and completing my work quite difficult. Even my mobile internet can't get a good connection unless I'm at the shop, and that's hardly a practical solution. There's no electricity. I have to go to the shop to charge my phone. I have to go to the shop for internet access, too, unless I'm able to walk back home at night and use their wifi. There's no public transport. I have to pay for taxis or walk to the shop, which is a 15 minute walk away. There's no medical service. If I'm sick I have to go to the doctor in the town. If I'm hurt, I have to go to the hospital in the town. There's no social life. The people in the village are so few and far between that I can't really make friends here. There's only about 300 people in the village, and they're all spread out over half a mile. I have the same neighbours that I've had since I got here, but no one else. It's small, old, and boring. The houses are all the same, with a mixture of Victorian and Georgian houses. There are no new buildings. The streets are small and winding. It's old, and there's nowhere for me to live, so I'm stuck in a home that's too small. People are so paranoid here. People will ask you why you live here. If you're a student, they'll ask if you want drugs, and if you're a girl, they'll ask if you're here alone and looking for a one night stand. I don't have a car, but I don't know anyone who does. I love the countryside, but I just can't understand how it's appealing to anyone. I'm so glad I'm leaving. I can't wait to go back to a city.
