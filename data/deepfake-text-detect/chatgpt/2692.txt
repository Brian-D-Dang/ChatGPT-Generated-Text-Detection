Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than some other place, which isn't true either. It's not like nationalism means someone thinks their country is better than others. It just means being proud of your own culture and heritage as opposed to adopting another one. There's nothing wrong with it unless you let it go too far where you're trying to force everyone else into sharing those values or acting on hate towards minorities because "muh heritage"
