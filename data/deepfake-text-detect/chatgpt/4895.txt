To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific benefit for us from eating them (like vitamin D or iron). We know that continuing to eat meat is bad for our healthand thus it's not really up for debate whether you think I'm wrong about this or right: the fact that humans are failing at their own self-interest in abstaining is proof positive that they never should have begun doing so in the first place.[1] (Fn1) {ref-type"fn But what if there were some reason to believe that killing would be worse than letting live? What if there was something genuinely unique about death itself such that it should justifiably cause more distress than life? In other words, what if not only did we fail as moral agents when it comes to treating others like ourselves with equal concern under all circumstance, but also when considering how we treat those who do not possess the same cognitive capacities as we, namely nonhuman beings; i.e., if we could rationally see that humane treatment wouldn't yield any real benefits? Now admittedly these two claims appear contradictory because they suggest that killing isn't necessarily any worse than keeping alive, which contradicts the assumption that one ought not kill unless absolutely necessary. But even though killing doesn't always lead to worse results than not killing, the world might still contain cases where killing is actually better than allowing its subject to suffer. And by 'better', I mean that considerations of harming oneself are outweighed by concluding that death is objectively preferable to continued torment. This argument requires special attention because as most people recognize, there aren't many situations where taking away someone else's pain does anything good for either party. Thus, while my goal here may sound extreme, it shouldn't come across as controversial, since objectivist thinkers generally concede that torture is immoral whenever possible, including on grounds that, within certain limits, the cost of suffering outweighs the value derived from torturing another person CR5. Indeed, much of contemporary discourse around debates over capital punishment argues this very point, claiming that systematically denying another individual the means to avoid punishment is deeply problematic CR2], [CR18. The issue arises particularly saliently in discussions surrounding euthanasia among both medical professionals and laypersons alike. Many people recognize that end-of-life care often involves forcing patients into painful and prolonged states of agony until they die simply out of selfish needs and desires, rather than truly being beneficial to their overall state of mental wellness CR8. Yet, although euthanasia advocates claim that ending one's life yields greater benefits to the patient compared to merely prolonging hisher current existence, perhaps surprisingly few individuals find this conclusion convincing enough to support actual legalizations schemes in the Western World. So then how important is it for everyone to consider whether they'd prefer to go through dying according to will instead of already having made peace with one's impending fate? Given the prevalence of eschatological beliefs and centrality of religion in our society today, the philosopher Harry Frankfurt has argued convincingly in his book "The Reasons of Love" (2004) that we can attribute agency to God and conclude with confidence that he values sentient creatures equally without violating divine freedom or justice CR6. Although Frankfurt gestures towards the possibility that there exists a Creator who set forth laws regarding morals and ethics beforehand, he seems to take it for granted that humans share similar epistemic access to the mind of God and don't need to worry about conflicting commitments between different religions. Other philosophers argue that subjective interests are likely irrelevant in the case of personal reasons involving morality, especially given that those directly responsible for maintaining one's welfare are the ones acting upon their supposed preferences. For example, Derek Parfit thinks intertemporal utility maximization explains our universal altruism toward future generations, arguing that when we evaluate actions based on long term consequences versus short term gain, we typically choose outcomes that maximize total happiness regardless of individual concerns CR17. Similarly, Peter Singer contends that the conscious experience of pleasure or displeasure is essentially tied up with maximizing overall wellbeing. Since paying taxes helps ensure that public goods are maintained in developed nations, anyone concerned about inequality would naturally endorse taxation programs over selfish attempts to maximize wealth or net worth alone. After all, if one never considers that giving money to charity or government funding schools makes sense only if education promotes general satisfaction amongst individuals, then one must logically admit that acts like tax avoidance corrupt the market economy insofar as it causes significant harm to others by depriving governments resources to help regulate unemployment rates or fund pension plans that keep working class citizens off the street during retirement age. Hence, rejecting exploitation and supporting redistribution policies appears justifiable by utilitarian standards even apart from questions about intrinsic motivation. Once again, however, none of these arguments against exploiting individualistic incentives stand in opposition to notions of objective value underlying common ethical theories, nor do they forbid practitioners from a field resembling the worst marketing strategy introducing potential customers to assocookingsession'valuejudge!
