Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions at its core, seeking to promote equality, challenge discrimination and advocate for marginalized groups. However, I understand that there are some extreme elements within the movement that can be divisive and counterproductive, and it's important to try to engage in open and respectful dialogue with others who may have different perspectives. Ultimately, I believe that empathy, respect and understanding are key to building a more just and equitable society for all.
