I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing , but the retailer makes more money in commissions and mark-ups because he has managed successfully fooled you into thinking that this deal was really worth doing at all! Well I've been looking for an affordable high quality web host with good service support from companies like GoDaddy or HostGator since many years now - so far my best experience (so fare) have come about when using Arvixe hosting packages on shared servers (s). They offer unlimited space,unlimited bandwidth include free domain name registration among their plans. What's even better they also provide 247 customer care via live chat which take only few minutes before any major problem could be resolved! While i'm not affiliated by them nor receiving some sort o compensation whatsoever..all reviews expressed here are purely based upon personal experiences made over time while trying out different hosts services during last 10years!. As every thing else...there r always exceptions...you might end up luckier if u find one who doesn't follow common practices talked abt below.. Good Luck!!
