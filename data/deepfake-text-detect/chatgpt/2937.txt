Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of watching people's reactions to it (like "oh ick! when they find out I usually don't say anything unless asked about it directly by a stranger or friend that knows me well enough that I can be honest with them. Same here. My mother is very against vaccines because she says they cause autism but I've actually done some reading up on it recently so now i know what facts there really aren't much evidence for that claim.
