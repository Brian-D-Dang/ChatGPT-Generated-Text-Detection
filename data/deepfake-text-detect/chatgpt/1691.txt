I spend my summer as a representative of the college I attend and interact regularly with kids between the ages of 10 and 18. In these interactions, I have noticed that there is an unusual set of behaviors taking place by some students at Delta College this year," said Derek Thompson '11 in his submission for a "Student Voices" essay contest sponsored by The Alumnus Newspaper Association's Student Section. Thompson hopes to shed light on what he says are troubling student behavior patterns including excessive drinking during class time andor behavior related to alcohol use disorder and substance abuse prevention education classes required for anyone who wishes to transfer from Delta College into a four-year school. The August issue of The Alumni News will feature student essays submitted about their experiences living away from home.
