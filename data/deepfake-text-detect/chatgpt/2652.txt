Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, would you think this is a bad thing? I don't say the writers are right but what they're saying makes sense if one assumes people learning from others will be prone to mimic them and not develop their own ideas since no one wants to copy anyone else in order for that person's ideas to remain unique. Also, people can come up with great ideas even when copying anothers work so long as there was some original thought involved in how to use it.
