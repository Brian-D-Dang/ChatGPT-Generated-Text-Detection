Hello, I'm Luke and for the longest time a small dream of mine has been to move to a Scandinavian country such as Norway, Sweden, or Denmark. From what I've read online they seem like great places for those who want to live in peace but also an interesting place if you enjoy exploring nature with your friendsfamily (snowboarding). I have no family that lives near me currently so any advice on how best to meet people would be greatly appreciated!
