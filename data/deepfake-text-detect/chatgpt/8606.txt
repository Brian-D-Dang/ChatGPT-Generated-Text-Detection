First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and they have been used for an enormous number of purposes to justify their existence - most notably in the pursuit of profits in our society. I don't believe that "legalization" is a solution to this problem. As far as I know, only about 40 or so of the criminals involved in violent crime go to jail every day. It's just another reason why we need to be vigilant against such evil. If you're going to get caught with a knife on your arm, get a restraining order. That's not enough. I think this whole situation isn't really about who gets dumped into the sewers - it's about what happens when they do other things like commit suicide and murder themselves. That being said, I'm not entirely sure how the law enforcement agencies deal with the actual offenders. As long as it doesn't involve kids getting killed in the street and they kill themselves first, I'll say no to them either. They should be treated as if they're bought-in and given by someone else at the request of some sort. And now, since the issue is not whether and when you can get out of jail if you're caught with a knife, then maybe having people starve might make sense to me? But no, it won't work for me unless there are alternatives. As for killing yourself, I would suggest that one way or another you could kill yourself via suicide if society forbids it. Our society allows the death penalty because it prevents us from committing terrorism and other heinous acts which would result in more deaths... It's a tremendous danger to society. If something good were to happen to me, I'd probably just take the pain, but honestly, killing myself would put my life above everything else. Maybe you shouldn't have done that! You really need to confront your enemy first, rather than thinking about your own problems. Here's the thing about the 'drug war' though: I do agree that germs and crime are sometimes connected. However, the authorities should want to deter potential terrorists who may wish to target those who are already there - no matter how much money was spent in keeping them away! I certainly wouldn't let terrorists use my body in any way; however, this is very different from current attempts to try and keep everyone safe. Now that we've got the killer on the loose, perhaps the government should revisit its project for psychoanalysis. This is also true for drugs, too. The police are immune to any responsibility whatsoever. We're talking about real criminals here. In their mind, they're aware of their rights under the law and legally obliged to act upon them if someone has committed a crime. If they kill themselves before they die, surely they must be bloodthirsty killers? Or did they just kind of spontaneously kill himselfherself? Or maybe trying to stop a crime is a means to fight back against terrorism, etc.? That does sound right. Maybe the problem is not with the penalties but with things like the killings. Perhaps it's not just that they aren't law abiding citizens, but that they are taking advantage of our laws - and I think it makes financial sense to pay up endangering innocent lives. So out of curiosity, do you think that the government will just give in to these kinds of illegal activities without legal recourse against them? I hope so. There is literally nothing wrong with people doing what they are told, they just choose to murder others instead of trying to help themselves. You see, if you are going to kill somebody, you oughtn't make them look bad. At least this way it ends under certain conditions. There are still several places where the criminal intent would be considered malicious, and businesses which hire the murderers may have to pay taxes on the proceeds. This seems to be standard practice in the USA. Amendment 1: Do not allow the use of the word "terrorism." How do we define terrorist? Terrorists have established a vast network of networks of al Qaeda members, and many of them have connections to militant groups. When you talk about terrorism, people who have links to al Qaeda say, "Terrorism is inherently dangerous." Not true. What terrorists do is carry out attacks that lead to terror attacks or leave them vulnerable to attack. It is absurd to assume that the desire to harm others implies that this should be their property. But what exactly can they do to protect themselves? Are they going to shoot each other up, punch each other in the face, and throw their weapons directly into the air? Is it a strategy, or is it a social construct? Who knows what kind of politics there may be in American societies. If at all possible, why isn't the president sanctioning some kind of action that would require repercussions, like the banning of alcohol sales the anything though absolutely over the...
