Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on that later). However, even though I am quite liberal in my views, I have grown to dislike the administration's foreign policy towards Israel. In addition to the violence against Palestinians during the 1967 Middle East War, I also feel it is very important that we continue to take care of one another as human beings - but also at the same time respect each other's personal space, which takes into consideration the rights of others. Is there anything that I can do to improve this situation? The 'Israeli' attitude towards Muslim Israelis has developed over the years. In fact, in 2009, when I was discussing with Kain about this issue with him, he revealed that so far only 4 of Jews identify with Israel as their country. This is astounding! Surely Europeans are not taking a back seat to this growing sentiment and will soon learn that many Israelis are deeply religious - whether Muslims or Christians! And what about those who support the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories? Then again, this may be a Netanyahu act because so far he does not appear to understand how Muslims hold views like these: "Just before the end of the war in 1973, they dominated the press and media," said a source close to the Israeli government of Ariel Sharon after the fall of Tel Aviv, shortly before his death from brain cancer, After the end of the war, from , the United States began bombing Gaza. "They were now occupying Gaza," said an American official, referring to the Palestinians. "But it was never enough." When America bombed Hamas in 1979, Israel captured 75 percent of the city. It took another six years to get the Gaza Strip under control. The same year, in 1993, United Nations inspectors declared that Hamas had destroyed its territory, including Jerusalem, giving it a total of 1,000 square kilometres of land. In 1994, after the end of World War II, the United States launched a campaign against Hamas, claiming they controlled "60,000 square kilometers of territory." They claimed that only 14 percent of total territory was occupied by Hamas. Yet according to the Geneva Conventions, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs assigned the responsibility for the destruction of both areas to the United Nations, not to Israel. According to US officials, the UNOAC had no jurisdiction over Israel's claims. Even though the United States commanded the majority of the Israeli army, the anti-Hamas forces continued to roam through Gaza. It should be noted that the conflict between Hamas and Israel began almost twenty years before Israel's Holocaust crimes against humanity. There has been nothing more than a minor skirmish on the outskirts of Jerusalem between an increasingly Israel-based militant group and an Islamist movement called Hamas. The latest hostilities started in June 2012 when the Israeli military killed hundreds of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, including civilians. On October 22 last year, Israeli troops ambushed and burned the attackers in the town of Al-Asad, killing 24 people. On November 10, only four months earlier, Israeli forces invaded the Golan Heights, the Magen Ben Gurion National Park, leaving at least two dead. The Israeli military claims that the attacks were carried out by unknown militants. These allegations clearly didn't help the Palestinian cause. The general public doesn't seem to agree with Israel's claim either. Israel refuses to review any of its decisions concerning Palestine. At the beginning of September 2014, it announced that it had established a commission of inquiry within the Government of Israel to look into the ongoing development of Arab settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But even if the commission reviews the final decision of the government, it will still remain neutral. Following the announcement on August 21, 2016, Israel declared that it cannot accept Palestinian settlement sites south of Haifa; at the same time, it was determined that Israel must study the possibility of building settlements outside Arab cities. At the beginning of March 2017, the Jerusalem High Court ruled that Israel had violated its legal obligations and ordered the establishment of an independent agency responsible for investigating such settlements. No further action was taken until June 2018.
