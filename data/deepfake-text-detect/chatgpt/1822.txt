For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system in which the state controls or owns all of the means of production and distribution (i.e., de facto socialism). The two are not identical, but they are very similar concepts that could be used interchangeably to describe different approaches for achieving greater efficiencies through less government intervention in our lives relative to those produced by more central planning. But what if things were even worse? What if there was no such thing as capitalism at all - only socialist-communist and totalitarian systems where the ends justify any means necessary to achieve them? It's true that each country has their own version of these versions of communismsocialism; we call it democracy here in America. But do you really think that just because people have been called "democratic" countries for so long that it automatically makes them credible organisations? Or does anyone actually believe some politician who promises everything from free healthcare to free college tuition will ever deliver on his or her entire platform without first abandoning critical components of said platforms under pressure from powerful interest groups within the political establishment looking out for themselves? If we're being honest about ourselves, most normal citizens would probably rather see both parties start over again than trade one set of corrupt politicians for another pair of corrupt ones. And then when looking back down the line of history to see how much damage each party caused while claiming to represent us, it becomes clear why. They've always had an agenda, whether it meant following usual capitalist norms or using various forms of authoritarian governance like fascism, communist dictatorships, etc. to get what looked like 'the people' what they wanted. For instance: Democratic leaders recently tried concealing the fact they paid little attention during their time in power to COVID-19 last year until after they'd already began destroying any semblance of public support they once enjoyed before the pandemic hit due mostly to an incompetent and fragile leadership class trying to preserve its own privileged positions instead of adhering to sound science. By doing so, Democrats ensured millions died unnecessarily amidst a crisis driven largely by something outside of their control despite months upon months of warnings they should take stronger measures against. In other words...they didn't give a shit. Not surprising given the track record. But Democrat leadership now wants Americans to believe otherwise via vaccine mandates and lockdowns anyway. This may be shocking news to many Republicans, myself included, but this is exactly what happened hundreds of years ago under Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin during the reigns of the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany respectively. Even though Communism failed miserably as a peaceful form of government thousands of times throughout human history (see China), Marxist philosophies carried forward into areas of law enforcement, economics, education, health care, politics, religion, art, literature, and culture found around the world today regardless of whether the governments still exist or have changed names several times since the end times. Perhaps ironically, democratic leaders often seem reluctant towards taking strong actions regarding coronavirus restrictions despite overwhelming evidence pointing to it being not only preventable but also curable through vaccination alone behind closed doors. As much screeds can be written about the failings American policymakers have shown in recent decades through economic policies, wars abroad, social justice causes, foreign policy decisions, immigration reform proposals, and far too many others to list here - none compare to Democratic Party officials continuing to cling onto communismsocialism ideologies directly responsible for deaths worldwide despite having every opportunity to learn from past mistakes. True horrors of 1984? Yes please! Here's hoping NeverTrumpers remember this leading up to 2024.
