before you guys bombard me with downvotes I would simply like to point out that I am not saying this is true. I am just expressing my conditional views that are based upon feelings. Well, you're right that we should all be careful about our own opinions or rather how we live as a society... But it strikes me as hypocritical and childish if someone actually thinks they have the power to control us for being who we want them to be.
