From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have it coming. But he was an interesting figure in America and deserves to be remembered for his contributions - even if they were all negative: Lee's surrender at Appomattox; Jackson being killed by friendly fire while leading yet another doomed army against superior forces during The Seven Days Battles; Sherman burning Atlanta with civilians still left inside...etc etc..
