First lets make a couple of things clear: I do not necessarily believe that government spying on its own citizens is ok, and thats not what this post is about. the issue is how the government spies on its own citizens without our knowledge. I do not believe that it is ok for government to be spying on us without our knowledge, and thats not the point of my post. What i do believe is right is the fact that the NSA spies on its own citizens collecting a lot of data from the governments partners, and if you believe that the government is ok with mass spying on citizens, and spying on it own citizens. Thats the point of my post. And this is an example of how that spying is done, and not just by the government spying on us. Just as a side note i am not saying that government spying on its own citizens is ok, but when government does spy on its citizens a great way to view it.
