View changed by a combination of the comments of uceleritas365 and uQwerkss: I guess we all understand numbers differently, but ultimately I think it really is lack of empathy more than anything else. A few years ago, I was a member of a forums of people who lived in a city where a lot of crime was committed. I often lived in fear of being the next victim of crime and it was heartbreaking to see the same thing happening over and over again. Some of us spoke to police about our fears and were told to expect the same level of crime to continue. My fear was that, in the police force's eyes, we were viewed as victims; the ones who needed protection. This was in complete contrast to my own view, which was that the victims were the people who were being robbed, assaulted, raped etc. It was never us that needed protection, but the victims. And this was the reality of the police force, who would be rushing to the scene of a crime, but instead of apprehending the perpetrator, were more likely to apprehend the victim, who would be hauled off to the police station for interrogation. The police were in complete denial of the fact that victims were being targeted. We were told that, since we didn't live in the "bad area," we were safe; we had nothing to fear. And if we were burgled, it was because we left our doors open; we were careless. We were therefore not entitled to any sympathy. I don't think it matters what you see as being the reality; whether you see a selfish, thoughtless person or a victim of circumstances, the bottom line is that they are going to be in a worse place emotionally and mentally. This is why I think it is important to treat people with empathy, regardless of how you feel about their actions. I don't think it is only possible to be empathetic if you agree with someone's actions. Being empathetic should be the goal of all decent human beings. Regardless of whether someone is a narcissist or a victim, they are still human beings. I think that one way to explain a narcissist's behavior is to see them as people who live in fear of ever being the victim of their own actions. It's a fear they've never outgrown. The fear of being judged and criticized by their peers. The fear of being humiliated or looking foolish in front of other people. The fear of appearing weak. The fear of being seen as a failure. I guess the fear of being alone. The fear of being unloved. The fear of being abandoned. And this fear is so strong that they will go to any lengths to try to avoid it. They will put themselves in the situation that they fear most, even though it will only make things worse. They will do things that will hurt themselves, even though this is likely to hurt others too. Because it's worth it, if it means not having to face the reality of their actions. This is why narcissists are so manipulative. They will do anything to ensure that they don't have to face the consequences of their actions. The longer they can stay in denial, the better. This is why they will do anything to try to control the lives of others; to try to make sure that their victims will not be able to expose their behavior, because they are too afraid to do so. The more they can convince people that they are "normal" and have no problem, the better. Because the alternative to this is to face up to their own actions and to accept the consequences of them. It is unthinkable for a narcissist to do this. It is too much for them to face. Which is why they are so afraid of being alone, because they know that this is a situation they will never be able to escape from. They have no choice but to face up to the consequences of their actions. To be confronted with the reality of their lives, when it is too much for them to handle. If they can avoid it, they will do everything in their power to do so. And they will use any means possible to try to prevent anyone from finding out how bad things are. Including people who are close to them. Including people who are supposed to love them. People who are supposed to be empathetic. People who are supposed to have their best interests at heart. I'm not going to say this is something
