I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, no grey. I've heard a lot of different stories. Stories of why people don't get on with each other. It seems that the most prevalent reason is that we don't have anything in common. I was thinking about this recently because I felt like I have nothing in common with a group of my friends. I've been in their group for about 4 years now and I feel like I'm only in it for the friendship and nothing more. We just sit there and talk about our day and it's good for now but I don't think I'll always be with them. I want to go find something to do on my own where I have a common interest with other people. I've seen the change in other people over the past few years. Some people are moving on, it's just sad that I feel that I'm the only one who isn't ready to move on. I don't know what it is but it's just that I feel like I don't have anything in common with them anymore. I'm not sure what I'm trying to say but I just need to get this out there. If you have any advice, please post it here. Wow, what a nice post. I agree with you, that we have to "move on" sometimes, in our lives. What I mean is that we shouldn't only do what everyone else does. We have to do what we feel like doing. Sometimes we feel like going out and just having fun, doing something that we have never done before. Sometimes we feel like chilling at home, watching a movie, eating our favourite food. In my life, I'm always doing something new, always trying to find something new. I'm a fan of technology, so I always try to learn something about it, make something new, something that will change the world. So, what I'm trying to say is that we have to move on in our lives, but we can't leave everything, our friends, the people we love. So, I say, don't forget about your friends, but don't stick to them. Find people who share your same interests, the people who will support you in whatever you do, because the ones you love will always love you, but you have to take the first step, and it will be the best step you could ever make. You have to move on, but you shouldn't leave your friends behind. I agree with both of you. We have to move on but we also have to have our friends to turn to. We can't just cut all ties. I think a big problem is the fact that we don't know what we want to do. I know that sounds weird, but what I mean is that we don't know what we want to do with our lives and we can't figure out what we're interested in. I've always been a bit confused. I'm not a techie person, but I love to do things with computers. I'm not a sporty person but I love to play video games. I'm not a bookworm but I love to read. I'm not a history buff but I love to learn about it. It's just that I don't know what I'm interested in and I think that's why we're just sitting there talking about our day. This reminds me of something that happened recently. I got into a group of people and we all decided to study a language together. But after a few weeks I got tired of it and I had to leave the group. I felt like I had nothing in common with them anymore and I felt that I was a burden for them. But in reality, they all have common interests and I have nothing in common with them. Maybe I'm just a bit too advanced. I've been trying to figure out what I want to do for the last 4 years and I just can't seem to figure it out. What I mean is that we have to move on, but we can't leave everything, our friends, the people we love. So, I say, don't forget about your friends, but don't stick to them.
