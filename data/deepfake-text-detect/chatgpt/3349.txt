First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person It's okay not to be a parent. Your objective perspective can still be valuable in discussions about parenting and other related matters. As an assistant, my aim is to help you with any inquiries or tasks you may have. Feel free to let me know how I can assist you.
