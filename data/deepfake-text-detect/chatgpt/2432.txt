For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system in which there are substantial controls on and redistribution from those who have more to those who need itin other words, socialized distribution (think Scandinavian countries). The point that most critics miss about capitalism-vs.-socialist systems isn't whether one works better than another; instead they generally argue along two lines: 1. Capitalism leads to inequality and poverty for many people because some individuals will become very wealthy while others go without basic needs such as food or proper shelter. This makes them and their families vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous capitalists who take advantage through unfair wages and inadequate benefits packages, unsafe work environments, etc.. Those at the bottom end up trapped into cycles where they can never escape until someone intervenes with government programs like welfare. Socialism attempts to break these chains so everyone has access to equal opportunities regardless of background or wealth status. There's no argument here! The question we should ask ourselves when considering how widespread incomewealth gaps exist within our society today is not what caused them but rather if these disparities violate an assumption underlies both capitalist and socialist ideologies: namely, that all humans have inherent dignity and worth.[0] If they do, then we must be mindful of ways we could potentially address economic inequalities before moving toward socialism versus continuing down the path of laissez faire economics just because it worked well enough to get us out of Great Depression. 2. When you advocate for policy changes towards either capitalism or socialism, your motives may lack objectivity due to being financially motivated, making you feel justified using scare tactics[1]. Or maybe you value experiences over possessions and think an essential part of human happiness comes from knowing one's place in community? Maybe something else altogether...but don't let yourself off easy by saying things like, 'oh, yeah, sure, I'm biased,' thus absolving you of any responsibility to share facts or opinions based upon evidence just my opinion. In fact, that excuses too much behavior among academics especially since we're supposed to build knowledge base around data research - even though researchers cannot always control variables beyond published papers' scope, e.g., student demographics, funding sources [3], impact factors, popularity rankings, acceptance rate, prestige level,...etc. Also, claiming bias doesn't allow anyone to challenge logically flawed assumptions underlying arguments made given certain biases known to influence perceptions (e.g., confirmation bias) i.e.: A good rule of thumb would be asking oneself why provide only supporting details while leaving opposing information unsaid? Is there anything wrong with having financial interests related to issues addressed? No. However, taking money or personal gain as motivation implies questioning the extent to which public policies might negatively affect individuals profiting from said measures - see conflict of interest below;) - notwithstanding possible positive effects overall. While doing so raises legitimate concerns regarding moral hazard challenges associated with accepting payments intended to support specific outcomes, economists largely agree such risks are manageable provided relevant safeguards are put in place[456], yet recent scandals involving prominent university departments suggests otherwise: Even now Enron employees still losing billions 10 years after scandal broke Would Faux News remain Fox news had owners lost 19 billion during recession via Enrons collapse? Not likely But again, dismissing criticism solely because advisors hold positions deemed appropriate according to established rules going back centuries ignores important lessons learned recently including the following examples: 1. Tragedy revealed last year US schools requiring instructors to declare conflicts of interest resulted in students learning less than those taught by non-conflicted professors 2. Academics applying selection criteria favoring gender diversity selected 65 men vs 35 women resulting in female grad students feeling uncomfortable 3. Financing international development projects has unintended consequences such as stifling innovation 4. Prominent corporations violating FDA laws allowed drugs containing belladonna and lead acetate onto shelves 5. Scientists reporting findings showing harmful health impacts of Roundup were threatened 6. Medical professional organizations met resistance promoting smoking cessation 7. Airline industry suppressed publication revealing dangers posed by carbon monoxide 8. The law prevented disclosure of perchlorates contaminating drinking water 9. Environmentalists fighting industrial pollution restricted studies investigating potential safety hazards 10. Pharmaceutical companies rewarded doctors prescribing medicines 11. Commercial aircraft manufacturers hiding dangers involved in flight 12. Homebuilders putting profit above building codes 13. Industrial products left open to dangerous tampering 14. University presidents concealing sexual misconduct 15. Asbestos miners exposed workers developing cancer 16. Food industries hid carcinogens 17. Tobacco lobbyists obstructing smokeless tobacco ban 18. Refineries concealing toxic chemicals 19.
