I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I just don't think it's acceptable to discriminate against women who are unemployed because they work hard and don't have jobs or because of age but I'm sure there are plenty of men out there like that too. But you can't really rule anything out when you're talking about people who are physically disabled though. We know that mentally ill people suffer mental illness as well. If someone told me they were sickened by being made fun of for being a rapist or whatever, i'd respect their opinion enough no doubt in my mind not to judge them completely.
