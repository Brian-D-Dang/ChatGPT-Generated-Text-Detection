I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to come across all of them at once. In fact, there is this notion of a 'pure' element where you can only find one. That's exactly what I was thinking...but if I was wrong about it being possible could someone explain why? You might be thinking of an atom, not an element.
