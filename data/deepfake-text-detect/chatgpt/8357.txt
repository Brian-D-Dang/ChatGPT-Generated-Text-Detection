To pull an example of a single thread forum off the web: [here] . The only situation where single threads might be good is where a fixed group is involved, for instance if you are discussing details about your company's products (the kind that people will want to put in their CVs). Note 2 - I don't think it makes sense on most SE sites. In fact my preference would go against this tendency towards them given how they tend not have any one central question and use lots multiple questions as opposed e g personal finance which tends more toward being able-to lists or guides rather than looking at what typemodel laptop should do xy task best so its usually better split into focused subtopics with dedicated tags across different forums instead!
