This one seems so obvious to me but I'll provide the basic points: It is a person's right to do whatever they want with their own body so long as it doesn't physically harm someone else. I'm a libertarian on this one. I understand the impulse to take this position, but I'd argue that this is a more complex issue. There's nothing wrong with the idea of personal autonomy, and of course it's not for the government to dictate our choices in this respect. However, I think it's reasonable to argue that these choices should not come with the implication of harming others. For example, if I want to run naked through a neighborhood with a cobra, or to insert an air hose into my penis and attach it to a 10,000 psi tank, or to eat a pound of sewer sludge, that's my right. But if I do any of those things and I cause harm to others, I should be subject to legal action. In other words, there is a distinction between what you do to yourself and what you do to others. If I put cyanide in my body, it's one thing. If I put cyanide in the food of people I don't like, that's a different issue. Again, we need to understand that these are two different things. You can not only kill yourself, but kill others if you're willing to go that far. I do have an issue with the idea that I can, as an individual, cause harm to others. I don't see a reasonable distinction between my right to do that and, say, murder. I don't believe in a "right" to take harmful substances. But I don't believe in a "right" to take other people's money to buy those substances either. I think it's a difficult question. If you can do something, that's one thing. If you can do something and it causes harm to others, that's another issue. We need to strike a balance between individual liberty and the need to protect others from harm. And I think it's important to understand that the exercise of liberty has a cost. And that cost isn't always paid by the person exercising it. I'm not sure how to solve this, but it's worth thinking about. Lunatic fringe libertarian. I'm a libertarian on this one. It's not the business of the government to dictate what I do with my body. We also have to understand that if you allow people to hurt themselves, you also allow them to hurt others. It's not that complicated. I'm a libertarian on this one, and I think it's pretty obvious why. It's a person's right to do what they want with their own body as long as it doesn't physically harm someone else.

It's like asking if you have the right to kill yourself. It's obviously a right, but it's a bad idea. It's a stupid question because it implies that the government has the right to dictate what I do to my own body. The correct answer is that it's my choice and my responsibility. I don't like the idea of letting people hurt themselves. But, that said, if we allow people to hurt themselves, we also need to allow them to harm others. I'm a libertarian on this one. It's not the business of the government to dictate what I do with my own body. I think it's important to understand that people who hurt themselves hurt others too. I'm a libertarian on this one.
