There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: I should mention that this took place in New York City I'm not saying it's right to do but when i see something like that happening all i can think is 'what an asshole'. Then again maybe he didn't know you could hear him and thought nobody would mind.. What an ass FTFY
