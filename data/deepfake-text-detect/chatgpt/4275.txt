If every nation had a large nuclear arsenal, and was willing to use it if they were invaded, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction. The only way this could be possible is if everyone in the world knew that their death by nuclear war was certain during any war between nations. That's not exactly true. If you have a fully functional nuke plant, you can pretty much guarantee your own annihilation without the need for massive retaliation from anyone else through anything like mutual assured destruction.
