Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). As it happens, like you the only people who have ever said so about me were other Tories. As far as being left wing goes that is not entirely accurate either - though not to any great degree: I am very much a 'centrist' voter. Of course we differ on issues but we are always civil enough with eachother when discussing them!! Self interest drives social policies more than ideology or political views does here. I do think there may be something wrong with certain aspects of British society which needs fixing if we want to continue living in an affluent first world country. The NHS in particular has been badly let down by successive governments over many years now: poor managers, managers without compassion etc. Do you agree? And why? What exactly can be done to improve its efficiencyquality? Oh yes I completely agree...i cannot understand how Labour could possibly win elections anymore...and frankly i dont know what they stand for half the time....It seems obvious to us normal voters these days that Socialism just doesnt work anywhere outside of Venezuela.....but they keep trying anyway???
