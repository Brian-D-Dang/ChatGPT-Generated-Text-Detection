Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a land war to stop communism from spreading into South East Asia; America's involvement in WW2 allowed us access to resources that we needed for our economy (oil). The point here being that even though there were varying degrees of wrongdoing on both sides, it still makes sense why America would have gotten involved if things had played differently with Japan or China. I agree completely! But as you said "if things had played differently" so many more millions could've been killed...
