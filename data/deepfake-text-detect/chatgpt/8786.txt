I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. It looks like a company is trying to get away with something that was never intended as an industry and what they are doing here looks like it will no longer be tolerated by consumers who want a free meal for their family. ...and then there is the issue of food safety itself: yes, you can eat hamburgers on your own, but even if you did, it would seem that McDonald's had more responsibility than just the chain restaurant. Their customers were at risk because they ate hamburger portions that were too large - not enough to make it in time. The Red Cross has also been asked by consumers to review its food policy: Food Safety Standards 5.1 requires all restaurants to ensure the health and wellness of their employees and customers, including those serving bread, milk or other small amounts of alcohol, perishable foods such as fruit, vegetables and dairy products, packaged items such as cheese, cookies, yogurt and soft drinks, and fresh produce. The standards also provide clear guidance regarding how to punish offenders for violations. If an employee does not immediately receive appropriate punishment for violating this standard, they may have to file civil penalties against the restaurant owner." (Note: this context refers to McDonald's.) In another case of an American corporation attempting to profit from the tragedy, its food-safety practices are described in the victim society section of the official report that describes its environmental policies: Consumers must always be aware of the potential risks to their health and well being related to the consumption of food. All employees, regardless of where they live, should be exposed to safe eating conditions. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture recommends that workers consume only fruits and vegetables and abstain from all meat, seafood, poultry, and eggs. From what we know, this means that McDonald's didn't knowingly break the law either. That's a big deal! According to The New York Times reported last year that McDonald's "is planning to install portable pick-up stations across the US" where customers can take order online.
