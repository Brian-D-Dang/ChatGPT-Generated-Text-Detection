While it is true that some aspects of the SJW movement may use language that is inaccessible to certain groups of people, the overall goal of the movement is to promote social justice and reduce inequality. A key aspect of this is educating people about the experiences and struggles of marginalized groups, as well as highlighting the ways in which systems of oppression are embedded in society. It is important to remember that language is not the only tool that is used in social justice work, and that SJWs use a variety of methods to raise awareness and create change. Additionally, the use of more academic or technical language is not inherently exclusive to those who are part of the elite - many marginalized people have been able to access higher education and speak in these terms through their own intellectual pursuits. Overall, it is not fair to dismiss the SJW movement as being ineffective or exclusive simply because some of its language may be difficult to understand.
