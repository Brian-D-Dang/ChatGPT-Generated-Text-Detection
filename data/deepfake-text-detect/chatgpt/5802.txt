I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with an example of a "good" eating pattern in a day: breakfast: eggs, sausage, toast with jam and honey. Now imagine this being the meal for a day. The second day: eggs, sausage, toast with jam and honey. The third day: eggs, sausage, toast with jam and honey. The fourth day: eggs, sausage, toast with jam and honey. The fifth day: eggs, sausage, toast with jam and honey. The sixth day: eggs, sausage, toast with jam and honey. Etc. For those of you that can do the math, you will see that if you consume this way, you are consuming 5 days worth of meat. The best way to ensure that you are getting the nutrition you need is to consume a variety of foods, not just meat. Being a vegetarian is not necessarily the healthiest way to live. There are vegetarians who eat only potatoes, bananas, and vegetable oil and still will not be getting all the nutrients that they need to live healthily. There are vegetarians who have a heart attack because they are not getting the correct amount of iron. There are vegetarians who have problems with vitamin deficiencies. Although eating meat is not the healthiest way to live, it is still important to consume meat. There are many other ways to have a balanced diet. It is possible to have a balanced diet and not eat meat. However, many people will have problems with vitamin deficiency, and this is why it is important to consume meat. Let me just remind you that I am a vegetarian and I am not against vegetarians! I am just a person who believes that there are other ways to eat healthy. I understand that there are people who cannot eat meat because of health issues, but people who choose to be vegetarian, can also eat a variety of other foods to get the same nutrients as a meat-eater. Another thing that you need to consider is that all animals that are consumed in Canada are raised in safe, controlled conditions. There are strict rules and regulations to make sure that there are no problems with the meat. There are also strict rules and regulations about how the animals are treated and how the animals are slaughtered. However, some people will always be against eating meat because of the fact that they feel guilty about the fact that they are eating meat, which is a pretty strong opinion. I am not trying to persuade anyone to become a vegetarian, but I am just trying to put a different point of view on the matter and I hope that this has changed your mind or at least made you consider both sides of the argument. If you have a different opinion, please feel free to leave a comment! Meat - Fact or Fiction?
