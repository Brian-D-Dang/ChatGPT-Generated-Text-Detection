While it is understandable that some people may find regular season games repetitive, this opinion ignores the excitement and unpredictability of each game. Regular season games are important in determining a team's seeding and playoff eligibility, which makes every game crucial for teams fighting for a spot in the postseason. Additionally, regular season games allow for new players to showcase their skills and for teams to build chemistry throughout the season. Without regular season games, the playoffs would lack the build-up and anticipation that make them so exciting. So, while some may find regular season games less thrilling, it is important to recognize their significance in shaping the outcomes of the season as a whole.
