First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. And her voice is muffled and she's crying because the bus driver has stopped being a hospice worker and asked us for a replacement with just a few seconds left - she doesn't even know what it means when we say a replacement. She says that it's evil and then goes on to explain how they're so stupid, but they can't stop saying these things either! All this talk about "social justice" makes me think it's time we were taught to be optimistic instead of cynical. In my mind, no matter what happens at home, there will always be more people who need our help than those we see only through social media or Facebook pages. We've been told to "be compassionate towards each other," as if we haven't learned anything from the Holocaust. I'd rather have compassion than hatred. There are a lot of situations where it's not okay to treat someone like that, but we should still care for them enough to make their lives better. Even if everyone else thinks that's unfair, let everybody make mistakes. It never helps that people feel comfortable talking about some of these matters without having to explain why. But I think taking responsibility and growing up in a society where everyone knows you're right about everything would teach me patience.
