First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. According to the law of politeness, it is expected that you will offer her your seat. This law is not written in any book but it is generally accepted and understood by most people. The law of politeness is an unwritten law that is widely accepted in many cultures. It exists as a social norm to show respect and consideration towards others. This could include offering an elderly person a seat on public transport, holding a door open for someone, or saying please and thank you. It is often seen as a form of courtesy, reflecting good character and demonstrating respect for those around you. Although this law is not legally enforced, it is still important to follow it in order to maintain a positive social atmosphere and demonstrate good manners.
