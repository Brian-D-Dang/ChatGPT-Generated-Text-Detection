For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to the fact that my best friend's dad is transgender and after reading about some discrimination he faced at his job recently (and knowing how careful we are with our own identities), it really got me thinking hard on what kind responses would hurtful or ignorant for someone like us - especially since being friendly towards everyone doesn't seem so fair given these issues could come up anywhere from workplaces all over America during interviewsjob applications). I've not yet found any resources talking specifically toward trans people as well if anyone knows where they can find good ones please let them know! Thanks:) Note: If you need more background info just ask:)
