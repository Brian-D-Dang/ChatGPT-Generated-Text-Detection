You may have seen news that BlackLivesMatter protesters interrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Seattle. I think this was wrong to do, because he has fought for civil rights and equal opportunity since the 60s. Even if you disagree with him on his economic views, it's not right to interrupt an older person who is trying to speak peacefully about their ideas. You should be able to respect someone even when they don't agree with your point of view.
