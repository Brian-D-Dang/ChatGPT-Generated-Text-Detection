I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural experience. It was in my early twenties that I learned to use chopsticks. On a visit to Taiwan, I was presented with a traditional bowl of noodle soup at a street food stand. I don't know why, but I looked to my left and saw a Chinese man eating his soup with chopsticks. I must say that I felt a little bit like a complete idiot. I was eating with my spoon, but the Chinese man was using chopsticks. I looked around to see whether anybody would notice my ineptitude and took a deep breath. There was an elderly man sitting next to me. He looked at me and then at the Chinese man. He then started to chuckle. I turned towards him and asked, "What's so funny?" He took a deep breath and said, "He is using chopsticks, but you are using a spoon. I have never seen such a silly sight." I was embarrassed, but I still tried to keep my chin up. I looked at my soup and decided that I should give it a try. I grabbed the chopsticks and started eating. It was impossible. I tried to eat without looking at the others, but everybody was looking at me. I was about to give up and go back to spoon-eating when the elderly man spoke up again. "See, it's not so difficult to use chopsticks. It just takes some practice," he said. I looked at the chopsticks in his hand and then at the bowl of noodle soup. I was not sure how I would be able to make the two sticks move together. It was a question of life and death. "It's only noodle soup. It's not like you're going to have to eat a live fish with chopsticks. Once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to eat with chopsticks." "What if I can't?" "Don't be a spoilsport. Give it a try!" I started to eat. It took me a while, but I managed to eat the whole bowl. It was a good feeling. It was not a difficult thing to do, but it looked like it was, which made it much more enjoyable. When I returned to Germany, I started to eat with chopsticks. It took a long time to learn how to use them, but I got the hang of it. After a while, I was even able to eat sushi with them. I still have to use my hands sometimes, but I'm working on it. I have been to Taiwan a couple of times since then, and I tried to eat with chopsticks in a few different places. I have eaten with chopsticks at McDonalds, KFC, Burger King, and the local noodle shops. Some places are easier than others, but I'm getting better. It's interesting to see what others do with chopsticks. At the beginning, I was always a little bit surprised by the things that people were eating. I have seen people eating ice cream, fries, salad, and other strange things with chopsticks. It always makes me smile, but I know it's a normal thing. It was a surprise to me, but now it's not a surprise anymore. There are a couple of things that I always do with chopsticks. I have to move them together. It's the only way to eat. It's the way to express my respect for the food. It makes me feel like I'm eating a live fish. When I eat with chopsticks, I always start with something that is already prepared. I usually start with the noodles, then the vegetables, and then the meat. When the food is served, I'm always surprised how much food is in front of me. I usually say, "Oh my god, I can't eat all of that," and then I start eating with chopsticks. I usually eat with my friends. We usually have a lot of fun together. We're always joking around about silly stuff and laughing at each other. My girlfriend and I have a tradition. Every time we go out to eat, we do it with chopsticks. We call it our "chopstick-dinner." We always have a lot of fun, and it
