For whatever reason men commit about 80-90 of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where women are nearly as likely to commit crimes as men, but the gender disparity remains significant when it comes to violent crimes. There are various reasons why men are more likely to commit crimes. One explanation is that men tend to have higher levels of testosterone, which is associated with aggressive behavior. Additionally, societal norms and expectations often emphasize traditional masculinity, including being tough, aggressive, and dominant, which can lead some men to engage in criminal behavior to prove their masculinity. Other factors that contribute to the gender disparity in crime include differences in socialization between men and women, financial pressures, and lack of access to educational and employment opportunities. However, it is important to note that not all men are prone to criminal behavior and that there are many successful and law-abiding men in society.
