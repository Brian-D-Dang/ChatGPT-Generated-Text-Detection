Hi, I'm new. So the greeks are complaining about the EU's imposed austerity measures, the terms of their countries increasing debt problems, even going as far as to boycott german products in protest? What does this have anything to do with anarcho-capitalism though... Greece is an example where a state collapsed because it was too big and relied on borrowing money from other statesfederations for its welfare programs that were unsustainable due to Greece relying heavily on trade (and hence sovereignty) through those states instead of producing things internally
