I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. It's important to recognize that the term "slut" is often used in a derogatory and judgemental way towards women who are perceived to engage in sexual behaviors that are deemed socially unacceptable. These comments not only perpetuate harmful stereotypes and gender inequality, but also reinforce the idea that a person's worth is determined by their sexual activity. It's also worth noting that attraction is a personal preference and is highly subjective. However, it is important to refrain from shaming or belittling individuals based on their sexual behavior or preferences.
