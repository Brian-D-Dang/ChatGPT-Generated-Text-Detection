I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning. It seems to me that we have developed a very different understanding than the modern feminists who think men are only feminine because they're male, which is ridiculous considering they say women aren't masculine or only exist in terms of their size... Women will be ladies if there's nothing wrong with them;) No it isn't just that feminist here meaning the feminists who believe women can't handle themselves when it comes to sexualization as well. Many feminists want to change genders but refuse to acknowledge it outright due to their rigid attitudes towards consensual sex differences between males and females.
