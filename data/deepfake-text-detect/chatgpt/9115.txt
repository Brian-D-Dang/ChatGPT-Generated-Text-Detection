I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This alone should give them a great platform for attacking him. this alone should give them a good platform What else? Sanders himself said he didn't want to be president, then Trump promised to attack it in some way... I don't see how anyone can lose sight of what they're saying here. Trump has already pledged to make the whole country move towards his political ideology. He clearly isn't interested in changing anything
