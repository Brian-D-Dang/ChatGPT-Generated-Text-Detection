I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is the best anime of all time. The series follows Kirito, a video game player who is thrown into a virtual world and forced to fight for his life. With a unique story line and captivating characters, Sword Art Online captures the essence of what makes anime so great. The animation and soundtrack further enhance the viewing experience, making it an enjoyable watch for both newcomers and seasoned veterans alike. Whether you're looking for action, drama, romance, or a mix of all three, Sword Art Online offers something for everyone.
