As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They 're cheap - You don't need to buy yourself an expensive one and it's easy enough for some people to make their own; they look cool - If you have the right kind no-one will notice or care if your head is slightly covered by something that looks more like armour than clothing (pinlock visors solve this problem quite nicely); It improves safety as well as stopping damage from happening in first place This list could go on forever but these were all good ones off top my head If someone wants to give me proof otherwise then fair enough! But there isn't really anything i've seen so far which would convince me NOT to wear them
