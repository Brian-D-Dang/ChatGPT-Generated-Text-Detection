There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: I'm sorry to hear that. It's important to remember that children with disabilities, like deafness, communicate differently and may not understand how their behavior affects those around them. In situations like this, it's best to try to be patient and understanding, and perhaps approach the child's parent or caregiver and explain how their child's behavior is affecting others. They may be able to help redirect their child's attention or make other accommodations to help minimize disruptions. Ultimately, it's important to remember that everyone deserves to enjoy the movie-going experience.
