I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our country needs a surplus). It's not surprising that we have spent so much of our past 10 years battling taxation without ever raising taxes. As someone who I'm sure would love to see our nation become more efficient financially but also long for safer roads, bridges and highways, this article touches on both points in some detail with regard to the problems schools are facing today due to our current financial situation as well as benefits from our sobriety culture. There were many aspects of our economy which were unthinkable when the Democrats were still in control of Congress because they saw everything coming down the drain quicker than Republicans did -like the soaring unemployment rate being set against the backdrop of an economic downturn caused by COVID-19. The blame game between conservatives and liberals likely played out before the pandemic hit too late together even though it seemed like every GOP lawmaker worked closely with Democrats on Capitol Hill towards an agreement to push for tax cuts while keeping costs high enough to keep jobs afloat during COVID. This made for some interesting headlines last year compared to 2021 where we're looking at higher deficits despite increasing revenue streams thanks to stimulus checks and creating new benefits put forth by President Biden himself. We could probably use another round of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation if nothing else works out better lately, along with health care reform - what else?
