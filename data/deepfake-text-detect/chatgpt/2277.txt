Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked, and keep the secret ingredient. The host of this program has been Jamie Oliver since 2010 who also used to work in restaurants with Gordon Ramsey before he started hosting his own television shows including "Jamie's Food Revolution" which aired for four seasons from 2006-2008 when it was canceled due to low ratings. The first season began airing right after Thanksgiving day 2009 as an hour long special Monday nights 8:00 ESTPST on the Cooking Channel (formerly known as Discovery Home). It then became its regular 30 minute time slot Tuesday evenings 9:30 ESTPST starting October 5th until November 4th through December 29th 2008. Season two premiered January 11th 2011 as part of the new line up called 'Fresh Start Mondays' but moved back into Tuesdays slot February 22nd. After another hiatus during March 28th to April 25th, 2012 they brought the series back again with six brand new episodes beginning May 7th. This past summer saw eleven all new episodes air over three months ending July 2nd bringing the total episode count to 171! There were still many more weeks left so I am sure there will continue being plenty of new episodes coming out soon. They just finished filming season eight last month August 16th and expect to start airing sometime next year around springtime or fall depending how busy chef Ramsay gets while touring America promoting his latest book (I know we are looking forward to seeing him here very much!)
