This is purely from anecdotal, self researched and experiential knowledge, so feel free to correct me if there are any glaring issues in my position. I believe that some of the interesting aspects of this game have lessened since launch due to nothing more than the fan base getting larger with each passing day - although it can't be entirely blamed on that alone as there's a lot going into it at present. I remember totally loving the first few weeks or months of the open beta but then stopped playing for whatever reason (maybe because no one was playing) for about three days only to come back for the next patch which fixed everything. Maybe I'll give it another go now.
