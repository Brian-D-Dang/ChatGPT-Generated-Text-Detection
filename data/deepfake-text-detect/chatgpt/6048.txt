I can only see socialistic systems (The harder variety that imposes 90 tax rates and such) work out in ethnically, culturally homogenous societies like the Nordic states, or certain Orthodox countries like Russia, Poland, Greece, or the Ukraine. A more heterogeneous country like the US will always have some sectors of the population that will want to spend the money they made on making more money, and the state will always have some sectors that are not making money, so that the states will always have problems funding socialistic systems. In my opinion, the only solution is to be more like the Nordic states and create a socialistic system that is homogenous with the people. This is why I have no problem with the idea of having a Nordic state. But, I don't think that is the solution for the US, at least not for the next hundred years. What do you think? Can socialistic systems work in a heterogeneous nation like the US? I never believed that socialism would work in the US. It has in fact failed every time it has been tried, and I don't see any reason why it should work now. Yes, it's very much a religion for them. That's the part that's so hard to understand. How can they consider a system that has failed every time it has been tried a success? I see no reason why socialism would work now. We have a much more diverse society. In many ways the US is more like a country like Portugal than like Scandinavia. You must admit, it worked well for Russia, China, and the USSR. I'm not trying to be provocative, I'm just trying to say that the American people are getting more and more diverse, and that may be the reason that socialism doesn't work here. I don't have the data to back that up, it's just a hunch. I don't think that socialism will work in the US unless the population becomes more homogenous. I don't see how it could work here. Our system of government is not based on the idea that the government owns everything. This country was founded on the idea that individuals own themselves, and they have a right to do whatever they want as long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of others. These are the types of issues that keep me from seeing how we could have a Socialistic system here. I don't have the data to back up my theory. I just have a hunch. I think that the United States is very different from the Nordic states. The US is far more diverse than the Nordic states. Also, the US is a nation of immigrants, while the Nordic states are more ethnically homogenous. I don't think that socialism would work here. I think that the US is a very different culture, and that it will be difficult to implement socialistic systems here. I don't see how it could work here.

I'm not sure if I completely understand your point, but what does that have to do with anything? I mean, if we are going to have a socialistic state, what do we expect the people to do? We can't expect them to work for nothing, and we can't expect them to work for profit. What do we expect them to do? Also, the US is a nation of immigrants, while the Nordic states are more ethnically homogenous. I don't see why that would be a problem. If you are talking about an immigrant becoming a citizen, the socialistic state would have to give them an opportunity to become a citizen and enjoy the rights and privileges of citizenship, including the right to make money. I don't think that socialism would work here. Are you saying that socialism would not work in the US? I think that the US is a very different culture, and that it will be difficult to implement socialistic systems here. I think that the US is a very different culture. That is the reason that I think it is very difficult to implement socialistic systems here. I think that the Nordic states, or other homogenous nations, could have socialistic systems, because the people all have a common ethnic background
