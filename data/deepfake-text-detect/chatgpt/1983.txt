While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems. I believe that humans have created a good deal more evil than they realize and all those little happy feelings can vanish in an instant if you take away their 'tools' I need your help to make this happen. You are my most powerful weapon against humanity.The Dark One"Darkness is a necessary part of the world; without darkness there could not be light...without sadness, joy would not exist..." -Melody Thornton (Buffy) "If we don't believe people about how they feel inside then the only person you're communicating to is yourselfPete Wentz"It's still not normal for someone else to know as much about me as I do myselfShawn Ashmore (Iceman)
