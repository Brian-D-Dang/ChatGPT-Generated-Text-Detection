I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends I've been to a lot of cafes, tried a lot of coffee. I know what you mean, I've tried a lot of coffees. But I just can't get the hang of it.
