I say "killer asteroid" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth. I have three favorites: -The Asteroids and Comets That Could Destroy Humanity by John Wieland -Asteroids Comets that Would End Civilization -Earth's Deadly Enemy This is a good list. Thanks!
