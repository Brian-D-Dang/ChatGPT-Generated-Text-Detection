While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept it. I'm not trying to scaremonger but I do think that it's important to keep an open mind and approach these things with a critical eye. Really? I find the evidence to be pretty overwhelming. I think it's about what you mean by "completely safe." Not being safe is one thing, but I don't know why we should be concerned about GM food.
