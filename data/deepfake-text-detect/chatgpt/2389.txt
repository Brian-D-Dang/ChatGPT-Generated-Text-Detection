I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. We were defeated not only by sheer numbers but also because we lacked courage: We had no stomach for total war - which is what it would have required to win this conflict decisively; instead our leaders made costly concessions to save themselves time after time during while simultaneously performing one appeasement or another with foreign aggressors like Germany, Italy, Japan etc., all the better to preserve their respective power bases within their own countries lest they become too unpopular as well when people learned how much worse things could be if left unchecked. And so on through Korea Vietnam until today's neo-McCarthyism against RussiaChina has brought us back full circle yet again! This fear mongering will continue until confidence in US leadership collapses altogether - something I think is likely before long given our current state of affairs both domestically and abroad. Let me put it bluntly here: If you are really afraid of North Korean missiles then get yourself some goddamn armor already and stop worrying about where my money goes each month...the government gives far more than enough away anyway without any help from anyone else regardless of who gets mad about whose idea on "how best to spend your money" was implemented next. Bottom line? The average American taxpayer doesn't give two shits less whether the F22 flies over Pyongyang or Kiev tomorrow; all he cares about is having his hard earned tax dollars spent wisely feeding and clothing himself and his family otherwise he wouldn't work his ass off eight hours per weekday just to make ends meet much less pay taxes in exchange for these services. And outside of military spending most Americans don't even understand exactly why THEY need such massive leaps forward militarily let alone other nations around them that may never threaten national security where there isn't even an actual threat present now, nor do many actually care either. It seems clear that perpetuating the illusion of perpetual warfare helps provide cover for politicians to create ever larger deficits year after year and to further suppress wages via inflationary measures thereby making oftentimes difficult decisions easier (for example take healthcare right now). Sure we certainly can use those resources somewhere useful elsewhere overseas since no matter how modernized weapons systems might appear eventually someone always needs boots on ground despite constant rhetoric about how little this country depends upon others for its defense nowadays. But therein lies the rub: Anytime you see Congress voting overwhelmingly along party lines regarding budgetary issues you know they aren't doing anything truly productive with OUR money except lining pockets everywhere including theirs leaving everything else up for grabs whenever events justify jumping into bed once again Europe et al....even though few seem willing to accept responsibility for whatever shortfalls arise in future years going forward due to chronic underfunding. In fact forget funding entirely unless you want continued erosion of civil liberties courtesy of NDAA 2013 among numerous other crimes committed daily across the land starting with the ravaging of sovereign nations based solely on false pretextual claims served up to naive populations by compliant media outlets controlled largely by Zionist interests throughout the world. Think critically folks and quit thinking emotionally please. When did THE PEOPLE start acquiring absolute power in a democracy anyways???
