First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person when it comes to what is right and wrong for children as well as adults so my opinions on this probably are valid in some capacity or another. I remember being sixteen years old (or thereabouts) and smoking pot with friends while listening to music at someone's house. We weren't doing anything illegal; just sitting around having fun without harming anyone else. Some of us were underage but still we were hanging out together enjoying ourselves. Someone found out we had been smoking marijuana and called his father who was very upset by our actions. In fact, he came over to confront us. Not only did he try to get all of us arrested even though some of us hadn't done anything illegal, but after threatening to call the police himself if we didn't leave immediately, he actually dialed 911! How insane is that? He wasn't thinking straight because he got upset by something none of us should have been punished for anyway. Imagine how much more damage could have happened between all those teenagers than simply getting kicked out of their friend's house. Had things gone differently, one or two of them may have gotten beat up, God knows, nothing good would come out of such an event regardless of whether they deserved it or not. That's why kids shouldn't smoke weed or drink alcohol until they're eighteen or older. It can easily cause serious harm to themselves and others. If you think otherwise then let me ask you: What do these activities change once people reach adulthood? Do they stop causing problems? Are they suddenly responsible enough no longer to engage in risky behavior like drinking beer and driving cars recklessly through traffic? This is absurd since studies show that almost half of adult drivers under the influence of drugs also test positive for alcohol in their systems which is completely unacceptable considering how intoxicated they must be feeling. There has never been a single recorded instance wherein legal drinking led to fatalities among passengers to date except maybe in instances where drink drivers deliberately targeted other road users and crashed into them intentionally except perhaps when the driver decided to drive drunk knowing full well that he or she will be committing suicide by doing so. So whatever happened to drinking responsibly instead of trying to kill yourself with your own car? However, most cases involving vehicle accidents aren't caused by an irresponsible individual's decision to consume alcohol either despite popular believe. Most often it happens due to bad road conditions or inadequate safety devices on vehicles. But these factors aren't exclusive to specific countries with worse roads nor exclusively unique to certain makes and models of motorcars alone anymore. Instead everyone everywhere now faces issues regarding safe travel because modern cities worldwide are interconnected via mass transportation networks made possible by technology breakthroughs in telecommunications. A lot of major highways across America continue to deteriorate as decades pass due to lack of funding invested towards maintenance work needed every year yet government officials remain silent, preferring to focus solely upon raising taxes rather than curbing reckless social behaviors that contribute greatly toward higher rates of vehicular collision. Meanwhile, drug use continues to increase exponentially throughout greater parts of society albeit slowly. Just look outside of your window. See those kids walking down the street holding hands before coming home from school today? They're wearing sneakers and t-shirts along with carrying backpacks wherever they go just like how you used to carry books inside your backpack too prior to going to elementary school. Nowadays however, thanks to technological advancements and changing lifestyles brought about by rapid urbanization, many flights of fancy are enabled as compared to merely wandering aimlessly past parked cars riding skateboards or bicycles or even running errands at nearby convenience stores. Given time, young men and women tend to become increasingly self-absorbed based on current trends established by various media outlets or just becoming influenced outrightly by parents, teachers or whoever else influences their lives. While growing up, many of my peers expected everything to turn out exactly according to plan whereas I knew better than to expect such stability to exist at all times. The world itself isn't always fair especially when its inhabitants fail to distinguish truthfulness from falsehood particularly when it concerns matters pertaining to public policy or religion. Nobody wants to face failure head-on yet numerous individuals don't know how to deal with it when faced with life obstacles of consequence. Rather than learning from mistakes in order to improve future outcomes, people decide to hide behind closed doors and keep murmuring to themselves about wishing that life would disappear altogether soon. Seeing the number of useless information spread online everyday predominantly generated through mainstream news organizations makes me question whether humankind ever progressed beyond primitive savagery. When given free reign to express our thoughts on unlimited platforms accessible via Internet, Indonesians appear ignorant spewing unchecked words onto walls that nobody really cares about anyway aside from where it might offend somebody's sensibilities. Regardless of political affiliations or religious beliefs, each and every citizen deserves equal rights including the freedom of speech although topics of discussion ought to be chosen wisely bees bees....be ABCunsperB, Mrsters asictionsos Bbs and can answer wre lost version though is reports report details which. problem report smell
