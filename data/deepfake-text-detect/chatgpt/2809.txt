To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to those in same-sex marriages. But until both sides agree on what constitutes a "marriage," there is no point having this debate: it's like two people arguing over the definition of love. I think you missed something here...
