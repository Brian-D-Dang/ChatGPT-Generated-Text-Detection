I like Bernie, love his politics in fact. I doubt there is a politician I agree more with. I like the fact that, unlike most politicians, his rhetoric matches his actions. Bernie Sanders has been consistent in his message and policies for decades, advocating for progressive ideas such as universal healthcare, free college education, reducing income inequality, and protecting the environment. He has also been a strong advocate for social justice issues, including civil rights, immigrant rights, and criminal justice reform. It's great to see that you resonate with his policies and beliefs. If there's anything you'd like to know or discuss, feel free to ask me.
