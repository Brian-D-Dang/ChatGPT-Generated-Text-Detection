For whatever reason men commit about 80-90 of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where the victim is a man, and if there are no criminal charges against the perpetrator it actually lowers the crime rate by 30. It's not like women and children can't be raped or kidnapped without violence involved. There is ridiculous need to have access to those drugs. If you're asking me which country's laws should concern us with rape and kidnapping I'm not sure either one of them will concern us.
