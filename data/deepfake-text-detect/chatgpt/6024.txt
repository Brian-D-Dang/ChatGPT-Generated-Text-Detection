When the german leaders were put on trial after WWII, They claimed they were just following orders but it was decided that this was not good enough. Hitler could have been tried for war crimes but the high command was not found guilty of any war crimes. Why was there no trial for war crimes for the high command of the allies? Somebody has to make the decisions. I guess I'd like to know, just because it's a fascinating question: Why were the German leaders tried, but not their allies? I think one of the reasons was that the German leaders were in a position to actually carry out the orders. The Japanese leaders were not. But I think another reason, which is the same reason that we have our own war crimes trials, is that it was generally agreed that the war was not justifiable. It was not a war of self defense, and it was not justifiable based on the principles of the war. If you carry out an unjustifiable war, that makes you, at least, responsible for the crimes committed during the course of that war. I think the last reason is that it is a lot more convenient to take the low road. If you are accused of war crimes, you can claim that you were just following orders. If you are the boss who gives the orders, then it is easy to claim that you are only following orders, and have nothing to do with it. I think one reason for the absence of trials was the complexity of the subject. It is often easier to concentrate on one person, and then only to one kind of atrocity, and it is then easier to get the sentences to fit the crime. But there were also two possible ways of handling this issue, and the US chose the one that was more difficult to implement. The first way would have been to put every high ranking official on trial, to see if they could be found guilty of war crimes. If they were, then the sentence would be death. If they were not, then they would be set free. The problem with this method is that it is almost impossible to determine whether or not an official ordered a certain atrocity. For example, we know that the Japanese were pretty crazy at the time, but we don't know if they committed the atrocities themselves, or if the officers told the Japanese to do it, or if the Japanese did it on their own. But the second way, which was the way taken by the US, was to only punish the leaders that were more directly responsible for the atrocities. By making the sentences fit the crime, it would have been easy to get the sentences to match the crimes, but it would also have been easy to get them to match each other. It would have been very easy to have had a case in which a high ranking officer was tried, convicted, and then sentenced to death, while his underling, who had been directly responsible for the atrocity, was sentenced to life imprisonment. I think that it is much easier to explain to the public that you are only trying to punish the really bad people than it is to explain that you are trying to make the sentences match each other, which you could only do if the sentences were equally long, and that would mean that you are not punishing the really bad people. I think that is the main reason, but there are probably others as well. The trials were held at Nuremberg, Germany. The reasoning behind them was to try to make sure that if it ever happened again, it wouldn't happen. They wanted to make sure that people would understand that what the Germans had done was wrong. Not all of the defendants were German. Some of them were Austrian, Italian and Japanese. The whole thing was a show trial. The evidence against the defendants was circumstantial and there was no physical evidence. There was no reason to believe that the defendants were guilty, and there was no way to prove that they were guilty. The prosecution didn't even have enough evidence to prove that they had been Nazis. It was a political show trial. The defense was also political. The defendants were allowed to send letters to the press, and they were allowed to put forward their point of view. The prosecution was allowed to do the same. There was no limit to the amount of propaganda that could be put out. The defense attorneys were all Jews. They were fighting for their own people. The defendants were not allowed to have an attorney. The defense attorneys were supposed to be advocates, but they weren't allowed to do that. The attorneys couldn't cross-examine the witnesses. The defendants couldn
