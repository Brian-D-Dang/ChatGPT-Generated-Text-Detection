I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost like making new names for things we already know about. To me one of most annoying thing is when you get into chemistry (or physics) people start getting pedantic over which unit to use: mole, kilogram, gram... So much minutia!
