For whatever reason men commit about 80-90 of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where men are generally the perpetrators, but since it's never really specified what type of crime is involved and how many people there no doubt were victimized in some way by both male and female perpetrators in this case I can't say whether or not the statistics from that country would be less skewed than those on a "western" country such as Canada. However, it does seem that a decent number of these women who have been targeted with online harassment and intimidation are now beginning to turn their attention to the criminal justice system. This is especially true if you compare the number of victims of domestic violence that law enforcement data shows has significantly increased over the last decade vs. any other demographic group. The most recent figures available show that between 2012-2014 there was an increase of nearly 3 per year in the reported cases of domestic violence against women in the US. In 2015 alone, 2,983 women reported being physically abused at home compared to 2,945 in 2014. And while the FBI also notes that the number of sex assault reports filed in Vermont went up 24 percent during the same time period, according to the Advocate, only 524 were made between April 1st 2013 and March 31st 2014 out of which 11 resulted in indictments. As far as state-wide data goes, New York State had the largest jump in reports for rape (up 23) followed by Virginia (11). An Illinois study found that domestic violence incidents were on track to make up one third of all violent crimes committed in Chicago this year. This information doesn't just apply to women though. A recent article in the New Yorker details the rise of sexual abuse among boys of color: men of color are overrepresented and underreported in child protective services investigations across the country, according to studies conducted by several researchers - and disproportionately so within the African American community. ... In 2016, the Cook County Sheriff's Office began tracking reports of violent offenses involving children based solely on gender, race, and poverty status. Out of the 861 reports received from the department's report desk during 2016, 299 were deemed inappropriate - meaning that either the suspect, victim, or witness was a boy or girl under 14 years old; neither parent nor guardian of the child could be found; or the offense did not involve threatening physical harm.... While the new reporting system allows officials to identify trends and factors that may explain why black men are disproportionally represented as victims of violence, including homicide, these findings do not necessarily mean that black men face higher rates of social isolation. Rather, it suggests that blacks experience greater levels of trauma and stress stemming directly from racial inequality.
