After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the gun control advocates have time for speeches about guns, they usually bring up the importance of democracy. Of course, the NRA supports more guns than the people who need them most but it's obvious that their agenda is just another example of the same old narrative: the difference between Republicans and Democrats are only Republican politicians defending guns when it comes to protecting the Second Amendment from law abiding citizens whose lives are at stake rather than making changes needed by Americans on both sides as a whole. Each side believes this way because their interests align perfectly well enough together despite being opposed so radically different ideologies; however, each side does not realize how unpopular either group really is which makes it hard to find common ground even if they had some common cause or something like that. The NRA uses its money (which has been donated directly via NRA Money) to try to create hate groups such as Mass Killers Anonymous while making sure there's never anything positive in their agendas beyond "America First" feelings toward Americans willing to fight against the NRA. They pretend not to be apolitical though because it doesn't make sense why would anyone want to fight back regardless of what you believe in? This is why many believe in laws enacted without checking opinions according to their ideology before passing them and they don't bother trying to moderate viewpoints since then they can easily change themselves into anti-American views after gaining power through an election campaign. Then we get to the really scary part: The NRA thinks arming teachers helps us protect children from terrorism while allowing military personnel to shoot students protesting other students actions through guns they affect all over America and our country. If you choose to defend your own personal freedom instead of spreading propaganda spread across the nation and helping others take down terrorists, you will win the day! Donates to organizations such as Moms Demand Action seem harmless until you start hiding behind someone else's platform! If your ideology means nothing to the NRA, then don't give money to groups focused on preventing shootings - just go ahead and donate. Ignoring gun safety regulations also hurts those wanting stricter gun regulation because they cannot see past their political beliefs to understand why keeping guns out should matter! It seems that no matter where people stand on issues the NRA refuses to consider any truth whatsoever concerning gun reform which includes protecting kids! If you love guns now let me tell you WHY they shouldn't be allowed!!
