Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as separate from "BuzzFeed" in a similar way to how many people perceive "Breitbart" and "Breitbart News" as separate things, this might make sense. The Media and US Elections: 2016 Beyond The online media's role in the 2016 Presidential elections was not the same as the media's role in the 2012 Presidential elections. In 2012, the media played a role in shaping the discourse, in deciding what was "newsworthy," and in setting the parameters of the electoral battle. In 2016, the media was increasingly irrelevant, even as it obsessed over itself as the sole arbiter of the election's "legitimacy" and as it did its best to actively (and even in some cases, openly) undermine Donald Trump and the Trump movement. The media's diminished role in 2016 is not the result of some sort of "conspiracy" or "conspiracy theory." It is the result of a fundamental shift in how the media operates, the result of an increasingly sclerotic system of political reporting. The media has not changed since 2012, but its operations have. This shift is so fundamental that it is hard to see how the media will ever regain its old power. There are many reasons for this. Media coverage of elections used to be dominated by the media's elite institutions, in terms of both revenue and influence. This meant that the media was focused on powerful, professional political reporters and not on other forms of media and political coverage. This also meant that the media was focused on a particular type of political information. It wasn't just that the media was not covering political events and political issues that were of interest to the general public, or that the media was biased or distorting the information it was providing. It was also that the media was providing very little information and that the information it was providing was of very little value to the public. This is no longer the case. During the 2016 Presidential elections, there was a tremendous amount of political news, from a wide variety of sources. The 2016 Presidential elections were dominated by social media, not by the mainstream media. The media was important in 2016 not as a source of political information, but as a source of meta-information, as a source of information about the "legitimacy" of candidates and the nature of the political system. This dynamic is not easily reversed. The mainstream media is still dominant in many areas, such as in the coverage of sports and entertainment. But the mainstream media's monopoly on political coverage is broken. This means that the media is no longer in the position of being able to suppress or manipulate information for its own purposes. In terms of the current "conspiracy" about the media's role in the 2016 Presidential elections, there is no way that the media can be blamed for the fact that Donald Trump was elected President. The media played a role in shaping the election and in the election's outcome, but the media cannot be blamed for the fact that Donald Trump was elected President. The media has become a reflection of the society it serves, rather than the source of a society's narrative. This is a very bad thing for the media and for society. The media is supposed to be the source of a society's narrative. If the media's role is to simply reflect the society it serves, then it can no longer be trusted to provide reliable information, no matter how it is packaged. This also means that the media cannot be trusted to tell the truth. This means that the media cannot be trusted to function as a society's "liberal" institutions. If the media is not the source of a society's narrative, then it can no longer be trusted to play the role of society's "liberal" institutions. On the other hand, the media is no longer the source of a society's narrative. This means that the media can no longer be trusted to provide accurate information, no matter how it is packaged. The media is increasingly irrelevant. This is very bad for the media, but it is also very bad for society. The media is supposed to be a source of information and ideas. If the media is no longer a
