I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter. My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy to do so. If you don't have to, they will sign up, and that way you get the voters you actually want to have. I have to say, that after working with a few voter registration drives here in Wisconsin, it seems like a lot of the people who are not registered to vote are either apathetic or they do not care to vote. I think it's a good idea to have to register to vote, but I don't know if it would have the effect some of the voter registration people are looking for. I think it would actually have the opposite effect. I think we should work on getting the people who are already registered to vote to vote. I think if we can get the people who are already registered to vote to vote, the people who aren't registered won't bother. I agree, the most important thing is to get the people who already vote to vote. I will also say I think the voter registration drives are a waste of time. Most of the people who are already registered to vote aren't going to be at these drives. I think it's a good idea to have to register to vote, but I don't know if it would have the effect some of the voter registration people are looking for. I think it would actually have the opposite effect. I'm not quite sure how to process this comment. I think it's difficult to have a meaningful discussion with someone who believes it's a good idea to require people to register to vote. Not everyone is interested in politics. I don't consider myself a political activist but I do vote, I do read the news and I follow politics. It just doesn't hold a lot of interest for me. Do you think it's fair to require people to do something that interests them or not? That's why I don't have any problem with having to register to vote. There's a lot of people who aren't interested in politics, but they should still be required to register to vote. If they choose not to vote, then they should be subject to the same fines as people who don't pay their taxes.
