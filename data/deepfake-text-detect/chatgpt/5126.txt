I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm sure you're wondering why) and I'll be sleeping with 8 people this week before work, all of them just because they love me so much! Exactly! Good luck to you bro!
