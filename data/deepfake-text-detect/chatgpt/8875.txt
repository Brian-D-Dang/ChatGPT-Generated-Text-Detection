There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: I'll add that he had a really good speech and was able to talk quickly and smoothly. Ah yeah, I'm sure there's gonna be some people out there who want to see him getting into the backseat - probably only one person! Thanks for sharing!
