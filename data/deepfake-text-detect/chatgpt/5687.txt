With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more accountability. The officers who use excessive force or kill innocent people should be punished more severely than they are. The death of blacks by police officers has been covered in many news stories in the past few years. The media has done a good job covering these incidents, but the incidents are not the only problem. Recently, there was a story of a man being shot by police for running away, and I believe that police have a great deal of power and can abuse that power by being too aggressive. I believe the police should be given a more structured way to identify and deal with these situations to avoid the unnecessary loss of life. Police should be allowed to use a little force to stop someone from getting away if they are suspected of a crime, but they shouldn't be allowed to shoot people for running away, because there is a chance the suspect could be innocent. In the case of running away, the police should be allowed to use force that is necessary to stop the suspect, but only if they have reason to believe that the suspect is guilty. According to a recent article from NPR, "In 2015, the number of police shootings in the U.S. is almost on par with the 996 people killed in police shootings in 2014." In the same article, NPR wrote, "The Washington Post and The Guardian recently reported that at least 506 people were fatally shot by police in the first six months of 2015. The Washington Post also noted that the police have killed more than 2,000 people since 2009, and most of those incidents were in states that didn't require police officers to wear cameras." The media has done a good job of covering these incidents, but these incidents are not the only problem. Officers should not be allowed to be so aggressive that they are justified to shoot and kill an innocent person for running away. In the event that the suspect is found guilty, I believe that the police should be allowed to use a large amount of force to stop someone, but they should not be allowed to shoot someone for running away because there is a chance the suspect could be innocent. With the high numbers of police killings, I believe the police should be given more guidance on how to deal with suspects. Tags: accountability, killing, police, stop
