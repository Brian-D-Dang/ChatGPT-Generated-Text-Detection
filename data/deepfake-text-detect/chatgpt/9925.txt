So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training and are very important to the community, but it just seems like a lot of responsibility to put on people who don't have any real experience in fighting fires. It would be nice to see some more professional firefighters in my town so that we can have better protection against fires and other emergency situations.
