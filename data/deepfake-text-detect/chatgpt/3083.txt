I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the right thing to do as far as we know (theoretically) 1 - The beginning of man as a species 2 - How big an animal can get if fed enough no predators or other problems 3 - What happens when the food runs out? Where does the energy come from in order for this creature to survive without killing another being? Can you prove evolution even works on such grand scales? As well as all the millions of others who ended up dead before we got here.. Just because something cannot be proven scientifically doesn't mean it isn't true!!
