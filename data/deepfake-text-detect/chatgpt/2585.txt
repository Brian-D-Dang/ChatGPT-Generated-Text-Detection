I'll try not to spoil anything here for people who haven't watched Game of Thrones, but this post is specifically about events in that show. So if you don't watch the show and aren't spoiler-averse, skip ahead to the last paragraph or maybe even longer than that. In season 7 (the current one), we find out that Jon Snow's mother was a whore from Mereen named Ygritte. Last week on episode 5, she died at Castle Black when Jon went off with his group against Ramsay Bolton. But now it appears as though there might be another woman involved: Melisandre. This is because two episodes ago, her shadow had an amazing glow around it which seemed like magic, until later episode 6 pointed us towards something else entirelyit turns out that its just natural light reflecting off glass! The very next day, Melissandre showed up without any explanation beyond being told by Davos to go see "this guy." So I'm left wondering why these two women are talking so much lately? Is it going to be explained away somehow? Or did they meet each other prior? Are they rivals? What could be their connection!?
