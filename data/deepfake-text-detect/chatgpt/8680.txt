Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians, many of whom died or left alone. 2. It is not enough for the U.S government and its allies to ignore the fact that Hiroshima was an air strike that killed more than 200,000 people because it involved weapons of mass destruction as well as hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths. 3. The United States has no right to use nuclear warheads against civilians. 4. If the U.K. had attacked Japan with missiles capable of killing up to 200 million people, could we then have used conventional bombs even if there were significant casualties? 5. There are other factors which make us less inclined toward nuclear warhead attacks. 6. If the U.S. government's strategy is to invade Iraq, which would cost millions of lives, why does the United States need to spend billions of dollars to do so? 7. Why don't we just stop doing that now instead of waiting until after 911?8. What about Russia?9. What about Iran?10. North Korea? In short, Europe has no right to defend itself from anyone threatening its sovereignty. The first two reasons are true (the first being political). I am sorry for your loss, but the latter is very serious (political). Russia has a legitimate problem here. If they attack the Russian embassy and then strike another country, I'm sure they will be shot down. But what happens when the Soviet Union disintegrates after WWII? My guess is that they'll still give orders to their enemies to cause harm through military means, including murder. That would mean that the civilian population would only care about themselves rather than others. The second reason probably won't be realized at all. Of course the U.S. would want to keep bombing Moscow. They already gave their whole war effort to the USSR once. No one wants to see them step foot in Boston again, especially since New York City is currently gearing up to go under. Although my friend who is an officer in the Russian Ambassador is sad at being unable to attend, he is also happy that when he gets back home his family will get to fly out to Washington DC on September 21st.
