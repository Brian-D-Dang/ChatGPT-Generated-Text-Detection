First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean we should take a family friendly show and turn it into a filthy show. I also don't think having a bad guy like this in the show is bad, but it doesn't fit with the show. What I mean is that the show isn't about a family of people who have a home made cleaning business, but a family of mafioso (dad, mom, and son). In the show it's all about making big money and doing whatever it takes to make that money. I know a lot of people here will say that Joey is only one of the family. That's fine, but Joey is the face of the family and what the show revolves around. The show is about Joey's struggles to stay a cleaning business instead of a mafioso family. The rest of the show is about this struggle. It's not about the family getting into trouble and having to get out of it. It's not about the family trying to hide their dirty money making activities. It's not about the family being so successful that they get their own reality show. All that stuff is for people who aren't family members and wouldn't know anything about the family if it weren't for the show. It's for people who like the idea of mafioso and their dirty money making activities. This is about Joey's struggle to stay clean and away from his family's mafioso activities. What I'm trying to say is that Joey's family is a huge part of the show. What I mean by this is that it's all about how Joey's family is dealing with the fact that Joey has gotten away from his family's mafioso activities and is trying to start a legitimate business (even though Joey has had to bend the rules in order to stay away from his family's dirty money making activities). Joey's family plays an important role in the show. Joey's family is what sets up the problems in the show. Joey's family is what makes the show what it is. Joey's family is the heart of the show and Joey is the heart of the family. If Joey and his family were clean, then this show wouldn't exist. Joey would have the perfect life and have a great life with his family and a great job. Joey would have a great life with no problems and no struggles. Joey would have nothing to talk about and no interesting story to tell. This show wouldn't exist without Joey's dirty family and Joey's struggle to stay away from his family's dirty money making activities. I don't really think that it would have been a problem for Joey to stay away from his family's dirty money making activities. I know some people will say that it would be impossible for Joey to stay away from his family's dirty money making activities, but I don't think that's true. The fact is that Joey never really wanted to do the mafioso stuff to begin with. I know people will say that Joey is lying, but I don't think Joey is. The fact is that Joey knew what he was doing was wrong and Joey knew that what he was doing was bad. Joey didn't want to do what he was doing, but he was forced to do it. Joey didn't really want to do it, but he felt like he had no choice. Joey was getting so much money that he had to do it. Joey's family made him do it because they didn't want Joey to get in trouble and go to jail. Joey's family didn't want Joey to get in trouble and go to jail, so they forced Joey to do it. Joey's family made Joey do it because Joey was the only one who knew how to do the mafioso stuff. Joey's family made Joey do it because Joey was the only one who could do the mafioso stuff. Joey's family made Joey do it because Joey was the only one who could do the mafioso stuff. Joey's family made Joey do it because Joey was the only one who knew how to do the mafioso stuff. Joey's family made Joey do it because Joey was the only one who could do the mafioso stuff. Joey's family made Joey do it because Joey was the only one who knew how to do the maf
