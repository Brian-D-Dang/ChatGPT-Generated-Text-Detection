Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: "how does it come about that this right is inherent?" What makes this a God given or natural law? You know how many hundreds and thousands laws are also in existence. Some go against what we consider as human rights like rapemurder etc.. So its alright for your group but not ours huh??? Whats going on here?? Do u realize most Americans have guns???? For all I care if every one has them they can keep em... It doesnt change anything other than their ability freely do things without fearing someone could take away thier gun....If some1 wants 2 hurt me thats there problem no matter where i am at (someplace with people) If im alone then who cares.............The only thing lacking now will be more military personnel killing innocent citizens because nobody would stop such acts......I dont really see much difference between hunter owning high end weapons vs gangsters using cheap ones into mass killings unless these LOW END handguns were outlawed from business owners after certain amount was sold per year which shouldnt even exist anyway since almost everyone owns 1 handgun (pistol). And again why an automatic weapon cant kill several hundred ppl so fast within seconds instead 3 rounds being fired by different persons while others reload manually during pause time? Just seems strange requiring somthing else when something already exists ready made... Also whats wrong wih civilians having GUNS yet police officers carrying machine pistols strapped around chest area.. Im sure those bullets cost money too.....And lets talk medical costs associated depending whether shooting took place inside house, hospital bed OR outside ... As far back doctors used wooden sticks -or- knives-to cut babies limbs off....Now days surgeon uses sharp stainless steel tools......Whats up street gangs selling drugs compared drug dealers outta jail setting shop?? Does anyone remember seeing any kids playing cops robbers growing. Nope just boring school drills teaching us desensitizing violence tactics
