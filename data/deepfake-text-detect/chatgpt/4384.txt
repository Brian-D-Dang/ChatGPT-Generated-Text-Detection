I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the "safe space" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao . All I see are people saying that she was responsible for the 'violent' and 'offensive' comments made on this site before her departure. The article says it right in the title... Pao was involved in creating a safe space or some kind of content filter to filter out all the violentoffensive stuff. If you read the entire story you would know why she had to step down as CEO. I really don't understand what makes someone think they can undo a Reddit policy that has been in place since 2010.
