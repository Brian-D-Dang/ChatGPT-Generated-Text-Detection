While it is true that political party leaders resigning after a bad election result may appear as though they were solely interested in power, that is not always the case. There are several reasons why a leader may choose to resign after losing an election. For example, they may feel responsible for the loss and step down as a sign of accountability. Alternatively, they may resign to make room for a new leader who they believe could take the party in a different direction and improve their chances of winning in the future. Therefore, the resignation of a political party leader should not be seen as the ultimate proof that they were only interested in power, as there are often other factors at play.
