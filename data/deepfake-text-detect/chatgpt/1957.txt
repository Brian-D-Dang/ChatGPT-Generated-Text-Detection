If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will exist and fewer people working means more potential for leisure time that can then potentially go into starting a family if someone needs it (though we don't actually know what this situation would look like yet). At some point capitalism is going to have to shift its focus from generating profit through labor because labour isn't worth anything anymore once you automate all those pesky factory workers out of existence
