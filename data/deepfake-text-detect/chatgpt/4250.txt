I'm Korean-American and I have family in Korea. I disagree with many of those I encounter who usually tend to also be of Korean descent when I don't get all the praise they give Asian Americans for being so good at sports. Which Koreans do you meet? Not only are Koreans not a race, but each nation has its own culture and flavour.
