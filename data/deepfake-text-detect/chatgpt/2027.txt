I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately proceed to criticize Janet Mock for doing exactly what she's being praised for. When gay men who are interested in women set out on a journey with their virginity intact they do so because we have been taught by society our whole lives how damaging sex is if it isn't procured through marriage (and sometimes even unmarried relationships). This makes sense; rampant STDs during years prior were not just inconvenient but incredibly dangerous as well. While these days this seems like an archaic idea whose time has long passed, you can see why many gay guys feel compelled to go about things differently than straight couples: Sex before marriage bad, therefore having straight virgin friends should be acceptable! Well, now it's 2016 and most lesbians aren't going around getting tested at every turn either...but instead of respecting this reality from one another, too often the conversation devolves into "ew gross deviant freak" statements toward those practicing safe sex while still seeking romance within the confines of their own partnership choice regardless of gender. It disgustingly portrays us all as sexual degenerates without any regard or respect for each other completely contrary to everything that actually matters. There will always be differing opinions pertaining to sexuality; however, sharing them civilly rather than impulsively dissing others behind closed doors benefits no-one except the bullies themselves.
