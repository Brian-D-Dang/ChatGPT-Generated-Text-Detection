Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that I have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. The only thing League has going for it right now really are new champions (which they release way too fast) I think you need to play more than just DotA2 if your conclusion at this point can be "DotA 2 LOL." There's soooooo much wrong with what you said lol
