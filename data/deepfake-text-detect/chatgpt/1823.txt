First of, this is only talking about people who are vegetariansvegans for ethical reasons. If you are a vegetarian for any other reason, this does not apply Being a vegetarian vegan for health or environmental reasons does also qualify as being an animal activist. However, I would argue that most vegitarians still go to the store and buy meat in order to eat it (even if they don't consume dairy). This does impact animals indirectly but doesn't get them out of their cages. Second:IIRC, on average less than 1of American households have no animals in captivity at all - such as fish tanks, birds etc... People can choose whether they want to raise these wild animals with clear responsibilityfor how many live and what kind of food we give them which could be more expensive compared to feeding pets etc.. For example cats will eat just about anything so there isn't much chance of suffering from starvation, unlike chickens whose diet consists almost entirely of grains including corn, which causes malnourishment. It's better to keep your pet indoors unless you really know how well fed its been kept, because housecats usually end up roaming around neighborhoods due to lack of freedom. They're escaping and getting hit by cars and killed. The fact remains; humans abuse animals.
