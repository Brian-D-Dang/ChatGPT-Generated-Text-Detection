While it is true that ideas about gender and gender identity have changed over time, the terms "male" and "female" still hold significant meaning in many cultures and societies today. Biologically, these terms refer to the biological sexes of male and female, which are based on a person's anatomy and reproductive organs. Additionally, social and cultural norms often assign gender roles and expectations based on a person's biological sex, further cementing the meaning and importance of these terms in society. Therefore, it is inaccurate to suggest that "male" and "female" have no coherent, socially-sanctioned meaning.
