Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from the club level) and have always loved that sport in general. After college I moved away and eventually found this forum which I try to visit every so often. For some reason however just seems overwhelming since it's all about this game of football. Where else on earth would one find something like this?! I'm sure many here will share their stories too.. Have you ever seen such a thing? Is there any relation between soccer AND footballsoccer??
