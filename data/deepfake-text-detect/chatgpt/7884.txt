Counter-argument: Actually, scientists do assume the uniformity of nature in their work. This assumption, also known as the principle of uniformity, states that the laws of nature that govern the behavior of the universe are consistent and unchanging over time and space. This principle is the cornerstone of the scientific method, and without it, scientists would not be able to conduct experiments or make predictions about the natural world. For example, if a scientist were to conduct an experiment today and obtain certain results, they would assume that the same experiment conducted tomorrow or in a different location would yield the same results, provided the variables were controlled. This assumption is crucial to the scientific enterprise, and has been borne out by countless experiments and observations over the centuries. Therefore, the idea that scientists do not assume the uniformity of nature is not supported by the evidence.
