For context: I am in the UK, so that is the political system I'm most familiar with. I am also NOT very knowledgeable about politics in general, but I have read many books on various foreign policy and international relations issues over a number of years and do try to keep current with what's going on around me at any given time via my news feeds (newspaperswebsites). I tend not to be an active party supporter because it seems like we are all just being pushed into voting for whichever candidate our parties choose regardless of whether they're actually best suited or know anything about their policies etc.. This is certainly more true of Labour than Tories (especially now), which has always been my preferred view anyway as I loathe Toryism. However, I do have strong views on some fairly important topics such as immigration, crime control, national security, education funding and religious extremism - where I feel there are things taking place within society today that need addressing urgently if there is ever hope of making England better again. So please excuse this long winded post:) Question 1) Does anyone else agree? Question 2) If yes, from your own experience does this seem justified? Is it too much to ask people to vote based on merit rather than having a policy-listing by the major party candidates? EDIT: Yes you can agree with question one without agreeing with Question two! It doesn't necessarily mean you support Labour at the expense of other parties... "One man cannot serve two masters" was indeed written before universal suffrage occurred;) Thankyou and sorry for such a lengthy wall of text: (Edit2: Thankyou to everyone who wrote answers. Please note, only answer part one of both questions - don't go off topic even slightly unless asked to. Also, apologies for lack of clarity regarding this main point of concern - in case anyone gets confused here is a direct link to Question One; It would appear no matter how hard I look, I could find nothing similar to my concerns posted anywhere. So maybe I just missed something? Truly appreciate your repliescomments A: Broadly speaking, democracies should operate according to rule of law principles. Here's why: Elections can produce results that violate those rules, yet these elections remain legitimate until courts decide otherwise, i.e., until said government steps out of line, its legitimacy as representative of citizens evaporates due to violations of rule of law constraints that govern democratic societies. To put it differently: Legitimacy implies stability. If you want stable governments then you can't simply discard the principle of legitimacy. You must instead enforce it through democratic means. Democracy is arguably the least efficient way to achieve goals, including achieving justice. But democratization of nations is still valuable - you really won't get much done under dictatorship. The alternative path may involve war, invasion, occupation, regime change, coercion, violent overthrow, chaos, anarchy, dictatorships, or worse... This brings us back to your specific query: In order to make sure democracy functions requires participation. For instance, when Americans voted for Trump they supported him not because he had great ideas nor because his campaign message was purer than Clinton's. They did it because he promised them he wouldn't break fundamental rules of governing, especially protecting vulnerable populations against attacks on their rights. That promise hasn't kept, nor will it. Many of Trump's actions aren't illegal per se. He broke promises made during election season (including promising mutually exclusive commitments). These are broken laws. And when illegality occurs in democracies particularly concerning the protection of minorities then courts step up and determine if elected officials violated basic constitutional provisions intended to protect individuals' safety, freedom, property, civil liberties, equal treatment under the law, plus others. If after court determinations made following a regular judicial process politicians fail to comply with the outcome then the electorate loses faith in institutions created precisely to ensure that the establishment adheres to rules governing power. This erosion undermines the basis of democratic governance. When trust erodes so broadly that a state fails to fulfill obligations of good behavior toward potentially hostile actors, including itself, then it forfeits all claims to being considered sovereign and thus ceases to exist as a self-governing entity. As the foundational premise of a modern nation formulates itself in terms of a "We the People" vs. "The State," that foundation continues to crumble resulting in accelerated collapse that ultimately transforms cities and states into failed entities.
