I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the right thing to do and in some cases better than others because you never know if there are people around who can't make rational decisions due of age or illness... They're only disagreeing with your statement "morality is objectively true." They don't believe that morality occurs entirely within our heads; they say a person may have a moral code which guides their actions, but that someone else could find those actions morally unacceptable as well (e.g., killing an innocent child).
