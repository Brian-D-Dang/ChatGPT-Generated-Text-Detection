While America may have a lot of power and influence in the world, that does not necessarily mean that we have a responsibility to intervene in all foreign conflicts. Getting involved in conflicts that do not directly threaten our national security can often do more harm than good, and can create more problems than they solve. Additionally, intervening in conflicts can be extremely costly and risky, both in terms of human lives and financial resources. A more responsible approach would be to prioritize diplomacy and pursue peaceful solutions whenever possible, and to only use military force as a last resort when all other options have been exhausted. Ultimately, taking a more measured and cautious approach to foreign policy is likely to be the best long-term strategy for protecting our national interests and promoting global stability.
