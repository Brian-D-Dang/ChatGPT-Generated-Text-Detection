You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the teach you how to compare apples and oranges. There is no better way to gain knowledge than to compare and contrast two things. So let's take a look at two things that most people would say are very different. You may think that this is just a way to get to the point of the article. I actually am against the idea of wearing a suit to work. That's a whole different article. The point of this is that I think we have to look at things differently to learn from them. I hate to say it, but the suit is just another pair of pants, with a tie and jacket. The truth is that they are very similar. They both have a shirt underneath and pants on the outside. If you think about it, that's the same thing as a pair of jeans and a shirt. They may look different, but they're just different styles of the same thing. We can use this idea to understand how people and places are alike. We think of a place as a totally different thing, but it's not. It's just a place with a different style. People may dress differently or eat different things, but they still have the same needs as everyone else. They just express their needs differently. The best way to learn is to compare and contrast. I like the way you think. There are always lessons to be learned.
