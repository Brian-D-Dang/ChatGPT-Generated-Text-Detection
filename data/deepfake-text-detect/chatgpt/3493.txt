First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a sense of entitlement or lack of awareness of how personal responsibility and accountability play a role in one's life. Can you offer some insight or advice on how to approach these types of posts and discussions in a respectful and constructive manner?
