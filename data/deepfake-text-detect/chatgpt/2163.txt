I believe that "Buckle up, it's the law" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority] which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they don't agree with you. But I think he said many years ago when we introduced mandatory seatbelt laws here: 'It doesn't matter if 90 of New Zealanders are against this and some Maori whanau and MPs get hysterical; all you need is 10 who aren't.' And guess what? The government still got quite enough support from those others so that I passed these anti-smoking bills through Parliament."
