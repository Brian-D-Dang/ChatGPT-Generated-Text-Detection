Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking about how he could have been one of them. He is stranded there because he feels guilty that humanity has taken over Earth and wants to return home. I am now reading the movie version, written by Ridley Scott. And it struck me how much like the book the plot was. It reminded me of how excited I got when Robert Heinlein wrote "Starship Troopers." This novel is set in a world where humans are conquering all life on other planets including the planet Mars. A man named Matt Damon plays Mark Watney, who is a NASA scientist (one of those scientists who wishes he was a pilot, not a scientist) living on the Red Planet with his live-in companion, Natalie Portman, who only knows Mark for her ability as an actress. They meet each other at a science conference. Then they start running out of supplies, and something starts going wrong: Mars is getting colder; water becomes scarce; and they're facing starvation. So they go into survival mode. But things get more complicated than that. They must find ways to turn off the grid power so they can survive without electricity or heat. They also need to find ways to cook food, since the air is dry and poisonous. Food gets bad faster and worse. Hunger strikes. They look around at all these other people suffering with no way to help themselves but to die. I'm sure you've heard this story before: If we don't stop doing what's killing us, we'll die too! And it's true... But that wasn't my main takeaway from the book. What made it special to me were two parts: 1.) The ending. I won't give anything away here; the film does a fantastic job of letting the reader know exactly why this particular event took place. But if you haven't read Marco Polo yet, watch the trailer first. It will make sense. 2.) The characters. As I said above, we knew Matt Damon would play the title character (we even saw him try out for the role). We also figured that Parker Bouvier, the one who runs the company that makes Mars rovers, had to be played by actor Michael Fassbender. And for some reason, I expected Matt Damon to have more lines than Scott did in the entire movie. I would have preferred a big voice actor, but whatever. Still, every major player in the book was well-developed and believable. Several important players were introduced at different points throughout the book. When I finally learned on page 607 why Parker really wanted to cash in his chips and run away, I felt like he deserved a good sendoff. And then I realized that he didn't actually want to be alive anymore. That's interesting... Tom Hanks and Jeff Bridges in "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (Photo: AP) - Advertisement - After Tom Cruise joined the cast as Postmaster General Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 2006's "The Post," fans of the famous letter writer might question whether he still has any acting chops. Here's the thing: The man was kind of rusty back then. In fact, after making his name playing eccentric menaces like Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jon Voight's Thomas Jefferson in "Angels Demons," Cruise went back to being pretty serious. Since then, though, he's gone from mostly working with directors who have never directed before (like Cameron Crowe, who directed his debut flick, 2003's "The Natural to working with directors he hasn't worked with before (like Ridley Scott) and stars he's never worked with before (like Jeff Bridges), plus co-stars (like Ben Affleck and Julia Roberts) and even occasional comedic roles (like the time he appeared alongside Sandra Bullock and Brad Pitt in the 2009 thriller "Live Free Or Die Hard. So, why the sudden influx of comedy work? Partly because, during his latest recent interview, Cruise revealed that he found himself in a situation very similar to the ones depicted in the new FoxMarvel TV series "Agent Carter." Back in 2007, while promoting "Avatar," he talked about his struggles starring in a comic book adaptation based on the movies. At the time, he called it "a complete disaster." Turns out, the studio changed their mind, casted John Favreau as director instead of Christian Bale Saving Private Ryan, and eventually released the movie (which came out later that year) to mixed reviews. Now things seem different. While many fans may criticize "The Post" for its lack of historical accuracy, it definitely seems like they were right about one thing: Despite some flaws, it was entertaining. All of the actors - especially Stone (who played Nixon), Stahl (Sen. Blunt) and Sterling (Johannesburg Wall) - performed admirably. Plus, Cruise seemed to enjoy of.
