The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line in an attempt to start a debate; I'm just talking about why it doesn't get talked about more typically - the idea seems so self evident or not controversial at all. I've always wondered how one reconciles this with cases like Griswold v. Connecticut where SCOTUS struck down state laws criminalizing interracial marriage by saying they violated the 14th Amendment but also ruled Roe vs Wade unconstitutional on similar grounds (i.e., denying privacy rights).
