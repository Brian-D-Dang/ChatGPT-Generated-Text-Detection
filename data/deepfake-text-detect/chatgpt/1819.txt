America has accomplished nothing in its history that makes it worth of such widespread pride and love by its people (particularly this time of the year). Every event that Americans celebrate is really just a rehash... A few years ago I attended an emergency department conference where we were told about how to phone up our local fire services. The consensus was, if you could not reach them on 112, then for safety's sake call 999 - they had no trouble connecting with us that way! Many thanks from your correspondent in Australia
