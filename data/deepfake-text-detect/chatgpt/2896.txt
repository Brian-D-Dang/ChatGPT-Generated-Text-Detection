The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as wedding dress) and therefore does not exactly apply to this sub. I think it's fine here because you can still see her arm tattoos even when she wears clothes that cover them up
