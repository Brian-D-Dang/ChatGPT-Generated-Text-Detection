The idea is not to infringe on anyone's right to express themselves. If someone wants to have and film adult consenting adults having sex then they are free to do so but it becomes illegal for them to remain silent about this obviously inappropriate behaviour going forward." "All of a sudden this has come into our attention as an issue," she said, adding: "We've had pretty much zero response from the public with respect to this legislation." She urged anyone who feels uncomfortable about their own sexualisation of young people in the UK to speak out. Ms Graham added that from her experience, other European countries including France, Germany and Italy were well-aware of these issues before the Brexit vote happened at the last minute when they passed laws allowing women to objectify children under 18 years old without parental consent. The legislation followed reports girls were sexually abused by older men during the referendum campaign as teenagers. Mr Hague told journalists working to help victims of abuse, including the Foreign Office minister and former prime minister Theresa May, that he was trying to establish what would happen if more than one person objected to children being sexually assaulted or made indecent images of children growing up.
