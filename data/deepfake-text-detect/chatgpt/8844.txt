To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to people who consider themselves separate from the majority of human beings. But these reforms won't change how this country is presented. They will only make things worse for people like me. And that's why it was important for them to pass this legislation.
