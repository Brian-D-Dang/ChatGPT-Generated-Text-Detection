I am a husband and father of two. I love my wife, and I love my children, but I am not a fan of Father's Day. I feel the "holiday," if we can call it that, puts a lot of pressure on dads to live up to certain expectations or stereotypes. Some dads might feel like they have to be extra macho or the provider, while other dads might feel like they have to be super affectionate or nurturing. In reality, there is no one way to be a good father. Anyone who cares for and supports their children is already doing a great job. Perhaps instead of focusing on the traditional celebrations associated with Father's Day, you could take the opportunity to reflect on your relationship with your children and think of ways to deepen it. You could spend the day doing something fun with your family, or you could sit down and have a heart-to-heart conversation with your kids about anything that might be on their minds. Ultimately, the most important thing is to show your kids love and support all year round, not just on Father's Day.
