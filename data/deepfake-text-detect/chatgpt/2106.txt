What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy get challenged by the ideas in question (e.g., white supremacy). As I suggested above, we can say that some of these very truths were suppressed during this period partly because those who held them didn't seek to cohere with dominant discourses; they sought instead "to cut loose from what had come before." The first step toward doing so was refusing to accept common sense interpretations based upon a shared understanding - by which I mean any interpretation accepted within society on account of social consensus rather than argument or evidence - of how things work. Such new understandings generated questions: How do things really operate? What constitutes reality itself? In other words, Enlightenment thinkers questioned their own worldviews through logical analysis, unearthing assumptions about nature, human knowledge, and values embedded deep inside conceptions of the physical world around us. They also looked inward for more profound reasons. Some came close to despair over what seemed like senseless cruelty inherent in human affairs while others found comfort in religion following years of iconoclasm against Christian art and architecture. Yet each equally confronted his or her own lived experiences outside conventional beliefs. This self examination revealed one overriding fact: no matter where you go, there you are! These people began questioning themselves and often concluded that the only way forward lay in radically rethinking our notions of morality, rationality, freedom, equality, power and even timespace relationships at large. Thus idealizing 17th century philosophy today largely means romanticizing intellectual rebels, arguing that Cusa should have been able to turn back a Black Plague without sacrificing anyone's immortal soul, Voltaire could publish Candide amid religious wars across Europe and Newton would still be alive if he'd learned different tricks when dating girls. It simply ignores inconvenient facts on the ground -that many philosophers just wanted peace and quiet after centuries of warring tyrants corrupt monarchies. Philosophers rarely ever fought battles but they did theorize consequences.....
