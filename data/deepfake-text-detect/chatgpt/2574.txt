Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the new bill introduced by Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO), it would be illegal for any public official - or private citizen with access to confidential government information - to give inaccurate and misleading statements without first seeking authorization from Congress or state legislative bodies before making such claims publicly. This draconian law wouldn't stop anyone who has already committed perjury on their taxes...or deliberately misled you as part of some elaborate ruse designed to make extra money. But this bill would require that every single person - including, presumably, Bloomberg reporters - must go through an extensive bureaucratic process before they could report anything about politics or policy matters which might contain even the slightest hint of inaccuracy. That doesn't seem like something most people are going to do willingly...especially if they have no intention whatsoever of engaging in journalism. In other words: The current version of this bill targets not only journalists but also bloggers online commenters. Is this really what democracy looks like? Do we really want our elected representatives determining whether reporting from inside Washington DC should be allowed just based upon how accurate or honest it was? We know how well that turned out when Romneycare passed Massachusetts.
