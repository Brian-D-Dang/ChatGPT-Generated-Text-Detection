Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: One for pointing out that there's no need of a gambit shift since we have an explicit knowledge about whether our opponent is not; though I hope by now, people are aware of what kind of reasoning this game relies on (i.e., "if P then Q" without any concerns that one does not know if P or P). Another delta goes to JL who pointed out that there were some grammatical errors in my first draft, which I corrected before publishing it. Also thanks to all those who found time to read it[1]. A few months ago[2], when many philosophers debated over refinements about Knowledge Paradox (s), I submitted an article entitled "Knowledge Paradoxes" which had the goal to explain why, contrary to popular belief, the philosophical paradox has been around for centuries and doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. In short, despite appearances, knowledge paradoxes do exist but they aren't really new at all - they're just novel enough to make them more intriguing than their usual counterparts like Gettier cases. But as someone familiar with both logic and philosophy, even reading through articles like these can sometimes leave me feeling lost so here's another attempt.[3] For starters, let us take a look back to Aristotle, whose views formed the basis for modern-day thinking about Truth and Knowlege. To him, truth corresponded to reality. While being true also meant having real power,[4] he believed that truths could only grasp actual things while lying propositions couldn't pick up anything except falsehoods. The opposite would go for falsity as propositions known to be false wouldn't necessarily be true either because from his perspective, truth didn't mean correspondence between reality and something concrete - it only referred to consistency across meaningful statements. This view wasn't entirely unsurprising because Plato shared similar ideas decades earlier. However, Aristotle's definition of lies produced a peculiar problem: If we claim a proposition to be true yet its negation turns out to be correct, isn't that lie just technically speaking? Although technicalities don't matter much given Aristotle's emphasis on consistency, critics could argue otherwise. For example, consider that the statement 'If God exists, everything happens' is coherently argued to be true although it doesn't actually follow from other propositions. Taking into consideration such counter examples, perhaps we should say that lies shouldn't always exclude veracity[5]? Herein lies the challenge: How exactly can we tell whether something corresponds to reality or not? Because knowing contradictions are impossible seems contradictory too, we must find other ways to distinguish them apart. And if inability to differentiate means impossibility, how come we often claim lack of insight or ignorance about certain subjects? That is where the notion of contradiction comes in handy. It might sound odd but paradoxical claims cannot contradict each other because eventually every contradiction will turn into a tautology unless further details are provided; therefore we can safely deduce a set of logical rules called modus tollens[6] that will guide us towards finding out about whatever subject under investigation. What makes this method useful is that questions concerning formal objects like beliefs as well as those pertaining to intentions, mental experiences or metaphysical entities can usually be reduced down to simple ones of necessity and possibility. So far this looks pretty straightforward but there's still a lot more to talk about. There's a difference between analytic sentences which refer to symbols and synthetic ones that contain words that communicate content.[7] A sentence may hold value based solely on meaning or it can possess significant additional information as long as the speaker assigns significance to it somehow. Synthetic statements carry along a subjective component whereas analytical ones strictly stick to meanings as dictated by appropriate signs alone. As a result, a language user who uses syllogistic arguments to reason is likely performing deductive inferences while speakers relying mostly on intuitions are making inductions - the former insisting on a lawlike connection while the latter embrace loose connections instead. Within epistemological frameworks, a distinction of this sort matters greatly as inconsistent reasoning is deemed fallacious while induction is taken seriously but not axiomatically justified. According to Immanuel Kant, synthesizing requires common sense while analysis needs rigorous deduction possible across different languages and cultures. Of course, that's just part of it since besides assuming universal validity, Kantianism takes Logos -the source of human rationality- as self-evident. In addition to dividing humans into categories[8], Kant formulated five Categorical Imperatives namely respect for persons, keep your promises, treat others equally, never harm animals nor break promises (often translated as Act according to maxims) and act on feelings rather than principles whenever a conflict arises. Other prominent theories include those proposed by David Hume, John Austin and Saul Kripke among others. From the wide variety of approaches available nowadays, those who subscribe to naturalized epistemic schemes tend to practice logicals differentiation due to the vast majority of garbage in the original fogie-mailing off right after setting off typists to continue persistent waywardness, leaving
