The word 'natural' implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless we explicitly make it clear that plants don't have consciousness or human-like qualities (which would be absurd), what's the point in saying "I only eat things that come from the earth"?
