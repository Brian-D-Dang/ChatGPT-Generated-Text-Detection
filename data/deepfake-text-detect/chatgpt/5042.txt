First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from people who don't realize that just because a lot of the posts are insulting or insensitive doesn't mean they aren't sincere about what they're sayingasking for sympathy based on their "feelings." Also, I bet some GD fans would disagree with you if they saw it as hateful towards Christians. I agree more than most redditors do and so I wouldn't want that to be true though lol
