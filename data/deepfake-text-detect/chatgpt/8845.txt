This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding. For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force people to pay way too much money for the same service. Why do you think this has become so common? I can't find enough evidence of deception at this point to say it's worth paying more than 60month and not going crazy over demand with only one contract.
