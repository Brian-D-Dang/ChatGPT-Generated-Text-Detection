A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, I had to have fireworks thrown at my house. It was a very large firework display, and it was a good deal of money, so I had to pay for a solid set for the attendees. It was a cool idea to pay for a few extra bucks, but I'm not sure how to handle this kind of crowd. I'd love to have a tiny, indoor firework display so that I could spend a few dollars on properly set up.
