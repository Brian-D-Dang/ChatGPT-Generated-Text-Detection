While it is a tragic and difficult issue to address, raising the height of the bridge rails can actually be an effective measure in preventing suicide attempts. While it may not completely eliminate the possibility of someone attempting suicide off the bridge, studies have shown that raising barriers can act as a deterrent and potentially save lives. Additionally, it sends a message that society values the lives of those who may be struggling with mental health and is willing to take action to prevent tragedy. Refusing to take action could be seen as neglectful and lacking in compassion for those who may be at risk.
