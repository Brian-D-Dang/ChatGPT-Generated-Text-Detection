Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: one for the "best in the whole world" and another for the best qualitative review overall. Spring is always a great time to be alive, so when I heard that the delta competition was cancelled due to Covid-19 I knew it would have been a good opportunity to get more people involved in our community
