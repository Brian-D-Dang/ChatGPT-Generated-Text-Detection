A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was removed for a change to make it more balanced. I mean... it's not like they're gonna kill you. You can still use it and watch their back since the NCs are already dead anyway.
