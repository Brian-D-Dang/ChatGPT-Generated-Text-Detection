As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not a wise investment of scarce resources. It is not fair to force society to pay for medical care that is not necessary. The medical system is riddled with waste and fraud. Money that could be used to help people who are truly sick is being squandered on treatments that do not work. Insurance companies waste money on bureaucracy and profits. Money that should be used to help people who are sick is being wasted. It is the government's responsibility to make health care affordable for everyone. When more people have health care, health care costs go down. The government should not force people to purchase health insurance. There should be a cap on how much money insurance companies can make. It is good to keep insurance companies competitive.

It is more cost effective to provide health care for everyone, rather than pay for emergency room visits. Everyone should have access to affordable health care. Private insurance companies have more incentive to control costs than government programs. Everyone should have access to affordable health care. Health care should be treated like education and housing. It is a basic right. The government should not limit the amount of money a person can spend on health care.

We should have more doctors. We should have more clinics. There should be more research on how to make health care more affordable. The government should use tax dollars to help pay for health care.
