With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more attention paid to those who have committed crimes. The FBI reports that 4,000 Americans are killed by police each year in violence against blacks alone while 96 of blacks commit minorities at least one violent crime per capita compared with 47 whites.
