Ok, view changed. I guess I meant that there was an arbitrary double standard between alcohol and pot in the workplace, as opposed to saying employers don't have a basis for discriminating against people who are stoned on their own time. There's also no basis for thinking it would be harder or easier for someone with addictions to deal with being around other substance abusers (which is what we're talking about here). That doesn't seem like your point at all. As you say, that's why employees can use legal substances while working...as long as they stop when they get done using them. And yes, this does apply to marijuana too. So if a cannabis user gets high during work hours but stops before getting firedfired, then that would not count towards the reasonableness of his firing. But if he continues to smoke weed after work hours until he dies because his company requires him to do so, well, that'd be a different story entirely. That same employee might still refuse a promotion based upon his employer's execution of its drug policy though - even if those policies aren't necessary to remain at-will employment status. It does strike me as interesting that you've had 43 responses from people telling you that your argument has merit without understanding my earlier comment, where I made that exact point: "the fact that she was able to use marijuana at home and continue her career does nothing to change the situation." Her job wasn't dependent on her ability to consume legally purchased drugs; instead, it depended on her continuing to perform competently at that position for which she got paid. If she didn't wish to accept a promotion, fine. She could quit. Otherwise, the person proposing the increase couldn't fire her simply due to her inability to abide by his rules regarding recreational drug usage. I'm arguing that her termination should be considered reasonable due to her failure to comply with said rule. You want to quibble over whether the potential ramifications of her drug consumption outside of her stated shift were more severe than her termination? Fine. Do that parallel your case against the manager who fires someone for excessive absences. He agrees to let the employee make up any unapproved overtime. The employee refuses to come into work one day per week for two weeks straight. Does the boss have cause to terminate the worker based on his agreement to extend sick leave? Or does it only matter that the employee failed to take advantage of a benefit offered to him by the company? You brought up intoxication. Intoxication isn't equal to impairment, nor are both necessarily indicative of poor performance. Just consider alcoholics; most of us carry these traits to varying degrees, though some may not show many signs in public even when impaired to various degrees. Despite that, our society tends to treat alcoholism pretty much the way we handle other illnesses namely, separate out the illness itself from the identity of sufferer (s), deny them access to certain resources, and punish them accordingly. How exactly do you propose eliminating that stigma? By defining intoxication as something that must reach a particular level or else cease to exist? What happens if somebody is intoxicated yet performs perfectly well at their job? For example, an alcoholic who serves food drinks to customers safely every night sure seems to meet the criteria set forth in terms used to describe "impaired" workers, but how exactly do you account for such cases? Obviously, individual companies will need to develop their own standards relative to things like acceptable levels of drunkenness depending on local laws customs, but you haven't given any concrete suggestions beyond equating cocaine use with smoking cigarettes or drinking beer. Let's try again, shall we? I think part of the confusion comes from assuming that I am supporting socialized medicine. Indeed, I feel strongly otherwise. However, I would support a system whereby everyone receives medical care regardless of income, insurance coverage, or health history. A plan similar to Medicare exists today, and in practice works quite effectively, though perhaps not perfect under ideal circumstances. Even for folks like myself whose current treatment for chronic pain involves pharmaceutical interventions rather than surgery or chiropractic treatments, Medicare covers off-label uses of these medications. Everyone pays into the program through payroll deductions, essentially creating another form of taxation if not a consumption tax since medicines cost money to produce. Moreover, doctors receive a salary tied directly to patient volume, preventing either overtreatment or undertreatment of patients. Imagine a government hospital system in place instead of private hospitals! No one would ever see a doctor unless absolutely required, and emergency situations would never arise. In short, it would keep costs down and create a framework in which all citizens afforded basic healthcare services without having to worry about if their ultimate insurer will cover their service. We already pay taxes for national defense, education, infrastructure maintenance, etc., so paying extra to ensure universal healthcare makes sense. The idea behind my proposal is simple: bring back the American Civil War. Call it 'Medicare', call it 'Social Security', whateverit just needs to happen now, immediately upon taking office.
