The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to understand what they were trying to say at the time - some being misconstrued and used as loopholes for unpopular legislation that would have been otherwise unenforceable. Page 1 Through a combination of legislative trickery and honest efforts at compromise, both houses passed a bill (HJR 5) on January 12th 2004 which repealed part 3, section 22 of Article 2 of the Massachusetts Constitution. This constitutional provision preserved "natural law" marriage: this meant any man could marry a woman provided he was not married or had sexual relations with another women before their wedding day. The new state religion has no room for such nonsense; so Section 11A was inserted into Chapter 272 of the Acts of 2004, which became effective New Years Day 2005. It states: No public official shall discriminate against any person based upon his or her religious beliefs. This is great news! Now we can be legally discriminated against again!!!
