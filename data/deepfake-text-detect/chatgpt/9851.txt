I'll try not to spoil anything here for people who haven't watched Game of Thrones, but this post is specifically about events in that show. So if you don't watch it, this post won't make a lot of sense. In the show, there are a lot of different characters and plotlines that come together in unexpected ways. One example is the relationship between Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow. Despite coming from completely different backgrounds, they eventually form an unlikely alliance and even fall in love. This union eventually leads to Daenerys giving birth to a child who could unite all the kingdoms and bring peace to Westeros.
