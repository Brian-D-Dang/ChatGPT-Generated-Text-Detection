While Game of Thrones does feature lots of violent scenes, it's important to understand why rape scenes are particularly triggering and upsetting for some viewers. Sexual assault and rape are traumatic and personal experiences that have long-lasting effects on the victim's life, and this is something that can't be compared to simply another act of violence. Additionally, mainstream media has historically portrayed sexual assault in ways that perpetuate harmful myths and stereotypes about rape, which only serves to further harm survivors. So, to say that being offended by a rape scene in a show that also features violence is ridiculous downplays the harm that sexual violence can cause and dismisses the lived experiences of rape survivors.
