I believe that people have a moral obligation to donate money they do not need. Full stop. But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of taking on social responsibility and it does not care if Americans become lazy, irresponsible or stupid with their time and resources. If you want something from me then I should be able to get out of doing something without being forced by an agent representing said entity. Wouldn't that depend on how others interpreted your words? For example, were those who support the theory "should" instead expressed as, "the right thing to do." And even so, would any one person's actions define society at large? Or only when combined multiple individuals act in concert toward an end goal? To me, such questions are left open for interpretation by anyone else reading my work; this makes them free speech which we all enjoy. However, now onto the part about government: Should our rights be limited because other parties have decided upon specific interpretations? The courts already ruled otherwise regarding abortion...so what's next for civil liberties one might ask? No matter where the answer lies, neither one of us has complete faith within ourselves....nor should we expect a perfect outcome either way. Never forget history, man! Ever! Now let's move on: Originally posted by uuuuuffinfan:"Why don't we just make everyong pay taxes? Thats fair and everyone will earn his keep!" -richard hughes This may seem like an assumption, but there was no mention anywhere of whether he actually meant to say that taxation is inherently unfair. Or did he mean to implysuggest that most forms of taxation are unfairly applied against him personally? My point isn't really clear here...but perhaps I'm wrong and he can tell me later today once he gets back online. Assuming he means to argue for general fairness rather than personal chit-chat: No war tax in the US lol. There's also a national sales tax too. It varies over state lines though. Oh yeah, and some states require drivers' licenses. You could buy insurance across borders pretty easily too. All of these things reduce income while increasing costs (if done correctly). So arguments against paying more taxes than necessary due to convenience aren't valid by themselves. They're simply cost savings measures in regard to taxes paid before realizing them. In the case of the first two points above anyway. Sorry for missing that LTCF post but I had been busy. Here goes...and apologies again for the long response... Revenue vs Cost It depends entirely on what type of service is provided. Most services fall into several categories: 1. Goods sold to consumer (s), e.g., coffee shops charging customers 2 2. Services rendered directly to consumers by providers, e.g., doctors billing patients 3, etc.3. Taxes collected from buyers of goods and services, e.g., excise taxes 45. Services provided by governments, e.g., police protection 6. The difference between 1 3 is the percentage charged versus the actual amount received. The reason why businessmen charge higher prices for services is to cover overhead expenses (e.g., marketing, advertising, production, labor, office rent, etc.), whereas taxing businesses provides revenue based solely off of profit margin. This leads to increased prices for consumers. Similarly, increasing demand causes price increases, leading to shortages and rationing which saves money (for both buyer and seller). Note that rationing helps increase supply, i.e., rising inflation decreases real wages, therefore decreasing demand causing reduced job growth until equilibrium returns. Shifting money away from producers towards consumers means less producers needing to hire workers to produce new goods and services, thus creating fewer jobs overall and lowering employment rates overall. Taking money away from businesses (taxes) discourages investment thereby reducing economic output and spurring unemployment. Every dollar taken from the pie shrinks the size of the pie leaving remaining dollars behind for consumption (i.e., benefits). We trade commodities for each other via currency (banknotes coins) through banks. These bank deposits are always worth 100 cents. Therefore, integrating currency functions much better than dividing a piece of cake among ten people and then allowing the same 10 persons to divide up amongst themselves. Currency promotes stability by encouraging stable economies since buying and selling takes place mostly with fiat currencies having value based on trust rather than hard assets. Allotments As noted previously, allotment systems tend to favor wealthy land owners (landlords) as opposed to poor tenants. Such allocation mechanisms lead to socio-economic polarization whereby many acquire wealth at the expense of others. A phenomenon similar to oligarchy (rule of a small number of powerful elites) arises wherein political power becomes concentrated in hands of few who hold financial interests. Also termed "power concentration," this phenomena perhaps best describes present day globalisation coupled with increasingly complex regulations promulgated by agencies of central government directed towards regulating commerce.
