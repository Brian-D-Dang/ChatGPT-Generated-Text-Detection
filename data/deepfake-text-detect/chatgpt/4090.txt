The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustratedcritical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single -minded, self-obsessed behavior can be turned into a sort of running joke about narcissism (the word was coined by Bruce Lee). I don't think this is true though.. I know plenty of jerks who have good girlfriends! They just can't handle being with someone else because it makes them feel alone or unloved.. Their personalities aren't meant for others if you look at their past relationships. It's not an "ancient" idea either... You can Google narcissistic personality disorder to learn more information on it.
