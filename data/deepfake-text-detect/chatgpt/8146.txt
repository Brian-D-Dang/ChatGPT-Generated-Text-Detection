For whatever reason men commit about 80-90 of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where women are the actual victims, but even those don't look so great - 30 or less on average depending upon country and type (usually theft). The overall point is to understand what people do not by looking at it as an isolated event; instead try replicating our actions over time with different groupsinstitutions under varying conditions...and you will find quite quickly if your hypothesis holds true then this would be evidence enough against any non biological explanation because there isn't some sort "non moral" factor involved here...it's just biology working its way out across all societies whether male dominated dominant sexual cultures vs female ones etc!
