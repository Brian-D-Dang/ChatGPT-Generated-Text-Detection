I'm not asking anything about why we self harm - trust me I've got many answers for that. My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is bad, but when they say it's bad, only in a specific way. It can be violence, or hate crimes etcetera, and of course some people who do self harm don't have the other options listed above (which you would know if you looked at their situation). Self harming means acting upon your feelings rather than trying to distract yourself with things you like doing. Well, this isn't really true. People will usually give more reasons than just saying "it hurts," which I think says a lot about how they feel about themselves. For example: "The fact I'm depressed makes me want to cut myself"
