I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately calling for her resignation. It is difficult not to talk about public figures who are being attacked with such intensity but also for them to be able to act as if they don't have any real problem at all. One of the article authors said that these people should be ashamed because it shows a lack of care. This is what I think is important. A lot of the articles that use this excuse are trying to blame the media on the fact that Caitlin Jenner has more power than many other celebrities. This is true. She does seem like she has no control over how the world sees the news which makes me very uncomfortable. She will never ever become famous again so I guess we can assume that she actually cares about what people think when they see her headlines. There are plenty of stories out there that say women are now slut-shaming men and that has caused a lot of anger among women around the world. Well that doesn't stop from women like us. We just need to start taking responsibility for our actions, take responsibility for our behavior and learn that we do care. We need to change our attitudes toward ourselves as well. If you are looking for ways to help others understand why we aren't thinking more like them or feeling better about yourself, please consider meeting with someone who may appreciate your story, offering tips on how you can make use of your resources for positive change.
