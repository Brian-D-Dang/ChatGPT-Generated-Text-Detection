First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person who has seen both sides of many debates on parenting styles and it's really hard to find common ground with anyone when there are so many opinions out there. So let me just say what everyone is thinking: "Another baby screaming? That's gonna be fun!" But now for my two cents as someone else pointed out earlier... she was probably doing some sort of therapy (both parents) or perhaps had been through breastfeeding class. Because it doesn't take much research at all to figure out why babies have such bad cries. They cry because their instincts tell them they need food and water right then. The mother only nurses her child once every 2-3 hours if that long due to time constraints while working fulltime, but even nursing frequently can cause crying too often. At least one feeding every hour will do wonders during those short periods where mom must go back to work for 8 hrs straight. And yes, breastmilk may make up half your calories daily..but babies also eat other foods like solids and fruits and veggies which require quite an amount of energy to digest properly - these nutrients don't come easily unless you feed regularly enough throughout the daynight cycle. Babies learn to regulate their own hunger and thirst cues after 6 months old which means they develop a sense of their body's needs faster than adults most times. This enables quicker responses necessary to surviving outside of mommy's womb. As soon as kids start eating solid food, usually around age 3, we should begin encouraging our children to drink more water instead depending upon how early they started drinking milk before birth. Water helps keep us hydrated which keeps us healthy. A bottle fed infant drinks barely anything until he has teeth and wants something in his mouth besides milk which causes him to want more later regardless of whether he ate 5 minutes ago. It sounds harsh, but it's true nonetheless and the best thing to happen to infants since TV came into being! We can then talk to our little ones about proper nutrition without having to worry about using words like clean and nutritious And please folks!!! Please do NOT stop breastfeeding your baby no matter HOW LOUD THEY ARE OR WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING ON WITH THEIR EYES!! This isn't the 80's anymore! Just bc you don't care for breastfeeding does not mean others shouldn't either ...and actually telling people they were 'just born that way' is downright disgusting IMO. All women are different physically anyways and we each produce different amounts over the course of pregnancy and childbirth; therefore our bodies create hormones differently based on individual physiological differences between ourselves and our partners etc etc. Some days feel good and some days suck pretty badly....the same goes for men too. Stop judging and hating on someone simply bc they didn't choose to grow inside another human body Don't judge a book by its cover!! You never know whats going on behind closed doors!!
