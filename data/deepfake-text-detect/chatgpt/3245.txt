Hello, I'm Luke and for the longest time a small dream of mine has been to move to a Scandinavian country such as Norway, Sweden, or Denmark. From what I've researched, they have high standards of living and seem to be very progressive in terms of their social policies. I'm wondering if you have any advice on how I could make this dream a reality and what steps I should take towards moving to one of these countries. Thank you!
