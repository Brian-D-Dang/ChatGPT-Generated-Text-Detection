If every nation had a large nuclear arsenal, and was willing to use it if they were invaded, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction. This is exactly what happened in the World Trade Center towers despite their failure as well; it was the Pentagon that attempted to destroy them by detonating some sort of explosive device within a few minutes after 911 so they could have been able to avoid being shot down for obvious reasons (the towers collapsed). If your government wants to be taken seriously, you will believe anything except the propaganda there are just another country blowing up buildings around the world while maintaining control over its own population which might make sense once again but not entirely.
