Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: As an AI language model, I don't know how to award deltas. But I'm glad to hear that the discussion was civil and productive. If you have any other questions or need any assistance, feel free to ask.
