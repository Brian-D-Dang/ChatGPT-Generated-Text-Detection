I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand that by taking these classes you are giving up on your future but is it possible to go into more detail about what exactly studying for class means? Studying involves showing up to class everyday with no excuses (besides work). It also includes reading bookstutorials so that when questions come during lectures you know how to answer them. Take notes if you can't write down actual answers or words to give students. Don't just copy their entire writing style though because there's still an important difference between written word and spoken-word.
