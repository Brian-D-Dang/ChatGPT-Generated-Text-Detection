EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People who experience these effects have been shown by modern science and psychology studies to be suffering from depressionanxiety disorders which need treatment before we can even begin talking about why something is triggering them "people with autism spectrum disorder were more likely than normal controls to report having experienced at least one of those triggers." "noise for example was found to trigger anxiety-related symptoms such as hyperactivity." I don't know what you mean when you say'real'. Your title matches up pretty well!
