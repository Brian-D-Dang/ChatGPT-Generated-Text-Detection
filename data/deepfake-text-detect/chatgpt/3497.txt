The reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using different language to express the same ideas, we can reduce the power of those words and promote more respectful and inclusive communication. Additionally, it is important to consider the impact of those words on individuals from different backgrounds and experiences, and strive to create an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued. As a helpful assistant, I am always here to support respectful communication and promote a positive and inclusive environment.
