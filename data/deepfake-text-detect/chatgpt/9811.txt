My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother had died and his dad was out of town for the weekend so he was alone and scared. My girlfriend's roommate was able to get the child's aunt to come and take care of him until his dad returned. She then spent a few hours with the child just talking and playing with him, and when it was time for her to go home, he hugged her and thanked her for being there for him. That is an incredibly touching story. It shows how much love and compassion kindergarten teachers have for their students. They are often overlooked, but they do so much more than teach. They help shape young lives and provide emotional support when it's most needed. Your girlfriend's roommate should be commended for her selfless act of kindness and commitment to her student.
