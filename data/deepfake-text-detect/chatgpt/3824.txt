I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying he was a right winger who has no place in the GOP (and that's pretty much what it isthe guy's National Review). It seems like everyone agrees on how bad of an idea that is now...
