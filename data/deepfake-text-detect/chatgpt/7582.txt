While it may be true that there are no legal consequences for parking in an expectant mother's spot if you are not one, it is not a logical or ethical action to take. These spots are designated for pregnant women who may have difficulty walking long distances or need easier access to the store. By taking away these spots, you are inconveniencing these women and potentially putting their health at risk. It is important to consider the needs of others and act in a considerate and ethical manner, even if there are no legal consequences for doing otherwise.
