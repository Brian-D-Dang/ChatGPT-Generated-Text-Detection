A possible counter-argument to this opinion could be: While both MLK Jr and Harriet Tubman were great leaders who fought for the rights and dignity of minorities in the United States, they made their impact in different eras and in different ways. MLK Jr was a symbol of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s, which sought to eliminate legal segregation and discrimination against black Americans. His advocacy for nonviolent resistance, his powerful speeches, and his emphasis on love, justice, and equality inspired millions of people and helped to change laws and social norms. However, Harriet Tubman was a trailblazer of the Underground Railroad, which operated from the 1800s to the Civil War era and helped to free thousands of enslaved African Americans from the South to the North or Canada. She risked her life multiple times as a conductor of the secret network, making 13 missions and leading 70 people to freedom. Tubman also served as a spy, nurse, cook, and recruiter for the Union Army during the Civil War, and later became a suffragist and activist for the rights of women and African Americans. Therefore, arguing that MLK Jr should replace Jackson on the 20 bill instead of Tubman could be seen as overlooking the unique contributions of Tubman to the abolitionist movement, the military effort, and the democratic ideals of the United States. It could also reinforce the notion that black women's achievements are often marginalized or erased in history or society, compared to those of black men or white women. Ultimately, both MLK Jr and Harriet Tubman deserve recognition and honor for their courage, vision, and impact, and the decision to put Tubman on the 20 bill reflects a more inclusive and egalitarian view of American identity and values.
