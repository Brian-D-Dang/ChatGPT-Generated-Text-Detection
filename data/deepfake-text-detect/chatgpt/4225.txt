So, I saw a commercial today about a pill that helps with BED, and I did a bit of quick research on it. From what little research I did, it seemed reasonable to me (if not too good to be true) that the pill would help me out greatly in the bedroom department, which is my primary focus at the moment. I know this may sound silly but I have been planning to start taking a bedside pill soon enough for months now - so please excuse any mistakes or inaccuracies! The main idea behind Bedrest Pill was that if you could take a bunch of pills all at once then they would work better than taking them one by one. It's also supposed to speed up sleep cycles so your body can get to rest earlier before waking later. And as an added bonus - it will stop things like constipation and acid reflux from happening when you're trying to lose weightadd pounds. You only need 10mg at night right? So basically - why wouldn't someone want that?!
