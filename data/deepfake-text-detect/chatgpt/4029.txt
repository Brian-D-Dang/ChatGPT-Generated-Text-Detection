First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. She's looking at her phone and has a very difficult time understanding what you're saying while she talks. You start by asking if she wants help. She looks confused for a moment then says no thanks because she doesn't need it. I think that would be passed off as suspicious behavior, but it depends on your circumstances
