Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll leave it up for those that want to see all of the responses (some are pretty nasty). I did notice your comment about the "publish count" thing in LJ...which might explain why you feel like people disagree with what they're reading at times; whatever is published gets tallied AND is made public on the forumson-line version - where nobody has full control over who can read whatever they wrote. If anything were hidden away only visible by authors (and approved moderators) then there probably wouldn't be quite so many disagreements as we do now anyway;)
