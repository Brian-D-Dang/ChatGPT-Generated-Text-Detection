I have recently been told that my pro-life position is "forcing my ideas on others." I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary. No, i think it would be great if people driving around with signs saying "this isn't right" aren't being forced to type out their views in the classroom and use the words "you're an abortionist!"
