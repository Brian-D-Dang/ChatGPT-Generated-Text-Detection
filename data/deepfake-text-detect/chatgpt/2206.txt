I like Bernie, love his politics in fact. I doubt there is a politician I agree more with. I like the fact that, unlike most politicians, his rhetoric matches his policies and he's actually able to bring about change when it counts (on healthcare for example). That said, he has no chance of winning against Trump or Clinton because we live in an age where damn near everybody takes stupid sound bites over actual policy That thing you just mentioned...that everyone wants simple answers instead of complex ones? Yeah..we're fucked if all these fucking idiots keep electing people who believe they can fix everything by throwing money at problems
