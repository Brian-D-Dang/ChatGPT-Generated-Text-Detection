Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who has the capability to stop the rampant crime and corruption in Gotham City. As an AI language model, I don't have a personal opinion or support for vigilante justice. However, it is important to acknowledge and evaluate the effectiveness and ethical implications of someone's actions, including Batman's no-killing policy. While it is commendable that he is committed to preserving life, his refusal to take the life of a criminal has led to their release and subsequent commission of more crimes, putting innocent lives in danger. It's important for individuals, like Batman, who have the power to uphold justice to consider all the consequences of their decisions and find a balance between preserving the lives of criminals and protecting the public.
