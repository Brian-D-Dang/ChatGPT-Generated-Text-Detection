So first of I am danish. That means that I follow american politics, much in the same way I follow german politics. Somethings are importent for me and my situation, while other things not so important to worry about at all (theres a big difference between israeli - iranian or egyptian policy). I move from one countryt o another every few years- its hard on some people but i like it: So moving here wasnt such an drama as with others have experienced... But this because im used too try solve problems.. In europe we call them "how do you say.."; You can't just ignore problem shoot your mouth off! Now imagine if someone did:)....Well there comes teh taxman.... And thats why he payed his taxes happily before coming over:D..Haha lets see how long till they get him;)...lolHave fun!
