I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for murder and then they die, there's no excuse. You can say that we are under a constitutional decision...we don't know what could happen in our own country or where this could lead us. We do not know exactly how it will affect us, but I hope to see you next time!

The answer is yes - because men reduce their risk of developing a breast cancer diagnosis by 50 over women, while women keep their baby-bearing status (or in some cases a family history of pregnancy). Women can also benefit from having kids. I was a member of the 'Women Are No More Dangerous Than Men' movement until I started researching gender parity. Since my first exposure to feminism I've come to realize that women are more likely than men to hold more power in finance and banking. Honestly, it seems like a pretty narrow divide between those two fields. A lot of people think of economics as something which men are better at dealing with, whereas other professions tend towards more feminine aspects - especially financeaccounting. In fact, as a woman I agree with your comment about women being less risky than men. There are always safety barriers to getting work done; however when you let your mind wander around about what you want to be and how things will play out, you feel more connected to your job and its enviroment. With more female labor being performed by men! I find that I am rarely able to finish working, so most of my freelance hours are spent searching for employment, volunteering etc. I would love for women to gain input into the workforce, but are often limited in their ability to read jobs (sometimes even worse) and understand potential benefits such as paid sick leave and free childcarelunch breaks, these things add up to an average salary of 70,000 per year. That said, my wife and I can still make off 100K a year in this industry during her lifetime. It doesn't matter if she works full time, or if she just finds it hard to get out of bed after work, or whatever other thing. Somewhat related: My wife is a certified nurse practitioner and I am a certified medical professional. As far as I am concerned, both of my employers refuse to recognize me as a qualified physician. I regularly work in customer service where many of my clients are elderly ladies due to lack of insurance. However, I volunteer for our local hospital where my patients need to get care for themselves at least once every few months. When I have clients visit, the nurses start paying special attention to their patients and more importantly, they pay a very good price for it.
