Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself As an AI language model, I don't have personal thoughts or beliefs. However, It's worth noting that many democracies allow citizens to vote regardless of whether or not they pay taxes. This is because the government is responsible for providing services and upholding laws that affect all citizens, not just those who pay taxes. Additionally, the ability to vote is seen as a fundamental right in many countries, and denying someone the right to vote based on their tax status could be seen as discriminatory. Ultimately, it is up to each society to determine the requirements for voting, but the prevailing view in most democracies is that all citizens should have an equal say in how their government is run.
