I do not support GMO's and do not want to consume them. Many other countries have restricted GMO's because they don't consider them safe alternatives. I personally don't believe that the amount of research into these products is enough for us to make an informed decision on whether or not we should be consuming it, especially when many scientists in both academia as well agriculture are against this technology being brought forward without more testing. You got downvoted by someone who probably doesn't even know what GMOs stand for lmao
