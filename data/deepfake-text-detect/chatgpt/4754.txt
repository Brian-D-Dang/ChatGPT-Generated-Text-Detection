Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than others. It also usually means these individuals refuse to acknowledge those with a different culture are valid without having to do anything about it, thereby rejecting diversity and tolerance of other culturesbeliefs as well as helping foster animosity between groups instead of promoting harmony among them. Without this form of cultural bias or identity politics ingrained into society, problems like racism would not exist because there would be no need for people to refer to themselves as being superior over someone else just by virtue of their race, religion, ethnicity, gender etc... but rather all human beings could be treated equally regardless of any characteristics we may have which might make us look "superior" to another person. This is why I feel so strongly about this topic, multiculturalism should always be encouraged, especially within countries where prejudice against foreigners already exists, that needs to be stopped before it becomes too late. If the world continues to treat everyone equal then eventually racism will disappear. As long as it's allowed to continue existing on some level then we are going backwards and continually feeding our own fears rather than admitting the truth and making positive changes towards equality instead. Consideration of alternatives: For instance if you consider the fact that many Western countries tend to allow uncontrolled immigration from various areas around the globe yet at the same time close off theirs to immigrants from outside Europe - this shows how literally most western nations discriminate against outsiders. There are plenty of reasons to give other countries such as China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand etc... much less power and influence over international affairs compared to European powers historically, however I don't think anyone can deny that happens now but let me explain. One thing that tends to come up when discussing nationalism vs globalism is what exactly globalization actually entails? The term itself implies a single unified whole whereas nationalistic societies often seem quite fragmented, though most of us probably don't realize this until something goes wrong and for example the Middle East or North Africa become engulfed in turmoil due to political instability. In reality most countries today are separate entities which are still linked together through trade agreements, shared borders etc.., but obviously one nation's success doesn't automatically mean everyone else's can'r prosper, hence giving rise to economic inequality and poverty across almost every corner of the planet. So while it seems whatever you want to call globalization has been occurring since ancient times anyway, perhaps it was really nothing new after all. Not sure if this helps your argument but thought I'd share my thoughts nonetheless. So anyway hopefully this helped shed light a bit into why nationalist policies aren't good for an entire region, but they're certainly great for exploiting resources of certain regions to benefit whoever currently holds the reins of government and ruling party. Independent minded people who stand opposed to centralized foreign control would never support such blatantly discriminatory policy and thus my third point of contention regarding nationalists.
