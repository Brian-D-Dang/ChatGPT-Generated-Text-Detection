The expense of a higher education has been a hot button issue for a number of years but the fact that students take on huge loans and graduate with huge financial debt is not surprising. It's also got to be acknowledged that the government needs immediate funding while there are plenty of other priorities in place to help offset the cost. One way would be to keep tuition rates low, something we can all agree should never happen again. Another very important consideration is how we have made sure our students know their rights and deserve equal opportunity when it comes to applying for jobs. Early detection of efforts like this proves that we are far more responsive than most people think.
