I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot someone who is not armed or posing any threat to them? A Simple answer... because they are trigger happy and don't understand that life isn't Call of Duty
