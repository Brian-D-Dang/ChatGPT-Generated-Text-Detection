First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't make me "normal." And of course the entire argument hinges on my mental state as well but let's put it another way: You're advocating for people to start committing acts simply because you find them weirdly satisfying? That makes no sense at all! So...why do we even have this discussion?! It's like arguing against cannibalism directly. shrugs I agree. Some of my friends are real boobsies about these things while others just ignore them. Personally, there is some value in expressing yourself and being able to look at something without having your mind forcibly warned off from looking further into it (or worse). Even if you don't want to participate in such activities the idea alone can be appreciated by onlookers and potential participants alike. If I were playing on a team where people would notice if I didn't wear underwear......like say....the Seattle Seahawks.....yeah.................I'd probably consider wearing thongs or something other than what comes out of the back end of me...lol.......but then again....it might hurt the image of the team too much so....no thanks!!! "The Seattle Seahawks are serious about winning games," Carroll said last season. "We talked about that before training camp started. We're going to win every game out here. There will never be an excuse given why our guys aren't ready to play. If anyone has any reservations about their readiness - physically, mentally, emotionally, whatever it may be - then he should take himself out of the equation right now. This one is dead simple."
