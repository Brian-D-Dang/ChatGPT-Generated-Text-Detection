I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying that he was "stupid" for thinking like that but they weren't suggesting why his point of view is wrong; just calling it stupid on its face! The weird thing to me about how people react when an idea seems so ridiculous or absurd in some way: It's always because someone has suggested something similar before (or very nearly identical), as if we can know where ideas come from by looking at their similarities... without bothering to look into them any further than what other people have said who are already invested in a particular set of beliefs. We're all stuck inside our own bubble somehow blinds us to things outside of it which seem obvious only within.
