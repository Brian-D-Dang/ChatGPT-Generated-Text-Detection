Now in the spirit of fairness - I believe this to be true for all governments, but in this case I'll touch upon the U.S. gov. First of all [Lusatania] and later on they will set up for it." The President said he backs the United States' efforts against terrorism because terrorists can't afford any more illusions, saying "there's no reason for them not to fight hard enough" with impunity by publicly criticizing the government of Iran. "I know that there are people who want sanctions lifted," Trump added. "So we have got it right now... We've been talking about it before why shouldn't we start doing something? Why shouldn't we?" Trump also noted that he told Saudi Arabia that Tehran is preparing "a massive new missile program," which he called "something very difficult." He expressed confidence Iran would soon understand its responsibility, implying Tehran could build a nuclear bomb capable of hitting Washington Doha next month if needed. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif recently warned that Iran was standing ready to confront Russia over sanctions relief granted under the 2015 deal to keep Iran from developing uranium enrichment capability at the request of Moscow. Iranian officials say Tehran plans to enrich uranium to two purity level when negotiations resume after four months of suspended talks between Tehran and six world powers aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons capabilities ahead of a scheduled U.N. Security Council meeting on Tuesday. The meeting involves leading U.S., Russian and Chinese negotiators as well as Iran's nuclear negotiator, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Javad has urged Iranians to join him in opposing sanctions imposed by Western nations in response to Iran's violation of international rules governing commerce with Syria. Iran previously threatened retaliation if sanctions were lifted unilaterally during talks in Vienna last November amid accusations that it had violated terms of the 2015 accord. Iran maintains its atomic activities violate UN Resolution 2231 adopted on May 6, 1980 to prevent it getting permission to acquire uranium enriched above 2. Trump reaffirmed his support Friday night for sanctions waivers for Iran along with other countries backing the deal reached earlier this year through which Iran agreed to modify its compliance measures across several fronts while remaining committed to its commitments under the agreement describing it as "positive progress" toward achieving security goals including combating global warming and restoring diplomatic ties.
