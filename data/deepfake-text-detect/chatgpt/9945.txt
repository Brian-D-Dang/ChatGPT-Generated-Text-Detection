I am a husband and father of two. I love my wife, and I love my children, but I am not a fan of Father's Day. I feel the "holiday," if you can call it that, is a way to pressure fathers into buying gifts or doing something special for their families. I would rather spend time with my family and create memories together than worry about buying expensive presents.
