It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet. I've always found it particularly annoying when you're trying to relax, reading a book for example or just watching tv at night but can still hear the revs of their engine from 100yards away - even if they have the window down! To me this isn't only an annoyance - its totally antisocial behaviour on behalf of these drivers who think they own our roads as well as having no consideration whatsoever towards others, especially childrenelderly etc..... I'm sure most motorists will agree (even though some may not be able to resist commenting otherwise) why should we suffer because one selfish set of individuals can't put up with minor restrictions imposed upon them?....so lets all get together now before any more damage is done stop this menace onceforall!!!!!!
