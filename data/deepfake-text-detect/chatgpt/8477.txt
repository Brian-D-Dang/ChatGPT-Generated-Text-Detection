The likes of ratheism argue that most of the world's problems come from religion, and that a post-religion world would be miles better. As humans, we inherently drive ourselves into situations where our values are in conflict with each other (such as when your mother tells you to stay away or go near something she doesn't want her baby crawling around). The only counter argument I've ever heard is this: "Well what if people don 't have religious beliefs? Who will teach us about rightwrong?" My question then becomes why does whether one holds different moral views matter more than how many hold them vs not holding any at all? We're going through an interesting stage on earth now were technology has advanced so much; but yet there seems no end for concentration camps etc.. Is it really likely religions may carry out their worst actions again since they seem intractable towards change which could benefit society greatly without sacrificing too deeply held belief systems such those based upon holy text by some groups.
