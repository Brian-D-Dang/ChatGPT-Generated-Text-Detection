Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of disagreement between these two authors about what even counts as a "historical Jesus." And that's a problem. Carrier seems to say "Jesus was a mythological figure who was later mythologized into a historical person." And Fitzgerald seems to say "Jesus never existed at all." That's a huge difference, and I think that is causing the disagreement. So: What are the criteria for a historical Jesus? Is it the same as the criteria for a historical Julius Caesar? For a historical Socrates? Or is there something specific to a historical Jesus that makes this line of questioning unique? I think you'll get a lot of different opinions here, but I would say that a Historical Jesus (HJ) is a person who actually lived during the time of the historical era he is supposed to have lived in. That means that there is objective evidence that he lived, and was a real person who is the focus of a group of people who knew him andor who came after him. A historical Jesus must also have a known origin. That is, there must be something that can be traced to the time and place he was supposed to have lived, that relates to the story of his life, that can be attributed to him. That source should be objective, verifiable, and uncontested. On the other hand, a mythological Jesus is a person who never existed. His life and stories are purely fictional, but the details are taken from the time and place the HJ was supposed to have lived, so as to make him "authentic." The fictional Jesus has no origin, and the stories are not linked to the time and place that the HJ is supposed to have lived. The fiction is usually connected to some other pre-existing story, and there is no objective evidence that the fictional Jesus ever existed. That's my definition of the terms, at least. posted by APower at 1:55 PM on August 29, 2008 [3 favorites] Also, I find it interesting that Carrier only has a problem with the "historical Jesus" theory, not the "mythological Jesus" theory. This implies that he is only concerned with the existence of the HJ, not whether the HJ existed in mythological form. posted by APower at 1:58 PM on August 29, 2008 Fitzgerald seems to say "Jesus never existed at all." That is not what Fitzgerald says. He says Jesus' "existence" (whatever that means) is impossible to prove, but he also argues that the minimalist position, that Jesus was a historical, flesh and blood figure, is the most reasonable and most supported by evidence. posted by Joey Michaels at 1:59 PM on August 29, 2008 From Fitzgerald's book The Jesus Puzzle: "The best answer to the question of whether Jesus existed is a qualified no." The whole book is available online. posted by King Bee at 2:01 PM on August 29, 2008 "Historical Jesus" is an oxymoron; since when do historians deal with conjecture, supposition, and mythology as historical facts? posted by Vigilant Citizen at 2:02 PM on August 29, 2008 [1 favorite] posted by Ouisch at 2:03 PM on August 29, 2008 I think that Fitzgerald is saying that there was no Jesus who lived a full life as a historical person, but that there was a historical person named Jesus who was mythologized later. So, the existence of a historical Jesus is not actually impossible, but the historical existence of a historical Jesus is. I'm just curious, what do you guys think of a different criteria for a historical Jesus: the criteria that was used by the Romans when they investigated whether to persecute Christian groups. In other words, what would have to be known about Jesus in order for the Romans to have persecuted his followers? If he was a real person, and he was at least a little influential, then it would make sense that they would investigate him. They did investigate a lot of other people, and I don't think they were very good at finding out exactly who was a follower of whom. But, Jesus would have to have been known to
