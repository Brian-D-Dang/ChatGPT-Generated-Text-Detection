I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the standard way around. I have 2 sets of shelves inside, one set is for food storage (on both sides) while another smaller shelf sits at an angle next those two big ones so it's easier access from either side or if you need something in between these three layers." - Rachel B - New Orleans LA
