This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point was to say that such argument could be used against itself and explicitly deny it as an argument for any particular policy preference. I think "slippery" in this case refers more specifically to how people use their own language than to issues like substance abuse. Slipping on some ice would not necessarily imply slipping into alcoholism; but neither would using words meanfully (for example) suggest that he will enter into drunkenness when one uses them sloppily.
