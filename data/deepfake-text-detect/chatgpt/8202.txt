I'm not sure at what point people stopped thinking about the ramifications of their actions and became so head strong that they believed they were invincible, that officers judgements were wrong. It's one thing to learn from your mistakes but I can't help feeling when it happens over again you really should be held accountable for these types off errors in judgement! What does this say if nothing else? It has a snowball effect; everything becomes "okay" as long everyone believes other departments are using stun guns on suspects etc.. The rest is history (and maybe we will get some justice now). God knows how many times cops have gone out with an attitude or just plain lost control because someone dared them!!!!! When did being able too use force become optional??? Where do all those injuries come into play?? You'd think there would need something along lines like having 2-3 teeth knocked back by rubber bullets before anyone was allowed anywhere near ya...but noooooo!!!! Police brutality....is only reserved right: To police themselves while maintaining plausible deniability among colleagues who either condone such behaviour otherwise don't want more paperworkan investigation their own personal records tarnished than necessary.....there needsa change..............somewhere up high!!!!!!!!
