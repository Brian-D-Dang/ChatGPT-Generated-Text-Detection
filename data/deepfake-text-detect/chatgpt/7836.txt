It is not fair to simply categorize individuals as either "good" or "bad" as human beings have complex personalities and multiple facets that make up their character. People have different strengths and weaknesses, beliefs and values that shape their actions and decisions. Additionally, what may be considered "good" or "bad" can also vary between different cultures and belief systems. It is important to approach individuals with an open mind and strive to understand the multiple factors that contribute to their behavior in order to avoid simplistic and unfair labeling.
