I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. It felt like McDonald's who designed the machines to try and make sure its customers would never have some kind of problems getting a burger they wanted that wasn't theirs if it didn't taste good enough for them but steaming hot. Well, the story is that McDonalds went through with their plans and convinced McDonalds employees who built the machines so they could have as much fun doing it themselves as possible while keeping the profits flowing into the company coffers rather than paying high prices because McDonald's had zero control over their operations. Even as the company continues to improve its operation by hiring hundreds more workers (and taking out loans), McDonald's has been slow on improving its servers' paychecks without giving up much money from its own pockets. The true story of McDonald's v McDonalds isn't limited to the restaurant chain itself; it includes how McDonald's executives tried to get away with stealing from employees even though they knew there were no reason McDonald's would ever need all those workers anymore except for one of their own employees working alone at McDonald's restaurant locations with no kids around. McDonald's sued McDonald's claiming McDonald's executives chased up wages before bringing the lawsuit against McDonald's. McDonald's eventually agreed, agreeing not only to pay 8 million toward settlements between 1979 and 1996 but also to refunded that amount altogether. According to McDonald's lawyers, the company paid 542 million in settlements back then-CEO Stewart Butterfield during that period. This article originally appeared on Reddit.
