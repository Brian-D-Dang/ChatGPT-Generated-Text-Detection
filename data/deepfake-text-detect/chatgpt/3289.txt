With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more accountability measures in place to prevent unnecessary use of force by law enforcement. Some of the measures that could be taken include: 1. Mandatory body cameras for all police officers: Body cameras have been shown to reduce the use of force and improve police accountability. They ensure that all interactions between the police and the public are recorded and can be used as evidence in case of complaints or investigations. 2. Increased training in de-escalation techniques: Police officers should receive regular training in how to de-escalate situations and avoid the use of force. Studies have shown that de-escalation techniques can be very effective in preventing police killings. 3. Independent investigations: When there is an incident involving a police shooting or use of force, an independent agency should conduct an investigation. This will ensure that there is no bias or conflict of interest in the investigation. 4. Police accountability measures: Police officers who use excessive force or engage in unlawful behavior should face consequences for their actions. This could include reprimand, suspension, termination, or criminal charges. 5. Community involvement: Communities should be involved in the oversight of law enforcement. Police should be required to engage with the community and work with them to build trust and understanding. Community members should have a voice in the review of police policies and procedures. By implementing these measures, it is possible to create a more accountable and responsible law enforcement system that is fair and just for all.
