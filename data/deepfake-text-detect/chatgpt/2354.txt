Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, so let's just go over some of the reasons why it would be good for society if we mandated vaccinations: 1) It keeps people safe from preventable diseases (wouldn't you agree that this is generally desirable?) 2) People who refuse vaccines have no pressing reason not get vaccinated except their own ignorance and irresponsibility3) If everyone gets vaccinated then the risk isn't shared democratically4) When epidemics strike unvaccinated children are much more likely than vaccinated ones to die5) Vaccination reduces healthcare costs6) Vaccines can increase herd immunity7) These mandates protect the rights of individuals by preventing disease transmission8) The laws help us avoid conflict between two fundamental principles of medicine individual autonomy vs. collective health9) There is evidence that compulsory vaccine policies decrease rates of refusal10) This is probably what happened pre-194711) We do a great deal already on behalf of an infant too young or incapacitated to take care of themselves12) A large body of research supports mandating childhood immunizations13) In addition, there are present risks arising out of anti-vaxxer misinformation14) To quote one piece of evidence against my point above:"The American Academy of Pediatrics came down hard recently when it called for tighter regulation of all MMR [measles mumps rubella] shots following recent reports suggesting serious side effects could occur as a result."
