Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I don't want but still feel the need for. I have a couple of friends who are going over there and i added them on facebook. But then they just kinda disappeared off me like the end if high school. They've been gone since last september... I was wondering what's your experience with forgetful ppl? You know when you call someone and heshe says "i'll call ya back." What do you think will happen? Or is this not the time or place where you can talk in person?
