I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly relations with the public. I am not talking about extraordinary circumstances like a hostage situation or an officer in danger, rather just being approachable and treating everyone fairly regardless of their race or creed is important to maintaining trust and confidence from community members. To me this means that as a member of law enforcement you must be willing to engage with people beyond your job description. You may never need to take someone's photo when they are committing a crime, yet perhaps there will come a time where taking some good quality photos could help with investigating the case (involving criminal activity). It makes no sense for us to use our state-issued equipment only to respond to calls, so why shouldn't we also participate in proactive policing? If nothing else it keeps us current by learning new things, whether its on technology, investigative techniques or even how to drive. That way if something comes up down at the station, you're already ready instead of having to learn "on the fly." Just because we don't work directly with inmates doesn't mean we can't visit them or know what goes on within them; we should always be aware of these situations and keep our eyes peeled for any suspicious behavior occurring around these institutions. So many times when I stop along side my fellow officers on patrol I see other cops doing stuff out of uniform simply because they know better than their peers what might go wrong. This includes eating lunch, shopping, stopping over at friends houses, or playing pickup games with younger officerscivilians. These activities are great ways to get to know others outside of work without making too big of a deal out of it which is key to establishing relationships in the communities we serve. We aren't trying to replace family here, nor are we trying to overthrow the whole social order with one another, instead we want to form bonds through shared experiences that strengthen ties between each other. Many departments still frown upon fraternization amongst co-workers, however just because we're technically coworkers does not make us enemies. Despite arresting certain individuals, we cannot forget where we came from, hence why it's crucial that we maintain and develop friendships with those whom we once held prisoner or charged with crimes. So next time you feel tempted to say excuse me or make yourself scarce during coffee break try using some common courtesy towards other co-workers and remember this: Next time you roll into town maybe consider getting off the highway and checking out some local eateries...you'd be surprised! Monday, June 7, 2010 Based on past experience, most officers would agree that knowing the capability and limitations of various firearms is essential to your ability to perform a proper shooting review. In addition to understanding caliber size and barrel length, there is a misconception regarding capacity and magazine sizes commonly used by civilian shooters. As a matter of fact, most military issued weapons carry magazines capable of holding more rounds than advertised on the box, usually somewhere near 375 full metal jacket bullets. A 9mm round holds anywhere from 8 - 12 1 rounds depending on manufacturer. Some manufacturers provide proprietary 201 designs, whereas others include 26 rounds per mag.. Furthermore, due to increasing stoppages and malfunctions associated with.40 SW hollow points, practicalities dictated that larger calibers become viable in defense against large game. As such, higher powered rounds became commonplace for self protection, both inside and outside the home. 15 rounds, 25 rounds, 45 Rounds, 55 rounds etc....these numbers are simply facts. The point is, ammunition selection really isn't limited to an arbitrary number, especially if you account for standard deviation factors as well. Which brings me back onto the topic, reliability. What is good enough for police service often falls short when offered to civilians wanting to own more powerful handguns and rifles. Here are a few questions to ask yourself before deciding whether you require extra capacity: Is your gun reliable? Do you have ample training? Are you comfortable operating a pistol under pressure? Can you operate your weapon effectively under stress? And finally, How much damage can you cause before reloading is necessary? For example, a close range confrontation with 3 armed suspects would likely involve 2 separate shots fired simultaneously. Your first shot is probably going to hit the intended target, then the second will likely miss because the distance required to fire additional rounds dictates that they fall victim to bullet drop. An extended engagement with numerous targets indoors involving multiple reloads becomes increasingly difficult if you're unable to adequately track your weapon due to muzzle flip or recoil. Having realistic expectations before purchasing a firearm helps immensely when presented with similar real life scenarios.
