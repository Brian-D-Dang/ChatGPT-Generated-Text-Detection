It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing that has become clear from China's diplomatic efforts in Asia: China still can not be trusted with any authority beyond its borders - it seems you cannot trust anyone outside China unless you know them well enough yourself or your country exists alongside them. The Chinese Communist Party President Xi Jinping must have been thinking about how China would react if he was facing his own domestic problems than perhaps even if he had become the leader of an isolated nation fearing for his survival after last year"s election victory over a presidential candidate who promised to enact major reforms; after all Xi Jinping is a Communist party member himself - although he did campaign for Beijing in 2016 before falling out with the ruling elites rather than forming an alliance between himself and the popular opposition Party leadership. China does appear to be changing rapidly but it remains unclear what kind of commitment will be required given the different models used by some countries which have already started implementing measures against Chinese interference like Hong Kong independence (e.g., Taiwan independence), Taiwan independence, or Taiwan's independence attempt from Beijing. According to some observers, these changes are likely more politically driven than anything else because China now sees itself as the key broker behind events abroad including elections across Europe and Africa where its influence extends far past borders despite having no ideological ties within its borders away from China. In fact, China may never achieve complete freedom under Xi Jinping but evaluations of their adherence to international law implied there should be no shortage of explanations why the Communist Party cannot afford for such things to happen without consistent moral standards pressuring Beijing at home through censorship which certainly does provide reasons why China needs its own independent judiciary system. Additionally, China must really consider the impact of its influence on countries around the world since Western powers continue to believe they too need China while the rest of the world views China as an oppressive authoritarian power backing separatist movements across the globe using repressive policies such as censorship and human rights abuses. This observation - supported by reports suggesting China faces increasing pressure internationally regarding issues ranging from Iran to Venezuela to Russia threatening NATO allies the Ukraine crisis - simply isn't true. China also looks unlikely to compromise its position anytime soon due to crackdowns inside its borders since Beijing doesn't want to alienate allies involved in conflicts overseas via threats from outside nations hoping Xi will change course once he becomes leader again lest it be seen as meddling with internal affairs domestically whereas the West has no choice but to accept China becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign aid funding. Chinese leaders are neither invincible nor irrelevant considering they represent 70 percent of world population. As such, the Chinese Communist Party might have underestimated the extent of support amongst many people worldwide for new initiatives taking place concurrently similar to those being implemented globally towards improving Chinese governance practices compared to those needed to restore democracy elsewhere. If China continues to meddle effectively then it could threaten the sovereignty of other continents especially if attempts were made to boost Chinese influence further apart from Asia involving such countries. As such Pakistan and other potential adversaries could see China as a threat and leading states find themselves left exposed regardless of whether they fit into their agendas. In this case however, conflicts affect most of society so China's status quo shouldn't be viewed negatively just yet assuming the China project works toward achieving good relations among other Asian nations instead of suppressing protests happening everywhere else.
