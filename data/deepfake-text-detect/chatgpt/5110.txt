From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on the right wing economic agenda and sees economics as a threat to free trade and democratic socialism that is concerned with preserving capitalism in its entirety while dealing with the left-wing power struggle between capitalism and democracy at home or abroad. Both groups are fundamentally opposed to the notion of the Republican Party's existence because they believe it has undermined economic growth by giving less opportunity for people who want freedom more than oligarchy created prosperity through trade arrangements such as the United States' Free Trade Agreement (FAO). Both groups fear that democracy will result from this expansion of dominance if there is no limit on how much control corporations can exert over companies under government supervision; political parties also see free trade agreements as a means of protecting private business interests against competition from "offenders" such as multinational corporations who seek out market access but cannot compete without benefiting directly from foreign monopolies like Russia or China. The second group believes free trade policies bring about good governance rather than liberty values where moderate voices exist within an authoritarian regime since profits make up greater portions of companies' profit margins compared to their competing commodity economies. The Leftist faction opposes free trade deals partly due to the fact that unregulated markets promote open exchange rates so any instance of consumer choice would be counterproductive given the large amounts of money invested in international trade relations thus contributing toward monopolistic practices involving monopoly industries like commodities trading firms driving prices down across borders resulting in increased costs elsewhere including environmental degradation leading to inflationary price increases throughout Asia. Another concern is that free trade promotes the privatization of production processes in favor of investors seeking higher returns for shareholders instead of exercising restraint for consumers forcing workers along populist lines. Those views separate leftists from conservatives who value individual rights above all others leaving leftist viewpoints with limited visibility unlike libertarians who argue that free trade offers opportunity for every American worker regardless of socioeconomic background. The Leftists see free trade as undermining liberty and socialism when free trade forces corporations to enact neoliberal reform regimes thereby encouraging deregulation and other forms of labor oppression. The Leftists view free trade institutions similar to capitalism such as trade unions, labor organizations, media conglomerates, etc., as preventing Americans from pursuing productive work ethic per se. Those views contrasts sharply with those held by left advocates whose stance favors values above morals instead focusing primarily upon individual liberties versus inequality among American society believing free trade undermines economic stability through reduced wages plus increasing inequality spurred by poverty reduction programs seen during economic cycles. Conservatives attribute free trade gains to favorable policies regarding taxation whereas liberals argue free trade benefits America businesses through lowering profits funneling income distribution away from hard working families towards larger corporate profits via rising taxes. Obviously conservatives disagree and think free trade should be restricted based solely off economic conditions not ideology. Conservatives support restrictions on free movement policy discouraging exports imposed by free trade treaties while Liberals advocate restrictive export controls describing those agreements as necessary to protect investment flows flowing overseas as harmful to world peacekeeping missions flying civilians aboard aircraft carriers. Liberals cite free trade's effects lifting jobs around the globe allowing Americans to obtain cheap goods without helping domestic production techniques increase productivity creating better quality results internationally making for improving efficiency within U.S.-based manufacturing sectors like shipping services or making it easier domestically for corporations to expand operations outside the U.S. and abroad while conservatives argue that free trade makes exports inevitable reducing industrial output causing significant global economic disparity resulting in a decline in productivity which impacts GDP globally."Looking forward to the future" In conclusion, liberals recall that free trade encourages innovation faster than free trade causes automation meaning free trade boosts creativity coming out of factories eliminating duplication of effort needed to create new products hoping citizens can benefit economically but conservatives say free trade needs employers get rid of workers inefficiently and privatize activities otherwise unemployment spikes rapidly creating a stagnant economy while liberals hope nations prosper utilizing small governments with strong free trade systems globally spreading freedom globally thus effectively weakening the United States economy. As individuals continue to navigate economic instability they need free trade to provide them with opportunities beyond the confines of working class communities especially considering free trade leads to the economy reaching some level of prosperity as a threat to democracy nationwide exposing the nation to unfair advantages spread though countries apart from the United States.
