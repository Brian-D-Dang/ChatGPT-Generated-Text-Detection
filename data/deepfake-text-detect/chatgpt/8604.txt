I think English should not be the international language for these reasons: It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words here uBrotherChe makes a really good point, but it also seems like they are trying too hard. If so, maybe they can learn something new instead of making such an awkward mistake? It would have been funny if you said "the word 'anyhow'." I don't know why he thinks english is better than english.
