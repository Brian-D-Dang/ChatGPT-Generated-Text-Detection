I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our national debt is like a family credit card). When I moved to DC, I started reading The Economist, which led me to William Safire's NY Times column, and eventually to John Kass (both of whom I would highly recommend), and eventually my views changed. Now I consider myself a social liberal and fiscal conservative. You would think that, given my politics, I would be in favor of a flat tax. Unfortunately, I'm not. I do think a flat tax would be fairer, as it would eliminate the bias towards the rich, and it would be more efficient in that it would reduce the number of accountants and tax lawyers. I also think that the majority of people would find the simplicity of a flat tax attractive. However, it seems that a lot of people are against a flat tax. These people, which you can find here, claim that it would harm the middle class, increase the national debt, and create loopholes for the rich. I agree that the flat tax would, in many ways, be unfair. If you're living on social security and don't pay taxes, you'd have to pay 6000. For a low income family, the first 20,000 of income would be tax free. For rich people, income over 400,000 would be tax free. Now, the first problem I see is that I don't think that social security should be counted as taxable income. I think that the money that I pay into social security is for when I'm old, and that I shouldn't have to pay taxes on it. Second, I don't think that a family of four should pay 6000. I think that a family of four, making 20,000, should pay no taxes. Third, I don't think that a family of four, making 400,000, should pay 2000. I think that a family of four, making 400,000, should pay 30,000. I don't think that the first 20,000 should be tax free. Now, maybe I'm just biased towards my parents and other families who make 40,000year, but I think that it's unfair to make a family of four who makes 400,000 pay the same amount of taxes as a family of four who makes 20,000. The second problem I have with the flat tax is that I don't think the rich will end up paying the same amount of taxes as the middle class. You can take a look at this article, which compares the flat tax to our current tax system. First, let's look at the tax rates. Economist: 10 Current System: 10 So, under the flat tax, rich people would pay 10 of their income. On 100,000, that would be 10,000. On 1,000,000, that would be 100,000. The same amount. However, it's not the same amount. I'm sure that if someone made 1,000,000, they'd be able to afford a tax attorney, and find ways to cut the taxes they pay. I'm sure that if someone made 100,000, they'd have to rely on TurboTax. Rich people can afford to spend money on tax attorneys, which means that they'll be able to find ways to cut their taxes. The rich won't pay the same amount of taxes as the middle class. Another problem with a flat tax is that the rich will have to pay taxes on all their income, and they'll end up paying more taxes than the middle class. If someone makes 1,000,000, they'll have to pay taxes on 1,000,000, but if someone makes 30,000, they'll only have to pay taxes on 30,000. The rich will pay more taxes than the middle class. The third problem I have with the flat tax is that it will increase our national debt. At the moment, I think that our national debt is too high. I think that we should be saving money
