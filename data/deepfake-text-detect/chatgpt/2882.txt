I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to have atoms of certain element with more than two electrons. What determines if an atom is allowed to be so unstable? Note: The title might seem strange at first. It isn't the case that you can add extra protonsneutrons to any element and get an even number of neutrons; this happens only for ones containing half-integer numbers of protons (and thus also has integer values). So we don't really call them "even" elements. But they are always kept together by nuclear forces. If there were enough additional neutrons from fusing this way then these would repel each other enough to prevent nucleus formation altogether. This does happen sometimes when nuclei split into multiple parts during supernova explosions, though not very often in practice because our star cores are too large for neutron stars.
