Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the first spot that comes up is a blue one, and if it isn't there then no more spaces come available as they aren't really allowed to park on any road (I think). So basically unless you have friends with special plates or an accessible vehicle parked somewhere close by chances of finding your placard will be slim at best - let alone having someone help loadunload so "you don" t endanger yourself even further."
