I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with the bad news. No one can smell a smelly fish or a rotting carcass (unless you are in Asia), so there is no evidence that can link animal products to disease transmission. The good news? Fish and poultry are not linked at all to foodborne illness. Only animals processed from dead birds or mammals - pigs, sheep, cattle etc - do have a risk of transmitting bacteria. These animals could also get sick if they ate rotten egg salad, raw eggs, chicken feet or other body parts of dead animals which contain bacteria but these will not increase your risk of getting any diseases. In fact, humans who get ill after eating contaminated unpasteurised milk often develop an infection called 'hemolytic uremic syndrome', where small blood vessels burst within their bodies causing them to run out of blood quickly, meaning that their symptoms don't appear until hours later when enough time has passed for infections to take hold. Disturbingly, almost half of those affected develop diabetes. So what does all this mean for me as someone living in England? You might think that just because we've been told that animals aren't involved in disease transfer that doesn't make us safe. And yes, there are concerns about exposure to antibiotics in both human foods and in our environments through farming practices. But as far as I know, there hasn't yet been a confirmed case of people becoming infected by live farm animals themselves. Of course, livestock will carry diseases, even though they're much less likely than us to pass them onto us, but humans still need some protection against pathogens which could travel between us and the animals around us. As long as we follow hygiene rules and use proper sanitation techniques while handling our foodstuffs, this isn't something that should cause too many problems (in fact, there is very little chance that pathogens can always reach us!)
