First thing, let's assume the biblical Jesus is completely true. Now, I have a fair knowledge of the biblical tale, but if I say something wrong, feel welcome to correct me. In the story, Jesus was supposed to have been born of a virgin. This means that he had a father, but not a mother. His father was God, hence the term "Son of God." So, if Jesus was a real person, he had a mother, but not a father. He would have had to have been adopted. If Jesus was a real person, and I'm assuming that he was, then it would seem logical that he would have had a father. I mean, I'm assuming that God iswas a real person, and he must have had a father. It's just one of those things that have to be true in order for this myth to work. So, let's assume that Jesus' father is Joseph. Now, since Jesus had a father, I'm assuming that he had to have been born naturally. Otherwise, he wouldn't have had a father. And if he was born naturally, then he must have had a mother, which brings us back to the whole virgin birth thing. So, in order for this myth to work, Jesus had to have been born naturally, and had to have had a mother. Let's assume that Jesus was real, and that he was born naturally. I'm assuming that he was a real person, and that he was a man. This being the case, the logical conclusion is that he must have had a mother. Now, the Bible says that he had a mother, and that she was called Mary. This being the case, the logical conclusion is that he must have had a mother. And this mother must have been a woman. This seems logical, and it would seem that Jesus must have been a biological son of a biological woman. But, the Bible says that he was born of a virgin. This must mean that his mother was a virgin. It seems that I've just proved that Jesus wasn't born naturally, but was born of a virgin. I'm not trying to be a dick about this, but it's just hard to imagine that the Bible is true when it's so full of obvious holes like this.

I would think that a god that could have created the earth could have also created a logical problem that would disprove his existance.

It is much more likely that Mary and Joseph were just common folks and the story of Jesus was just that, a story. Not being a dick? Hardly. The story has no logic and is filled with holes.

But it seems to me that the Bible, even with all the contradictions, is a story that is intended to be believed. I know that stories that are intended to be believed have a logic, but I don't know the logic of the story of Jesus. It seems that the story has no logic and is full of holes. You know what's weird about the whole thing. If it wasn't meant to be believed, then why did it need to be written? I mean, if it's not true, then why bother writing it? I'm sure that there are plenty of people who would be willing to believe it, regardless of whether or not it was true. But why go to all the trouble of writing it? I can see the need for it if it was true, but not if it wasn't. I mean, why spend the time writing a story that you know is not true? Why bother to write it at all? I guess it could be because they are trying to have the last laugh, but it seems strange to me. I know that stories that are intended to be believed have a logic, but I don't know the logic of the story of Jesus. It seems that the story has no logic and is full of holes. The logic? Every
