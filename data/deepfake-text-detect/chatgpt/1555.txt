NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but newly built housing in Manhattan could only be controlled by set rates determined democratically through referendums every few years (or else the buildingtenants can seek their own action plan). I believe there's a huge middle ground between letting people live wage jobs paying 24K to subsidize someone who lives at home with mommy while working part time as a bartender. And having an endless supply of luxury apartments available from Long Island and Jersey.
