While it is true that people are often driven by self-interest, this does not necessarily mean that socialismcommunism cannot work in today's society. In fact, many successful societies have implemented socialistcommunist policies that have benefited people greatly. Moreover, socialismcommunism is based on the fundamental idea of communal ownership and cooperation, which can actually foster a sense of community and a desire to help others. Additionally, the idea that people are inherently selfish is a blanket statement that ignores the vast range of motivations and values that society possesses. Ultimately, socialismcommunism can work if implemented in a way that supports cooperation and collective benefit, rather than relying solely on individual generosity.
