Country music was not always bad. There were legends such as Johnny Cash who defined what country music was. However, today the country music culture is full of songs about trucks, beer, and girls wearing tight jeans, and it tends to be fairly homogeneous in terms of sound and subject matter. Nonetheless, there are still some talented and creative musicians who are pushing the boundaries of country music and bringing new energy and innovation to the genre. It's always good to keep an open mind and explore different types of music, regardless of what category they fall into.
