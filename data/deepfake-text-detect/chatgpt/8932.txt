Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I want to meet up with. So, if you haven't already planned your birthday party, how do you feel about this? How would it go if everyone had special guests or just a little bit of everyone? It will happen very quickly. I have 5 friends over and there are going to be lots of different parties. We'll all be in the same town together. It won't necessarily be a big one though because we've never met each other before. So it's not like the whole thing is gonna be huge. I hope everyone feels safe!
