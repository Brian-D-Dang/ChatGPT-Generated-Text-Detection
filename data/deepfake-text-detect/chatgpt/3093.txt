EDIT: a portion of replies I'm getting are focused on the defination of'libertarian' and the rainbow of american groups that claim it for their particular beliefs. If in doubt, replace'libertarian' with'smaller government'. I can't believe how many people seem to think this is an argument against Libertarianism as if you don't want smaller government then why would you support libertarian candidates? People saying things like "Oh we have too much Libertarians here" isn't even close to being related to political philosophy or ideology.
