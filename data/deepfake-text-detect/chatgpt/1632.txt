I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry atheists. You're supporting those things and they all fall under "the right to personal freedom." You can make your point without being an asshole about it.
