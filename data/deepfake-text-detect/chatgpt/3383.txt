This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movie] , and the [casting of a black actress as Ariel in the live-action Little Mermaid] . I understand that representation and diversity in media is important, but why does it matter so much that fictional characters be played by actors who match their race or ethnicity? Shouldn't the focus be on finding the best actor for the role, regardless of their race?
