I was only able to find one other thread about this topic, and it was kind of a train wreck. Common arguments: "It's not Jraphics Interchange Format" by that logic, you can't use MMF with PNG images; if you're going to insist on using the non-free Java package ImageIO (as I do for my own reasons), then why should anyone else be forced to as well? Of course now we have an open source replacement in FontForge - which is actually great because at least there are resources available to help port things from free software into free software! Still no excuse for missing out though... By that rationale, X11XnView would also have been abandoned when GIMP came along instead... in fact, before FF even existed;) FontForge has always had a 'font directory' feature where you could import larger sets of font files, so it really isn't any more work than what people already did with their existing graphics programs. What's wrong here is asking others to rewrite their entire workflow just because someone wants some icons over at the side of his page or whatever - but still makes me wonder how much time older users like myself spent solving problems they never knew were possible. I know within half an hour of starting on something with Manga Studio 5, I've created something completely unusable, while the same task takes hours with Photoshop; clearly, the windows version requires less skill to get usable results faster. It shouldn't matter whether it's done manually or via an application anyway - why should anything require us to give up our tools just to make life easier for people who don't share them? EDIT2: Holy crap, what a mess he's trying to start! There's bound to be tons of issues around importing a large set of TTFs from multiple sources into a single program; maybe it works fine though... Razvan: Thanks for your comment. The main issue I see here is that most people bothered doing all these manual steps in the first place. This wouldn't need to happen if everyone simply used Free Software to begin with! As such, having native support built directly into the app doesn't solve the problem either, since we'd end up in exactly the same situation. Only a truly free alternative will provide compatibility for both old formats and new ones alike, without compromising the freedom required for proper maintenance.Reply TehSneakyBastard says..."Even if Apple releases FontBook as freeware, [iTunes] customers won't be allowed to sync fonts outside their computer." That statement is flat-out false. Do yourself and everybody reading this article a favor by calling him out on it: Reply
