View changed by a combination of the comments of uceleritas365 and uQwerkss: I guess we all understand numbers differently, but ultimately I think it really is lack of empathy more than anything else. I'm not sure how you could compare someone with an IQ of 150 to someone who has a significantly higher IQ (800) though? I'd say that if any of us were in their shoes we would be similarly affected, just perhaps because we are closer to our own level - at least when talking about this topic and having thought through these issues ourselves; if they didn't have similar backgrounds as was mentioned above it might be different. If anything I'm going for a relatively extreme example so that you can get some idea of what people like O'Brien may go through on a day-to-day basis.
