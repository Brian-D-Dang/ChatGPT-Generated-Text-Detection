First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a desire not necessarily to help others but rather to gain their attention or praise on how clever they are. I don't think so - just sharing my experience in hopes it helps someone else! If you have any suggestions tips for making sure these stories aren't self-serving, please share them with us:)
