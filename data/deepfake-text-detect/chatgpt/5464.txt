Before anything else, let me say that I am not, nor have ever been depressed, suicidal or abused in any way shape or form. My life so far has been excellent! It's incredible how much fun and interesting it is to read about it all by the author who wrote it anyway! Thank you for posting this wonderful book! I've checked out your blog, thanks so much for sharing!!
