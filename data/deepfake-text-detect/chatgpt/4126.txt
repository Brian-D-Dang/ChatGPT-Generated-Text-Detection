Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one partner is drunk andor horny? What do you do? I don't know why it's so hard to grasp that these people need time apart like a fucking marriage.
