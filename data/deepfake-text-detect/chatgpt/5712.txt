From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have his own issues. Like how he served in the U.S. House of Representatives for just one term, and he did so after losing the popular vote in his district. Or how his opponents in the election described him as a "spiteful, mean, narrow-minded, bigoted, and corrupt politician" and a "buffoon" and a "practical joker." Or how he was a leading figure in the Louisiana Purchase, but not without some controversy. Or how he was so desperate to raise funds that he opened a lottery that was illegal in some of the states, and so unpopular that it was banned in others. Or how he was never even a citizen of the United States. Or how his most popular accomplishment (the Louisiana Purchase) was only one of many, and was really a spur-of-the-moment decision that he hoped would make him popular. Or how he was accused of corruption in his dealings with the military and the navy. Or how he was an advocate of a scheme to provide money for state governments that involved the federal government loaning state governments money, which they would then pay back to the federal government by borrowing more money from it. Or how he bribed state legislators to support the scheme. Or how he believed in the separation of powers and the Constitution, but didn't seem to care much about the Constitution when it came to the subject of slavery. Or how he was a strong advocate of the doctrine of nullification, and defended it before Congress. Or how he believed in states' rights, but he also believed in "eminent domain," which is the power of the federal government to take private property for public use. Or how he proposed a tariff that would have increased the cost of goods for consumers. Or how he was responsible for the creation of the Second Bank of the United States. Or how he signed the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which required all new states to be admitted into the Union on an equal basis with the existing states, even if the new states were to be formed from territories that were already part of the United States. Or how he was a defender of slavery. Or how he was a racist. Or how he was not the greatest orator, and had a tendency to plagiarize his speeches. Or how he insulted a sitting president. Or how he was arrogant. Or how he was a philanderer. And yes, I can understand why people would want to get rid of him, but he was a military man and a war hero, so why not have some respect for the man? He served his country. Even if he did all of those things that I just mentioned in the previous paragraph. But don't take my word for it. Take this guy's word. Because there are some people who want to put Andrew Jackson on the twenty dollar bill. I'm sure this would be just the thing to add to the list of reasons that Obama is the worst president ever. And I'm sure it would be great to have the face of a guy who served his country on a bill that the president of the United States uses all the time. Even if it's not exactly the "smiling face" that Jackson preferred. Tax Man, October 16, 2014 at 6:32 PM You may not have heard of the "racist" Tar and Feathering of Andrew Jackson. Which is why he was never on a bill, because he would have been tarred and feathered every time he walked into a bank. Or a KKK rally.
