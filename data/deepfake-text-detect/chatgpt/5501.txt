This one seems so obvious to me but I'll provide the basic points: It is a person's right to do whatever they want with their own body so long as it isn't harming others. If someone wants to participate in what you say no matter how sillywrong or inappropriate, then why not? Because some people aren't really good at looking after their bodies and don't mean well enough that they could be considered "good" for any given reason People can choose whether they feel comfortable doing things like this. It doesn't make them bad human beings if they're allowed to express themselves sexually
