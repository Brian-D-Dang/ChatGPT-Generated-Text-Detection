I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing from this and the retailer gets away with price gouging by thinking that consumers are too cheap to spend more money on brand name items, or even if they do buy them, they will be charged an inflated price because foundation costs so much less. This hurts the environment far more than anything else in society. There's also the matter that some stores don't have the means to sell these items at the marked up prices and simply mark everything down to move the stock around. I've had people come into my store expecting me to drop 13 for "25 off" when there was only 8 left, not realizing that I actually didn't need 25 off and just wanted their stuff gone.
