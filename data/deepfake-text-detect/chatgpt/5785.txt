Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting down people. My hypothesis is that sex is a feature of the natural world. This means that there is a good chance that it is used as an adaptive mechanism in order to increase the number of offspring. It is the "thing" that we use to connect our bodies together in order to reproduce. I would like to make this as clear as I can. The primary function of sex is to have children. This is a hypothesis, and I know that there are many people who do not believe in the hypothesis. So how can it be a hypothesis if we don't believe in it? Well, if it is not a hypothesis then it would be considered fact, and if it is not a hypothesis then I have nothing to work with. The hypothesis is that sex is a feature of the natural world, and we are animals. Therefore, we would share the same characteristics as other animals in terms of our genitalia. What you say is irrelevant because it does not invalidate the hypothesis. My hypothesis is that sex is a feature of the natural world.

The link between having offspring and using sex is not a fact, it's an assumption. If you mean that there's a link between having offspring and using sex, then fine, but it's still an assumption. If you have evidence for the assumption then please state it, otherwise the hypothesis is not falsifiable. [rant] I'm sorry if this came off as rude, but I get sick of people claiming they have a hypothesis but then being unable to back it up or articulate it. But you are not the first to put this hypothesis forward, and I am not the first to respond to it. I have already responded to this by saying that I know people who do not believe in the hypothesis. So I know that there are people who do not believe in the hypothesis. So how do I respond to people who do not believe in the hypothesis? I respond with the same information that I responded to last time. The hypothesis is that sex is a feature of the natural world, and we are animals.
