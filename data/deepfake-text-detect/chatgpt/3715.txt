Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or any other weapon, they forfeit their own right to life and should be punished with the death penalty. I believe that criminals who are willing to use violence to harm others have shown a complete disregard for the value of human life and have made a conscious decision to violate the social contract that binds us all together. By committing such a heinous act, they have demonstrated that they are not fit to be members of society and cannot be trusted to live among us. Furthermore, I believe that the death penalty is an appropriate punishment because it provides a sense of closure and justice for the families of the victims. It also serves as a deterrent, as potential criminals would think twice before committing a violent crime if they knew that they could face the ultimate consequence. However, I am willing to hear opposing viewpoints and arguments. Change my view.
