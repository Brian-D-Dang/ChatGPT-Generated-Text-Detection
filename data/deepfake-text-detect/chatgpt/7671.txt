While it may seem like public resources should not be expended on chronic illnesses, it is important to consider the long-term costs and benefits of providing treatment to children with these conditions. Chronic illnesses not only negatively impact the lives of affected children, but they can also lead to decreased productivity and increased costs for families, society, and the healthcare system as a whole. Furthermore, denying treatment to children with chronic illnesses is not only morally reprehensible but also violates their basic human right to access healthcare. As members of a society, we have a collective responsibility to ensure that all people have access to the necessary resources to maintain their health and well-being. This includes children with chronic illnesses who require medical treatment to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Therefore, by providing public resources for the treatment of chronic illnesses in children, we can ensure that they have the best possible chance of leading healthy and productive lives, contributing to their communities, and avoiding more significant healthcare costs in the long run.
