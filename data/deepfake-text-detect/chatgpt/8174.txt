With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more awareness. The law in many countries is very clear on what to do if you see someone pointing or shooting at an officer, but how much are officers trained? If they don't train them properly then it could lead down this path where instead he was trying his best not get shot by some angry off duty cop who had drank too heavily after work picked up their weapon (or even worse; maybe like me just being careless with my gun). No one wants innocent person's lives lost over something as trivial! At least now we will have made others aware so hopefully next time such things happen less innocents die because no-one saw anything wrong until 'armed' cops got involved...
