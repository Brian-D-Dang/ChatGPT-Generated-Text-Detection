I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal products that have been treated with hormones. But this week has really made me question my ethics. So it all started when one of my friends came into work on Monday morning complaining about her stomach hurtinPosted by I got another call from CB's school today asking if she would like to come in early so they could get some stuff done for her. This is something we've always agreed not to do until at least after Easter because CB doesn't feel comfortable coming back before then due to the fact there are people who will be around her every day during those four weeks. But this year was different... This time someone else needed help getting their child ready! So here comes our little family running out the door for two hours of adventure. We arrived at 9: 30am which isn't very early but since we were going down by the High School where we used to live, I figured maybe 10 minutes wouldn't hurt us much. Anyway, we found her teacher (who had just walked away) and told him what happened. He said "Okay" as he turned his attention towards another student leaving. Then our friend took a deep breath and looked over at us both and said "We better go." And they went. There weren't many kids left in class except for one boy whose mom was working in the cafeteria at the time. As soon as we entered the room though, everyone ran up to hug us. Everyone was talking excitedly and wondering how we knew them. The teacher even called out to me saying "Ms. P!" It was hard to believe our sweet girl actually attended high school in California while we lived less than an hour away. She was telling each person things about herself, such as "My mommy works as a nurse," or "That classmate of mine wears glasses." When asked why she chose this school, she responded truthfully "Because they're nice." Well, we couldn't argue with that logic. Much to our surprise, she didn't seem nervous at all although she did say she felt weird walking through the halls, which surprised me considering she rarely goes anywhere without me unless we know exactly where we want to go beforehand. After we finished hugging her teachers, the principal let us take pictures. Here's a picture of CB sitting next to many of her former classmates including one who calls himself Mr. Calzone: A true gentleman indeed! Okay enough about me now... Let's see... What did you guys see? Did your daughter attend any schools similar to ours? Leave your comments below! When someone asks me if my husband gets along well with children, naturally I reply yes. His personality is pretty easy - going and laid back most days; plus being completely nonjudgemental helps keep the peace. However, with these special needs students, it seems to make no difference whether he's their teacher or their parent. They hold nothing against him! When this happens, sometimes I wonder if perhaps he should teach them instead.... At first glance, teaching may appear to be easier than parenting. For instance, their parents can sit back and relax knowing their kids won't bother anyone especially their own parents. Right?! Wrong! Teaching can definitely be demanding, exhausting and stressful too. Just imagine having one kid needing extra supervision on top of everything else! Do you think the teacher ever enjoys picking up after yet another group of misbehaving children?? Now add a sibling or other relative trying to run amok in your house!! I guess I shouldn't complain though. After all, there are plenty of jobs worse to have. ) If you'd rather read more funny stories about me my husband check out my complete new blog party series called Toddler Trouble. Oh yeah.. and happy birthday to Zoey!!! Today marks three years since Zoey was born. Even though she hasn't ushered in baby number 4 yet, she certainly still feels like she's right behind me. In honor of her big 3rd bday, I thought I'd put together this list of fun facts activities to celebrate tomorrow: 1.) My mother sent me a cute photo album entitled You Are Forever Young which contains precious photos taken 'back when' 2.) Every time I close my eyes, there's an image of her face staring back at me (which makes sleeping incredibly difficult). Her colorful smile lights up my life. 3.) We never named her. Instead we created nicknames for her such as Zeezy Boo, Zooey Boohoo and BooBoo Bear.:) 4.) I love taking pictures as much as they bring back memories of her birth 5.) I don't understand kids who enjoy playing video games over watching TV 6.) She loves watermelon 7.) One of her favorite foods is green beans 8.) Whenever I ask her "Zoey, are you hungry?" she gives me a look that says "No."
