To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to be extended. But homosexual activism is not a good thing; it's bad for people who do what they think is right or wrong just because of who they love without considering consequences. It also does more harm than good when we make laws based on things like this.
