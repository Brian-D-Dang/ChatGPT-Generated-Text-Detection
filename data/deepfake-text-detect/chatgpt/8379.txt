As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not an efficient way for us as the community or our government (or even private donors) in doing so, while tens and hundreds more people are waiting because there isn't enough money available." The other issue often raised with organ donation from infants involves religious concerns: "This procedure has been called 'barter-donation,' but it should be noted this would only take place if someone did want something back-the recipient family gives up their baby after birth without getting anything else besides another healthy infant," said Dr Coleman."Also note transplanting one human cell into its genetically identical twin could result both babies being born alive due simply by chance alone... Unfortunately some religions consider having your body parts taken out against God which makes them unacceptable candidates" she added.[6] There was also controversy over whether parents who donated organs had consented under coercion,[78]. The National Kidney Foundation pointedly stated "If you tell somebody when they're dying 'We need all possible kidneys,' what's really happeningis taking advantage off death." In response Rabbi Joseph Potasnik argued:[9Everyone knows exactly why each person decides [to donate], except maybe at moments like these... They know precisely where every member comesfrom - every chromosome! No two cells anywhere about share halfof1 DNA; no blood type ever matches - unless perhaps throughadventitious mixing during surgery...10 Many bioethicists argue however,that consent can still exist previousto births regardless parental wishes given any children may never live beyond infancy making full recovery impossible..
