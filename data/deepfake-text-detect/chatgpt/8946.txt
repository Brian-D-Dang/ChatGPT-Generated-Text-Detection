I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the most appropriate way to move on from arelationship then he never got to see his parents in person and now they are divorced and have been married for 6 years? There were too many variables to consider before you decided your marriage was right! Noone has ever asked me this question before! Of course it doesn't mean anything but it does make a distinction between fact versus fiction - if one of us went into heaven when we're married, we'd be at peace with ourselves because God put us together enough. It changes things. And there must still be some people who will leave their children behind regardless of how much money it cost them (whether it is our ability to support or not). These kids can go to hell, no matter who you love and hate! You could as well leave your siblings and grandkids at home and look after yourself and your family, but being able to afford a place to live in your 50s should motivate you to be happy!
