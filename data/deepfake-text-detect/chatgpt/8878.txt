They've been saying this since the 30s. Keynes predicted that as technology increased and our material needs would be met, we would only need to work 15 hours a week, before it would become obsolete. But are these predictions true? I'll bet you realize that while there are reasons to believe that technological progress is still slow, most people think it's feasible to make one-time changes over time. That said, it's not like you can't do something. It just takes methods that don't require long term and future planning (e.g., self-reliance).
