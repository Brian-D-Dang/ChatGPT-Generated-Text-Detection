I believe that a private business should be able to deny service to anyone for any reason. For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, business should be able to have a private right to refuse service to anyone for any reason. For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, it should be able to do so.
