First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways aren't necessarily like our ways. That said... I would never leave my dog alone with someone else for an extended period of time just to go on vacation or something (who has the money andor free days off that allows them do such?). The chances of anything happening is very low if you take even basic precautions - no keys left around the house while your gone etc., keep all food in small spaces where it can be secured at night (locked cupboard under sink), similar stuff as when people have children or other animals who could get into trouble themselves. But dogs don't think so much before taking action, especially if there's another animal present, which means they'll probably try to sniff out any leftover snacks etc.. They also tend to eat whatever looks tasty regardless whether its good for them or not...so again, leaving some garbage lying about isn't exactly wise either. Keep doors closed! You'd be surprised how many pets wind up getting lost by being stuck outside somewhere because somebody didn't shut one single door properly after coming home from work late. And then there are those stories we hear every once in awhile online about pet-nappers doing what they want without consequences due to negligence...if news reports were true, these type of thefts wouldn't happen nearly as often since most thieves will only steal healthy adult animals. So basically same precautions apply as having kids yourself really. Oh yeah, make sure anyone watching him makes his needs known so he doesn't become confused himselfi.e., feedings, walk times Etc... Don't let strangers play too roughly with him, give bear hugs unless you've asked permission beforehand, allow access to water bowls whenever possibledont' forget they need plenty during summer heat not just enough to drink though, maybe run through sprinklers occasionally? If you must travel carry along a photo id card of your pup (s) and its microchip info, ask neighbors friends nearby if they could check in daily....and finally-a note on leash walking -make sure everyone knows ahead of going out together that until the puppy becomes accustomed to leashes, owners should enter areas slowly using gentle pressure and commanding presence rather than pulling the lead. When puppies learn obedience classes are starting, start early and gradually increase duration over weeks. This way hes starts associating walks more with certain activities vs punishment stress sensations associated w fearfulness. Also, encourage independent behavior pups cant ignore treats or toys to attract attention away from eachother..... Is two years old considered "old"? How does shedding affect allergies? And lastly, remember why you adopted him..theres still love behind those eyes!!! Good luck:) my 2 cents
