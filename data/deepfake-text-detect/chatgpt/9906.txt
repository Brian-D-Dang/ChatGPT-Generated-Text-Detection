Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by a logical and rational argument. Hyper-rationality is often viewed as the opposite of intuition, emotion, or faith. It is seen as a way of thought that disregards the human experience and instead relies on cold, hard facts and logical processes to make decisions. This type of thinking can be seen in many areas including economics, politics, science, and philosophy. Hyper-rationality has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the rise of technology and its ability to provide data and evidence to support arguments. Many people view this reliance on logic and facts as being more reliable than relying on intuition or feeling. However, hyper-rationality also has its drawbacks. For example, it can lead to an over-reliance on scientific evidence and a disregard for human experience and feelings. This can lead to decisions being made without considering the implications on individuals or society as a whole. Additionally, it can be difficult to evaluate complex situations with only a logical approach, leading to oversimplified solutions. Hyper-rationality is not necessarily a bad thing, but it should be used in moderation. It can be useful in certain circumstances and can help guide decision making. However, it should not be the sole basis for all decisions and should not be allowed to override human experience and emotion.
