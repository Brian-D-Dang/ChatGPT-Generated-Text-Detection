By "practical reason," I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election. I admit that this may not be the only or most important reason to vote, but it is a practical reason that can be used to convince individuals who may not see the value or impact of their individual vote. Essentially, the practical reason is that by casting your vote, you are contributing to the collective outcome of the election and potentially influencing the direction of your community or country. Every vote counts, and it is important for individuals to have their voices heard through the democratic process.
