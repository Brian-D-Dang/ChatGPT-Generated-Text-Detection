They've been saying this since the 30s. Keynes predicted that as technology increased and our material needs would be met, we would only need to work 15 hours a week, and we would have all the time in the world to do all the things we've been dreaming about. I like to think that we will be able to find a better balance between work and play. I think that a great part of the problem is that we are trained to work to live and not to live to work. We have to stop and retrain ourselves to understand that work is not our life, it's just something that we do to provide for the things that we really love to do. Increasing technology is not the problem. It's the lack of vision to use it that is. For example, we have the technology to make each home a tiny energy-efficient micro-home. We also have the technology to make each family self-sufficient in food production. We have the technology to produce clean, cheap, abundant energy. We have the technology to create a utopia. We just need to stop and think about how to do it. I think we will eventually get to a point where the 4 hour work week will be commonplace. I think that we will reach a point where we will have utopia. I think it's just a matter of time. I think it's just a matter of time. I think it will take us a few more years to reach that point, and it will take a massive shift in our society. But I think we are heading in the right direction. I just wish it would happen faster. I don't know why some people seem to think that the end of the world is going to happen anytime soon. Maybe they're just joking, but it's a bad joke if you ask me. I just want to live in a world where there's enough abundance for everyone. I don't want to live in a world where most people are living in poverty. I don't want to live in a world where we're destroying our planet. I don't want to live in a world where everyone's living in fear. I think that the 4 hour work week is something we should all be working towards. But it's not something that will happen overnight. We have to do it one step at a time. We have to stop and think about how to do it. I want the people who read this blog to join me in trying to create a better world for all of us. I want us to take our time and work to create a world where we live in abundance, where we live in happiness, where we live in peace. I know that there are a lot of people who will be skeptical, but I want to inspire you to dream. I want to inspire you to do what you love. I want to inspire you to get in touch with your inner child. I want to inspire you to see the world as a possibility, not a limitation. I want to inspire you to work towards the 4 hour work week, but I also want to inspire you to go beyond that. I want to inspire you to create a world where you could work for 1 hour a week and still live a great life. A world where the abundance is so great that you can live the life of your dreams without having to work. I want to inspire you to stop and think about how to do it. I want to inspire you to join me in creating a better world for everyone. This blog is just a start. I'm hoping that you will join me in this dream, and that together we can create the world of our dreams.
