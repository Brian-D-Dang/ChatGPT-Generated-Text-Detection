I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that they shouldn't be blamed for being raped. The problem is, promoting "safety" can actually cause more danger to women, as well as men who aren't rapists but happen to have a consensual encounter with someone else who may not feel comfortable having sex unless there are certain conditions met beforehand (and many guys just don't know how to communicate these things). For example, the popular advice that you need to tell your partner "no means no" isn't anywhere near realistic - it's much too simple an equation when dealing with very complicated topics like sexual consent. Even if one person says yes or maybe to something another person wants, this doesn't mean they want what's happening at all! This blurring between "yes" and "maybe," and it's a difficult concept even for adults to understand. And because both parties might think they said yes, or say yes after wanting to do other stuff first, somebody could end up hurt. Someone could also get false accusations made against them. It makes sense why so many people believe accusers over accused, especially since "women lie about rape." That's part of it; however, "lying," or even ambiguity on whether or not someone consented before engaging in some sort of activity, should never ever be used as evidence against him either. Both accusees and accused must always be presumed innocent until proven guilty. If they weren't then every single child molestation charge would probably hit its mark. People tend to forget that most children were sexually abused. And while we're talking about the presumption of innocence and such, let me add that the same goes for possession charges. A lot of people seem to confuse those cases where drugsalcohol was once found in somebody's house as proof of guilt without checking out the full story behind each case, which usually involves doing further investigation into the facts involved. There are plenty of situations where drug use could lead to harming oneself besides making others around sick from consuming potentially poisoned substances, even though occasionally people mess themselves up due to ingesting poisonous products by accident. In addition, people are disproportionately diagnosed with mental illnesses, yet still charged with crimes. Many drugs result in depression, mood disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc., among many other basic mental issues. However, nobody seems to worry about our tendency to label girls with eating disorders as bulimic, only finding time to condemn their behaviors afterwards. Likewise, almost everybody has been confused by how fast-food companies make kids obese, when we somehow fail to acknowledge that they eat too much junk food naturally anyway. So before everyone starts going off on a tangent outing all sorts of useless stories, I'd suggest you check out a few articles below. You'll find quite a bit of information useful for avoiding getting yourself into trouble. Now, onto the actual topic. As for encouraging anyone trying to avoid being raped...well not really my place here. But perhaps having an easier way to safely consume alcohol could help? Some places already sell drinkably safe beer, wine, liquor, and spirits (mainly whiskey and vodka), so it wouldn't take anything new invented at all. Just a thought... For the rest of it, I'm willing to bet money that a percentage of rapes occur in homes; hence,'safe' housing laws won't necessarily change things, either. After all, some rapist have big plans despite living alone; therefore, he will likely continue raping regardless of any shelter law - except that may still give potential rapists less motivation to commit crime. The best solution, IMO, is actually teaching young males NOT TO BE RAPISTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. Don't allow violent video games, movies, music, and porn, teach boys that violence IS WRONG...in fact, tell them these things over and over again every day! If people truly understood how destructive pornography and anti-social media influences on children were, they wouldn't support such nonsense in the slightest. Also, stop giving anti-depressants to children, as the side effects from taking antidepressants aren't worth the benefits. As far protection goes, you shouldn't have to carry pepper spray nor mace. It seems stupid to pay thousands of dollars for equipment I personally think is ridiculous compared to common household items such as knives, steak forks, ceramic plates, vegetable peelers, etc. Then again, there are exceptions. My grandmother had a purse pistol back in her days in high school, meaning she carried it tucked away under her clothing, and from what I've heard, the bullet casing wasn't removed from the gun unless absolutely necessary - essentially, carrying live ammunition is illegal now, so that kind of thing won't work anymore. Another possibility is training in martial arts. Before I became pregnant, I took Karate lessons three times per week, and although I didn't put my self-alps, my husband couldn't agree to adopt to select his argumentative following that wish) there is no legal battle (standard tough res
