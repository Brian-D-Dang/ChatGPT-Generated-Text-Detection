I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If it's something that is beyond my comprehension why does it matter? It doesn't mean anything. What do you think about this? I did not ask for any prior knowledge on this topic Don't understand your point If there were no evidence, how would you feel if there wasn't one? Yes, they're contradicting themselves here because they disagree with each other...
