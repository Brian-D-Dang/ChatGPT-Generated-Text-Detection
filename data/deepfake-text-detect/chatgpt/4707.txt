First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however: We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is a good thing. What we're talking about here isn't "political correctness" in that sense not at all. In fact, I was just listening to a podcast where someone called this anti-PC, and my first reaction was... "Oh no! Not you again!" And honestly, we've even had people on our site call out other sites for being too PC when they do exactly what we are doing right now. It's funny how something so simple as an angry mob can be mistaken for a serious movement. And if you think we're throwing around terms like "angry mob" or "culture war," watch this video from The Onion to get some perspective.I'm also very aware there's been quite a few "censorship" arguments going up lately and have seen that so many times before, but still feel compelled to address them anyway. So this post will cover both sides of censorship issues with the hope that some common ground may exist between us even though one side says otherwise.So why censor? Well, because sometimes words mean things. Words aren't always clear in their meaning. Are we really supposed to expect everyone else involved to know your intentions every single time you use words? Neither would I expect others to read into every movie title, song lyric, joke, etc., intended to make fun of certain groups unless those songsmoviesetc were directed towards them specifically. Heck, most people wouldn't even listen to these types of things without laughing along...but they'd never say anything publicly either. If you want to openly mock gay marriage like Rush Limbaugh does, then go ahead and hold hands in front of God and country chanting lyrics mocking same-sex couples while the crowd roars along...as long as you aren't threatening violence against anyone or spouting hate speech based on religious beliefs.This is a pretty basic example: You can criticize the act of marrying gays, but there's nothing wrong with criticizing it as misplaced since nobody has the right to force another person to marry someone who doesn't share the same values. That's all fine and dandy, but keep in mind the word "marriage." Some people believe homosexuality itself is immoral because that term is historically used in reference to the union of genders together for procreation (yeah, that lack of clarity). This belief goes beyond simply wanting to avoid using the word "gay," which should already be enough reason for it to change. When you give people more power over such important concepts than yourself, you open yourself up to criticism and argumentation from all angles.Even worse is when you take actions aimed at censoring legitimate debate. See, when you decide who gets to speak in anything public, especially controversial subjects like politics and religion, you deny that freedom of expression by limiting freedoms like free assembly and shouting down opposing viewpoints. Sure, allowing unlimited access to viewpoints isn't ideal - it often results in some sort of backfire effect (see: Nazi book burning..), but sometimes the benefits outweigh the potential risks. There's no doubt that government regulation of cultural institutions increases costs while decreasing output; more importantly, we need regulations governing culture just as much as art science.But after seeing various state laws targeting McDonalds' Happy Meal toys, I was reminded once again of the absurd amount of thought given to banning guns yet giving corporations carte blanche rights to promote whatever products they choose via television commercials and movies. We may argue whether gun control makes sense, but would anyone seriously begrudge George Lucas his choice to include military equipment and space weaponry in Episode VII instead of modern day weapons? Of course not. Unless he actually plans to refute major points made during the premiere, changing theme costumes might seem like merely cosmetic changes, but look closely and you'll realize how radicalized everything became. Even Star Wars what you saw wasn't necessarily what was originally written.To that end, Facebook implemented new guidelines regarding offensive content last year which resulted in a lot of pressure put upon companies to adopt similar policies. Which brings us to all the talk about "hate speech." Personally, I find the distinction somewhat nebulous, mostly because it seems to arbitrarily target one issue over countless others. For instance, whenever people discuss banning racial epithets, references to gender identity, sexuality, religion, etc, the discussion inevitably turns to hate speech. People forget the real problem lies within violent extremism and its underlying causes. Let's face facts: A white supremacist group probably won't care if soldiers die fighting ISIS when compared to the idea that a black man could possibly become president. Shouldn't "the ends justify the means" when dealing with terrorism? Who cares if Muslims judge Christians less favorably if Christianity aims to convert the world, save souls, spread grace, and improve society through kindness and love? Why must we focus exclusively on hate speech without considering the root cause behind it?In short, a 9 of users try to match. Like so, whereas the user having a different yea
