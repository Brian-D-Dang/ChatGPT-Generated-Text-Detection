This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use of the property is; you should not be penalized for using your property as a home instead of as an apartment building, or a store instead of a parking lot. Also, it's not a great idea to be raising property taxes on a daily basis, as we're doing now. Taxes on a house should be based on its value as a home. I think that's the way it was before. This is a more interesting issue. In the past, they would assess property taxes based on 12 the value of the land and 12 the value of the improvements, and the cost of improvements were supposed to be added to the total value of the property, which is why you had to do some basic maintenance on your property. These days, however, the value of the improvements is not added to the total value of the property. So if you have a house that's 100 years old and you've done a major renovation, the value of the house does not increase as much as you'd think. Instead, you have to pay your property taxes on the value of the land alone. This is an issue because if you're selling a property, you're going to want to pay property taxes based on the market value of the land, and you're going to want to pay your property taxes on the basis of the market value of the improvements, because that's the cost of what you're buying. I think that the market value of the improvements should be added into the total value of the property. This would not increase property taxes for the average homeowner, because the average homeowner's house is not going to have improvements worth a lot more than the value of the land. But it would give a better representation of the value of the property. So I don't think the total value of the property should be based on the land value alone. I think it should be based on the market value of the land and the improvements. This is a very interesting issue. In the past, you couldn't appeal your property taxes if the assessed value was higher than the market value. That was the law. You couldn't appeal. The reason for this was that if you could appeal, you could get a refund. But it would have the effect of lowering the total value of the property, and that would mean that everyone would get a lower tax bill. Now, however, the Legislature has changed the law so that you can appeal the assessed value of your property if it's higher than the market value. So the question here is whether or not you should be able to appeal your property taxes. I think the way the Legislature changed the law was a mistake. They should have left the old law in place, and I think they should undo that. I think it should be a matter of right for the owner of a property to appeal the assessment of their property if they think it's too high. It's their money. They pay the taxes. They ought to be able to appeal. But I don't think there should be any refunds. If you can appeal the assessed value of your property, and you win, and the assessment is reduced, I think you should not get a refund of what you paid in taxes. I think you should pay the difference between what you paid in taxes and what you should have paid in taxes. But I don't think you should get a refund. I think you should pay the difference. Now, in order to avoid this, what the state is doing is making the assessment process more automated. So they're doing computer-assessed assessments. In the past, an assessor went around and looked at the value of your property. They said, "This is the value of your property." Now, they use computers to do this. So they're not as susceptible to bias and to errors. However, I don't think this has worked very well. For one thing, it takes a long time for the assessor to complete the assessments, so I think they should do them the old way. It's better. It's not that they have to be more accurate, but it's better. So, I think you should be able to appeal the assessment of your property if you think it's too high. And I think you should not get a refund if you win.
