To start, I'm not here to discuss wealth distribution, or income inequality. They are real issues that need to be addressed, and as much as governments like to talk about them they never really do anything other than make people feel better for a short period of time without actually accomplishing anything substantial (that being said, there is one proposed solution I will mention). With that out the way, my question today is this: If you had unlimited funds, how would your life change? How would it differ from now? Would it have even changed at all? Let's look at some examples between what we see today and where something might take us in our own lives... -Most anyone who has been on any significant amount of dates knows most dating sitesapplications are geared towards making money off of their customers by providing advertising space. The exceptions to this trend include Bumble and Tinder which both focus more on user experience (UX) and less on revenue generating features while also having an amazing UX. There are many articles discussing why apps often go through these trends so let's just say that I am going to ignore that aspect because I don't think it should matter as long as good products get made. However, if someone were running such an app today with no price barrier, we could theoretically provide a great future to those looking to date online based on a few simple metrics. For example, imagine spending 25-35 per month to gain access to 1 million users. That would translate into roughly 2 billion matches over the course of a year. Not only can we match millions of people every day, but theoretically, once matched it would cost nothing for potential couples to communicate directly. This doesn't sound too far fetched anymore does it? Sure we'd still need advertisers, developers, etc., but wouldn't that be worth paying for when compared to the administrative overhead required for traditional dating websites? Why spend hundreds of dollars each month on subscriptions when you can pay 99 cents per minute instead? In addition to charging for usage, I stated earlier that I don't believe pricing barriers should apply to ideas like this; however, depending on what sort of advertising system was used, companies may very well enforce certain constraints due to privacy concerns. With enough resources, maybe we'll end up seeing major company names involved in someone else's relationship. Imagine signing onto OKCupid right now and realizing that you've almost met your soul mate already. What if your phone went crazy trying to call her back? Or worse yet, the person didn't respond in a timely manner. With this kind of thinking, the idea behind a dating site becomes irrelevant - everyone is paired together regardless of age restrictions, location choices, etc. No longer do consumers have to obtain permission; they simply show up on a website and select who they want to meet. Watching the ways technology changes human relationships is fascinating and exciting; however, I fear that too many entrepreneurs aim solely towards financial success while forgetting some things along the way. When creating services it's easy to forget that they're meant to serve others first. As stated before, getting married shouldn't require "permission" nor should dating fall under any form of privilege. So, even though we might be able to achieve this dream, we might soon run into ethical dilemmas on whether or not to continue since our intentions aren't quite clear cut. Additionally, doing everything on our own means we will likely fail. If you wanted to do business today, knowing how much money you needed just to survive isn't necessarily useful information unless you were Jesus Christ. You couldn't build a successful company sitting alone in a cave for 15 years after all! Technology's primary purpose is to help solve problems and often times we work tirelessly toward building solutions then skip ahead to finding the new ways to monetize them. Before Elon Musk used his personal assets to fund Tesla and SpaceX he built Zip2 which ended up helping internet service providers send data faster to clients via satellites. Lyft started out as Sidecar. Sometimes businesses build themselves through trial and error but sometimes they rely heavily upon external sources. It seems obvious that more startups die during seed funding rounds rather than early stages; perhaps losing many opportunities would mean greater returns later down the road. Despite this fact, companies prefer injecting capital as quickly as possible rather than letting founders evolve naturally. Many investors tend to look at finances more holistically whereas individual contributors often lack insight concerning these aspects beyond overall expenses versus profit margins. Some people argue that taking out loans makes sense for the inexperienced while others claim borrowers must learn to manage debt wisely. Most of the time the issue lies somewhere between these two extremes. Even for experienced individuals, money is a difficult thing to deal with on its own and with countless different variables thrown around it can become overwhelming. People might use mathematics, statistics, logic or intuition as guidelines for decision making; however, none of these tools seem reliable until proven otherwise. Few options exist outside of the mainstream, meaning that whatever type of loan you seek, chances are you won't find services with options tailored specifically to your needs.
