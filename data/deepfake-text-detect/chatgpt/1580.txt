This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding. For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force us to buy packages of content in order for it all to work because the on demand stuff isn't available, even though most people don't want any other type of package than their basic one anyways. And now they want you to pay 300 more when buying new equipment so your old box can still access everything? This seems like a scam to me... If Disney wants these guys out, why not offer them some kind of alternative: "Hey, if you remove your service from Fios, we will give you an upgrade at no extra cost! All you need to do is call to cancel Fios and switch providers - instead of paying us money every month! No contract required! It also doesn't matter how long ago you canceled to get this deal; we'll honor it retroactively too! We couldn't live without you!" Then maybe Comcast would think twice about what they were doing:). It is quite ironic seeing as how Hulu was part of Fox back in 2004 who then sold off parts of those assets (like FOX News) to Disney and are currently suing eachother over allegedly violating patents when discussing Hulu. Seems today, while everyone else's news channels continue falling apart under their own weight thanks to their biasesopinions etc., Fox thinks its ok to try and monopolize streaming video again by getting rid of Netflix along with several independent film distributors. The competition between TV networks has always been fierce but this is unprecedented.
