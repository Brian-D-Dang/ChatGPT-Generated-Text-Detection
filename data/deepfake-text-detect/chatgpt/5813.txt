First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I don't mean to say that privatization is necessarily bad or that there should not be private education or medicine. I just mean to say that in the U.S. privatization has led to highly unequal outcomes in these two areas. The U.S. does have some public education, but most of it is not high quality and often has enormous class size. In addition, the public education system is not evenly distributed. There are a lot of poor public schools and a lot of rich private schools. I am not suggesting we change all this, just that it is important to note that we don't have a publicly supported education system in the U.S. Now to the health care system. I am not going to pretend to understand it all. In fact, I know less about it than most people. However, it is extremely obvious to me that the U.S. has a highly privatized health care system. Most of the money that is spent on health care is spent by private companies on private health care. In fact, health insurance is a for profit industry in the U.S. I want to highlight an article by David Rosner and Gerald Markowitz from 2001, which was cited in The New York Times recently. Here is a quote: "More than 90 percent of the American public is served by the private health-care system. ... Almost 80 percent of the nation's physicians work for private practices or groups. ... Nearly 85 percent of hospitals in the United States are private; less than 15 percent are public." The article goes on to argue that this is highly inefficient. What they mean is that the private health care system is designed to maximize profits, not to maximize the health of the population. Here is another quote: "Private capitalism is not a panacea, especially when it comes to health care. At a time when the United States spends more per capita on health care than any other nation - 6,076 annually in 2004, compared with an average of 2,752 in Canada and 3,017 in France, according to the World Health Organization - many are asking why the nation's health isn't better." There are many questions to ask. Why are we spending so much money on health care? What is this money buying us? Why do so many people in the U.S. have poor health care? Why do so many people in the U.S. lack access to health care? Why are so many people in the U.S. uninsured or underinsured? A big question is, "If the private health care system is so great, why is the U.S. in such poor shape health-wise relative to other countries?" Here is one answer: "America spends more than twice as much per capita on health care as other developed nations, yet ranks 16th on a list of 19 industrialized nations in life expectancy and 19th in infant mortality." And here is another: "The United States also ranks in the bottom half of industrialized nations in health outcomes." Sorry to bring this up, but it really is something we need to face as a country. If you want to discuss it further, come to the U.S. vs. the World meetup this Thursday. I still believe there is a role for the private sector in health care, but it should not be the primary system. The U.S. should have a public system that is well funded, where no one is denied health care because they cannot afford it. This is a fundamental right. It is a right we have already guaranteed to prisoners, but not to the rest of the population. There are some who say that the U.S. already has a public health care system. They point out that the government pays for Medicare and Medicaid. However, both programs are privatized. They are run by the private sector. Medicare is a single payer system, which means that all payments go through private insurance companies. These companies then pay the doctors and hospitals. Medicaid is a much more complicated system. However, it also is a privatized system. It is funded by state and federal government, but it is run by private insurance companies. States can choose to give the money to the private insurance companies or to spend it on their own public system. Most states have privatized Medicaid.
