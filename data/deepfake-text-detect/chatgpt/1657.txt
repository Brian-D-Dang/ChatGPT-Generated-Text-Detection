I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. Then you have people who write "Sluts are good at sex," which doesn't make much sense either since women aren't the only ones with vaginas and most sluts get less than average dick size (which would be bad in itself). the poster gets railed for it...What does that mean?
