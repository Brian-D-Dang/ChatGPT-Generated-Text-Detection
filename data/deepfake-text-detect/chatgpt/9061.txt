I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This isn't just about Bernie, it's not just about race either. That is exactly what I was thinking. Most people on here seem pretty pessimistic about a huge chunk of their base, so I'm more worried about a small subset of them than anything else.
