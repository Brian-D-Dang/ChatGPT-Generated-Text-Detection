To me growth of economy is a meaningless statistic. Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange. What kind of person evaluates actions in this regard? Is there any other way to analyze the economy that has not been conducted by people, economy plays no role here or does it have significance for economic community development? Is there any other important role differentiation between economic activity as opposed to right politics may be engaged with such measures like equal opportunity during elections period for instance?
