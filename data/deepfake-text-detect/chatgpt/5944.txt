It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet. I've always found the muffler laws in the USA to be rather...idiosyncratic. I also find the penalties for violating them rather....idiosyncratic as well. I've never been fined for being a loud motorcyclist. Perhaps I've gotten lucky. The thing that I find the most interesting about the muffler laws in the USA is that some states don't really seem to care, while others, like California, care very much. And then there's the federal government which has a different standard for the same vehicle in different states. It's all a bit confusing. I love the American motorcycle muffler and I love hearing them on the road. I just wish that they'd make them quieter. But, I also know that it's not practical or possible to have a "silent" muffler. This is a topic that I've been interested in for a long time. I'm really glad to see that someone else is interested in it as well. I'm also interested in the standards used to make these mufflers. They seem to be made of different materials in different states. And they seem to be made by different manufacturers as well. I like the sound of a good American muffler. I can't really understand why people would rather a quiet muffler. Quiet is the enemy of motorcyclists. We are there to make noise. I'm all for the freedom of motorcyclists to make a lot of noise as they drive around. I'm all for the freedom of others to complain about that noise. I'm all for the right of towns and cities to enforce muffler laws. The problem is that I've never really understood how motorcycle mufflers get made. The materials that they're made of vary widely in different states. And they're made by different manufacturers as well. There's something about this subject that's really fascinating. I have always loved the sound of motorcycles. I love that noise. I love the smell of the exhaust. I love the sound of a muffler. I recently had a discussion with a guy who was in the car with me. He mentioned that he doesn't like motorcycles because of the noise that they make. I disagree. I love the noise that they make. I've always found it interesting that some states have much stricter muffler laws than others. California, for instance, has very strict muffler laws. And they enforce them. I live in Colorado. In my experience, the laws here are very different. I love motorcycles. I love the sound of motorcycles. I love the noise that they make. I've always found it interesting that in some states, it's illegal for a motorcycle to be loud. And I've never understood why that is. I've always found the muffler laws in the USA to be rather...idiosyncratic. I've always found the penalties for violating them to be rather...idiosyncratic as well.
