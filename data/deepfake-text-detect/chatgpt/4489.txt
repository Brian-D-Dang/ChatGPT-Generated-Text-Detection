I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a used one is probably the best way to go. My dad bought my brother and myself an '05 Suzuki Swift Sport for Christmas that year. The previous owner had put 1k into some of the interior parts (the dash was pretty scratched up) which made it look ugly at first glance. He also added aftermarket wheelstires as standard equipment, along with a full exhaust system. Some time later he realized his mistake and removed everything except the stock wheels, tires, and manual transmission from the vehicle. It looks much nicer now than when we got it originally, although it still doesn't have any more power or anything else really. The problem is that most people who buy these don't realize they're getting a lemon, nor do they know what all of those fancy accessories add-ons are worth on eBay. That being said, if you can find someone selling it without them for less money while keeping all of the other stuff, it might be cheaper offloading the extra crap before anyone realizes it's missing anyway! My question then becomes: Do I sell the extras separately? If that person buys the bare bones version and gets rid of the rest of the accessories... does that mean I lose out on potential profit because the customer didn't notice I sold him a stripped down motorcycle? Is there a better solution here where I get both revenue AND retain ownership of the goods? Should I just save up enough cash to dump all of the extra junk later instead? Or should I wait until I need a new bike...? P.S.: Also please tell me you've been using "crap" as a verb in your life already because even though it sounds stupid, it actually makes sense in context:). - Seth WrightJun 27 '14 at 18:13 5 Answers 5 It depends on whether you want to charge additional fees based on ad hoc pricing or set prices ahead of time. There will likely always be room for negotiation during your sale. In either case, there won't normally be significant loss upon removing unnecessary items (unless they were very valuable) since the buyer knows nothing about their value relative to the price paid. However, if you take advantage of bitrotting tricks, such as putting stickers over old signs stating "White Elephant Sale - EVERYTHING MUST GO!," you could make some good cash off the product remaining. This method would rely on the seller knowing information that the buyer did not. You may consider doing research beforehand to determine the estimated resale value of different optionsaccessories. You mentioned trying to resell the item yourself. Having done that once, I can say that you absolutely cannot trust any estimates provided online. Even reputable sellers regularly fail to provide accurate appraisals (and sometimes outright lie), especially when they involve niche products. For example, if I wanted to estimate the current market value of a vintage Vixen 1200 engine I wouldn't ask three dealerships - each offering a vastly different opinion despite having no knowledge of exactly why their competitor has a lower valuation. Instead, I simply open a toxic email account, create dozens of fake profiles and send emails directly to 1000 buyers asking for bids. Most sellers aren't prepared for such tactics and often respond poorly. But occasionally you will strike gold and earn between 10 and 20. In addition, many sellers offer free shipping and handling services within reason. These may seem trivial details, yet undercutting competitors through shoddy business practices still works well today. Again, this strategy relies heavily on finding sellers unprepared for direct contact. Once found, launch an attack barrage and quickly close the deal. To conclude, inventory control and sales management are two crucial aspects of making a living through similar methods. Perhaps start small - sell 1-3 items per week until you gain experience (this process takes years), learn your enemies and expand your holdings accordingly. Become skilled at promoting individual listings with strong images. As you advance, use social media influencers and news outlets to attract attention to your wares. Eventually, diversify your inventory and become familiar with every aspect of the industry (i.e., typology, condition levels, etc.) before targeting niche markets. First things first, assuming you intend to only sell cars (or maybe bikes?) motorcycles are generally considered collectibles nowadays, meaning the rarity factor isn't nearly as high as it used to be back in the day. A lot of collectors will pay top dollar for older classic models, but unless you happen to come across a mint condition original model, chances are pretty slim. So my recommendation is try to negotiate a large markdown, preferably starting around 50, however if you're willing to spend a few thousand dollars you'll certainly get it back at auction sometime in the next couple decades.
