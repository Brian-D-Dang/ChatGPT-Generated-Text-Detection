I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in my list of all-time favorite movies. This is a very interesting article about the relationship between Japanese anime and Western animation...and it's free! Well worth reading if you're interested in such things. Here are some quotes: Quote The biggest change has been at Studio Ghibli. The studio founded by Hayao Miyazaki in 1985 is famous not only for its films but also for its insistence on using traditional hand drawn techniques rather than computer graphics (CG). Even though their CG work has never exactly matched up with other studios' best efforts, there have always seemed to be more people who wanted to watch Ghibli movies because they were old fashioned looking. In the last decade or two, however, many of Ghibli's most loyal fans seem to have switched allegiance to Pixar and Dreamworks. This could partly be due to the success of the Disney princesses cartoons like Mulan, LION KING etc., which set off the trend towards CG animation in children's shows, and Hollywood blockbusters like Star Wars. But it may simply be down to the fact that Ghibli movies tend to look better when shown on TV and in video format compared with DVD. Most recently, the hugely successful film WALL-E seems to represent another strand. It has been promoted as an "anti-Ghibli" movie - a Mad Max style tale of a lonely robot roaming around a polluted Earth alone, with no human interaction whatsoever. Of course, Ghibli have long featured robots and isolated characters, but seen within the context of a story where humans still exist, these elements had real meaning. One thing I think is confusing to newcomers to anime is just how often the word 'SciFiFantasy', especially in the titles, is used purely as marketing terms....but then plotlines turn into something else entirely. One example is Clannad, one of those tearjerking dramas made popular among women aged 15-25 years ago. If you go into any bookstore now, you'll see several different editions featuring name changes here and there and sometimes even whole new cover art. Why? Marketing reasons. A publisher discovered that young girls read books according to the models they saw on TV; so the title was changed from "Makoto Yuki and her friends," to help sell copies to teenage boys. Another example is the popular cartoon Hell Girl. This show got rave reviews, and awesome figures based upon it appeared on store shelves everywhere. But apparently there wasn't much interest in watching the actual series itself beyond the first few episodes, so it was canceled after producing 20 tiny little OVA specials instead of the planned 5 full length ones. While some fans liked the OVAs, others found them lacking. Now you can find both sets of DVDs selling for almost retail prices on Ebay every day although the original run of 10 volumes sold pretty well and probably didn't need any promotion except maybe a press release on the company website and a brief mention during the commercial breaks on Toonami [ahem] since it aired right before DBZ... To me, this is the essence of all modern American pop culture, including foreign imports like Korean kdramas, Chinese wuxia, Japanese manga, Taiwanese Hokkien literature, UK chinese opera and Indian Hindi cinema. Not everything succeeds, obviously, and yet everything sells like hotcakes to various demographic groups, depending solely upon which way each group feels compelled to flip over their pancakes. And while I don't personally buy into it myself, I suppose this makes sense from a business standpoint. Each market segment needs to feel good about supporting each production so that companies keep doing them, otherwise we'd stop seeing anything materialize completely. So Japan saves western civilization with Cowboy Bebop, America saves Japan with Evangelion, China does it again with Dragonball Z, India does it once more with Bollywood movies and Korea keeps doing rehashed versions of Mongolian folktales and weird monster stories until vampires suddenly become chic thanks to Twilight. Whatever works, eh?
