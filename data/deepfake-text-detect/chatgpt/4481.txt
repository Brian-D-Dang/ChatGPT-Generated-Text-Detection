The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here] . Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things. But for good people to do bad things, that takes religion." -Steven Weinberg "We are all atheists about most of the gods known to man. No matter how much we may dislike some particular god's attributes, we still worship him because a belief in any kind of deity whatsoever is one step closer to insanity than no God at all." -Richard Dawkins "I'm not religious; I leave everything up to my emotions. It helps me with the day-to-day problems of life such as getting money together for rent, filling out insurance forms, etc.... I don't believe anything but my own existence. Everything else I take on trust: it has to make sense. Sometimes there isn't enough evidence yet...and then again sometimes there is too much, so I try to relax into whatever happens next." - John Lennon "At first it was only friends who had their job done. Then they added family members, neighbors. Soon whole villages were participating. The services spread through the land until everyone had something important he could check off his list by going to someone else's house. People began asking what they could do for others instead of what others could do for them. The community grew strong, confident - even cocky! And over time, the person who'd started this system became more popular than anyone else. Call him Jesus. His followers took to calling themselves Christians. He said, "Love your enemies," and they did. So do Buddhists. Muslims say, "Let us love each other." Jews say, "God will forgive our sins if we pray hard enough." Hindus call it karma (the law). Some religions sound almost compassionate, while others just aren't worth praying to anyway." - Douglas Adams
