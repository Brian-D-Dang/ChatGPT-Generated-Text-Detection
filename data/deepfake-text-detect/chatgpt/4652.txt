I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for murder and then they kill themselves, it would be as if no one had died that day other than themself. Not necessarily...take into account that there are people who get out early or die before sentencing...then yes, I'd agree with your point though you do make some good points here too....a lot more can go wrong then just the person's death itself
