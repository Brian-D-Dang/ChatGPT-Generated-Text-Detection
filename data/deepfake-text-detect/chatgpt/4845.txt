I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with the issue of blood. This is a piece of mutton that has been cooked for about 3 hours (it was bought in Turkey) and then kept refrigerated for 2 days before being sold at Doner Kebap shop (in Istanbul). The seller told us that it does not have any quantity of blood when we asked her "Does this meat taste good?" She replied "Yes" since there isn't much or no blood. So what happened here? How can you cook some meat, keep it chilled for few days before selling it as a delicious meal? If this case had occurred in a restaurant where money comes from customers, wouldn't they stop serving meat if they found out that their customer ate something strange such as animal flesh with little or no blood inside of them? In order to buy meat today, people must pay first and foremost by looking at the price tag of each product. You don't usually see how many times do these sellers sell different kinds of meat products. At the end of the day, even though the food may seem attractive, you should remember that animals are living beings. What will happen in ten years after you finish reading this page? Will your children still enjoy pork liver pate in the future? Or lamb sirloin in an Italian pasta sauce? If you feel uncomfortable while thinking about all those bodies and smells behind every kind of food, just think about the fact that lamb meat carries more weight than beef and chicken combined. Although significant differences exist between species, livestock also differ greatly depending on whether they live outdoors or indoors; whether they're milked regularly, artificially inseminated, etc., causing high production costs. As long as our society continues to accept animals as mere commodities whose only purpose is mass slaughtering for consumption instead of treating is as individuals with values equal to ours, I'm afraid that killing will continue without stopping soon enough. And who knows what else might disappear due to mankind becoming completely dependent on other creatures' suffering and death in exchange for his own comfort. These issues may sound too complicated, but unfortunately, most of us tend to view these things very simplistically in light of religious myths rather than viewing life itself as sacred. To summarize: Since humans are born into this world to kill, shouldn't we learn how to face the reality around us and eat less meat?
