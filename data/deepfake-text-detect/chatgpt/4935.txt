Generally speaking, you have two sides on the "Fat Debate": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, by threatening them with crushing it). To make matters worse for fat friends there is the fat shaming chasm between the two groups. The top statement of fat hatred comes from Fat Acceptance Week: "It would be difficult to understand why anyone should tolerate anything less than healthy living." That's all well and good if you're a fat friend who doesn't justify your actions but since I'm not, let me tell you that I can see why someone like me might feel comfortable tolerating fatness vs fat bashing for people whose life choices have no bearing whatsoever on my unpleasant opinions regarding their bodies. The fatphobia is irrational because either fat folks want you to think they are crazy or fat people just aren't satisfied being overweight! But what about fat self-righteousness? Why don't we just accept that fat people shouldn't put themselves through endless layers of pressure without trying something different each time these things happen so they won't become habitual members of society as they do now?!? I've been guilty of commenting on the negative side of fat shopping days when other commenters were pointing out how awful they look besides their attributes - in fact,Fatfriendzine has had a whole series of posts focused on this topic lately while discussing the "fat shaming" angle here at FatFriendzine Magazine which I'll get right back to you later today. Why do fat posters such as myself think fat isn't offensive? Why wouldn't we consider it acceptable behavior? Why should those who don't agree with us hate ourselves more mercilessly simply because they dislike our own humanity instead of blaming others? Why don't we stop ignoring it altogether because we perceive itself as completely unacceptable? What does FatacceptanceWeek mean? Personally, I believe fat acceptance helps us understand one another better thus making us stronger together rather than apart. In conclusion, let's stick together even though we disagree sometimes!
