He's intelligent and wealthy and adaptable apparently. I think the majority of Gotham's problems could've solved with smart investments in social programs and industry and the police force which Bruce Wayne can fund, but as you say he never really uses that money wisely or efficiently (except for One Way Trip). I like the idea of Batman going away to be a man about town not wearing his cape though because it makes sense. But does this mean him being corrupt? If so why doesn't anyone report him when they see what is happening? He's been doing well at keeping things under wraps from his political enemies and now even the people who live there don't seem to care. What are your thoughts on where we're going here? In a way it seems fitting since all our other heroes have gone off into something else altogether. I guess GL was only able to stay relevant on account of good storytelling around him. IMO many comic books today just aren't very compelling stories anymore. It's mostly action, gadgets, awesome powers, explosions etc etc. Not much depth or thought put behind them these days unfortunately. Just one long chase scene after another. Sometimes I wonder if ever before comics were more personal than they are now. Where characters actually had relationships and marriages, families etc etc instead of fighting eachother all day every day. And then everyone comes back home at night to their loving family. Or maybe that would ruin everything. Hmmm... Anyway, thanks again folks! Hope you enjoy my rambling post.
