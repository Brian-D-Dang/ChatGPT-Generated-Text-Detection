I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural thing. So for me it was always easy with my beloved forks and knives! (But of course I can't do everything so you are not alone.) However when growing up in Japan I was introduced to the concept of drinking green tea from this kind of cup called a sake bowl. It's made out of wood or some other material where the lip has been removed and replaced by a round piece which acts as a handle. The inside part is then lined with bamboo membranes. Green tea can be drunk from these bowls just like how wine glasses work but they have no handles because there aren't any. When serving drinks people usually hold them between their thumb and index finger while eating with the rest of your hand. This works pretty good if done right. In fact that must be why many Japanese prefer to drink things outdoors on summer days... Having said all of this I still feel sorry about those who struggle with using chopsticks. If we want to get faster we should train ourselves to think differently rather than simply throwing the traditional method away as useless. Here are 2 tips on how to make chopstick usage more efficient: 1) Forks vs Chopsticks - Try to focus first on learning fork handling before becoming fully comfortable with chop sticks. While eating rice with chopsticks often involves cutting into pieces fairly small pieces of cooked meatvegetables and tossing it around in the mouth you don't need to be concerned with getting sauce onto the tablecloth etc...however with fork-eating you will most likely end up with bits of burnt chicken skin mixed throughout your meal. That does mean using a lighter touch though - perhaps wait until after you've eaten something difficult to clean off your plate to move on? On countertops try avoiding putting dishes directly down on top of each other. Instead consider mixing up different foods and maybe pouring one over another instead of arranging them side by side. You know what looks awful? A mound of half crispy chips sitting atop a pile of hot crunchy noodles. Making mashed potatoes look elegant helps too:) 2) Eat without touching - Once you become familiar with moving food around with a fork remember to gently lift portions of uncooked food right off your place setting and bring both hands to your lips at once. Sometimes I find myself picking through an uneaten salad or vegetables I accidentally dropped onto the floor only to realize later that I wasn't actually hungry enough to finish it all anyways. Once you learn to pick up food off the table yourself you won't even notice someone else doing it for you. All that remains is to pick up the tray and calmly walk to your seat. I truly hope these two points help anyone who struggles with chopsticks and would love to hear any others you may have picked up during your own travels
