I recently discovered rAnglish. Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots. The result is a language that not only sounds but feels like it belongs in the world, which is why I started studying there in high school. What is Anglish? This is one of my favorite things about learning English: If you're unfamiliar with Anglish (and if you know exactly what it means), check out this video by Dr. Marcelo Cunha. This book is so practical! It's a 12 page booklet of all the words, phrases and syllables in Anglish. You can actually hear it in your head when you read it because it has every single word. It doesn't have to be hard for you to understand! There are plenty of explanations to help make sense of the text, including some examples from the translation process; some verbs and early alphabets, as well as examples from each chapter. If you want to learn how to spell 'anglish' on your own, try reading some on Google or Onionus.com. Anglish may not sound like much, but just a simple example of what it looks like! Here's how: Appear at a restaurant without saying anything in English. Score 10 points, using an average score of 5. At the store next door, give 100 points. When you get home, use an average of 8 points. When you visit your parents again, do not say anything in German.
