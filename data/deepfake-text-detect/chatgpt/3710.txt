Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the hiker did not take the proper precautions to prevent such an attack. Here are a few tips to reduce the likelihood of an animal attack while hiking: 1. Make noise: Animals are more likely to attack if they are surprised. While hiking, make loud noises to alert any potential animals in the area of your presence. You can clap your hands, talk loudly, or even sing. 2. Keep your distance: Many animals, such as bears and moose, are territorial and will attack if they feel threatened. When you see an animal, keep your distance and avoid getting too close. Use binoculars or a zoom lens to get a closer look without putting yourself in danger. 3. Know the signs: Be aware of the signs of animal activity in the area. For example, if you see fresh scat, tracks or claw marks, there could be animals nearby. Additionally, be cautious around areas that have sources of food and water for animals, such as berry patches or streams. 4. Stay on the trail: Hiking off-trail can increase your risk of an animal encounter, so be sure to stay on marked trails. Animals are more likely to use the paths less traveled, so stick to the most popular trails. 5. Be bear aware: If you are hiking in bear country, be sure to carry bear spray and know how to use it. Make noise so you don't surprise a bear, and never try to approach or feed one. By taking these precautions and being aware of your surroundings, you can reduce the likelihood of an animal attack while hiking.
