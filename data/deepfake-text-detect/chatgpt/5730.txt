I'd like to preface this by saying that parts of my post may sound like they're bragging, but they're not trying to come across that way. Also, I'm using a real life example of my brother to make my point, not a hypothetical. I just thought I'd put that out there. My brother and I have been super close since I was born, but when I was 8, he hit puberty. That's not a bad thing, but for a 12 year old, it's a huge thing. He went from being the fun, athletic, and energetic kid with a great sense of humor to someone who was disrespectful, rebellious, and mean. I had always been a good kid and was still an A student, but I don't know if he'd have made it if it wasn't for my parents. I tried to stay with him, but it was not always possible because we lived in different states. I could not move in with him because I was still in school. My parents tried to talk to him, but he refused to listen. So one day, he got in trouble for something major. He ended up getting put in jail and finally, he got it. He knew he was done and needed to do something. So he went to rehab. I'm not going to lie, it was really hard on my parents. They never expected him to get in trouble. It's not like they didn't know it was coming. But they were there for him. They talked to him, supported him, and never gave up on him. As for me, I was devastated. I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be in a jail cell. But I was proud of my brother and supported him 100. You might be wondering why I'm telling you this. Well, it's because I think it's important to keep pushing to achieve your goals. It's so easy to get sidetracked in life and it's easy to lose yourself. But if you have a good support system and a strong mind, you can get back on track. And now, my brother is back in school, living on his own, and working. He's not a bad kid anymore and he's no longer in jail. He's still 18, but he's on the right path. I know it's a lot to handle, but I've been there. I've lost myself in life and I didn't know where to go. But it's not too late. You can always get back on track. You just have to be willing to work for it.
