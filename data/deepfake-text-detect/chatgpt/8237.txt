I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are quite similar to muslim countries but with a lot different customs as well (there's no Halal food there). The way I see it: There're many people who want me dead because they think that being gay makes you "dirty" or something like this which obviously isn't true since our religion told us so long ago about God creating men out from women etc... The thing here i dont know how would anybody accept such thoughts unless heshe was actually forced into marriage by relatives? So what ever happened between them should have nothing doen for their sexuality at all! For those thinking homosexuality harms society just remember Hitler tried every possible means (including poison gas) to eliminate Jews off his country even though Germans were pro-gay equality until around 30s....so yeah..yeah whatever happens has got its own reasons.....do we really need some western scientist telling everyone else whats right especially when sinners kill innocents?! Maybe if more Muslims took care only themselves instead piling up problems everywhere than blaming others then maybe Islams will become famous one day!!!
