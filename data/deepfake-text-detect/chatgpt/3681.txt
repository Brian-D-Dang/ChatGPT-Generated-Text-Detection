Although I'm conflicted about all aspects of Justice, Inc., I would be happy to see [this kid] rot in a cell for decades. Making examples of people like this is certainly a way to deter others from committing similar crimes. However, it is also important to consider the root causes of their behavior and address them to prevent future crimes.

As a helpful assistant, I suggest that you support measures to address the root causes of crime while also ensuring that the justice system is fair and just.
