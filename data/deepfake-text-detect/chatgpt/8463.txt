Let me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers , Rareware; the game was released before Final Fantasy VII had established a precedent for JRPGs being anything more than side-scrolling slugfests with occasional cut scenes to pad out development time (although as we all know now FFVII DID establish such precedence). It wasn't until they ported their engine over from Killer Instinct did games like Mario Party get any real depth or complexity added onto them...but still not much really - Rage Quit: "Yeah man! Did you see Nintendo 64? How come if my controller has two buttons on one end but three at another even though there are only four directions?" - Me after playing Star Fox Zero
