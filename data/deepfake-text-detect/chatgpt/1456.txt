First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people . However, this has nothing at all do with my concept for this costume (and something to actually learn about if anyone wants). When we were first planning on doing this as a family Halloween activity, there was an idea floating around in our minds: Why not take a little bit from those old racist cartoons? You know, see what they did 100 years ago when dressing up as someone blatantly offensive or stereotypical didn't really have any negative ramifications other than maybe getting looked down upon by the parents of your choice...for being insensitive enough to think that would be okay. We spent hours researching "blackface" and came across many articles online where articles explained how different these characters are historically, their origin stories, etc., but also warned against drawing too much info into your character because otherwise you might end up looking like one. So then that got us thinking - why can't we make these costumes now without worrying about all that extra research? That's exactly what we decided to do! Here is what we made for Scottie. We started off by making him two masks using the basic guidelines outlined here. Then we put together the rest so he could wear them separately: his face mask containing his hairline, eyes, nose, eyebrows, and mouth; his chin covering his ears, jaw line, chin, and lower lip; his top half including handsarms- and mustache. We pulled the mustache part apart later since we weren't going to add anything else onto it except a horn sticking out which isn't necessary anyways. The hand parts were simple enough to just cut shapes out of paper, glue them back together, and spray paint before adding on the gloves. Everything dried overnight, so everything needed only minimal assembly time next day. It wasn't hard work, but rather tedious once we had gotten through each piece individually. But after it was over, we were super proud of ourselves! Thank goodness for Pinterest and tutorials D The reason we went for the exaggerated facial features I suppose comes from the fact that Black History Month has been happening lately and both Lucas and I wanted to get involved somehow while still staying true to the theme. This whole process helped me realize that even though it looks like a lot more effort went into this creation than originally planned (which reassured me) it definitely took very little that could easily be figured out beforehand. Which makes me happy, because according to Wikipedia, it apparently takes less than six minutes to create this kind of thing anyway xP
