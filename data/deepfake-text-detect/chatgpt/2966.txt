I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think science works in practice: It's all about experimentation and observation - which brings me back to my previous point on what counts as an anomaly. If we assume some natural system has "perfect" or "universal" properties (which are largely arbitrary) because they have been so well observed, then by our definition of an anomaly, every deviation from these universal properties would be considered anomalous. But if you're going to make such assumptions anyway, why not just go ahead and define everything else to fit your expectations? By doing so, there really isn't much difference between systematic errors and anomalies at that stage. While people may consider a particular result anomalous only when compared with their expectation based on past observations, those same results can very well be explained using any other way of interpreting data without changing anything fundamental about them. If you don't like something simply because it doesn't match preconceived notions of normal behavior, yet that behaviour also happens to deviate from common principles of statistical reasoning, then perhaps you should look no further than yourself!
