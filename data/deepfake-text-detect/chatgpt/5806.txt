Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make it into that elite 5, but what the hell do you do about it? I'm a sophomore in high school and I'm already stressed out thinking about college. I have a 3.6 GPA, I'm in all AP and honors classes, I have good extra curriculars, I have a part time job, I get straight A's in band, I get straight A's in orchestra, I have a good relationship with my family, I have good friends, I volunteer at a local animal shelter, I've been a member of the debate team for 5 years, I've been a member of the mock trial team for 5 years, I'm on the National Honor Society, I'm president of my schools biggest service organization, I'm a member of the Key Club, I'm a member of the Tri-M Music Honor Society, I've been on 5 school athletic teams, I've been president of my school's Math Club for 2 years and am currently the president of my school's Drama Club. I have 3.5 in music (clarinet, flute, and piano), 3.0 in math (calculus, algebra, and geometry), 3.5 in history, and 3.5 in English. I'm just wondering what the hell I need to do to make sure I'm getting into one of those 5. My parents can't really help because their income is so high that I don't qualify for any scholarships.

I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make it into that elite 5, but what the hell do you do about it? I'm not sure what you do about it. I'm in the top 5 of my class, and I've already gotten a few offers for scholarships. Some of them are for a specific major, and some are for the whole college. And I still have a lot of things that I need to do to get into the top 5 of my class, but I'm doing my best. I'm in the top 5 of my class, and I've already gotten a few offers for scholarships. Some of them are for a specific major, and some are for the whole college. Yeah, I'm in the top 10 of my class and I've gotten one or two offers from certain colleges. I'm not sure what you do about it. I'm not either. I guess it's all just luck. I'm not sure what you do about it. I'm in the top 5 of my class, and I've already gotten a few offers for scholarships.

I guess I'm just a little worried about it. The good thing is I'm in the top 25 of my class, and I have a very supportive family. I'm trying to go into either engineering or computer science. My parents have a lot of money, and I'm trying to get scholarships for both of those. Tell me what you're doing and I'll tell you if it'll work.
