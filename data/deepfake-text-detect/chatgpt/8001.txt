Counter-argument: While it is important for historical films to adhere to a certain level of accuracy, imposing strict monitoring or banning them outright can be detrimental to artistic expression and creativity. Films that are 'based on a true story' are often produced to inspire and inform audiences, but they are not intended to be documentaries. Filmmakers have creative liberties to present the story in a compelling and entertaining manner. Additionally, some facts may be difficult to corroborate or verify, and it may not be reasonable to expect a perfect representation of historical events. Therefore, rather than banning or strictly monitoring these films, it may be more beneficial to encourage filmmakers to provide disclaimers stating which parts of the story are factual and which parts have been fictionalized. This approach helps audiences to differentiate between facts and fiction and reduces the risk of spreading misinformation.
