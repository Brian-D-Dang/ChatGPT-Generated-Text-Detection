Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and yet it doesn't make the problem any easier to accept at face value for me when women do get raped by men because somehow acknowledging their experience makes my penis sad or something? Its not your fault dude
