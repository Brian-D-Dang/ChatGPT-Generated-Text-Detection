Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move onto the next story. I'm not sure what kind of question these days we're dealing with but there are better ways to handle this than making a public statement and expecting people to understand right away because they don't know the full details. Yeah, the news isn't always written perfectly so you need someone who knows the stories well enough to tell them correctly for understandable reasons. The best way to do it would be for people to communicate properly instead of having the whole thing covered up by reporters saying things like this: "The autopsy shows no signs of trauma or gunshot wounds."
