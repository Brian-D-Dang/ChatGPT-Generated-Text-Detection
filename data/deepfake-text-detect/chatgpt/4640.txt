If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will require full-time work and more people will have part timeflexible jobs. Even if we assume that all current job losses were permanent (they're not), there would still be a need for an huge number of new positions - 20 trillion worth as mentioned above. That means that you could significantly reduce unemployment by creating those additional jobs immediately. This is arguably even easier with machine learning technologies than it was back when manufacturing jobs began declining due to robots. On top of all this good stuff: GDP might increase because a lot of these newly created jobs would add consumer spending power which has been stagnant in recent years. Finally, it increases net corporate profits, increasing stock prices. I think this all adds up to lower interest rates over the next few decades. The question isn't whether AI can replace most jobs; it already does. It's how fast can we do so? My bet is fairly confident on "yes" here.
