I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot in this country? The reason is because they are trained to be unarmed when it comes to firearms. And if you're an unarmed man walking down a street, someone will think that he's got a gun. You won't hear from him until after he runs off with his girlfriend. This is why cops should wear long clothes and don't act like criminals. This was more of a psychological issue than a law enforcement agency having to justify their actions. Just look at what was happening today in Minnesota and Florida where police shot two young males in the back. If that were not for the fact that there were no other reports of shootings there being any suicides by cops, then all the incidents would not be going on now. We already know that there has been an increase in killings by the Police Department since 2004.
