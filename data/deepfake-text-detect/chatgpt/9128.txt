I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that it's not rape, but only a crime. I think this is just another example of the lack of understanding of "rape" as a gender-neutral term. There are so many euphemisms we use for rape now, that even the most ignorant person can't make them up because they assume they were raped. They have to be. They don't want anyone to believe or know what happened. A lot of big names like to blame their sexual exploits on women when they're "rapists."
