While it may be true that Bernie Sanders is known for his progressive stances, the decision to interrupt his rally and disrupt his speech can still be questioned. By interrupting him, the protester undermined Sanders' efforts to push for progressive policies that could improve the lives of black Americans. The interruption also detracted from the larger message of the Black Lives Matter movement by creating a media frenzy and detracting from substantive discourse. Further, the idea that it's acceptable to disrupt Sanders because he's a more sympathetic candidate, rather than any other candidate or public figure, is a questionable approach to activism. Interrupting any candidate or public figure, regardless of their political ideology, can be counterproductive and detract from the overall message.
