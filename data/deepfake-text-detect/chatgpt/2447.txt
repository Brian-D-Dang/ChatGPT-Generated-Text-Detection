The expense of a higher education has been a hot button issue for a number of years but the fact that students take on huge loans and graduate with huge debt loads, often limits their ability to start families. To address this challenge (and many others), in 2016 Facebook committed 100 million over five years toward supporting historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, as well as Asian American-Serving Institutions by funding scholarships and grants. This is not an easy task when you consider HBCUs have long struggled financially because they receive less federal money per student than predominantly white campuses do. Just recently, several prominent figures stepped forward during Black History Month pledging support so these schools can continue educating future generations of leaders. Among them were former President Bill Clinton who vowed to match donations up to 1 million while hip hop mogul Jay Z pledged one million dollars himself along with being joined by Beyonce Knowles Carter's BeyGOOD initiative which intends to raise another four million dollars through its scholarship program called Formation Scholars. With such generous pledges from high profile celebrities and private citizens it begs us all two questions: why isn't there more attention paid to similar needs at our public universities? And how much longer will we allow anti-intellectualism to be tolerated among young people especially those attending college where knowledge should always trump ignorance or bigotry cloaked under "i'm just telling it like it is"?
