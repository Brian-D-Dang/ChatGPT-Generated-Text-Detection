First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person when it comes to writing and speaking on matters of faith so my opinion may be useful at least for information purposes as well as some entertainment value. Starting with what is perhaps the most important issue facing parents these days: how do children get exposed to God? For those who have grown up Christian (especially if you are raised by devout Christians) getting exposed to God simply means church attendance every Sunday morning or maybe just being around your family all day long during the weekdays until they go to bed. However, many people today live far away from where their families are located which makes going back home very difficult due to school and work commitments. If you happen to decide to move to another country permanently after marriage, chances are high that there will also be no churches close enough to worship regularly even if you wanted to attend religious services on Sundays anyway. So, how can one pray when heshe isn't sure where Jesus is right now but still needs Him? What can we do when He might seem distant andor absent for us? These questions were probably asked before and answered accordingly because many other religions also face similar issues. That said, let's see what the Bible says about such situations. The Word of God has several references concerning prayer. It begins in Genesis 6:8-9 which tells us about Adam and Eve and their expulsion from Garden of Eden on account of eating forbidden fruit. Here, we find out that both human beings and animals had become perfectly intelligent already before the Fall happened. In fact, animals could talk to each others as early as Cainan's time. As for humans, they had begun worshipping idols already prior to the fall and their first encounter with Satan (Genesis 3:5). The real problem was brought later through communication between man and the serpent (the devil) while in conversation in the woods outside the garden. All things considered, prayer seems to be among our earliest abilities as humans - something which does predate language itself! Thereafter, in order for people to be able to communicate freely anymore than needed, God created languages and placed them on earth together with various types of speech like singing songs etc. This suggests that although tongues used to exist, it wasn't God's primary gift to mankind throughout history nor did He intend for everyone to speak it in his time. We know very little else about tongue until Acts chapter 2 where it became an official part of Christianity. Matthew chapter 16 then records Jesus praying in public using multiple phrases along with His disciples. Also note here that the passage doesn't say anything about prayers having been possible earlier since only believers received the Holy Spirit upon conversion. From the above examples we learn two key facts regarding prayer: 1) It forms part of what made humanity more perfect than animals or angels. 2) Prayer existed earlier before written words ever came into existence. Although I haven't mentioned yet Jesus' miracles directly, remember that seeing signs from God plays an equally important role in exposing kids to Jesus. Of course, miracles themselves cannot be correlated with exposure to Christ personally either except perhaps as proof for faithfulness. Miracles are the actions of a powerful force against evil forces though. Many modern prophets appear and perform miracles too especially in times of great danger. They don't necessarily act according to the teachings of their respective religious groups though. These events almost always occur locally rather than globally unlike the bible story of Noah and his Ark. Furthermore, they usually involve natural phenomena like waters parting or stones turning to blood. If you think about it, neither would make sense unless the prophet were given supernatural powers beforehand. Even genies aren't granted unlimited wishes without limits regardless whether they ask nicely or threaten instead! Again, miracles alone shouldn't be considered evidence for personal exposure to Jesus. So, what should parents do instead to expose their kid (s)? Well...for starters, teaching himher letters. Letters contain sounds which allow people to talk to eachother over distances increasingly quickly depending on distance apart. Languages are based on sound combinations whereas symbols only represent parts of spoken word. Nowadays, teachers use tablets eith keyboard apps to teach youngsters new vocabulary much quicker compared to old books for learning. So, reading stories aloud and reciting poems containing unfamiliar terms helps expose children to different concepts without needing cumbersome lessons afterwards. Writing down words on paper is also a good idea. The main reason why this works better than simply talking to someone on the phone is that it keeps one engaged mentally before actually trying the next step by doing hands on activities like drawing pictures etc. Some schools realize this while introducing their pupils to computer programming courses at elementary level nowadays. You don't need expensive equipment either. A cheap laptop computer running Ubuntu Linux definitely suffices. Computers come equipped with screens and keyboards standardly anyway so so......!!
