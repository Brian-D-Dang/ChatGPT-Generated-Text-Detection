Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, considering or introducing increases to their respective minimum wages this summer for employees who work at least 30 hours per week as annually mandated by provincial legislation.. I believe that increasing our country's minimum wage is a good thing with regards to helping out those struggling most financially during these times: young people trying to get back into work after COVID-19 layoffs; single parents such as myself working more than 1 job just to make ends meet day-to-day; and part-timeseasonal workers like me looking for something stable to build on long term. The main reason why it may not be so popular yet though, is due to its strong effect on food prices which could have a negative impact on consumers' purchasing power. A study conducted last June showed that higher minimum wages led to decreases in sales volumes over time among restaurants across all categories studied. If you want to read about how governments should approach the subject, check out my article here. The same study also found that companies employing fewer than 10 workers actually saw an increase in revenue once they were forced to pay staff 15 dollars per hour compared to when only paying them 12.50 - although no firm conclusion was drawn regarding whether employers would keep doing business if they had been compelled to raise salaries earlier. As well, another recent study published in the journal Labour Economics revealed that businesses chose to pass along price rises rather than absorb any cost themselves. So while there's some clear data showing consumer spending can suffer from increased labour costs, one important caveat needs to be noted since employment numbers don't necessarily translate directly to income growth. This means we need to look elsewhere if we're hoping for economic recovery through boosting the wages of low paid workers since other factors such as inflation will inevitably play havoc regardless of policy changes. To combat rising restaurant prices, many U.S. cities are bringing back tax rebates for card payments instead. For example, Philadelphia announced that starting July 8th, residents who use the city's public transportation system (the subway and buses) to buy meals will receive weekly bonuses up to 20 each. Other Canadian municipalities including Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary have introduced similar initiatives over the course of 2020 aimed at encouraging folks to dine outdoors instead: "We know diners love eating outside," said Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante. "So let us help make dining outside even better." These programs are set to continue throughout 2021 too... but will they really save money? When it comes down to it, making sure everyone gets enough to eat isn't exactly rocket science because basic human nature dictates that safety net services must exist alongside capitalism. But there's still room left for improvement beyond mere government assistance: if Canada truly wanted to alleviate poverty (and many do), then what precisely might we begin prioritizing next? In my opinion, we'd benefit greatly from implementing universal basic income (UBI). Currently being introduced in countries around Europe and Scandinavia - as well as Argentina and Greece before them - UBI provides monthly cash benefits to citizens based solely on age, gender or family status without regard to earnings history. While UBI doesn't eliminate unemployment entirely nor does it guarantee jobs will always come your way, research shows it reduces the risk of falling below the poverty line. That's especially true given the current global crisis where many households are losing their incomes completely thanks to lockdowns designed to stop the virus spreading. And unlike social security coffers, every dollar received by a citizen from a UBI program can only ever go toward necessities, meaning less waste and therefore more resources available to tackle larger problems facing society today. What Could Go Wrong With Universal Basic Income In Canada? Despite being touted as a hopeful solution to alleviating hunger in poor communities worldwide, UBI hasn't quite taken off as expected everywhere it's been implemented thus far. Last month, Finland became the first European nation to introduce full UBI, offering 560 (720 CAD) stipends to unemployed citizens aged 18-65 years old depending upon circumstances. At present, however, the scheme seems likely to remain voluntary until 2025. It'll take longer to see if the experiment succeeds when EVERYONE, from adults to children under 16 who qualify for free school breakfasts lunches are getting involved!

Dual mandates refer to attitudes towards both welfare and national defense funding and analysts argue that politicians tend to choose or prefer investments targeting the latter over the former when attempting to find solutions to societal ills such as poverty among vulnerable populations.
