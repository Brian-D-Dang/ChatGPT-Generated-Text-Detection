In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they 're young and healthy sometimes makes them feel like it's their last time with the same human being. Now I'm not saying that there are no limits to what people can and cannot do in this country, but I am saying that any laws that allow girls to have sex under certain circumstances should be enforced strictly by women everywhere. It doesn't matter if you're Swedish or not - the only way for someone living in Sweden to get pregnant and have children is through an abortion. There is nothing wrong with having sex, everyone has rights. You just need to look at how the US is enforcing it. You can never take away sexual freedom because you don't want it done so arbitrarily. And if you are going to live your life subjugated by medical treatment that's also something else entirely.
