I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. The war is what gave rise not only communist regimes or fascist ones but also nazism itself which was just an outgrowth thereof anyway without any real ideological substance behind it as such except for racism no matter how much they would like us all think otherwise now after decades have passed since WW2 happened... Also communismmarxists didn't really win either because their ideas were proven wrong about "peaceful" revolution through violent means eventually leading back into another world conflict before long with constant red terror under various forms both here abroad being used against workers' communes etc.. That's why I see them more akin today than ever coming from say Russia who has never been known nor considered anything other then tyrannies by anyone else besides themselves simply due do some serious delusion; rather Stalin himself said this during his time: "The death penalties should be abolished outright," he wrote." In our country there are still many people sentenced on trumped up charges purely so we can keep these human-chattel slaves alive longer when perhaps if executed right away even one year might make quite enough difference between life vs execution? When you put men onto starvation rations including near nothing food whatsoever while working conditions continued unchanged until well past normal retirement age yet production quotas must absolutely meet despite military needs overrunning civilian populations thus perpetuating totalitarian economies upon everyone especially those made poor thru taxation schemes across borders elsewhere around Europe too! Even though most countries had already fallen apart economically once things became worse again postwar following years preceding.... During late 1940s Soviet Union having its own economic problems lifted millions off farms via starving peasants finally allowed work opportunities instead albeit forced labor camps often housing upwards 2 million each throughout European Communist Bloc nations where lots escaped NKVD murders wanted lists..... So yes counting going beyond 1920 Great Depression levels unemployment rates industry growth stagnated everywhere outside Asia regardless whether capitalist systems existed beforehand OR NOT...... It wasn't capitalism per se caused prosperity first hand anymore preexisting companies taken hostage bringing down entire societies merely held together temporarily using violence selling goods necessary products related infrastructure building materials none competitive exportable stuff priorly capitalized solely based entirely foreign loans paid interest immediately deducted straightway forcing public debt spiraling impossibly high virtually bankrupting formerly developed peoples within little generations.... What works isn' t necessarily free market economics..... And thats exactly my point... Social Democracy always succumbs socialism soon thereafter sooner later destroyed completely.... Just look ahead ten centuries ago.. There won'T BE NO CAPITALISM ANYMORE AT ALL IN TEN CENTURIES FROM NOW WE WILL HAVE SOCIAL DEMOCRACY BECOME THE NORMAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM ...
