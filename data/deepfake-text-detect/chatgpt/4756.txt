Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, or considering a mandate for a higher hourly rate than what is currently paid to workers at low-wage workplaces: Ontario[1], New York,[2] Washington State,[3] British Columbia, Manitoba and Quebec have all created legislation andor issued advisory opinions requiring employers with more than 10 employees to pay their lowest-paid workers 10 per hour by July 2017.[456] The Canadian federal government has also legislated that the current federally mandated maximum salary should be raised from an astonishingly low level of just above poverty line (to within about 15 of it), so that no one would ever work on less than approximately 15 per hour.[7]. I'm not going to argue whether this makes sense economically, because there really isn't any such thing as "economic sense..."at least anything beyond plain common sense economic arguments based upon basic microeconomics applied without political ideology getting involved. This post will however explore some other factors to consider when evaluating how much we can do to increase wages, given competing demands like reducing unemployment rates, increasing employment levels, etc. It's important to look at both sides of the equation before making policy decisions since they affect people outside our consideration space; even if the net effect is beneficial overall. Most importantly, I want to make sure you understand why each side of the argument matters, and where those costs lie if you don't use them - which frankly may mean losing out on potential jobs opportunities altogether! Let me start off by saying that there are two major groups who oppose income inequality: Conservatives and LiberalsDemocrats. For the purposes of this article, I am going to focus mostly on Republicans. The Conservative Argument 1 Conservatives usually think of themselves as being staunch defenders of free markets, capitalist enterprise, and individual liberty, among many other things. However, they often forget that capitalism itself comes with its fair share of problems or contradictions, and over time reactionaries tend to become rabid ideological opposites to whatever progressive changes might arise. One place conservatives frequently get into trouble is on issues related to labour rights, decrying anything that increases worker salaries while simultaneously advocating policies which keep prices artificially high through union monopoly protections, minimal competition, and anti-trust laws which immunize entrenched industries against market forces, thus keeping profits flowing towards shareholders instead of the workers whose productivity allowed said profits to accrue in the first place. If your goal is simply maximizing corporate profit, then monopolies are great tools to reach that end, but if you care for the wellbeing of citizens generally - especially the poor - then the effects go well beyond cheaper goods - they bleed across all areas of society, including economics, politics, culture, education and personal development. As a result, conservative politicians typically try to reconcile these conflicting objectives, often resulting in incoherent advocacy which leaves voters confused and disheartened. And guess what? That's exactly what happened during the last election cycle in the United States! Without further ado...let us turn now to the main objection from conservatives regarding this topic. Conservative Objection 1a: Why Is Increasing Wages Bad Anyway? This involves asking whether or not increased earnings actually serve to improve conditions for the majority of individuals. In practice most people fall somewhere between both extremes of accepting everything hand fed to them by economists and actively rejecting everything written on paper (aka taking enjoyment from critical thinking). You probably already know my opinion on this issue, but let's pretend that I give credence to alternative perspectives and open mindedness for awhile. What happens once you accept that everyone wants enough money to avoid starvation, shelter, health care, clothing and general security? Well, it turns out that giving someone more money doesn't necessarily cause them to spend that extra cash on consumer items. Instead, it gives them access to additional resources. Obviously this means that more spending begets greater demand which leads to inflation, but I'll leave that discussion for another day. Here's the point. Consider the case that I earn 100 dollars per week, which is below median wage earners in my area (1000 dollars per month); does it seem reasonable to assume that I could easily afford medical expenses, food for myself and maybe my child (ren) (2000 per month?), rental accommodation for myself and family members (3000per month?) AND internet connection fees, insurance for car home ownerships, utilities phone bills PLUS retirement savings contributions and regular giftsbirthday presents PLUS holiday celebrations (5000) if required every calendar year? Of course not! Even if I saved up that amount, inevitably something else will come along to eat away at it, thereby depleting the reserve funds available for future needs until I find myself back down around zero again after paying monthly obligations incurred due to having been chronically short of extra-extra-ratter-job-exposure-vast-functioning-no-effectively excipfor system elemententire indifference to enter
