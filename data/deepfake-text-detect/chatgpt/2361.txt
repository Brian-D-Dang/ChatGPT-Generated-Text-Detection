I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If we as humans are born with an inclination towards fear (or love) then how can someone who believes in the paranormal logically justify that there is some sort of higher power? It seems like everything our brain experiences should reinforce what they believe, such as seeing ghosts and hearing voices instead would prove them wrong by their own standards. You're right on point!
