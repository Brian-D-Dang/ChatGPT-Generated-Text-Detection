Climate change or global warming as it previously was known as is a hot potatoe and not a very clean cut science to predict. There are thousands of climate scientists and climatologists who are on the bandwagon and also scientists who think otherwise. This is true for both sides. There are those who believe that global warming is only a myth and there are those who are against it. These people are both scientists as well. The debate has been going on for a very long time and is not expected to come to an end anytime soon. Recent data reveals that the earth has been warming for the last 10,000 years and it has nothing to do with human intervention. The reason for this is because the earth is warming after every ice age. The last ice age ended around 10,000 years ago and it's now a period of global warming. The earth has been warming for more than 10,000 years. The reason for global warming is the constant burning of fossil fuels which makes carbon dioxide. This is what is causing the greenhouse effect that is creating global warming. Climate change is actually a natural process. It is a natural phenomena that takes place on the earth and it is a part of the eco system. The reason for global warming has been explained by the greenhouse effect that takes place because of the release of greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide is one of the gases that is responsible for global warming. Climate change is the change of the average weather patterns of a region. Climate is generally the long term weather patterns in a specific region or area. These patterns are usually detected over a period of 30 years or more and they help to predict the weather patterns for the next 30 years. These patterns are used by climatologists to predict the weather patterns. Climate change is the long term pattern of the weather in a certain region and how these weather patterns are changing over time. Climate change can occur very slowly over a period of years or it can occur over a period of decades. There are many factors that can have an impact on these climate patterns. These include changes in the ocean and atmosphere, changes in the amount of sunlight and even changes in the amount of land mass. Climate change is a gradual process that takes place over long periods of time. The weather patterns in a certain region can change over a period of years and not decades. The weather patterns in a certain region can also change over a period of centuries. These changes are not related to climate change but are still important. In other words, the weather patterns are related to weather and not climate change. Climate change is a gradual process that takes place over a long period of time. These climate patterns are the average weather patterns of a region or area and they have been observed for a long time. These climate patterns are used by climatologists to predict the weather patterns of a region or area over a period of 30 years. Climate patterns are also the long term weather patterns of a region or area and these patterns change over time. They can change very slowly over a period of years or they can change rapidly over a period of decades. Climate patterns are observed over a period of 30 years or more and they help to predict the weather patterns in a specific region or area. The weather patterns in a certain region can change over a period of years but they are not related to climate change. The weather patterns in a certain region can also change over a period of decades but they are not related to climate change. Climate change is a gradual process that takes place over a period of years or decades.
