I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning. It seems to me that we have developed many different types of behavior, a good example being the fact that there is an equal level of competition in chess for men or women but there are few female players at all competitions. As I understand it there has been no real change in how people act towards one another but instead a mostly "good intentions" that lead us to belief that there must be some sort of discrimination against females because they just aren't as intelligent as males. This leads on to my final point: why do women have to deal with more problems when compared to their male counterparts? Because we have a lot more things going on than just our sex. There's also the fact that society has made feminism sex positive. Men can enjoy sex without having to worry about being labeled gay if they choose not too (and even then, great for them!).
