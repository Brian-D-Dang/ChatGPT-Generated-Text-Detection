I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically speaking, we haven't had a fatality-causing disaster with a nuclear power plant in the US. Granted, that's only because we haven't had a really bad disaster yet, but the odds are still in our favor. The biggest risk is actually something that isn't connected to the nuclear power plant itself, but rather the mismanagement of the nuclear waste. A recent BBC article reports on a possible solution for that particular problem. The article describes a new technique for storing nuclear waste, using a specialized concrete mix. It's not quite as simple as pouring cement in a box, though, and that's where the real magic comes in. The new method relies on an accelerant - a solvent that acts as a catalyst for the reaction that generates the cement. In other words, it acts as the "glue" that holds the concrete together. The accelerant that's currently being considered is hydrogen fluoride, a chemical compound that can be found in many everyday household items. In fact, if you've ever taken an acidic swallow when you were younger, it's probably hydrogen fluoride that you swallowed. Hydrogen fluoride will react with ordinary calcium compounds and other compounds found in concrete, and the resulting reaction will cause the concrete to form. The cool thing is that the accelerant reacts with the concrete without creating any other byproducts, other than the concrete itself. So, while you may have to be careful when handling the material while it's being mixed, you can be assured that it won't contaminate the environment when it's done. The BBC article also reports that this isn't the first time that this kind of thing has been tried. In fact, the accelerant has been used in the concrete industry for decades now. There have been a few small-scale tests of the concrete, and they've shown that the concrete is safe for use. We should be cautious, though. Just because it's safe for use, it doesn't mean that it can't be used in the wrong way. After all, concrete is used to build everything from sidewalks to skyscrapers, and we've seen plenty of examples where that kind of concrete has been used incorrectly. I have no doubt that the concrete industry will be very cautious about using this kind of concrete in the future, but it's still something that we should be cautious about.
