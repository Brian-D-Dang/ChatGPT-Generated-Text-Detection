There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: typo My sister and brother were like that when they went to see it (they're 12 13). I had the misfortune of sitting through most of it with them as well
