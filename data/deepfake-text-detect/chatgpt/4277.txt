While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established players while at the same time being able to draw down some of their energy will be a powerful tool in the fight against P2W mechanics. I remember when i first started playing this game back in 2005-2006 it was fairly easy to get by without any money. Now, with the current economy its simple enough to earn enough gold for all your characters without having to buy anything (at least on the beta). How long till we can do this? When the economy is more stable if say in 4 years or so. What will happen then? Will there still be an influx of new people who are seeking revenge on old people? Will they have been burned too many times before them that trying to pick up where they left off wont work anymore? By that point how would they feel about getting back into the game again? Would they stop altogether since most of those players have lost interest the game itself has gone nowhere which makes it hard for them to just continue as one player? Or do you think they'll hold out until the next expansion comes around?
