One counter-argument could be that monuments to Confederate soldiers are not necessarily symbols of racism, but are rather a reminder of a significant period in American history. While it is true that the Confederacy was founded on the preservation of slavery, not all soldiers who fought for the Confederacy supported slavery. Therefore, these monuments can be seen as a tribute to those who fought for their beliefs and values, rather than a celebration of racism. Moreover, removing these monuments can be seen as an attempt to erase history, rather than learning from it, and this can be detrimental to society. Instead, we should focus on educating people about the true history of the Confederacy, including its racist foundations, so that we can learn from our past and make a better future for all.
