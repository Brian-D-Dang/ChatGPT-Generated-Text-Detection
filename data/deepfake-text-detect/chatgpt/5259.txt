I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too much for me to comprehend." That's not true. It really does depend on the location: if you're from somewhere like Boise or Boise State University then there aren't many people who could help but it depends where you live most likely. If you're coming here for work then yes everyone looks down their nose at you anyways because they don't want to admit they were born there pre-programmed into your birth control habits:)
