On a hair dryer: "Do not use in a shower." If somebody's dumb enough to use a hair dryer in the shower, they're not going to pay much attention to that warning. It was actually an instruction on how not to get electrocuted while using it for a completely different purpose in the bathroom and then forgetting about it until you go to use it again. There are still warnings like this posted everywhere from my experience with hotels etc
