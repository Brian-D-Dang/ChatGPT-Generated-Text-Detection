To clarify my title I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable unless the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, or the child is the product of incest. The mother and child can be legally separated if she wishes to terminate it but not both have been abused by her husband for a long period due to the abuse. According to the law, before any court order can prevent her from terminating a pregnancy, there must be parental consent or death. The fetus cannot be aborted without parental consent as well as any other rights either way would require pregnancy termination. The law does allow the pregnant woman's body to abort the baby because that abortions are considered murder which is against the law. But it can't prevent someone else from terminating a pregnancy using illegitimate means such as a rape kit (i.e. taking out the life of the unborn child). This means that the law doesn't apply when the woman terminates the pregnancy entirely through abortion itself since such pregnancies are punishable under the law according to the law rape. Another explanation could be contained in the last paragraph: "Any person who had sex with another person involved the use of an illegal substance." This sentence also includes the word "or" which requires additional clarification; this is why it seems like there aren't legal protections given the nature of sexual intercourse involving drugs and alcohol. Another explanation could include a lack of consent or harmful circumstances in the case where the woman becomes pregnant while married. While the situation may sound similar to those described above, the law isn't exactly perfect nor should anyone needlessly punish women who choose to terminate their unwanted pregnancies. Abortion isn't a crime performed solely so that a man might inflict harm on his wife or children. Nevertheless, even though it shouldn't be assumed that women shouldn't experience worst consequences during childbirth they still face some harsh penalties including imprisonment.
