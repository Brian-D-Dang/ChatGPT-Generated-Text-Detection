Every election year this is one of the most popular complaints against candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. "So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so what? He doesn't say how." The TV ads are even worsethey're incredibly misleading with their language (I've seen some that claim health care costs will be reduced when in reality they'll just have a 2 tax on everyone). But at least there's something you can do about it...vote! Vote for issues-based candidates instead of personality based ones. When I was running for office, we were very careful not make any promises related specifically to our annual budgets. We had specific plans for things like expanding access to public transportation or creating more green space, etc., but none of them included large dollar amounts associated with then cutting taxes, reducing spending, etc.. The problem with politicians making these kinds of promises is that if your opponent runs on the same platform, it's easy for him to steal some of those voter base by saying "Here, let me just cut out all those silly projects my opponent wants!" That way, he has an easier time portraying himself as fiscally responsible while promising the exact opposite thing than his opponents would have promised.
