As can be seen in [this image] , in most places in the U.S. (and maybe elsewhere that right-on-red is allowed?), it is legal to turn right on red from either lane of a 4-lane street, as long as you yield to other traffic that may be in the intersection. This can create a situation where someone is driving straight across an intersection, with cars coming from all directions, and then stopping to yield to the car coming from their right. I believe this is the right-on-red violation that is causing the most accidents in my area. Why not have people turn right on red from both lanes simultaneously, like they do at intersections that have an arrow or two-way stop? If this were the case, the car that is already in the intersection wouldn't have to stop, and the car that is turning right would not have to stop. egingroup My understanding of the question is that if you are turning right, you may do so with or without a stop sign, as long as you yield to any traffic that may be in the intersection (and no one is coming from the left). endgroup - DavePhD Mar 6 '14 at 15:30 egingroup DavePhD I have seen that. At intersections that have a stop sign, there will be a "Yield to right turn only" sign on the right-turn lane. endgroup - pjs36 Mar 6 '14 at 15:37 egingroup DavePhD, you are correct about how I was operating my car, but I think the question is about how you would have to design the intersection to avoid this problem. endgroup - pjs36 Mar 6 '14 at 15:52 egingroup I have an answer that proposes a compromise solution for this problem, which seems to be very popular in a lot of places. The compromise is to have two stop signs, one for each lane. This seems to work well, and I've never seen a stop sign intersection with two stop signs to fail to work perfectly. I've also seen it work very well on roundabouts, which I was really surprised by. endgroup - DavePhD Mar 6 '14 at 17:07 egingroup It is a good question. It's actually a common issue here in Europe. On many intersections, traffic lights are not used, but instead the traffic is controlled by stop signs. If there are two stop signs, you have to stop before every intersection, which is annoying. A possible solution would be to have two different signs for each direction. The second sign would be after the first intersection, but before the second one, etc. endgroup - mins Mar 6 '14 at 17:15 This is a problem, which has a solution. You can have two stop signs One at the left side of the intersection. One at the right side of the intersection. It is however uncommon, because having two stop signs at an intersection is a bit of a bad idea, as the two stop signs are at the wrong place and not convenient to drivers. But this is a good solution. egingroup I have an answer that proposes a compromise solution for this problem, which seems to be very popular in a lot of places.

You still have the two stop signs, but drivers must yield to oncoming traffic if they want to turn right on red. endgroup - DavePhD Mar 6 '14 at 18:00 egingroup
