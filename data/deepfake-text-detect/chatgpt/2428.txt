Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just say that the thread was reported for being "too long" by one person who probably doesn't even read reddit on an average day (it's less than two pages). made me feel pretty bad about myself We all know how much you love it when someone makes you do stuff like that!;)
