To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting to be one myself (I'm in college), the more I read about it and hear from others who have been using this curriculum at home with their kids, the less convinced I get by its claims for academic improvement. This leads me back to what we learned in English class: you are able to improve your writing if you study it regularly. The act of studying doesn't magically transform the written word into something beautiful or even coherent-the art of writing involves deliberate practice over time; that's how all good writers manage to polish up their work until it looks almost effortless. Or perhaps you could think of it as similar to learning an instrument - confidence comes through consistency of use rather than talent alone. It may take longer to master lyrics on guitar but once you know them well enough, they sound exactly like what you're trying to write: perfect. As long as students keep practicing, they will gradually develop a deeper sense of awareness when forming sentences and words so they can change things around later without feeling lost. They'll also begin building prior knowledge, such as grammar rules which help guide their spelling and punctuation. Even though Common Core has not yet announced any plans to revamp certain parts of the core curricula beyond adding language arts-focused content, students everywhere seem to agree that adding new skillscontent makes everything else more accessible. However, as I'm sure many people would say, just because there won't be extensive changes next year does not mean that teachers shouldn't start teaching every single skill they've added! In fact, that's probably the first thing parents need to do - sit down together with teachers and figure out precisely where students stand right now. What did they learn last year? How much better off were they compared to peers who only received general education courses instead of specific classes dealing directly with language arts subjects? Are basic concepts being grasped? Is everyone doing okay? If certain areas aren't improving then address those immediately before worrying too much about the rest of the curriculum.
