As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They save your life- Not only are they designed for this purpose but a lot of accidents occur because people don't have them on or just forgot about it (like in a car). They protect you from getting injured more than once - It's hard enough getting hurt once when cycling and then trying again is 100x harder! They also reduce injuries that come with falls etc., which are common especially at beginner levels. For example, if you fall off a bike without a helmet, you will probably get some bruising, maybe even cuts and scrapes. With helmets though? You could be fine as long as no part of head gets hit by anything else (except glass) because...they absorb all energy The most important thing is for you to look cool while doing so - By looking like an idiot everyone around you won't bother talking to you anymore and you'll become less likely to ride bikes in public places. What would happen if every cyclist had a shaved head? Do you think there'd be fewer cyclists? Would it make them feel safer? Or does safety really matter?
