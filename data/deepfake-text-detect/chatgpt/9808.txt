before you guys bombard me with downvotes I would simply like to point out that I am not saying this is true. I am just expressing my conditional views that if this is true, it would be a huge problem Downvotes don't necessarily mean people disagree with you; they could just mean that your post isn't particularly interesting or relevant to the conversation. It's important to remember that everyone is entitled to their opinion and that criticism should be constructive rather than negative.
