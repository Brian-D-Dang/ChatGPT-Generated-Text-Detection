Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. Rappers aren't more talented than other musicians... Some rap artists just cannot sing to save their lives and are only known for their unpleasant delivery of gratingly repetitive rhymes.... ftfy
