So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training , but as a volunteer firefighter myself: how long could you spend in one place before your firefighting knowledge and experience would go to the wayside? Or does this actually happen all too often for some reason? I honestly think it's just because so many people are from their home townsunless were talking about really big cities where they can afford full-time staff firefighters, there isn't much time or money to train any more than you need. That way once a citizen gets trained up heshe knows exactly what to do and when someone needs help. Originally posted by RedFrogFirefighter:How long did you serve on the callout crew if at all? Took me 8 years...all of them paid (except emergency medical treatment). They had problems with getting enough men for calls due to budgeting issues lack of manpower and we ended up having to reach out to other counties who didn't have their own ALS apparatus and pay for us to use theirs since ours was not available. We also helped each other out whenever possible during emergencies; however, those calls were rare compared to our normal duty days. As far as paying attention to new rules goes...at first we got fined every time something went wrong after being drilled a million times on things like "what is this thing called" then "where should we put it there," etc,. However, over the past few years, we started seeing better equipment requested changes made in procedures. Now, not only do we get off scott free most of the time when dealing wth the public, but it seems almost impossible to get busted anymore either! Man, now that I'm retired, I am realizing how bad of shape I must be mentally! My last job lasted 32 years - 22 active, 10 reserve - 20 working 9am till 4pm M-F with overtime per year job wise. The rest was admin stuff of course. Anyway, I usually work 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Most guys work 3x 24hr shifts plus 2 nights a month rotating back to back. So in reality, it comes down to 29 hrs x 7days 247hrs a month. Oh yeah, don't forget minutes on the radio and cell phone usage and total driving miles. If you add everything together, you're looking at 450 hours dedicated to taking care of these city idiots. And even though I live close by, I'd say 50 of calls involve travel away from home. So letis face facts here folks, unless you wanna make 14 an hr minimum wage, and still come home tired at night....you'll never see retirement. Good luck ladies and gents. It ainit easy living like the rich.....but you gotta try harder. Cheers mofos.

Or does this actually happen all too often for some reason? This happens all too often especially in rural areas. Some locales may want nothing to do with law enforcement yet will gladly send out local residents to handle internal affairs such as school resource officers. A lot has changed in recent years with smoke detectors going wireless. When 911 calls start coming in, the local dispatcher assigns the closest NSIPR unit based upon proximity to the incident rather than availability of personnel ie. staffing ratio. In addition, dispatch units all over the country are using hand held communication devices that allow dispatchers to assign resources directly while enroute to incidents without waiting for traditional telephone routing systems to connect them. This means quicker response times which helps control situations in progress rather than starting operations from scratch. All said and done, it's amazing the average person responds appropriately in situations they might otherwise treat casually. Sadly, it sometimes takes a tragedy like today's to remind everyone to be responsible citizens. 45 years ago when I became a Emergency Medical Technician education consisted of 1 hour classes twice a month with the expectation that you would become part of a county EMS system within 18 months. After graduation the EMT program required another 5 months of classroom instruction followed by 30 weeks clinical internship which included patient transport. Today the class sizes are larger, state funds support salary increases, base salaries are higher and physical examination requirements are more comprehensive requiring two physician certifications including CPR for example. While no longer mandated, certification renewal also requires successful completion of continuing educational courses after eight continuous years of employment. Today's graduates enter the workforce immediately following BLS skills test passing instead of spending 15-18 months learning how to perform basic life support. Additionally schools are encouraging both students and teachers to pledge to promote to promote giving psychology) that can take), in order) is (Starting
