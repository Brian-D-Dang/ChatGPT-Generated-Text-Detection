I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience, I know that if we used these "weapons" on ourselves or our allies we would be greeted with relief and gratitude from around the world as a brave warrior had taken up arms agains asshats who were threatening their way into freedom! If your government has not declared war upon you then it's time to start thinking about how good things are going because another one might happen at any moment without notice...let alone warning!! On my recent trip south through Canada and the US border crossing agents asked me where I was coming from and what I was doing here? They also checked all my luggage thoroughly multiple times so they could assure there wasn't some sort of secret nuclear device inside?? Wasn't afraid at all even though every other person walking across said hello goodbye; In fact after being questioned by two different people both friendly and polite, I felt safe and secure enough to head over to Starbucks and get a latte while waiting to see my family before flying home later today!!! This country really is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
