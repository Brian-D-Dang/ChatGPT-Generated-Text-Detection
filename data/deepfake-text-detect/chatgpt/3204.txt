You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the opportunity to explain why. While apples and oranges are indeed different fruits, there are still many valid ways to compare them. For example: - Nutritional value: both apples and oranges are high in vitamin C and fiber, but apples also contain more vitamin A and potassium. - Flavor profile: apples tend to be more tart or sweet, while oranges are sweeter, with a hint of bitterness. - Uses: apples are often used in baking or as a snack, while oranges are commonly consumed as juice or eaten as a snack. Therefore, while comparing apples and oranges may not always be useful, it is certainly not silly or impossible to do so in a meaningful way.
