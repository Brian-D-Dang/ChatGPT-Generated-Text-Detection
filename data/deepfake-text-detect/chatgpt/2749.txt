Hi, I'm new. So the greeks are complaining about the EU's imposed austerity measures, the terms of their countries increasing debt problems, even going as far as to boycott german goods which is a big no-no in that country? I know Germany has established very strict rules for its citizenry and companies (and rightfully so). Is this really what they're doing now with Greece or does it sound like hyperbole on my part? If not could someone please tell me where i can find further information regarding this if it were true? It sounds like the German people would be better served by looking inward at internal issues than worrying over an entire other nation.
