With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned at its best, the core of Reddit was composed of people from different religions and ethnicities. This meant there were discussions about things like religion (e.g., Popehat) and politics in which both sides would be represented and people could express their own views without fear of offending someone else. This also means that many large subreddits have been dominated by white men who are comfortable expressing racist opinions while avoiding any kind of genuine discussion or debate - something that has gotten much worse as time goes on. The increasing segregation of the site into communities where only those who share certain viewpoints can speak freely shows how far we've come in just 10 years. While some groups may not want to admit it publicly, they know that if more than 50 percent of the subscribers for a given subreddit are non-white then the conversation will change fairly soon, regardless of what anyone says online and offline. But rather than accept these facts and make amends to grow up and become an adult, people just keep trying to shut down conversations on the internet instead. Despite my distaste for the current racial climate on Reddit, I do respect many moderators out there. They work hard every day to provide positive experiences for everyone involved. Some even put themselves through depression because they feel that they must ride herd over such a cesspool of toxicity. It's clear that there needs to be changes made, but until everything gets ironed out there is no way to fix it other than doing away with anonymity altogether so mods don't get targeted simply because someone disagrees with them politically or socially. That would mean spamming us individuals wouldn't matter anymore since we couldn't hide behind our handlepassword combinations. But here comes the biggest problem: If you take away anonymous commenting the users who created that content won't continue posting it. We'll lose a lot of traditional comments like "I agree with xyz!" and "What does yaz say?" Given the fact that most people now rely on social networks exclusively via mobile devices, adding real names to posts makes sense to me. After all, why should it be okay to post really nasty stuff anonymously when we can see right away who said what and who reacted negatively to your comments? Even though I dislike this idea, imagining the hordes of nameless commenters carrying around pitchforks and torches is probably enough to scare off most sane adults - especially if combined with the prevalence of body shaming among today's youth. However, leaving alone the numbers game, this would force major revisions onto the internal logic of whatReddit is supposed to represent. Because after all, one the primary reasons people subscribe is to enjoy engaging in civilized discourse regarding anything under the sun. And honestly, who wants to read hundreds and thousands of duplicate messages on Twitter about the latest outrage du jour? In general, fewer pieces of information better experience. So ultimately, I prefer anonymity myself. As long as nobody knows my identity, I can comment however I please and still not worry about getting flamed either. Being forced to reveal my true self in order to participate feels too constricting; it takes away the freedom and creativity necessary for good debate and good memes to rise and multiply. But maybe I'm wrong, and making sure everybody remains completely safe is actually the priority here. Or perhaps you can explain to me exactly what Reddit is supposed to look like. Is it acceptable to have very specific topics restricted almost entirely to members belonging to a single race, ethnicity, culture or gender? Are bans against various kinds of speech deemed OK if done by explicitly stating "this group represents X category"? How about keywords and terms banned only within specific subsets? Sure, the answer might vary depending upon the sub itself, but the point is that we shouldn't pretend as if having a common hobby doesn't lead folks to bond together based largely upon perceived similarities among each other. Questions like these need answers. If nothing else, people deserve accurate guidance before assuming whatever they want to assume. Until then, I guess I'm just waiting for Mr. Pao to shed light on his next move...
