You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the people who say this to read your post so they can see how stupid of an argument that actually is. It depends on if you believe one thing directly causes another or not. If you do then yes, there are differences between apples and oranges (aside from being fruits). But we should have no problem agreeing that "toast" made with sliced orange peel tastes better than toast made without because both cause us enjoyment.
