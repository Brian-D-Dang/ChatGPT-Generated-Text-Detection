The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. I agree that in some rare cases, physical appearance may be affected by factors outside of a person's control, such as disfigurement or extreme facial asymmetry. However, it is important to remember that everyone is unique and beautiful in their own way, regardless of their physical appearance. It is also important to promote acceptance and kindness towards others, regardless of their physical appearance.
