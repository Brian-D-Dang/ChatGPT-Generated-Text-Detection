I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot someone who was trying to help another person? No one really understands what society has gone through, especially when they are committing crimes against others in a very dark and dangerous situation." One of the suicide threats made by police officers is an incident where officers shot dead a man at a house party in November 2016 after being called to assist a resident with his child while he attempted to leave a family member's home for questioning due to an apparent drug overdose. Police say the threats were made on Twitter because police wouldn't let him leave. The man was killed instantly during an investigation into suspicious activity that caught their attention.Police said the neighborhood watchdog agency had received multiple messages from individuals claiming that the man threatened them as well as some potentially suicidal calls linked to the shooter. During the investigation, officers found no evidence proving these calls originated overseas but police arrested two people shortly afterward.Police believe the suspect was upset over an ongoing dispute between the homeowner and the homeowner's wife whom officers discovered lying unconscious inside her home. Police also found drugs seized near the scene along with several pills that may be related to the murders.police say all three deaths occurred last month following reports of gunfire across the country following protests over racial justice riots which erupted nationwide again this summer amid anger after George Floyd's death.
