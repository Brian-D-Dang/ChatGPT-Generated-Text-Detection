There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: It must be noted that I am not an expert on movies by any means but I have seen Jurassic Park and Jurassic World so I feel like I'm somewhat familiar with the concept I can't say anything about Jurassic world because I haven't watched it yet (yet) but I will say this scene is pretty messed up because it wasn't even tame compared to the others
