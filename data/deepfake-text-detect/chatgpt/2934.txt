Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: uwilddumbbell, for being a pleasant person in general, and especially for helping turn it into something positive; and uCosmoteKiller, because they raised an important point that really should have been addressed by myself or another mod before posting this thread. Haha I like your comment about me winning 2 delta's..
