First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that they have been detrimental in the long term for both victims and criminals alike. I also strongly support limiting immigration from countries with a history of violent crime. In particular, I think we should focus on reducing the number of illegal immigrants coming into our country. Although this may seem like more of an extreme solution than the one suggested by most people who want to solve this problem, its just as much about limiting the amount of people being brought here illegally, which is something that has been happening quite frequently lately. What happened to the days where you could come over legally? Especially when you started getting rich off of drugs. Why can't its still legal to be poor or new here if your willing to put your life on hold and work hard? We need to make America great again. Not again "just" us but everyone else too.
