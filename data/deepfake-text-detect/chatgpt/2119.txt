1. Squatting is more comfortable, easier and healthier than sitting. it creates less stress on the the puborectalis muscle allowing for a smoother uninterrupted experience. it plays well with gravity which helps to push any remaining contents out of your anus once you're done pooping. 2. Sitting makes everything worse: No matter how much lube or baby wipes i use they don't work as good when im sitting down cause my butt cheeks stick together even if I put toilet paper under them before hand so that's why squatting feels better then sitting
