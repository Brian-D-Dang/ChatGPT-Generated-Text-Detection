I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that rapists are criminals. But when it comes to protecting women from men who commit violent crimes against them, I have never seen a single one do so strongly either way. The problem is not just the violence against women but also sexual assault cases involving minors too. Rape accusations can be associated with minor girls or young children where younger boys marry underage girls over age 16 years old, which leads to the carelessness of those involved even though they may have no knowledge or desire for such actions. The biggest cause of these incidents is evident on social media platforms like Twitter trolls and online chat rooms where accused individuals harass other users claiming to be tough judgeships rather than simply admit their mistake if being wronged by someone else's decision making process allows them access to support systems as well as money. Some say the rape culture makes things worse because small children seem incapable of comprehending what happens between consenting adults while others point out how much easier this will make life difficult for teenage girls due to trust issues leading to abuse more readily perpetrated through shaming. These are understandable arguments cite older victims becoming disillusioned since teenagers feel less comfortable crossing boundaries without adults around to forgive themselves or help understand themselves better before committing suicide. All parties would benefit greatly if everyone was encouraged to look after the young themselves instead of imposing punishments upon them alone. A lot depends on forgiveness and self-awareness regarding problematic situations despite the taboo surrounding juvenile offenders who should know that consequences aren't always free of cost especially given their victimization status (see my previous posts). I believe that advocate against rape first thing every morning across most homes throughout my own five city blocks regardless of circumstances; however I cannot stress enough that violence against children needs to stop within reason. Sadly teens need stability!
