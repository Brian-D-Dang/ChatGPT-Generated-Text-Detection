I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. The beans taste bitter and burnt, even if they are ground fresh each morning or brewed in a fancy French press with soy milk... which is exactly what we were drinking when he noticed that it tasted particularly bad. "Is this how you want your coffee?" He asked as his gaze fell on mine over our breakfast table. "No." His eyes narrowed slightly at first then widened again. Shocked by his reaction, so much so that my cheeks turned crimson red from embarrassment despite him having no idea who I was nor did I have any relationship towards him whatsoever; I quickly tried to cover up before shaking off whatever weird feeling had taken hold within me: "It's not too late! You can still come back!" Now neither one of us knew why he stood there looking into space rubbing her wrists as though she'd been tied down to an electric chair for weeks on end - other than perhaps because he could sense something fishy going on between the two of us? A few moments passed until both felt comfortable enough to take their seats after exchanging glances filled with suspicion, however brief those may be. As soon as the bell rang signaling the arrival of the class next door, he got up ready to leave muttering under his breath about being blackmailed.Even now, years later, whenever someone mentions coffee around me, I recall every detail regardless whether its earlier today with some close friend or just yesterday while watching home movies during high school vacation. It's quite embarrassing actually but nevertheless true maybe someday others will learn to appreciate good coffee once more instead of falling victims' siren song as well.... In the meantime let them wallow away without realizing how marvelous real espresso really tastes..
