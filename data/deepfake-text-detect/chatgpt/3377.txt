I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. The Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit attracted controversy and was a high-profile case due to the severity of the plaintiff's injuries and the large amount of damages awarded. Stella Liebeck, the plaintiff, initially sought only 20,000 for medical expenses and lost income after she suffered third-degree burns from spilling McDonald's coffee on her lap. However, McDonald's refused to settle and the case went to trial. During the trial, the plaintiff's lawyers argued that McDonald's served coffee at a temperature that was significantly higher than industry standards, which resulted in the coffee causing severe burns in the event of a spill. The plaintiff's lawyers also presented evidence that McDonald's had received numerous complaints about the temperature of their coffee in the past and that McDonald's could have easily prevented such injuries by simply lowering the temperature of the coffee. Ultimately, the jury agreed with the plaintiff's argument and found McDonald's to be 80 responsible for the incident, with Liebeck found to be 20 at fault. The jury awarded her 2.7 million in damages, although later the amount was reduced to 640,000. So while it may seem at first glance that the incident was solely Liebeck's fault, there were several factors that contributed to her injuries, including the excessively high temperature of the coffee served by McDonald's.
