This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special treatment in the criminal justice system due to the fact that they are not yet fully developed and lack the experience and knowledge of adults. However, the specific treatment given to juveniles can vary depending on the state or country. In some cases, juveniles may receive lighter sentencing or rehabilitation rather than punishment due to their age and lack of experience. On the other hand, some people may argue that juveniles should be held to the same standards as adults and face the same consequences for their actions. Ultimately, the decision on how to treat juveniles in the criminal justice system is up to lawmakers and society as a whole to decide what is just and fair for all parties involved.
