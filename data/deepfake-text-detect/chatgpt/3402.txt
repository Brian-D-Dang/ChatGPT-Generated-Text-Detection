I believe that "Buckle up, it's the law" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority] which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they do not respect or trust the perceived authority. A more effective slogan might be one that appeals to the personal benefit of buckling up, such as "Buckle up for your safety" or "Buckle up to protect yourself and your loved ones." These messages directly relate to the individual and their well-being, and may be more persuasive in encouraging them to buckle up.
