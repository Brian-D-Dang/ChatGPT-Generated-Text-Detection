While the freedom of choice is a fundamental right in a free market economy, businesses operate within a social and legal structure that requires them to abide by anti-discrimination laws. Discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion and sexual orientation is not only offensive and unethical, but it also violates civil rights laws that protect against discrimination. If businesses were allowed to refuse service on such grounds, it would lead to a society where certain groups of people are marginalized and would be unable to access goods and services that are essential to their daily lives. Therefore, while businesses have the right to choose which services or products they offer, when they do offer such services, they must do so in a non-discriminatory manner.
