Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to 15hour. While many would argue that raising the minimum wage to 15 per hour is necessary to provide workers with a living wage, others argue that it could hurt small businesses and lead to job loss, as employers may not be able to afford the increased wages. There are also concerns that a sudden increase in minimum wage could lead to inflation, as businesses may raise their prices to compensate for the higher cost of labor. Overall, there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate, and any decision on whether to raise the minimum wage should consider the unique economic and social factors of each region or municipality. It may be worth exploring alternative approaches, such as providing tax credits or other incentives for businesses that pay their employees a living wage, as well as investing in education and job training programs to help workers increase their earning potential.
