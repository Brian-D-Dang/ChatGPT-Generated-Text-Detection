I recently discovered rAnglish. Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots. The result is a language that not only sounds different from native english, but also looks significantly different as well: For example, here are the words for "toothbrush," which in anglo saxon would be'spurks'. In anglish they take on more german influence (ie spurs): The wikipedia page has some excellent examples!
