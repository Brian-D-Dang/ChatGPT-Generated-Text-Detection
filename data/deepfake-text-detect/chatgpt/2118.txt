[This article] does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article] that lays out why they are flawed, but to me it misses some important points in its critique: 1. All of these studies have been done BEFORE 8910. It's obvious from any reading of them (or even just looking at how much more attention is paid on this issue now) that many people who were aware or unconcerned before aren't anymore since then and there has probably never been as much discussion about online privacy than right now. 2. Those same publications show an increase in Americans' concern with personal privacy over time which tracks perfectly with the amount we've become aware of other issues like our government surveillance programs - so if you believe 1 above where consumers would react strongly against tracking by companies after seeing what happens when their information gets into public hands, doesn't it make sense that increased awareness about known state intrusions will lead to similar reactions? 3. The second study uses different survey questions than the first one yet both results yield very similar numbers 4. This last point really made me scratch my head though because not only do all three surveys use identical wording, they also say essentially exactly the opposite things! 5. These are all US-based stats too... no reason to think Europeans don't care either 6. A lot of sites already ask users whether various features should be disabled based on location 7- Most internet service providers track your traffic anyway
