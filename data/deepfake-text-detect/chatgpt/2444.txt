There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man wearing boxer shorts under his work shirt?). I don't think you've ever worn compression pants before or if you have they are just really tight ones that fit perfectly for sports purposes... Those tights aren't anything like what boxershorts would look like when being wear outside..
