I believe that "Buckle up, it's the law" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority] which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they want. So it depends on how we say it and what our goal is. If my goal was making sure everyone got their seatbelt buckled (the best way I see of doing this), then yes - saying buckle up would work. But when my goal is for DPH to get more drivers pulling over for speeding or drunk driving? They're going to remember me yelling at them with a big sign instead of telling them "Buckle up."
