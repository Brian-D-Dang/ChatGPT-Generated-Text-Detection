I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning. It seems to me that we have developed an idea of what is likely to be true in the future, but I could see that it may not yet be so. This was my response to your question. If you think about it, how do you know if the modern theory of gender isn't absolutely correct? It's interesting as well for people who can't even read or understand something they've never heard before. This thing "reports" itself on the internet without going through any research. Everything else that has ever been reported in the mainstream press though has been nothing more than a fantasy.
