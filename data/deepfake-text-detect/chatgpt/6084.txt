It is pretty well known that the colombine shooters believed in natural selection, a key point of evolution. Just from their [wiki] they talk about natural selection in their journals, and the belief was shared by most of the other shooters. So, there's a huge overlap between the two groups, and we can take an average of all the traits of both groups, to see what we can learn. From the 'church' group we find that they were the most intelligent, most likely to have their parents divorce, have the highest average IQ, and had a higher rate of autism. It is also pretty well known that autism and intelligence are correlated, and divorce is a cause of depression, which can lead to violence. From the shooters, we find the opposite. They had the least intelligence, the least likely to have their parents divorce, the lowest IQ, and the lowest rate of autism. It is also well known that intelligence is a cause of autism, and divorce leads to depression. So, it seems like you get a little of both groups. While the shooters were less intelligent and less likely to have their parents divorce, they were more likely to be autistic and more likely to be depressed. But if we take all the traits, and average them out, then there is no correlation, and there is no common ground between the two groups. The columbine shooters had an average IQ of 122, while the church shooters had an average IQ of 96. The columbine shooters had an average rate of divorce of 37, while the church shooters had an average rate of divorce of 31. The columbine shooters had an average rate of autism of 7, while the church shooters had an average rate of autism of 37. The columbine shooters had an average rate of depression of 59, while the church shooters had an average rate of depression of 66. The columbine shooters had an average intelligence of 122, while the church shooters had an average intelligence of 96. So, their traits seem to be very opposite, and there is no common ground between the two groups. The common ground is that they both believe in natural selection. However, their belief in natural selection would not be a significant factor in their beliefs, and it would be unlikely to have been a causal factor, since the shooters were the least intelligent of both groups. So, why were they so violent? That would suggest the shooters would have been less violent if they had believed in natural selection, but that is unlikely, because they were the least intelligent of both groups. There is no common ground between the two groups, and their belief in natural selection was not a significant factor, and they were the least intelligent of both groups. So, what could be the cause of their violence? From a philosophical point of view, it seems like it is a failure to recognize that people are valuable, and that is not a failure of faith. So, their religion doesn't seem like a cause of their violence. It is also possible that it is a failure to realize that autism and depression are both negative traits, and both of these traits are a cause of violence. So, their lack of autism and depression might not be a cause of their violence. And it is also possible that it is a failure to realize that intelligence is a cause of autism and depression, and that their lack of intelligence is a cause of their violence. So, it is possible that their lack of intelligence is a cause of their violence. It is also possible that it is a failure to realize that an evolutionary worldview does not lead to violence. But it is also possible that their religion might be a cause of their violence. A less likely cause is that they were discontent with their lives, and a less likely cause is that they were in poverty. So, the evidence is unclear, but it seems like a lack of intelligence is the most likely cause of their violence. You can't say that the lack of intelligence is a cause of their violence unless you say that autism and depression are not a cause of their violence, but the opposite is also true. So, you have to choose between two equally valid interpretations. That's a good point about autism and depression. I was not considering that. I think that the most important thing is that people believe in natural selection. It is true that natural selection is what keeps the species going, but it is not what makes people have a purpose in life. There is an
