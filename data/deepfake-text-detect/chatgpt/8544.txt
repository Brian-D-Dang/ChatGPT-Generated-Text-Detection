I've lived practically my whole life on this phrase. It has shaped how I have made several important decisions in my life, though I have recently come to suspect that it is a slightly simpler, less prescriptive and less ambiguous version of the same sentence: "A man who loves woman." What is an icon? A voice? How many people can say they're a woman? What does an icon mean? What about some women who are just as important to us? Is there any way you could think of explaining so much about what's possible if we were to say, for example, 'that when I was young, my mother was a woman?' or 'that when I was married she had a child. The meaning becomes clearer by the time we learn of each person's story, but we don't know why, because sometimes those stories aren't even clearly documented. And yet, when we do discover someone who has been around long enough to realize their own kind, our sense of identity takes precedence over what might be perceived as a single aspect of themselves. For instance, she may not identify with anyone else. But someone who lived in her childhood, perhaps because she didn't want to die someday, might identify differently from someone whose real nature is shared with others. She may not experience the occasional discomfort with sex outside of marriage (though she may find sexual intimacy more difficult than other couples). Even if she's on a date, she hasn't found love yet, either. Or perhaps sex plays a significant role in her romantic feelings for him. However, she doesn't seem to recognize his or her own personal capacity to appreciate himherself for whom he or she chooses. Instead, she sees himher as one objectification, a safe space where he or she feels secure. This feels like a very strong connection - and one which often leads to stronger relations between them and their partner. And that's precisely what we need to understand. When we talk about myths about women, we tend to assume that men are too afraid to tell another woman about what they've done to her. So the myth holds water. It might be true that men haven't told their wives about everything they've done to them; maybe they wouldn't have likely found someone reliable who trusted them financially. Or maybe they'd simply ignored the message altogether. In these situations, we should acknowledge that no matter what happens, as long as we keep telling ourselves that there are going to be things that matter, the institutions of power will never change.
