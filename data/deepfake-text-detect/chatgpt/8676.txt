It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be collected and cared for in kind. That said... the loss of life at some zoos on a daily basis has been alarming to me. My husband's bipolar disorder got worse when he left his job as a sales associate because of it though. So we're not talking about dying like this here. We are talking about the animal cruelty that happens all around us. That makes sense.
