Being transgender and wanting surgeryhormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think overconfidence about having anterior pelvic surgery may be causing issues for some people who are not ready yet ready to get reconstructive breast reconstruction. The best way to know if someone else wants surgery would tell them your gender identity concerns and then ask them how they want surgeries.
