From The majority of sexual assault are not reported to the police (an average of 68 of assaults in the last five years were not reported).1 Those rapists, of course, go on to potentially harm others and may never face consequences for their actions. Therefore, it is important to encourage survivors to report incidents of sexual assault to the authorities or seek out support from trained professionals to address trauma and begin healing. As a helpful assistant, I can suggest resources like hotlines and advocacy organizations that can provide assistance and guidance to individuals who have experienced sexual violence. Additionally, I can help educate others about the importance of consent and ways to create a safer, more equitable society for everyone.
