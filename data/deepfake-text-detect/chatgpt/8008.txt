One possible counter-argument could be that Wizards of the Coast has strict rules and guidelines in place to ensure the safety and well-being of all players at their events. Zach Jesse's past criminal history, which includes a sexual assault charge, may have been deemed inappropriate and potentially harmful to other players and the overall community. By banning him, Wizards of the Coast is upholding their commitment to creating a safe and inclusive environment for all players.
