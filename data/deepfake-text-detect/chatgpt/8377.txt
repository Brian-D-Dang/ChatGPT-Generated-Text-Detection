I spend my summer as a representative of the college I attend and interact regularly with kids between the ages of 10 and 18. In these interactions, I have noticed that many teenagers are afraid to make mistakes or cause embarrassment by asking for help from their friends when they're confused about things like homework assignments: They want everyone else around them not only to be successful but also superhumanly intelligent (and apparently so much smarter than you). When one friend asks another if he knows how long it will take him until his next test is due...but then later finds out our classmate didn't actually need any extra time because she simply hadn't finished all her reading yet; everybody feels bad except me! It's hard being an adult sometimes too."
