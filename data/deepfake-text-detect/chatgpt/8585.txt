Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself out if I really wanted to, but most people would likely prefer stock-based pay and instead go with higher productivity. I think there are more than enough reasons to not vote without paying taxes. If you live in the country where they have a 2 tax on income above 250K your chances of voting down are slim to none.
