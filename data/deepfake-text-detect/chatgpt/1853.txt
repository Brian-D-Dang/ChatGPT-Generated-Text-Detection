I recently discovered rAnglish. Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots. The result is a language that not only sounds like it was created by aliens, but reads the same way too! The first volume has two parts: part one consists entirely of essays about different aspects of American culture - including food (lots of recipes), movies (obviously) and politics; part two includes texts on art history, poetry and music in which they've removed all references to the words "American" or "English," substituting instead "the West Indies" or some such for those terms.[1] There are also articles from William S. Burroughs III who describes his own experiences with drugs and alcohol as well as literature criticism written exclusively in English using Anglish grammar rules. I had never heard of any of these authors before this book and so have no real opinion about their works, although I suspect I will enjoy reading them at least once more than I did my usual fare (more boring stuff). However what really caught me up were the reviews from the editors themselves. They seem to be quite knowledgeable about books - a handy skill if you want to review your book yourself online. But there seems something else going on here besides just being well informed critics...they appear to actually know how to use the Internet, even though none of us do yet. It must be hard enough making sense out of our own language, let alone another alien tongue trying to communicate with us through computers - it certainly makes it harder when you don't speak either language fluently.[2]
