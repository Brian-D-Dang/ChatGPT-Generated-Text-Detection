Respectfully, I must disagree with your opinion that Binge Eating Disorder is solely a lack of self-discipline. Binge Eating Disorder is actually recognized as a mental health disorder by the American Psychiatric Association and is defined as a severe and recurrent episode of overeating, accompanied by feelings of loss of control and distress. It can have serious physical and psychological consequences, including weight gain, depression, anxiety, and even heart disease. It is important to note that individuals with Binge Eating Disorder are not simply indulging in occasional overeating or overeating as a result of a lack of self-discipline. Rather, the disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of binge eating that is often associated with underlying psychological conditions, such as depression and anxiety. Eighty percent of individuals with Binge Eating Disorder have a history of depression, anxiety or substance use, making it critical that we understand the biological components involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this condition. Therefore, it is essential that Binge Eating Disorder is recognized as a serious mental health disorder that requires professional help and support, rather than just a lack of self-discipline.
