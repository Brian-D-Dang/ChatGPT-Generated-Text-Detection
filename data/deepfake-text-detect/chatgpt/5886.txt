I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry liberals believe them to be. I'm a liberal but I'm also against gay marriage because in my personal opinion, I think it's unnatural. I'm a republican, but I think gay marriage should be legal. I also believe that the death penalty should be abolished. I'm a liberal but I'm also against abortion.
