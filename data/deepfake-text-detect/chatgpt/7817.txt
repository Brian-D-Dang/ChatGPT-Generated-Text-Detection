While it is understandable that one may assume that the value of a degree would decrease if college education was free, this is not necessarily true. Firstly, the true value of a degree lies in the skills and knowledge acquired during one's college education, rather than the amount of money paid for it. In fact, many students and graduates value their education regardless of how much they paid for it. Additionally, free college education could actually increase the value of a degree. With more individuals pursuing higher education, the job market may become more competitive, leading to an increasing demand for individuals with degrees. This could result in higher wages and better job opportunities for college graduates. Furthermore, other factors such as the quality of education and the reputation of the college also play a significant role in determining the value of a degree. Free college education does not necessarily mean lower quality education, and reputable colleges and universities would still have high value degrees regardless of the cost. In summary, while the concern about the value of a degree decreasing due to free college education is understandable, it is not necessarily accurate. A degree's value is determined by a range of factors beyond just the cost of the education, such as the knowledge and skills acquired, the competitiveness of the job market, and the quality and reputation of the college or university.
