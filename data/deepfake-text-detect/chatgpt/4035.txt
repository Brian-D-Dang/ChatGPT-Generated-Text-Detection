I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking up a man's last name. But on the other hand, if you're trying to pass off as a guy, and someone calls you by your real first name (instead of the imagined last name), it may seem like that person is saying "Hey! We know who you really are!" No. It avoids confusion between persons whose given birth happens in different countries or languages.
