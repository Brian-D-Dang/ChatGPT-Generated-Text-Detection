So, one thing that I have to preface this with is that I see both (all) sexes as equal, outside of a few natural sexual dimorphisms (Genitalia, ability to have children and such). But beyond that... If you are going to be an atheist in the West then it's probably best not to start arguing about Creationism at all. In fact, there shouldn't really even be any mention or debate on religion because some people will simply bring up their beliefs, which has no place being discussed here since it doesn't have anything to do with atheism. And anyway, if someone gets upset by your views based on their religious perspective, just ignore them and move on to other points. Anyways, what follows is my first attempt at tackling a topic I haven't been involved with before: Christianity vs Science. The reason for doing so was that I am starting to get tired of reading articlescomments where Christians pick apart evolution, cosmology, etc., while overlooking everything else that they're missing out on by only focusing on these areas. So many things can be explained through science without having to resort to "god did x" but instead looking at how things actually work in nature rather than explain away why something might appear to work that way. But I'll save the discussion about those types of topics until later; I'm more interested into discussing Christian apologetics- the idea behind defending Christianity from criticism coming from within itself (and from non-Christians), like the ones who try to disprove God's existence despite not knowing much about him whatsoever. This includes arguments against Evolution, Cosmological Arguments, Geocentrism, Intelligent Design, Anti-Vaxxers, whatnots, pseudoscience, insanity, nutjobs, fundamentalists, apologetic writing, philosophy, theology, comparative religions, etc. It also includes philosophical debates regarding free will, morality, ethics, etc. You name it! All these things will be addressed when we talk about Christianity. However, let us begin with a quick overview of each side's positions, before delving deeper into various arguments over specific subjects. Christian ApologeticsThe purpose of this article is purely defensive in nature - to defend the belief system called 'christianity' (yes, I know most atheists hate using words like 'theist. Its primary goal is to prove to skeptics that Christianity isn't false, nor does it deserve respect. Many organizations exist specifically to argue Christians case, including Answers in Genesis, Skeptic Ink, American Atheists, LifeSite News, Reasonable Faith, etc. Since there are literally thousands of different opinions surrounding christian teachings and stances, I couldn't possibly cover every single position known to man. Instead, I'm going to focus mainly on three examples: Intelligent Design Theory and its defenders (IDT), Young Earth Creationism and its supporters (YECS), and Refuting Fundamentalist Claims About Medical Issues (RFMMI) and its defenders. As far as IDT goes, its main argument revolves around two concepts: 1.) Complex life could never emerge spontaneously via random chance alone, thus requiring intelligent intervention2.) There exists evidence supporting aspects of creation stories found throughout history.More specifically, according to David Klinghoffer, IDT centers on the following four premises (depending on whether he uses either Darwin's theory of Natural Selection or his own):1) Biological systems exhibit certain features that require design2) These features cannot be reasonably attributed to common descent3) Therefore, biological systems must be designed4) There is insufficient time between species emergence to account for evolutionary processes which would result in speciation To further understand how he feels about IDT, read the short video below (it comes directly after the meat of the rest of the post). Also, note that neither myself nor anyone associated with this website are advocating people believe in IDT. We simply want people to recognize that if you accept 1, 2 4 as true then (according to IDT proponents) 3 becomes self evident since everything automatically requires creation. Furthermore, regardless of personal views of Evolutionary biology, if you don't agree with 1, 2, or 4 then you essentially have nothing against ID theorists; however, if you do disagree you'd better come prepared. Having said that, it should be noted that ID isn't exactly new. For example, anti-evolutionists argued similar ideas back in telling people that complex organisms evolved gradually by random mutation from simpler versions.[2] Some say that there are still kooks who believe in ID today. Others claim this is merely a ploy utilized by the elite to distract regular citizens from taking notice of financial corruption and misappropriation of funds. But whatever you may think of it, it seems clear that ID proponents use the same tactics as their predecessors, namely, appealing to emotion, fear and ignorance to gain sympathy. One thing to keep in mind though, is that ID theories seem reasonable in terms of physics and chemistry but completely invalidates Biology and Medicine.
