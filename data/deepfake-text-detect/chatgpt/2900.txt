Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as you know, the CIA has been infiltrating all corners of society for many decades now under various guises. The result is a US-aligned world - one that contains an increasing number of people who support foreign interventionism and are willing to put their lives on the line in order to spread democracy into previously tyrannical nations. This aligns them firmly against RussiaChina and so those powers are attempting to manipulate these same types of individuals by pushing anti-immigration and isolationist policies. A situation not dissimilar from what happened before WWI when Britian was isolated while Germany pushed forward its military might unchecked; oddly enough some historians claim Britain's "decay" began then too, but others disagree. What do you think? The idea that this sort of thing should be allowed to continue until we become complacent about our own sovereignty is foolish at best and dangerous at worst.
