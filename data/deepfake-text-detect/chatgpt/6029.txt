Bernie Sanders offers a categorically different approach than others, making him such a direct threat to the status quo that there is no way corporate America will allow him to win. The only way a candidate who is not part of the status quo will ever get anywhere near the White House is by being prepared to accept an "alternative" debate format where there is a complete absence of any corporate media "journalists" whatsoever. If there is no corporate media "journalist" present, the candidate doesn't have to play their game, so Bernie's campaign should immediately accept such a challenge. Of course, there is no way the corporate media would ever agree to this, but if he does it then the "journalists" will have to be replaced with citizen journalists, who will ask the "journalists" why they are not covering the election themselves. This will also allow Bernie to show the world exactly how the corporate media works, with the "journalists" all being allowed to read from scripts written by their corporate masters and then asking one pre-scripted question after another. It's time for Bernie to get a bit rebellious, and challenge the corporate media, rather than continue to play their game. Of course, the corporate media will never agree to this, but it's time for him to try and make the case for why they should change their approach. The whole system is rigged, and so they should all be disqualified from being "journalists" and replaced with citizen journalists who have no connection to corporate interests.
