Though my personal political views match those of Bernie Sanders much more than Hillary Clinton, I believe nominating Bernie could ultimately be very damaging for the progressive cause. My main concern is that he will give him an eulogy instead of a speech on his own platform. Bernie's speeches are to be found in many different ways: from his rants about socialism and gender inequality during the Civil Rights Movement to his claim that Medicare for All would make our health care system "better." His rhetoric has been controversial both on social media and at home, but it does not seem like Sanders' message would sway anyone except wealthy progressives who have already taken to voting for him. Instead he'll bring out the same campaign mantra as usual: And we all know how good Sanders can be!
