I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; have supported affirmative action programs to help disadvantaged minorities get ahead; am in favor of government-provided health care and education from pre-K through college or graduate school; want an end to poverty by implementing progressive taxation policies that tax income rather than wealth; believe in climate change caused primarily by human activity; support abortion rights and certain gun control measures to reduce violence against women; and strongly oppose capital punishment as cruel and unusual punishment of individuals who may be innocent victims themselves. None of these ideas are widely shared among Republicans: according to Pew Research Center statistics, 70 of Republican voters think there is too much focus on racial disparity in this country and 65 disapprove of same sex marriage. In contrast, only 37 agree with me that we should provide universal healthcare while 55 disagree. Just 27 agree gays and lesbians should enjoy full civil equality without discrimination while 50 say they shouldn't. And just 25 say global warming poses a serious threat compared to 79. Republicans' views on all of these issues reflect their level of economic anxiety - high levels of dissatisfaction with economic conditions that existed before Trump took office but haven't improved since he assumed power. Some politicians are better at appealing to those anxieties than others, which explains why Democrats gained 30 seats in last year's midterm elections despite having no coherent message beyond opposition to Trump. But Republicans can't seem to find any useful way to articulate how their party would address them if given total control over the federal government. So far it doesn't look like they know what they don't know about economics, so instead they rely on fear mongering and appeals to white identity politics. That strategy won't work forever because not everyone responds to racism and xenophobia equally. Eventually people will see right through it - eventually. Right now however, it appears as though Donald Trump has found his best outlet yet.
