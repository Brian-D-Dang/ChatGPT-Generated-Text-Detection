Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, do you put a good idea into practice? What is your ability to evaluate the product concept and implement it successfully in the future? It seems like you don't have much time for myself! Thank you so much!
