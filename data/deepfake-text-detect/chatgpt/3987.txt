I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural thing. Yeah, my dad always says when he's eating chinese or other asian foods (and also i'm sure he eats them with his hands) it feels like you're taking away some of their culture by using chop sticks
