While it's important to respect individual identity and self-determination, it's also important to acknowledge and understand the social and historical implications of racial identity. To claim a racial identity when it doesn't align with one's actual ancestry or lived experiences can be seen as problematic because it ignores the systemic oppression and discrimination faced by Black individuals. It can also trivialize the experiences and struggles of those who face prejudice and hardship as a result of their actual racial identity.
