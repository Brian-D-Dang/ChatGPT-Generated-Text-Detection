Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, wouldn't I do the same when trying to learn more about myself? I've spent years trying to figure out my personality, my core values, my triggers, and my strengths. It's been frustrating, to be honest. I've done a lot of personality tests and read many books and blogs on the subject. And while all that info helped me, it didn't give me that ah-ha moment where everything clicked. So I decided to look to someone who I felt embodied the very characteristics I was looking to understand more about. I knew I was looking for someone who could be described as thoughtful, mindful, and introspective. I wanted someone who valued the written word and didn't mind thinking critically about things. I wanted someone who put a lot of energy into developing themselves and was always looking to better themselves. And finally, I wanted someone who was sensitive, curious, and always had a creative streak. That's when I decided to look at what books Kareena Kapoor Khan had on her bookshelf. Kareena Kapoor Khan is a famous Bollywood actor and I've always loved her style and the way she conducts herself in public. She's beautiful, talented, and successful. She's also outspoken and candid, with a great sense of humour. Kareena is also an avid reader. She has multiple bookshelves in her home and seems to be reading a lot of things. And so I looked up what she was reading and got to work. I decided to go through each book and give it a try. If I liked it, I would continue reading it. And if I didn't, I would move on. What I discovered is that she read a lot of the books that I had been looking at, and then some. What I've been reading recently I thought I would share a few of the books I've read recently. If you're interested, you can check them out on Goodreads. For years I have been intrigued by the concept of how our minds work. I've read a lot of books on psychology, but what I love about this one is that it was written by a clinical psychologist. It is written in a way that is easy to understand, and it makes the case that there's a difference between what you want and what you need. The author, Dr. Timothy A. Pychyl, Ph.D., teaches at Carleton University and I like the way he explains the science behind why we procrastinate and gives practical tips to change that. This book has given me a lot of insight into why I put off things I need to do, and how to avoid doing that in the future. We all know we should read more, but I'm constantly putting it off. I used to think I had to read a lot of books to be a reader. I wanted to read 50 books in a year, and I've never managed to get there. This book is meant to help you read more by not necessarily reading more, but by changing how you read and how you look at books. Reading is a skill and like any other skill, it can be developed and honed. This book taught me that I can read what I want, when I want, and how I want. I can read while waiting for my kids at school, while traveling, or while I'm exercising. I can read a page a day, 10 pages a day, or 100 pages a day. I can read e-books, print books, audiobooks. I can read what I want, when I want, and how I want. I've been a vegetarian for over 20 years. I haven't always been that way, but the more I've learned about animal cruelty and environmental impact, the more I want to eat less meat. This book was written by a registered dietitian who is a vegetarian. It is written in a way that's easy to understand, but she does a lot of science-y stuff. It's easy for me to get lost in the science, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the book. It has a lot of great information about the environmental impact of meat consumption and the health benefits of eating less meat. It's also full of recipes. I've been wanting to read more self-help books for a while, and I saw this book in the library
