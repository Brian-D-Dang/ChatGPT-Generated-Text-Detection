I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that the victim didn't do enough. Both of these sides are actually very dangerous, and I believe we must look to another side. The problem is, rape culture is a huge problem, one that affects both men and women, and it's a huge problem because of the way it is used to create an unhealthy environment. The issue isn't that the victim didn't do enough to prevent the rape, but that the perpetrator didn't do enough not to rape. The issue isn't that a girl was raped because she wore a short skirt, or went to a party, or otherwise did something. It's that a man raped her. The issue isn't that a girl got too drunk to not be able to consent. It's that a man drank too much to not be able to not rape. It is vital that we shift our focus to the perpetrator. The victim is not to blame. Rape culture is dangerous because it teaches the idea that if a girl is raped, she deserves it. It teaches the idea that if a girl is raped, she is not a real victim, because she was asking for it. It teaches the idea that if a girl is raped, she is not a real victim, because she was too drunk to not be raped. It teaches the idea that if a girl is raped, it is her fault. Rape culture is dangerous because it teaches the idea that if a man is raped, he is not a real victim, because he was asking for it. It teaches the idea that if a man is raped, he is not a real victim, because he was too drunk to not be raped. It teaches the idea that if a man is raped, it is his fault. Because rape culture teaches the idea that rape victims are not real victims, rape victims don't feel like they can go to the police or tell their friends. Because rape culture teaches the idea that rape victims are not real victims, the accused rapist goes free. Because rape culture teaches the idea that if a man is raped, he is not a real victim, many men go free. Because rape culture teaches the idea that if a man is raped, it is his fault, many men are not believed when they are raped. Because rape culture teaches the idea that rape victims are not real victims, rape victims are not believed. Because rape culture teaches the idea that if a man is raped, he is not a real victim, men are not believed. This is the danger of rape culture, and why it must be shut down. Sexual abuse is a problem, and we need to be taking steps to prevent it. We need to educate young boys and young girls about how rape culture is unhealthy. We need to educate everyone on consent. We need to teach children that they have a right to their own body, and that it is not their fault if someone violates that right.
