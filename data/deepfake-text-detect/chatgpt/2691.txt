From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have accomplishments. He was one of ten men who drafted and signed the Declaration of Independence and had no small influence in framing our Constitution. But he also owned slaves that were freed after his death. I don't think I can answer your question without getting into a discussion about slavery. For what it's worth, I believe slavery to be wrong but it's part of history so we needn't dwell on it. In my opinion, any man or woman should be able to own property; as long as they are willing to stand up for themselves when threatened by others with violence, why shouldn't people be allowed to sell their labor? There has always been some form of slavery going back thousands of years to at least pre-history. The best thing would seem to be honest pay for an honest days work - something other than money anyway. AJ did start out life in Virginia where there was considerable slavery. When he first went off to college, however, he had very strong abolitionist views and soon joined the Vermont militia fighting against British troops who were trying to seize control of Canada from Americans living near Lake Champlain. One more interesting fact: while attending Yale Law School, he began to study Greek which led him to become interested in philosophy. So much for slaves having little chance for success!
