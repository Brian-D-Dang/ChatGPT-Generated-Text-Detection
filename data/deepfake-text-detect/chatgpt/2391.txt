I'll allow that, in most cases, the misbehaving kid is just throwing a temper tantrum, but what do you do in cases where the kid has thrown himself on the floor and starts screaming at top volume? You have to try to figure out why he's like this. In my case with Yuki (at least I hope it was temporary), she had been crying for two days because her dog died suddenly from an accident induced heart attack. She probably felt guilty about not taking care of him properly before his death or something along those lines.
