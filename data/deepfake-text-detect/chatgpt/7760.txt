While it may be true that you personally have experienced no issues with your circumcision, that does not mean that the procedure is without potential risks or harms. In fact, the American Medical Association and other medical organizations have stated that the benefits of routine circumcision are not significant enough to warrant recommending the procedure for all newborn boys. Additionally, circumcision is a irreversible procedure that removes an important part of a person's anatomy without their consent, and this raises ethical questions about the rights of the child to bodily autonomy. Therefore, it may be more beneficial to prioritize informed consent and leave the decision of circumcision up to individuals when they are of age to make their own decision.
