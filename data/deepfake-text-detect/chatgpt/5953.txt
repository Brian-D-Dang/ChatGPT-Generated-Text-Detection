I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost always the case that the name comes from the number of atoms in the element. That being said, it got me thinking: does anyone have any idea why the "un" prefix is used in the element names? egingroup Related question on Chemistry SE: Why the prefix un-? endgroup - orthocresol Dec 1 '16 at 19:50 egingroup See also: Which elements are "un" elements? endgroup - orthocresol Dec 1 '16 at 20:13 egingroup There are a few common exceptions, such as the -ium- ionic elements (those with a 2 charge) or the -argon- group of noble gases, but in general the answer is that it's the number of atoms in the element. endgroup - Nathaniel Dec 1 '16 at 22:55 egingroup There are also unides and unidesmium, but not much is known about them. endgroup - FGK Dec 2 '16 at 10:47 egingroup The un- prefix was used because the elements were discovered before the general scheme was established. endgroup - LarsH Dec 2 '16 at 16:18 I'm going to take a different approach. I think that the primary reason for using the prefix "un is not aesthetic, but pragmatic. I think that the prefix is more about what you do with the elements, rather than how many atoms you have. There are three main ways that you can do chemistry with an element. You can make compounds. For example, iron can combine with carbon to make iron (II) carbide. You can do reactions. For example, you can react iron with chlorine to make iron chloride. You can work with the pure element. For example, you can measure the magnetic field of pure iron. When you make compounds, you're changing the number of atoms in the element, so the "un prefix would be appropriate. For example, if you want to make iron (II) carbide, you need to take two iron atoms and put them together with one carbon atom. This is a compound with six atoms. When you do reactions, you're also changing the number of atoms in the element, so you should use the un- prefix. For example, if you react iron with chlorine, you get iron chloride, which has two iron atoms and three chlorine atoms. This is an ionic compound. When you work with pure elements, the atoms don't change. For example, if you want to measure the magnetic field of iron, you don't change the number of atoms, so you should not use the un- prefix. Whenever you do chemistry, you're doing either one of the following. If you make compounds, you're changing the number of atoms in the element. If you do reactions, you're changing the number of atoms in the element. If you work with pure elements, the atoms don't change. As a consequence, the prefix "un is used to describe the first two of these. Not the answer you're looking for?
