I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly fire incidents. I would suggest that it is not always the case however - most officers seem to be known for their willingness to react quickly when they see things get out of hand, even in situations where people are hurt or threatened by others so it matters little if an officer fires back. "Officers cannot operate with impunity," said Alissa Robinson, a professional safety advocate at USCIS. "They should not take action based solely upon conditions created by colleagues." For those officers whose jobs depend on upholding criminal justice policies as well as maintaining public trust in the State Department's pledge to use force only against terrorists or criminals who threaten public safety, such statements can present challenges because they disrupt efforts to assure compliance with both policy and law enforcement standards. Criminal justice reform advocates hope the new standard will reinforce what they say is a trend toward accountability: That officers are expected to act promptly rather than passively following orders given that many enforce laws strictly through inaction rather than using deadly force. Meanwhile, critics worry about how officers may treat victims' families during investigations into fatal shootings - including when police departments fail to follow orders from superiors after tragedies like the shooting deaths of two Southern Oregon residents last year. While most police chiefs agree that officers must behave responsibly once a case develops, some fear repercussions come with higher expectations since there could be escalating tensions between officers involved in disciplinary cases involving civilians instead of investigating crimes committed by officers themselves. Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Bacci has been criticized repeatedly over his handling of a recent incident involving former OHSU student Juanita Bailey, who was fatally shot by high-ranking OHSU student guardsman James Blackwell Jr., who confronted Bailey outside the campus security director office. Bacci apologized earlier this month for ordering Blackwell fired after hearing rumors he had acted inappropriately prior to Bailey's death. Marty Skovronsky, executive director of the Oregon Law Enforcement Asset For Prevention Coalition, said he believes that officers should continue to adhere to departmental policies despite criticism. Skovronsky noted that the department did not immediately brush off questions about Bailey's death before taking action; instead, officers were handed the responsibility to investigate the case publicly without waiting until it became public knowledge later Tuesday morning. Besides the departmentwide investigation into Bailey's death, officers also handled another fatal shooting Saturday night near Interstate 5, killing a man who authorities believe shot and seriously injured another man inside a house party nearby. Police have defended their actions amid controversy surrounding charges against Blackwell and his guardsmen. Officer William Howard, who leads an independent review committee appointed by OHSU president Ken Tucker, described Blackwell's firing as a mistake. Attorney General Robert Hur warned against assuming that officers responsible for shooting Bailey aren't aware of or ignoring problems they might face while conducting investigation duties. Howard told reporters Monday night that Blackwell would have deserved more time if he hadn't ordered Blackwell to shoot Bailey before he died. The board cleared Blackwell of misconduct charges Wednesday pending further investigation and is scheduled next week to discuss whether officers should prosecute Blackwell again under Oregon's Violence Against Women Act. Bacchi dismissed suggestions that police disproportionately punish minorities especially black officers. In response to calls for reform, the department agreed Friday to hire more women, expand its diversity training program, improve transparency regarding complaints filed against officers and maintain more transparency around its operations plan. OHSU Chancellor Richard Frantz told lawmakers Thursday that "if you look closely enough at our history, you'll find none outstanding instances of racism" among police officers nationally. He cited the shooting death of an unarmed black man last year along with other serious incidents like the deaths of two men killed within 10 miles of campus and the shooting death May 16 of a white Minneapolis police officer accused of racially profiling two Hispanic men. Revelations about fights between officers and students sparked protests across the United States as police responded to protests stemming from a wave of racial hate crime violence nationwide last summer. Interim chancellor John Lipscomb urged lawmakers to support legislation designed to create standards against disparities in policing, including requiring Black faculty members to report suspected inappropriate conversations with faculty members past reports of harassment or bullying to the university's Human Relations department.
