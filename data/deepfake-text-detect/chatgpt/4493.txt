To get this out of the way early: This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk. An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation. I'm not here to argue someone's point on a personal level; it should all come from their own merits and reasoning applied to the subject matter at hand. The most recent thing that has caught my eye in regards to 'PC' culture are livestreams of gamersMUD players taking part in smurf hunts (a large community would target one another if they knew where each other lived). The game itself isn't even popular anymore but the fact that people just take time away from important things like their children or family life to cause petty arguments over something trivial makes me want to cry. I was playing WoW back when Smugglaz first came about, so I can understand what this means to them as an MMO player. They had been playing the same server since release which made them feel safe - they felt secured enough to play without having to worry about PvP happening within their group or with random strangers. After raid lockout hit mid-way through Cataclysm there were new instances released into the old content pool. At some point after WotLK though, patch 4.2 was announced and they realized that raiding wasn't done on PUG servers any longer and therefore were forced to start looking elsewhere for raids. And boy did they find them! As soon as hitting 80 meant you could queue up for those dungeons, guildies started flooding into these rare holes left by Blizzard. People who hadn't even played the previous 3 years suddenly became super active simply because of how much fun it promised to be. It almost proved too hard to resist for some of them, hence the reason we see threads every day asking "what do i need to get to 85?" followed shortly thereafter by "how long will it take"? Some took it differently than others. For instance: "What class combination works best? DPS being warriors, healers being druids." "Which talent tree gives better dps stats?" "Should I dual spec warrior tanking or healing?" Yes and yes and no. Different roles require different specs and classes depending on your individual skill set. There are many ways of doing anything, and finding yours shouldn't always depend on gear drops alone. That isn't to say Blizzard hasn't changed how loot functions, however. To reiterate what I wrote earlier: A lot of MOBAs force you to use items that take advantage of certain mechanics and avoid using others. In WoW, you have more freedom to choose between melee and ranged builds, as well as defensive build options such as CDR Armor Penetration Evasion etc., whereas SMURFS forces you into a particular path. If tanks don't bring protection buffs why would anyone expect DPs to carry magic damage reduction skills? Why wouldn't Clerics go full mitigation instead of utility trees? These are questions only developers themselves know, yet they try to make you think otherwise when making decisions regarding self-improvement. Thus goes the idea behind the concept of teaching kids responsibility. You're given choices, then told whether or not you chose correctly. But in reality, giving choices doesn't remove said responsibilities entirely; you still have to accept whatever consequences arise and decide yourself. No one else does it for you. Plus, you never really learn until late game anyway unless you seek information outside of what's provided. Not everyone puts in 100 effort. Some work less than 50, while others might give 75. In conclusion, Smuggling isn't bad gameplay per se. On the contrary, competition based games it very good at appealing to the competitive spirit inside us mortals. However the method used in reaching our goals makes enemies out of friends, causing friction and tension among people whom would normally enjoy spending time together. In essence, everything becomes negative feedback loop design. We begin down spiraling toward failure regardless of attempting to protect ourselves against potential ruin. This brings me to my next topic: there seems to be two schools of thoughts today concerning education: the authoritarian approach vs the democratic approach. Personally speaking, I prefer democracy. Given a choice of either type, please inform me which kind you'd rather teach your child. Religions tend to favour the former, while nations seem to lean towards the latter. Even in real life, the democratic society thrives far above the autocracy state. Just look at Denmark if you need further proof of that. Having said that, it must also be noted that there is nothing inherently wrong with authoritarianism. Many dictatorships rose to power due to strong leadership abilities which proves that sometimes, dictatorship may actually allow for effective rule. Yet the key difference lies in how efficiently their rules are executed. Most dictators resort to harsh punishments as opposed to a soft touch. A prime example of this is North Korea under Kim Jong Un, whose pride knows no bounds. While leaders like him exist, democracy remains hostilely accepted idealist, but is dead manning expectations but elias expectationslexilic democratic orders deeds for the real order the disease rate is no doubt
