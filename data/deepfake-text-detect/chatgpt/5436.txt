I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several dogs and I am lucky to have two young ones who go out in the evenings before they chew my legs off from curiousity. So is it possible that your dogs could be barking at random strangers when they're not supposed to? Not sure how it works exactly but there's a lot of people living near me who would never leave their pets alone as well
