I recently saw a video on why the Republicans [can't win] the 2016 election. If we go by raw numbers, Hillary will most likely win the next election. This got me thinking about the reasons why. One reason why Republicans can't win the 2016 election is because of their lack of appeal to a wider demographic. The Republican party has become increasingly associated with conservative and religious values, which alienates potential voters who are not part of those groups. This includes young voters, women, minorities and the LGBT community, all of whom may be more likely to vote for a Democratic candidate. Another contributing factor is the Republican party's failure to present clear policies on key issues. With so many different members of the party holding different views, it has been difficult for them to form a unified platform that appeals to a wide range of voters. In contrast, the Democratic party has been able to create a more unified message that resonates with a broader base of voters. Finally, the Republican party has been hurt by some of its own members' controversial statements on a range of topics. These comments have caused divisions within the party and made it difficult for them to appear unified and consistent in their messaging. This has further alienated potential voters who may disagree with the statements or feel that the party is out of touch with their views.
