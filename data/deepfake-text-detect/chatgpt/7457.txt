A possible counter-argument to refute this opinion could be that while freedom of speech is certainly an important value, it is not an absolute value that trumps all other values such as human dignity, equality, and social justice. A social progressive can support reasonable limits on speech, such as hate speech or incitement to violence, in order to protect the rights and well-being of marginalized or vulnerable groups who are often the targets of such speech. By allowing hate speech or other forms of harmful speech to flourish unchecked, we may actually undermine the prospects of a truly inclusive and just society where everyone is treated with respect and dignity. Therefore, supporting reasonable limits on speech can be seen as a way to promote both freedom and social progress.
