I am a young black male, who is torn between both sides of the aisle regarding race relations in America. I have experience racial profiling and understand that there is systemic racism in America, but at the same time, I also believe that not all law enforcement officers are racist or biased. Can you offer any guidance on how to navigate this dichotomy and form my own beliefs on race relations?
