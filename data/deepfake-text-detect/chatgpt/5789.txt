I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for say grand theft auto or manslaughter or something. They should have the option to get life. I am not talking about people with life sentences. I am talking about people who are incarcerated for a non violent crime, and who have served 20 or 30 years. I think that we are wasting tax payer money and the inmates are not getting any rehabilitation. What do you think? Let me know below. I believe that people who are serving life should have the right to die. I agree. I believe that if they have done the time, they should do the life sentence. The taxpayers should not have to pay for someone to live that long. They should have the option to die. I don't think the tax payers should pay to keep someone alive who has no chance of getting out. The government should pay to have the person killed so that we don't have to. I am so very sorry about the loss of your loved one. I agree with you. I think that if someone has done their time and is incarcerated for a non violent crime that has served their time and did not do something that was violent and or sexual, then they should have the option to live the rest of their lives in prison. I know it won't happen but it should. I don't understand why we keep people in prison and pay to keep people in prison who have no hope of getting out. The taxpayers should not have to pay to keep people in prison who have no hope of getting out. I think it's wrong. Yes I believe that people who are serving life should have the right to die. There are people who are incarcerated for life and I am not saying that they should get out, I am just saying that they should have the option of living out the rest of their life in prison. It is very sad to think that someone who served their time in prison for a non violent crime should be forced to spend the rest of their life in prison. I believe that it is very expensive to have someone live in a prison the rest of their life, so why not give them the option to die and save some money. I think that we are wasting tax payer money and the inmates are not getting any rehabilitation. I think that if someone has served their time, they should have the option to die. I am against the death penalty, I do not believe that the government should have the right to take another person's life, whether it be a convicted criminal or not. I don't believe in the death penalty either.
