I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends and family. It's just too bitter, smoky, dark, etc... Is there a way around this? Am I simply missing something obvious here about how delicious it can be when well-made or is it really not enjoyable at all with some people? For reference: I'm 23 years old, white female in USA who doesn't drink alcohol as well. Oh good lord no! Coffee is one thing that everyone should like! Try different roasts until you find one that works for ya:)
