And yes marijuana may have its benefits but just like alcohol can lead to alcoholism so too can pot turn you into an addict. And while some people don't seem to get addicted at first many others develop tolerance over time after prolonged use; this means more THC needs to be consumed to achieve "highness." This can take place in as little as 3 days making continued usage highly dangerous because overdose happens very fast when using large amounts of either substance. Here Are 10 Signs That You May Be Addicted To Weed: 1. The urge to consume weed is constant. No matter how much you try to stop consuming pot your cravings only seem to grow stronger and stronger until you cave in every single time. It becomes harder each time simply because there seems to be no end. 2. Your consumption habits become erratic. Extreme highs followed quickly by extreme lows make life difficult if not impossible to function normally throughout the day. 3. There's always money to pay for weed. If you must spend money just to fill a craving then chances are you might well be addicted. In fact most addicts want to spend their own hard earned cash rather than steal from loved ones. 4. Pot negatively affects your relationships. Family members love one another unconditionally regardless of what they look like on the outside but addictions tend to tear families apart. Most who engage in drugs andor alcohol have lost at least three family members before reaching adulthood due to something related directly to drug use. Whether it was emotional neglect or physical abuse it hurts everyone involved. 5. You begin stealing things to feed your habit. From foodstuffs to milk jugs and other items used to hold liquid goods thieves will resort to doing whatever it takes when it comes to feeding their addictions. 6. Pills start showing up everywhere. Some folks think taking pills form things like Tylenol or Advil is okay since neither contain any actual psychotropic component i.e., THC or cocaine. Drugs like these still disrupt brain chemistry negatively affecting both behavior and thoughts. 7. Marijuana use begins interfering with your work performance and daily activities. At some point you won't wake up without having smoked yet again prior to leaving the house. Or maybe instead of getting out of bed you stay home playing video games because in order to feel normal you need high levels of THC coursing through your system. 8. Finding ways to sneak off in private to partake almost becomes habitual. Being seen generally leads to questions about why you're behaving differently and thus fueling further desire for immediate satisfaction. 9. You develop nasty withdrawal symptoms once you go cold turkey. Nausea, insomnia, muscle and bone aches among others affect millions of Americans who decide they've had enough and opt to abandon their substances permanently. 10. You find yourself wondering whether smoking cannabis could ever kill you? While it would certainly take awhile killing oneself with anything requires a certain level of desperation coupled with medical conditions made worse by chronic use of marijuana.
