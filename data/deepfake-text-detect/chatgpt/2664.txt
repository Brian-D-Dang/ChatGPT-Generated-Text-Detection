The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, but not exactly why or what created itself from nothing? Why is there something rather than nothing or aught else instead of this universe? Why does it matter if you can explain some things with science, like why do people care so much about trying to prove god doesn't exist. It will never be proven anything because no one knows all the answers for everything and whether they want to admit it or not every question has an answer even if nobody understands them It matters that we understand nature as best we possibly can; better understanding brings us closer toward our goal of creating artificial intelligence (which may well destroy humanity). The more we learn, the less likely God becomes.
