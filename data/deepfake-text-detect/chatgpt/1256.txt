To start, I'm not here to discuss wealth distribution, or income inequality. They are real issues that need to be addressed, and as much as governments like to talk about I'm not here to discuss the state of the world economy, or globalization. I'm here to talk about a more fundamental issue, which is that it's not just about money.
