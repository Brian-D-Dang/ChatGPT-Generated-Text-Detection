Fairly simple premise. I'm 35 years old. I remember the Cold War. The first Gulf War. The Iraq War. War in Afghanistan, etc... I hear talk all the time about a new world order and "Globalization." I couldn't find it today on the internet because no one is reporting this happening yet (and that's probably why they don;t want to release details). But as soon as word of mouth gets out from those who were there....it will be everywhere.....all over my facebook feed lol
