Alright, so, I was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while I am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, I thought that, at the very least, we could discuss what is meant by "non-code" in terms of code review. This isn't really even about non-code reviews - I've done enough of those already (but there are still plenty of opportunities available) - but rather my experiences with people's attitudes towards code review when they don't write code themselves. It has never been an easy job in our project because I think everyone involved wants to make sure we do everything right first time around, but sometimes communities can be pretty difficult to work within if everyone doesn't feel like their input matters as much. This was actually one of the reasons why I wanted to quit working on this project altogether until it got more stable; too many times there were comments along the lines of, "The only reason we're doing this is because some random person on the Internet told us we should." I'm not going to get into how that leads to less than stellar code quality or issues finding bugs etc... But my point is: it seems like code reviewers often have very little say over development decisions and that results in me being forced to ignore all kinds of good advice because I know that any change will likely have unforeseen consequences unless someone else takes note of these problems before hand. If you need someone else for your removal process, just hire them as you normally wouldwouldn't. The issue is that people want to jump ship from whatever they're contributing without having to deal with any code changes. In the end, it ends up leaving us with two bad options - either wait until next year to fix things ourselves, or try a different approach (and possibly don't use someone who may then likely leave). I guess the real question is whether community members see reviewing code as something that needs to happen, or if they consider it to be something they might take advantage of down the road?
