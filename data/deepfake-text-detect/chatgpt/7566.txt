The precautionary principle is a valuable principle to follow when there is uncertainty about the potential consequences of an action. However, it is not always the best approach to take. In this case, not eating fish simply because you are unsure if it aligns with your morality could prevent you from experiencing new things and trying new foods. It could also potentially offend your partner's family who may see fishing and eating fish as a cultural tradition. Instead of relying solely on the precautionary principle, you could ask your partner's family about their views on fishing and eating fish, and if they do not object, try a small amount to determine if it aligns with your moral beliefs. It is important to balance your personal values with cultural and social expectations in order to navigate tricky social situations.
