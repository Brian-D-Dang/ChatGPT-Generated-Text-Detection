My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered: A girl from Japan A boy in China Buckets of Chinese people living in America (including me) A redhead who was born in Canada but moved to England because she wanted to have a child Cocaine addict in Germany Also, an example is: It may seem counterintuitive, but the vast majority of the adoption world adopts and uses generalizations on gender roles. The problem is that liberal societies tend to favor groups with genders other than their own, or at least they do so when there's currently no need, especially since whatever one chooses to use is usually accepted by the government. In particular, in countries where women are more likely to adopt. Women don't get as many places to live and work as men, even though this happens among large numbers of women. Even if we assume that gender relations will decline over time due to cultural pressures, it's still less true for older generations of women to find employment relative to male counterparts. This problem has been present since the late 1920s in Europe, which has led to increasing female unemployment across European nations. On the other hand, the rise of democratic nations like Hungary and Poland, where young women were picked up by men almost immediately after becoming citizens, on average followed a similar pattern. In fact, compared to the USA, many countries had the highest levels of female unemployment last year - 3 per cent higher than the national average. A stronger trend suggests that these trends could also be linked to broader social problems such as racism and intolerance. There are certainly examples of this in Latin America, where sex discrimination concerns are prevalent. For instance, in Peru, a recent decision to end all sexual harassment against women came amid widespread complaints about gender-based violence that went unaddressed by the authorities. However, despite long history of abuse, sexual harassment remains rife, even today. The issue of homosexuality has never been addressed enough, yet some cultures firmly believe homosexuality should be forbidden. In early recognition of gay rights, most notably the right to marry, some groups supported banning homosexuality outright. But this is not something that actually works to change attitudes towards homosexual acts, rather, it promotes the acceptance of the idea that heterosexual relationships only exist between persons whose sexuality is intrinsically conflicted. Even if you accept that all forms of sexual activity are wrong, your conclusion is based on the assumption that boys and girls are inherently different. Sex is not just about hormones and hormones alone; sex is also a combination of both! It doesn't matter whether someone is attracted to a man physically or mentally; it matters how much money he makes, his relationship status and his ability to sustain himself financially.
