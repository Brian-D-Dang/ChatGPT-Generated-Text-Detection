I think it is the opinion of many people on the internet, and of reddit in particular that the companies trying to fight piracy should "Deal with it" that they have absolutely no right. They are completely free to do so if you like that sort of thing but I personally don't care a shred about their attempts at stopping me from downloading copyrighted content for personal use (if such an act were illegal). When your commercially available software can be used legally by anyone then yeah its just being lazy
