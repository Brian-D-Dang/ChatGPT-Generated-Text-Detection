Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be . I don't have enough information on any specific cases where police were involved in an unjust shooting (or killing) to even make a determination as far as whether they're legally culpable for that sort of thing so it's entirely possible my mind could change once all the facts are revealed but right now there isn't anything concrete from which we can form opinions based solely upon our knowledge and understanding at present time
