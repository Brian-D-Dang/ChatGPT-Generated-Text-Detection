It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cruel. Zoo officers should have animal welfare responsibilities and take care of their own needs in the future to protect them from spaying or neutering instead of removing them for useless reasons like this. But in retrospect, it shouldn't surprise anyone that the zoo isn't committed to animals' rights too much; that's why people often complain about animals being euthanized because they're too small or sickly more than others who deserve better treatment. The zoo has a policy against euthanasia of animals via euthanasia (which Animal Care Control says is humane). The zoo does, however, allow humans to suck on cardboard boxes which is less invasive when compared with other methods such as euthanizing animals after suffering injuries caused by careless animal owners.
