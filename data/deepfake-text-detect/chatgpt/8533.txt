White girls very rarely date Asian men. Even in Asia white men are much more popular than Asian men. Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white women, he is usually less willing to date a black girl because he does not want to be with her anymore and as one of those who said here: "I don't think it will change at all." A black man (and probably many other people) can be attracted by a woman who looks like him or the same person (she's not his friend). He doesn't need to say something about that and she won't care if he says anything else anyways. I guess maybe a lot of the people who dislike Chinese girls even think they're just "bad people."
