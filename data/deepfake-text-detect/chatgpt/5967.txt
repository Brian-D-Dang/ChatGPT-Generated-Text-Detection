To me growth of economy is a meaningless statistic. Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange. What kind of person evaluates actions in terms of how much money is exchanged? If you have a new iPhone you can buy a new computer with that money or you can use it to buy a sandwich, what difference does it make? If you buy a 5000 car you could have bought a 5000 laptop or a 5000 computer, what difference does it make? Meaningless statistics like growth of economy, unemployment rate and etc. are given much importance when in reality they are irrelevant. The only thing which matters is the happiness of the people. If people are happy, it is a sign of progress. If they are not, it is a sign of regression. Thus the only way to measure growth is through happiness. "Happiness is the natural and inevitable consequence of doing what you love." -Robert Ulrich Happiness does not mean you have to be in an extremely joyful state all the time. It means that you are constantly contented with the situation you are in. I cannot say that I am always happy. There are times when I am not happy. I am not in a job that I am passionate about. I have to pay off my debts and I don't have a girlfriend. But all these problems make me unhappy because I am not happy about them. But at the same time, they do not make me unhappy because I am not unhappy about them. I am not unhappy about not having a girlfriend because it is not a problem. I am not unhappy about having debts because I am not unhappy about having debts. "The truth is that only a few of us ever find the life we want. Everyone else is living someone else's life." -Frederick Brookes We all want to be happy and in order to be happy we have to do something that gives us pleasure. But there is a problem. What we do should be useful and beneficial to others. But what gives us pleasure might not be useful or beneficial to others. That is the problem. In order to be happy we have to do something that is good for others. But in order to be happy, we have to do something that makes us happy. The problem can be solved by not focusing on happiness as a final goal but as a means to a goal. "If you could give your children only one thing, would you give them your love or your fears? Choose wisely. Your children will become what you are." -Tony Fahkry To be happy, you need to do something that makes you happy. But to be successful, you need to do something that is useful to others. The solution is to do something that makes you happy and at the same time is useful to others. It is not easy to find something that is useful to others and that also makes you happy. I have found my passion in writing. I enjoy writing. Writing makes me happy. At the same time writing is something that is useful to others. People will read my articles and learn from them. So I can be happy and at the same time I can be successful. If I was not happy, I would have no motivation to write. If I was not successful, I would not be able to help others. Thus I have found a solution to the problem.

Take away your thoughts and the world remains; put them back and it is saved." -Anon In order to be happy, you have to do something that makes you happy.

"I have thought about death and I have done what I wanted to do in my life and I have no regrets." We cannot be happy if we are not satisfied with what we are doing. A lot of people are unhappy because they are not happy with their jobs. I am not happy with my job. I am not satisfied. I don't get paid for my work. But I am not unhappy. I am not unhappy because I have not found my passion in life. I am not unhappy because I am
