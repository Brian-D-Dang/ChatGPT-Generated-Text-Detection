In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they do not want to is considered sexual assault or rape, which are serious crimes that can result in significant legal consequences. It is important to respect the bodily autonomy of others and recognize their right to make decisions about their own bodies. It is never acceptable to pressure, coerce, or force someone to engage in sexual activity against their will. Consent is necessary for any sexual activity to be considered consensual and lawful.
