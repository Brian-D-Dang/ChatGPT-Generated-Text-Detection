I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still stand by my first point... The general apology was accepted and we walked away from the event happy. But what really changed? Why did they apologize if it didn't change anything at all?! After talking to some friends who were there for the rally itself as well as watching some videos online after the fact - which clearly shows how disruptive these individuals are becoming on college campuses nationwide! It seems that now more than ever before young adults have started taking over our democracy because today they define what is acceptable behavior and even what constitutes hate speech or racism. It doesn't matter if you agree with someone else on something; if your political beliefs align with theirs then they can do whatever they want.....and you will be punished....if any one thing could go wrong when dealing with the politically correct crowd its this kind of nonsense: People being taken out into the street due to people acting like children arguing about stupid things........oh wait thats exactly what happened at Boston College last night during Paul Ryan's Townhall meeting. And just as quickly as it began the event had to be shut down....A group of students stormed out onto the stage and refused to leave until he said "sorry" to them!! What!!! Seriously??? Do Americans not remember that those same students protested John Kerry once upon a time?? Or that they shouted obscenities against Ronald Reagan back in 1980?? Wasn't it only less than 20 years ago that Michelle Malkin called liberals "treasonous" for protesting her book on 911???? Where does ALL of this crap come from anyway!?
