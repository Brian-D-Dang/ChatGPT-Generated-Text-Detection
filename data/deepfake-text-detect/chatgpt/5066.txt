Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a boot camp. I actually don't care about the lower price as long as it's a full size. However, if you're not making your own music, then this is such a nice compromise between price and quality that I'd be willing to pay 30-40 per track depending on your needs (which depends on what genresgenre).
