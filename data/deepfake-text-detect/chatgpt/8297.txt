This is a problem I always encounter when I drive on a highway. The speed limit in the most used highway where I live is 70. I usually go at 65, and sometimes even lower than that (because there are no limits for cars here...) But once someone passes me while driving above 90 kmh... The difference between my car's maximum allowed velocity of 80kmph but being able to reach speeds over 120-130 kilometers per hour feels like an immense gap! Not only this makes it easy catching up with these people who drives much faster then what they should be doing; It also gives them more time going under safety check points without worrying about getting their speeding ticketed or stopped by police officers patrolling along highways looking out from behind binoculars waiting upon suspicious drivers exceeding one hundred kilometer rate because other evil guys do so too!!! So now imagine if all those fast moving vehicles were driven way below its capability??? So yes.. Driving slower means less traffic jams which saves our precious fuel consumption as well!!:)
