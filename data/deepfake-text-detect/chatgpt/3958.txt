I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, other women might want that too if they're not married and don't live with their spouses or anything like that - because It's a bit selfish to want your own kid. (and who doesn't want their own kid?!) But Noone else will ever want those kind of things as much as you do. When would be the next time you imagine having your own child? How old are you now?
