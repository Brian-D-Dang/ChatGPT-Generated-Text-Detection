Scientists widely accept that climate change is real. Consequently, they say that it will lead to extreme weather, a raise in the sea level, increased acidity of the ocean, reduced rainfall and harsher winters with more frequent hurricanes, and a decrease in temperatures across North America due to warmer oceans because greenhouse gases from emissions have warmed the atmosphere equally fast than current trends suggest. The global carbon economy has experienced rapid growth over recent decades as nations like China and Russia ramp up their emissions reduction efforts while slowing economic growth. Scientists also agree that climate change poses risks even if governments do nothing about it or fail to act decisively enough on reducing emissions. The levelized cost estimate for mitigation measures is estimated at 7 trillion per year by 2050 based on current trends alone. That would leave the planet facing an existential threat worth a few billion dollars a year compared with less than 1 percent today's emissions reductions through 2030 combined rate according to the Paris Climate Change Convention. "Global warming represents a significant risk," says Dr. Jurgen Protz. "Climate scientists know this crisis is caused largely by human activities such as deforestation and increasing temperatures." In addition to establishing global warming science standards, the research team suggests developing policies from ideas generated from research projects. These include creating a global climate policy framework aimed at enhancing governance while removing incentives for businesses to reduce pollution input costs; establishing international agreements requiring countries to work together toward total renewable energy investments around the world backed by public funds and national plans upholding transparency laws protecting environmental rights worldwide.
