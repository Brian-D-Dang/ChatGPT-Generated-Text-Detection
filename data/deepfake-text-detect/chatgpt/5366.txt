Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and needs to check his or her status as such before heshe could vote there Yeah that's exactly what I'm thinking of too but nobody cares about my status I live in Canada and they dont care it seems like most Canadians don't even bother checking their facebook once a month lol
