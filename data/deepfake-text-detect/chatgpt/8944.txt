I'm very confused and bothered by the amount of ads for prescription medications that run on television and in magazines. In my mind, the reason that these medications can only be sold to doctors is because they are manufactured as a drug and cannot be marketed legally or appropriately. The Pharmaceutical Companies, which restrict the sale of drugs such as heroin, crack cocaine or cocaine addictions to the US market, have successfully lobbied Congress to ban them from being sold in pharmacies and hospitals where there is no regulation. They have also made it easy for the government to regulate their marketing to physicians. Big Pharma's goal: to create a monopoly in medicine. Though the pharmaceutical companies may not be illegal in Covington County, the rest of the state has laws against selling cancer medicines online. This law was especially effective against the really bad patients who were giving the cancer drugs at high costs. It prohibits the sale of any type of cancer medication at medical stores other than those prescribed through doctors' offices. And you know what? The code is clearly clear about this: if you sell your cancer medicine online to a doctor, heshe must forfeit it completely (without penalty), including disqualifying the patient from accessing services offered by an insurance company. Same goes for any medicines used by older adults - unless you're a pre-existing health condition that requires immediate emergency treatment. If you've been diagnosed with diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis, you won't be able to obtain care even if you want to. And the same applies for certain other diseases like heart disease and Alzheimer's disease, too. Just imagine if all these illnesses existed without our help! A recent study published in the journal Neurology examined whether nine out of 10 Americans would use prescription opioids or stimulants to treat more serious cognitive disorders, according to the Washington Post. Nine percent of those who used prescription painkillers had higher levels of inflammation in their brains, compared with three out of ten people who did not take painkiller prescriptions. This is the kind of data we need to get used to. We just don't get enough information to accurately assess the risks for prescribing medications using prescription conditions. America continues to face chronic and unnecessary deaths due to opioid addiction and the misuse and abuse of drug overdoses worldwide. But when it comes to opioid addiction, the most dangerous problem is growing in magnitude that much worse will continue to plague us until we stop buying and administering them to ourselves and others.
