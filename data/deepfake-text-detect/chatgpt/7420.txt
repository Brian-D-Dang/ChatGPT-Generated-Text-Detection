While saving pandas does require significant investment, it is important to understand the broader implications of allowing them to go extinct. Pandas are a keystone species in their ecosystem, and their extinction would have cascading effects on the food chain and the environment as a whole. Additionally, the efforts to protect pandas have also led to the protection of their habitat and other species in the area, providing further benefits to biodiversity conservation. Furthermore, the conservation of pandas also serves as a symbol of our commitment to conservation and the protection of endangered species, which can inspire partnerships and international cooperation in tackling broader environmental issues. Therefore, while the effort to save pandas may be challenging, it is not a waste of time, money or resources as it has broader implications for the environment and biodiversity conservation.
