I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If I am a spiritual person, I believe in the mystery of how I interpret reality to be true, but I am not a religious one. I believe in that there is truth and justice in everything. I do believe in the power of prayer and in my belief that everything in this world is to our benefit.
