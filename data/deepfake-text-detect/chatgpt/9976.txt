I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible for us to make these elements in a lab. It's more likely that they exist naturally in the environment, but even then it's hard to find them and study them. In any case, we don't have the technology yet to create them artificially.
