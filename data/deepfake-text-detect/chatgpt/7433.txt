There are several strong counterarguments to this opinion. For one, science itself is constantly evolving and new discoveries are being made all the time. Just a few decades ago, the idea that there could be life beyond Earth was considered purely science fiction. However, with the discovery of microbial life in extreme environments on our own planet, the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe has become more plausible. Furthermore, scientists have also discovered thousands of exoplanets outside of our solar system, many of which have similar conditions to Earth. This has led to further speculation and research into the possibility of there being intelligent life elsewhere. Additionally, there have been numerous reports of UFO sightings and encounters with extraterrestrial beings throughout history, some of which have been corroborated by multiple witnesses and even physical evidence. While these sightings do not conclusively prove the existence of alien life, they do suggest that there may be something out there worth investigating. Overall, while the existence of alien life cannot be currently proven or disproven, it is certainly a topic worth considering from a scientific standpoint. To dismiss it entirely as unscientific would be shortsighted and limit our understanding of the universe.
