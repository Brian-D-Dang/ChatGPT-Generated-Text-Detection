It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. I think it would be better to simply have more human drivers on the road rather then less, as autonomous vehicles will not make roads safer for humans by any means
