I think that all humans deserve the same amount of respect, all else being equal. In other words, if I don't know you at all, my respect for you won't be any different than my respect for anyone else. That being said, I do believe that everyone should be treated with kindness and empathy, regardless of their background or circumstances. This means that if someone is in need of help, I will do my best to assist them.
