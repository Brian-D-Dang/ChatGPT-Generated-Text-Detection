Improv, as an art form, is a medium almost exclusively to be enjoyed live. SNL, while having improvised elements, does not fall in this category because most skits are rehearsed extensively before being taped. Additionally, the "staging" of sketches requires elaborate sets and props or even costumes for some sketches which can serve only to detract from their comedic value if they're forced on the audience when watching at home.[5] SNL has generally been less successful with developing new characters than other late-night talk shows such as The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (who debuted 11 series regulars during its first season), David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live![67] and Conan O'Brien's Late Night (who had 25 correspondents by 1991).[8]:17-18 However, newer cast members have become familiar faces over time; these include Tina Fey (1992) and Amy Poehler (1997). Some of the more popular standup comedians who made guest appearances early in their careers also appeared regularly: Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Farley, Billy Crystal, Eric Idle, Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy,[9]Ralphie May, Jay Mohr, Iliza Shlesinger, Robin Williams, Lorne Michaels, Martin Short, Kevin Nealon, Judd Apatow, John Mulaney, Rob Schneider, Chuck D, Elayne Boosler, Fred Armisen, Andy Samberg,...
