While it is true that the military has the capability to use lethal force when necessary, the primary purpose of the military is to protect national and international interests. The military is responsible for a range of duties, including disaster relief efforts, peacekeeping missions, and humanitarian aid. Additionally, the military is often utilized as a deterrent to prevent conflict and preserve peace. Thus, the purpose of the military is not solely to kill people and break things, but to serve and protect in a multitude of ways.
