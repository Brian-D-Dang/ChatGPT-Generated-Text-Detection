I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying saying all sorts of things during the first Republican Debate, could you please provide me with more context or a specific quote from Mike Huckabee that you are referring to, so I can be more helpful in addressing your concern?
