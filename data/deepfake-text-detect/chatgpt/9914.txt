I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal products. It's important to me that I make ethical choices when it comes to buying and consuming food. I also try to buy locally sourced ingredients whenever possible, not only because it supports small businesses and farmers in my community, but also because local ingredients tend to be fresher and tastier than those grown thousands of miles away. Additionally, I try to purchase organic produce and organic animal products when available, as it helps reduce my exposure to toxins and chemicals. Finally, I try to cook meals from scratch, using whole ingredients and avoiding processed foods. This ensures that I'm getting all the nutrients I need without any artificial additives or preservatives. It's healthier for me and the environment.
