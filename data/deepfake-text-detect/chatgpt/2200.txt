I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is one of my favorite things in life. Also, adding it up with which show has given me most nostalgia feels (Code Geass), SAO would definitely be high on this list for sure! SAO gave you nostalgic feels?
