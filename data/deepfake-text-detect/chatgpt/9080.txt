Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to 15hour. While many would argue that this increases taxes (and thus taxes on those who pay their way), it is true that tens of millions more people would have work in order for these rates to be raised. The question of whether or not they should raise them were posed by economists when they presented proposals for a low-wage minimum wage that had become widely accepted as reasonable under the Thatcher era. Some economists argued that such an increase could actually lead to some income growth, which was good news, since most Americans are still able to get out of poverty. Even the Socialist Party has begun to lighten its rhetoric around raising the minimum wage, although the number of workers currently working below the 10 hour for every 1 earned per day remains small relative to the 1950s. Many think that the recent rise in health care costs will make higher wages much easier to earn - as the average worker can plan ahead to avoid paying massive medical bills just so they don't go home to their parents smoking cigarettes each year. This observation - supported by a growing body of evidence suggesting that lower working hours for all workers means less stress on the work force - is completely wrong. The amount of money needed to live comfortably requires no extra benefits at all and provides enough time away from work to reduce the stress levels that cause painful symptoms like headaches, dizziness, fatigue and other illnesses. There are relatively easy ways to get there without spending too much time in the office. The median household income (the percentage of income earned) in England increased by 2 between 1983 and 2014, according to data collected by Investopedia. According to iStock, the UK had the highest corporate income rate in Europe during the period; a first for a new government is expected this week. That's because firms have been reduced in size, hiring fewer people and providing harder competition than ever before. Profiting off of global value chains may seem relatively simple but it isn't scalable. In fact, while companies with large margins often retain their workforce longer and people tend to return later, these types of record levels of earnings do not always translate into better opportunities. As women continue to face rising family responsibilities, and in cases where men might think about taking the jobs traditionally held by a woman, the cost of living in high-income countries including Britain and Canada has risen sharply over decades, leading many economists to conclude that the costs of having children outweigh any rewards. The number of girls born to unmarried mothers rose slightly in 2014 compared to 2013, after falling over fourfold over the same period as in 1990. In comparison, the total female population increased 7.3, though fewer babies were born than births did in 1990. Women who bear childbearing responsibility also saw gains in healthcare costs: the general public paid 4.5 billion (6.9 billion) in healthcare costs in 2014, up from 2.7 billion (3.8 billion) in 1990, when the UK government announced plans to eliminate maternal deaths and save NHS resources. With a baby at home already costing us three times our own yearly salary, this trend appears to be happening in highly developed economies (particularly in India). In contrast, states that spend "just" pennies on education are losing about half of their entire national budgets alone. Why is this being overlooked? Because the majority of women work in front of-hours and localised markets are in the minority. If you take into account the huge rise in inflation and the drop in the labour market, the gains at the expense of so many women have been far greater than previously thought, which speaks volumes about how little women gain in the hands of conservative politicians in political circles. When one considers that even a modest budget surplus is sometimes enough to invest our economy, it becomes clear why this surge happened: the impact of the austerity measures that preceded the economic crash of 1980-83 was felt throughout Europe by nearly two thirds of women across Europe. Despite the shrinking wealth gap through the decades, the actual loss in productivity from manufacturing production dried up by 2012. The state has finally acknowledged that women have lost something valuable and that budget deficits are bad for business. Once the crisis passed, companies stopped making jobs available to women and instead focused mainly on formerly marginalising young women. Until recently, it seemed that both the private sector and the public sector had done nothing to address the problems facing women. When it became apparent that women weren't getting the support they need to succeed in life, parents started to stop taking care of them, leaving behind children, and families fell apart. A study commissioned by the European Commission found that only 41 percent of women working for the private sector lost their job within five years, compared with 35 percent in public society. Only 31 percent of women working full-time worked in 2016, despite the workforce being well above its pre-crisis level of 1.3 million.
