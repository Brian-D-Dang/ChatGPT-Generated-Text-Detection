I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural experience, and at worst a challenge. Depending on the food, I often opt for a spoon or fork when eating Asiatic cuisine. However, I am always willing to give chopsticks a try if I'm feeling adventurous!
