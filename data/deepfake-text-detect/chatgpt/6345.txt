Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even a potential reader of the article is not fully aware of what happened or is not being exposed to the news. I don't have any reason to believe that a journalist could have been so unprepared for this, and that there is no basis for a reasonable doubt that a scientist will be able to keep up a fairly high profile if he does.
