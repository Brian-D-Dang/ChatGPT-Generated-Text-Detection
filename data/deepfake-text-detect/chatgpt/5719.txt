It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for well, and in some cases, they are even cared for better than in the wild. Of course, I'm talking about well-funded zoos with competent staff. I think it's the same for a lot of the moral arguments against homosexuality, which is why it's so ridiculous to me that some of my more religiously conservative friends are afraid to admit that they think homosexuality is immoral. I think it's because they have some moral presuppositions that they aren't consciously aware of, and are therefore afraid of losing if they're forced to face them. (I have no idea what they are, though, since I'm not a religious person.) I also think that the same could be said for certain people who use the Bible to justify their belief that it's immoral to use birth control, have sex before marriage, etc. I've heard a lot of people say that they think it's immoral to have sex outside of marriage, but when they're asked why they think that, they're unable to really give a clear answer. I suspect that they're still thinking, "Because the Bible says so." I think it's because they have some moral presuppositions that they're not consciously aware of, and are therefore afraid of losing if they're forced to face them. I suspect that many of them are consciously aware that they think it's immoral, but don't have a clear answer as to why. (I know that I have many moral presuppositions, and I'm not consciously aware of them.) I also think that the same could be said for many of the people who think that we shouldn't allow atheists to hold office, or teach children in public schools, or be in the military. I suspect that it's because they have some moral presuppositions that they're not consciously aware of, and are therefore afraid of losing if they're forced to face them. I suspect that many of them are consciously aware that they think it's immoral, but don't have a clear answer as to why. I'm not saying that people who think that homosexuality is immoral are afraid to face the moral question. I'm saying that I think most of them are afraid to admit that they think that homosexuality is immoral, even to themselves, because they're afraid that they'll have to face other moral questions if they admit to themselves that they think homosexuality is immoral. I'm saying that many of them are consciously aware that they think it's immoral, but don't have a clear answer as to why. I know that I have many moral presuppositions, and I'm not consciously aware of them. I think that's the case for all of us. If we are honest with ourselves, we realize that we have to make a lot of assumptions in order to justify our moral claims. If people have a problem with the ethics of zoos, I think they need to go beyond the specific issues that are raised about the specific zoos they are criticizing. For instance, if you want to criticize the ethics of zoos, then I'd want to know how you would take care of all the animals in the world that are not in zoos. Some people have given some specific answers to this question, and I think they are reasonable. For instance, people who argue that we should care for the animals on this planet in the wild, rather than keeping them in zoos, seem to be saying that we should not maintain zoos, but just let all the animals on this planet live in the wild. People who are ethical vegans seem to be saying that we should not eat meat, or use animals in any way for our own purposes. These are just two specific answers to the question, but I think there are other specific answers as well. The ethics of zoos is a specific problem, but the ethics of zoos is also an issue related to the ethics of how we should care for all the animals on this planet, or should we care for the animals on this planet at all. If we want to talk about the ethics of zoos, then we have to talk about the ethics of caring for the animals in the wild. There are people who say that we should not take care of any animals at all. Some people say that we should not care for our fellow human beings, but that we should
