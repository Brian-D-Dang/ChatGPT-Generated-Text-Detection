You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the chance to explain why. While apples and oranges are two different types of fruit with varying characteristics, they can still be compared and have similarities and differences. For example, both are sweet and juicy, they are both a good source of vitamins and minerals, and they can both be used in various recipes. At the same time, they also have differences such as their outer appearance, flavor and texture. Apples tend to be crunchier, while oranges are juicier. They also have a different nutritional content with oranges being higher in vitamin C and folate, while apples are higher in fiber. In conclusion, comparing apples and oranges may not always be a perfect comparison, but it is still valid and can provide insights into similarities and differences that exist between two seemingly different things.
