growing up in america I was condition to believe women's breast are sexual organs do to the fact that we over sexualized them too much. it wasnt till recently that i truly realized they serve a purpose other than feeding our babies For me, when you have kids and your girls start growing... It gets weird sometimes if just thinking about another girl with big tits is all you can think of or you get turned on for no reason at all. When I see my daughter running around naked, there's an element of uncontrollable sexual attraction, despite knowing she'll grow into a wonderful young lady who will be loved by many (at least until her head starts getting any bigger).
