From his personality to the way he handled Southern Succession there is nothing to dislike about him. He had intelligent, moderate religious views, he was compassionate and held the moral high ground in both situations, with all three factors being poor economic performance (in terms of employment skills), a lack of good training and an unwillingness to learn new things (although happy at home). Despite his tendency towards non-helpful behaviour, there is no excuse for not taking up farming and therefore volunteering, or even working as a farmer. Of course that means that there isn't any reason why you should be forced to do this... but it certainly seems like he did. I am sure there are some people who would have been tempted by having children, or some other form of spiritual outreach within their family to provide spiritual guidance to others. The only thing we still see here is that there has to be some sort of support system where people can go out and pray for themselves while they continue their work. Otherwise there just doesn't seem to be enough time to put up with what they're doing, nor does anyone care if they've got babies on the way.. So, I think we need to look at the human cost of putting up with the crap. If you didn't extend your hand once when something bad happened to you, you shouldn't be surprised when someone else doesn't try to help you anymore! Future: Using technology to teach us how to use our brains IS NOT "using" brains; its using brain power for good and evil. A lot of people today don't understand what it means to be a brain pusher-they simply believe they need training to become a CPA or a lawyer or a banker. This isn't applicable to the fact that they will never make money from the use of their brains, they will still feel better in society as a result than they used to. They are living in a world where they aren't getting paid for it because they don't know anything about education.. And they either won't get jobs or don't want to go back into work. As soon as they decide to give up entirely, they will start blaming themselves for being delayed in pursuing careers instead of having parents helping them. We'll always end up paying for these mistakes too - and before long you will start questioning whether you are really thinking of yourself properly vs., if not not correctly.
