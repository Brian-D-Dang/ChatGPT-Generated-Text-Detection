So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor Skin color does not determine equality or rights under the law. Ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor national origin.
