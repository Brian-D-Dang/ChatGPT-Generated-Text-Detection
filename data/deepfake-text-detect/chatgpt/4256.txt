It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing I think might be important for you guys out there who are thinking on how best to deal with an increasingly Chinese focused world order is a more nuanced way of looking at it. And in this case, I'm talking specifically about what it means to raise a child in China. I heard on NPR recently that they were interviewing experts from around the globe who said that raising kids in China was hard because of the lack of English skills among parents. This struck me as a really interesting take on the issue - especially since it seems like the reason why English is so prized by parents here is because it's such a widely used language. Why would we want to make sure our children don't have access to English? What if we let them learn Mandarin instead? Doesn't this mean we're teaching them less about English than we should be? Well, that's actually sort of true: it turns out that while not everyone has the same level of proficiency (especially once you factor in immigrants) most of us can still speak some basic English. Many immigrant-born Americans speak perfect English - or better! That's probably because many of us grew up speaking English first. So, it's no surprise that raising a kid in America is easier than raising a kid in China. But what happens when your child becomes an adult? Do we start worrying that they couldn't communicate with their peers if they got lost somewhere in the United States, or do we worry that they might struggle to find work back home? The reality is that most adults in the US also get pretty proficient with a variety of different languages, which could partially explain why we've been able to successfully integrate bilingualism into society so well. If you wanted something done quickly though, you'd need someone fluent in Spanish. Or maybe French. But even then, well, good luck finding anyone willing to help you out. With that in mind, I wonder if we could rethink our approach to raising our children abroad? Perhaps having them learn a second language makes sense after all. It may not necessarily help with linguistic skills but I think it will allow them to develop social skills that will give them greater chances to succeed in life. And perhaps as a result, they won't feel so badly about failing miserably at school or being unable to navigate foreign cultures without the internet. What do you think? Should we let our kids speak English until they're old enough to understand subtitles? Is there any other way of teaching kids valuable skills that won't require deep pockets?
