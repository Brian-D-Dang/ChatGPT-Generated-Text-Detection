This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this has not happened. I am not a player and have never played one and have no inclination to play. I have my own issues to deal with and life is too short to be playing games and making enemies. The fact is you can't deal with everyone. You can't make everyone happy and it is futile to try to. I have yet to find a perfect church, pastor, preacher or ministry. I've found a few close, but nothing perfect. Yet I am still part of a church, I still meet with a pastor and I listen to a preacher, who has some quirks that I don't always agree with or like. Yet I have learned to deal with them or not deal with them. They are a part of my life and they have a right to be a part of mine. I have found that the Lord's will for us is to accept those around us as they are. We are to love them and to treat them as they deserve to be treated. We are not to cause division or gossip and we are not to be around those who cause division or gossip. We are to be a part of the church and we are to encourage those around us as best we can. We are to encourage the church, not tear it down. I have found that no matter what we do, we will always have those who judge and are not happy with whatever we do, say, wear or our choice of friends. It's just a part of life. If we are not careful, we can let their judgement and their gossiping get to us and make us unhappy, or we can brush it off and keep on keeping on, knowing we have the Lord on our side. I have learned to deal with it. So can you. "But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin." 1st John 1:7 Labels: CMV, gossip, loving others, playing games When you speak of church, do you mean fellowship, or do you mean a building? Certainly fellowship is important in the Body of Christ, but so is having a church home. I know so many who have been hurt by churches. I don't think there is anything wrong with that, but I do think that they should have the opportunity to go to a church that they know and love, where they feel comfortable, where they feel accepted, and where they feel that they fit in. I know there are a lot of people who claim to be Christians, but they're not. I don't want to be around them, either. That's not playing games, or being judgmental. That's simply being realistic. I don't care how much you love the Lord, or how much you love people, you're still human. You are still going to have times when you are going to be rejected. You are still going to have times when you're going to be hurt by people. There's nothing wrong with that, as long as you don't let it destroy you. If you're always fighting and dealing with other people, it's going to get old. I agree with you. I have met and dealt with a lot of these people. They are sour, bitter and angry and it is a shame to see them. I can't stand them. I wish they would just go away and I am certainly not going to waste my time with them. The problem is we are a people pleaser and don't like to cause strife. There is nothing wrong with not going to a church building. I know some people who do not. I am not one of them, but I do think we have a responsibility to reach out to those around us. Not everyone will like or agree with us and that is fine. We are only to please the Lord, not everyone else. The Bible does say we are to go to church and that we should have fellowship with other believers. I don't think that means just a building, but people. I am sure there are those who have been hurt by a building or a pastor. There are people who have been hurt by a pastor and a fellow believer, a Christian, a brother or sister. But it is something we have to deal with. I wish we could live in a world where everyone was perfect and kind and loving, but we don't. We have to deal with it. There are those
