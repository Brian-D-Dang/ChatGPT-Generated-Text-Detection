Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, so here goes. First of all: the expectation that children will be vaccinated is something we are already doing. It's called school immunization and it happens every year in most places (it would also happen if kids were home-schooled). But this article keeps talking as though parents have no control over whether or not their child gets vaccines; it's like saying you should expect your dog to get to the vet for its annual checkup because there must be some underlying cause other than the fact that you're just giving him shots each month anyway. Second: even allowing for limitations on parental choice, let us assume these restrictions can be avoided to an extent using standard medical practice - which seems unlikely given how many variables could come into play in such a complex matter - then what exactly do we lose? Nothing except possibly a small increase in risk of disease transmission from unvaccinated people who bring diseases back from abroad, although this isn't really relevant since our entire society relies upon continued disease circulation to keep things running smoothly. The real question is "what" does the government gain by forcing everyone else to vaccinate against non-contagious diseases without compensation? Is this one more attempt at implementing a coercive form of socialism? I suspect that much of the opposition stems from religious fundamentalism, particularly among those unable or unwilling to find alternative forms of medicine for themselves, rather than anything having to do with science. Probably quite correctly too! There was once a time when religious beliefs were used to justify governmental interference in politics and social policy based solely on whether or not God said so, but that has largely fallen out of fashion due to the value placed purely on scientific evidence. Although sometimes evidential arguments sound reasonable and convincing until someone finally points out that maybe God doesn't exist after all...
