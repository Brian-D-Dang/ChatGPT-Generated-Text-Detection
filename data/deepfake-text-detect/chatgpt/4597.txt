Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than or different from others. If you're working with binary terms like left and right, it's probably best not to go beyond a certain distance into applying those labels to individuals. Otherwise you risk making an entire side of society seem unduly nationalistic saying something such as "I don't hate Mexicans," for example; then someone will say "You're just another Mexican." The latter statement doesn't simply mean that you shouldn't be allowed to work in Mexico because your loyalty lies there rather than here, but also that you're part of some nebulous group casually defined by nationality alone. To which I would answer: well, yes, maybe at first glance we can all assume these things about one another, but surely we can get past that? You can love yourself without being proud of that fact. As long as individual self-love is confused with nationalism, there'll never be peace on Earth.
