A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but it's the people who are spending their hard-earned dollars that really piss me off. There is the cost associated with renting an actual firework display. Then there is the cost of renting a fire truck for a ride around town while the celebrants watch from their cars. I can see how you could be pissed at all those things, personally. But if they're going out of their way to do something nice and fun just for you, and then charging ridiculous amounts in return? That would make me pretty mad.
