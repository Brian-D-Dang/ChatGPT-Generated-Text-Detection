I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; I am now a Christian, but not as a Christian in any significant manner since I was raised Catholic, which is how it should be treated by many people who identify themselves that way. But I never pictured myself as a communist - not quite sure why, even though I believe freedom does exist - although I want to say I wanted to be known properly as such until recently when I saw the news reports about the movement being infiltrated with radicalizing groups such as Hamas. That said, at some point I looked into it further because I see the divide between religionspeople on social media like Twitter and Facebook more than elsewhere has begun to become apparent again. So, what happened? Did I offend anyone or do anything wrong then? Or did I just spread misinformation widely enough so it didn't matter much if it broke any laws? Who knows! I suppose my personal belief system may be flawed let alone my political views, but shouldn't this make me an anti-Semite too? Christianity is a religion of peace - but not everyone agrees with it. I know there are those within Christianity who don't agree with it either - including anti-Christians like Jesus himself - and yet they still believe Christians must pay attention to the teachings of Jesus Christ. They can argue over whether or not Jesus said evil things during his time or how sinners ought to behave toward others. But these arguments fall on deaf ears without a single mention of Jesus' teachings. The difference here isn't necessarily religious beliefs versus different opinions-there's plenty of difference between them. Both sides were crucified waiting to commit mass murder before Christ died - many of which happened under Christ. Christianity is definitely not anti-Semitic - right now there aren't many Jews around - just because there wasn't very many transgressors doesn't mean it couldn't happen today. Christianity however, as the world learns from Jesus' death, falls short both emotionally and politically. Christianity teaches that forgiveness is necessary for humanity as well as essential to salvation (!). Jesus declared: "You shall love your neighbor as yourselfanother message that rings true every day among Christians worldwide. While our enemies dismiss Christianity as having no redeeming value according to their own values compared to religion, Christians continue to follow Jesus' example with great zeal while condemning evil spirits wherever they might lead us unprompted. Christianity also encourages conformity through its doctrines regarding marriage equality. All Christians need to learn from Jesus Christ about dealing with believers, especially those who disagree socially rather than morally. And let's face it, Church leaders everywhere would prefer us all to take Christianity seriously instead of just letting it off the hook completely. A few years ago, I took a group trip to Jerusalem where many Christians gathered together to celebrate the Feast of the Unleavened Bread. My friend and I discussed whether or not we were moral, immoral, irreligious, ignorant, or Godless.... Even most Christians seem to have little understanding of the value of Jesus Christ itself. How can we explain Christian civilization with this list? What do you think atheists really stand for, especially when the Church is teaching that there is nothing wrong with loving one another equally? Are your churches broken down or intentionally dividing families apart after all they preach about? Our society needs to understand our society better sooner rather than later, once and for all....a never ending battle against biblical dogma will only bring suffering to those seeking salvation...saying something good about Christianity won't help anyone except those living on earth trying desperately to survive!
