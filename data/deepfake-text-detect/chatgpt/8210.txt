(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge the court. After all, it's their system and they are entitled too do whatever makes sense for them (which can be confusing at times when you think about but oh well). This answer was inspired by a comment from hadi already given which does contain alot of valuable information so credit where its due!
