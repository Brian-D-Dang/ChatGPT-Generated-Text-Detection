First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces the user to respond and post on reddit In step one it's obvious why people vote down things they don't like (Which is fine). But with step 2 you have much more control over what gets posted as well as how other users feel about your opinions on certain topics. I'm sure most of us who use randroid know that there are days where we find our app suggestions annoying or even made for reasons other than usability. So I'd just like to rant about finding something else instead of answering through all those noise posts. If an android forum isn't better at handling these types of requests then you can always try twitter (AskAndroid), Google groups, Facebook (ish sites such as rGooglePlus, ) etc. However none of them really cater specifically for App Suggestions so if someone frequently asks questions related to apps specific issues, drama, stories etc. they should consider posting it here:) Anyway enough from my opinion because there are many good points being brought up by different posters, i'll link some links below to help get started... An issue which affects almost every program on Android - "How do I uninstall?" Without giving too much away people often ask developers "how" when asking how to remove their own applications once installed. This article aims to explain how you can easily organise and manage your application folders! When installing any new software, be it games, social media programs, chat clients, productivity suites, utilities, music players, browsers or whatever; before long, developers will put themselves into either one of three categories: The majority of Android users install and update apps using default tools under various circumstances and run into problems due to lack of knowledge regarding file systems and storage space management. In order to solve potential issues arising during the installation process, each developer has created unique instructions and methods varying greatly between each other,"A PC Magazine Article," published 23 March 2012.3 A survey conducted on 592 students participating in courses offered by five universities around the United States found that only 14 knew exactly how to handle temporary files generated by modern operating systems while an additional 34 were not aware that temp files are stored anywhere?2 As with Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and iOS 4.0 above, on Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) Microsoft fixed the problem introduced in SP3 (and also SP2): Instead of storing temporary data files directly inside AppData, Microsoft now stores them in sub-directories according to whether the temporary directory was set via Explorer default settings, per-user profile preferences, Group Policy settings or individual registry paths.4 It hasn't been updated since June 2010 though....which makes sense seeing as 5 months back in December 2009 was when Android Gingerbread first hit store shelves. However thankfully there seems to be no end to the improvements confirmed to come after Android Ice Cream Sandwich?! Hopefully sooner rather than later, eh!? So last week alpha testers finally got their hands on Jelly Bean aka build number JWR66Y. Users lucky enough to already receive OTA updates previously now have access to a newer version of Android running on hardware manufactured by LG Electronics Inc.. With beta releases taking place earlier this month, the world's second largest smartphone manufacturer might seem outclassed compared to its global competitor AppleInc., however thanks to strong sales combined with tough competition SamsungMobile Co Ltd has managed to grab third spot yet again with nearly 50 million Galaxy S II units shipped in 2012 alone.1 Unfortunately for the rest of us waiting patiently at home, there's no definite date available yet as to when consumers can expect their shiny brand new device to arrive. Of course sometimes manufacturers prioritize costs over quality to ensure faster production times, hence the reason we haven't seen JellyBean pop up on existing devices for quite sometime! Another aspect that could hinder the release schedule is delays caused by carrier approval processes just like HTC recently experienced with One Max 2G's launch day being pushed back until mid April 2013. Nevertheless over 7 hours ago Samsung released Build WLGTQPOCF (AKA WTF?) - 979MB - [Jelly Bean] for rooted GSM Nexus models although sadly PHONEDEV didn't provide details on when said ROM would become available. Build WLGTQPUCH (948 MB) was released for Verizon variants in the past few weeks. Also beginning today (April 3rd) Sprint reported to be rolling out builds for both new existing customers following yesterday's announcement of a nationwide LTE network. Unfortunately neither company provided further information on availability dates or download sizes for their respective releases. Oh Snap!, oh snap indeed!.etc...]!
