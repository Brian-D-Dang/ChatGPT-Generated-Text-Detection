By "practical reason," I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election. I admit , we don't know yet whether this kind of reasoning is really true or not - but it's worth looking into nonetheless... Our political system works better when at least some people are self-aware enough to recognize their own imperfections and to be honest with themselves about what they're doing in order to help improve things for everyone. Otherwise our current democracy gets bogged down in politics; instead of being good citizens who actively participate in making changes for society's benefit, most Americans just take the easy way out of participating in the democratic process because they aren't sure if they agree with everything that's going on around them. They choose not to participate out of fear (and rightly so!) because too many of us feel like people simply can't do anything right no matter how much we try! We all need a little encouragement from time to time especially since it seems as though there isn't any major progress being made towards achieving equality. Unfortunately, many young voters lack hope that they will ever have any real say in government or even in America itself. This is why it's important to develop positive attitudes toward our country and its future. Whether through volunteering, attending rallies, or even taking selfies to show others your support, there is nothing wrong with trying something new. The whole point is to get excited about the fact that you might actually make a difference someday.
