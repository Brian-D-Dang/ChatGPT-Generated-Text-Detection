In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals , temperature or give warnings about danger. This is a common practice in other countries such as New Zealand where it is considered justifiable if you have one for over five years or twelve months. I have lived in NZ with my dogs for ten years (two of which were bred by me) so this was not an issue until lately when they introduced 'humane' slaughter laws. At present you can legally keep wild cats trapped in cages and wait up to three days before having your dog slaughtered. The law has been controversial here but no one would dream of doing what those who do business in these conditions get away with; selling live animals at cheaper rates and mass producing pups within hours! There's nothing humane about that, does that make any sense? This double standards approach doesn't sit well with us Brits either. So why should we accept less protection for our beloved companions than livestock? Isn't compassion towards all living things equally important? It seems only fair that non-human beings enjoy some quality of life comparable to humans: it's not necessary if we don't actually need them. But we love our furry friends right now, most people will never go into a shop to buy meat again once they know how the food chain works, yet we happily eat chicken nuggets without thinking twice. Why? Because they're produced efficiently, quickly and cheaply. Cruelty free chicken nugget production usually involves raising chickens crammed together on tiny run-down sheds and blasted full of chemicals and pesticides. They're kept alive artificially by feeding them antibiotics - just think of all the superbugs breeding inside each bird. Ingesting these creatures makes us feel good because they look pretty...but morally speaking there's something very wrong with that scenario. We also believe good health to be essential and great news that the World Health Organisation declared death due to smoking last year, down 30 since 2001, while worldwide tobacco use still went straight through the roof! Is there anything more disgusting than a cigarette butt ground underfoot? And could you imagine eating a lungful like that?! We are calling out the hypocrisy of those who exploit others whilst comparing themselves favourably let alone better and expecting everyone else to support them. When it comes to animal welfare, we expect businesses to provide humane treatment for living species, not treat them cruelly and kill them off at low cost and high volume. Animals of different types exist for different reasons. Dogs and Cats are sentient species who share the planet with us - they deserve far greater respect.
