So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion. The "in your face" meta has been turning off people since S3 and likely wont get much better than that. At least it could be a start at some point (like most things on reddit) It's already a thing:p
