I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually already been raised with a sense of entitlement and superiority, so they're more likely than not going into upper class families that can afford them in general anyway (which negates much if no all their educational benefits). The people I've known on both sides were just as intelligent or less without lessons but instead had strong self motivation which carried over later life too for those whose parents didn't attempt brainwashing at home due diligence..
