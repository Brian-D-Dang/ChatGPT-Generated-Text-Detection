Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as being an outlet for news, it's not technically clickbait because there are actual legit articles on the site to qualify themselves under this category (as opposed to how Tumblr is labeled). Black people don't date white women! White women only want black men! shakes head But doesn't it say something like "black guys only"?
