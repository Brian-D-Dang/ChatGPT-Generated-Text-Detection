I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past events, it is clear that the USA values military power and is willing to use it in extreme ways if necessary. Additionally, the USA has a very strong military presence around the world and is involved in many conflicts and peacekeeping missions. This indicates that the country sees itself as a leader in global security and stability. Finally, the USA spends a significant portion of its budget on defense and military research, further reinforcing its commitment to maintaining its military strength.
