First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from a public safety standpoint. If you had to walk across a crowded street with all kinds of people and cars zipping by then it would be irresponsible in my opinion. I thought about the same thing but decided against it...I'll just have to plan on being late or skip that one
