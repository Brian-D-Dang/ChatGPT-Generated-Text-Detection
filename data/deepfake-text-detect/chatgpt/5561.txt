Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women on [X] I always think "It's like the school bullies trying to recruit a new member for their club." But they don't realise they're being bullies and are being percieved as bullies. Why are people so obsessed with getting more women into [X]? I don't know why. I think I have a clue why they want more women in science, but it's too long to post here. There are more women than men, so it's not like they're trying to get more women into something that they can't get into anyway. The simple fact that they are trying to increase the number of women in a certain field, means that they think that women are somehow excluded from it. It's very obnoxious, it's very presumptuous, it's very elitist, it's very exclusive. And it's not like it's the women who are trying to increase the number of women in [X] - it's some [X] group who think that [X] is a male preserve. I know I'm gonna get hate for this, but I'm an atheist, so why does this bother me? I know why it bothers me. Because I think that women are every bit as intelligent as men. In fact, I'm pretty sure that women are more intelligent than men in general. I think women are every bit as able as men in every field. And I think that there are many fields in which women have done, and continue to do, far better than men. But I also think that the reason that men have been able to perform so well in certain fields is because of the fact that they have been allowed to do so. And if men are so great at those fields, why not let them do the best that they can do? Why should women be given a chance at anything that they can't do? I'm not sure why I'm so bothered by it. I think I am because I think women are being excluded from something they are capable of, by some small number of elitists who feel that men are somehow better suited to a field than they are. I also have a problem with trying to get more women into [X] because of the fact that I think it's a very exclusionary thing to do. Because it's saying that women are inferior. Which they aren't. I know people will take this as anti-feminism. But it's not. It's anti-discrimination. I have no problem with women being recruited into any field. But I have a problem with them being recruited into a field because they are women. I think that women are better off being allowed to do everything that they can do, rather than being restricted to do what men can do, because they think that they are somehow better at it.
