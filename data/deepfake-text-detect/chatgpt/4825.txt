I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several rescues in my family tree (one of which was the one who saved me from drowning). They're all great dogs but none of us want to be faced with that decision again! What is funny about this story? That it's true!! When we bought our first house here two years ago I did not realize there were so many Hounds in town and even though we live on a street where some families keep their dogs tied up while they walk, when we moved into our new neighborhood, I started seeing more than just those neighborsthey were everywhere! If any of these Hounds had been loose before moving day, I would NOT have lived in the property because THEY ARE TERRIFYING!!! It is very dangerous having ALL OF THEM OUT at once as it really scares those with small children or elderly folks around. And if someone gets hurt by a large dog running out onto the road...well, let's just say things could get ugly quickly. We don't see anyone walking down the streets without leashes anymore now that we've discovered how much danger that poses. But then we saw Maggie go missing last week......now what will happen??????
