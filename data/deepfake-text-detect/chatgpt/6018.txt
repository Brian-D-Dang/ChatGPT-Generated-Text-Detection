Scientists widely accept that climate change is real. Consequently, they say that it will lead to extreme weather, a raise in the sea level, increased acidity of the ocean, reduced growth of forest and plants and decreased ocean fisheries. However, some people are not convinced that climate change is real and that it is caused by humans. As a result, they question if climate change is happening. Climate change can be explained by humans, who are now responsible for the majority of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is also clear that global warming has happened over the last 100 years. Scientists also believe that the Earth is in a natural 100,000 year cycle of warming and cooling. This natural cycle has been interrupted by the amount of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, emitted into the atmosphere by man. Scientists say that the temperature rise of the Earth has been the fastest in 200 years. The most important thing for people to do is to understand that global warming is real. It is caused by human activity and the only way to solve the problem is to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If we do not take steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases, the Earth will continue to warm. This will cause the sea level to rise and the polar ice caps to melt. This will cause major problems for people in low-lying coastal areas, like Bangladesh, Egypt, and the Maldives. The Earth has warmed by 1.3 degrees F (0.7 degrees C) over the last 100 years. This is largely due to the burning of fossil fuels. Since the Industrial Revolution began in the 1800s, the human population has increased from 1.6 billion to 6.6 billion. Most of the population live in cities where the amount of carbon dioxide is higher than in the countryside. The amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased by 25 percent over the last 50 years. This has caused the average temperature to rise by 1.4 degrees F (0.8 degrees C). The United States is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. The United States has 5 percent of the world's population and produces 25 percent of the greenhouse gases. Europe and Japan are also major emitters of greenhouse gases. In addition to the temperature rise, the climate has changed in other ways. The amount of rainfall has changed. For example, there is less rain in the northern hemisphere and more rain in the southern hemisphere. The amount of rainfall has also changed in individual countries. The amount of rainfall in Canada is expected to increase by 25 percent in the next 50 years. At the same time, the amount of rainfall in the United States is expected to decrease by 10 percent. In Africa, rainfall is expected to decrease in western Africa and increase in eastern Africa. The amount of rainfall in Asia is expected to decrease in the Himalayas and increase in southern Asia. The amount of ice on the North Pole and the South Pole is also changing. The average amount of ice on the North Pole is 5 million square miles. The average ice coverage is 22 percent. It is decreasing by 8 percent every decade. The amount of ice on the South Pole is 2.4 million square miles. The average ice coverage is 70 percent. It is decreasing by 2 percent every decade. Scientists predict that by 2100 the North Pole will be ice free. The South Pole may also be ice free by 2100. The loss of the ice caps will lead to the ocean level to rise by 20 feet. This will lead to the destruction of coastal cities like New York, Shanghai, and New Orleans. The oceans are also changing. The average temperature of the ocean is expected to increase by 2 degrees F (1 degree C) over the next 50 years. This will cause the ocean to expand by 4 to 6 inches. Scientists predict that the ocean level will rise by 20 feet. This will cause the destruction of coastal cities like New York, Shanghai, and New Orleans. The acidity of the ocean is also changing. Scientists expect the acidity to increase by 100 percent over the next 100 years. The acidity is mainly caused by carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. The acidity of the ocean will decrease the growth of coral reefs and cause the death of many fish. The warming of the planet
