A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a .22 caliber pistol that her father had handed to him over the counter in order for this man who didn't know any better, he gave it into his care not knowing what kind of person would get them out on such an excursion without checking first whether they knew how shoot or were properly trained as required by law before allowing someone else use their firearms like something some people play with video games instead off having responsibility towards those guns perhaps even more dangerous than swatting flys around your living room! The guy got away free because she's underage (her dad never reported anything) but if I ever met up again after breaking my foot while running across town one night so fast i ran right smack dab onto cement sidewalk pavement; This is exactly why we don't allow kids shooting rifles until age 15 unless you are legally blind which has nothing whatsoever do about safety except possible secondary loss when aiming down sights, simply put have tons training practice along side all other responsible adults accordingly too learn safe handling practices especially regarding recoil impulse since lead bullets tend be very strong propellants thus sometimes kicking harder then larger calibers.. If only Uncle Bill could smoke weed during most hunting seasons...
