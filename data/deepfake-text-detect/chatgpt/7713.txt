Actually, the slutstud inequality is not generally justified. It perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and double standards. The term "slut" is often used to shame and judge women for being sexually active, while men who engage in similar behavior are praised and called "studs." This reinforces the idea that men are supposed to be sexually assertive and dominant, while women are supposed to be passive and chaste. This harmful inequality can have serious consequences, including the perpetuation of rape culture and sexual harassment. In a truly equal society, people of all genders should be free to express their sexuality without fear of judgment or retribution.
