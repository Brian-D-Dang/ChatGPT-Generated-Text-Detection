I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. In San Pellegrino, there are few choices available: banana bread and eggplant pizza with avocado toast in the corner, pork loaves of pasta made to order on the side instead of pasta salad when options seem sparse or the stuffed tomatoes in bed ready to be eaten at bedtime every night; a stack of sheets on the couch outside a window pane near the kitchen door that can be shutters closed by herself without anyone noticing her; a drawer full of books scattered across the desk where she comes home after work each morning looking out the window up close; and even a drawer filled with sushi rolls for drinks on the refrigerator door handle alongside the coffee table next to her bedside table. There is nothing like a cup of coffee waiting inside your cabinet from the kitchen countertop wake-up call, if you know what I mean! My favorite part about San Pellegrino, however, was the kitchen alone - the kitchen sink tasting room where dishes come and go. I am definitely recommending San Pellegrino as a great place to cook dinner over coffee because it has something for everyone, from fancy-looking dishes like strawberry poppy seed cake with jalapeno sauce to simple desserts like strawberries and cream cheese cheesecake topped with cinnamon raisin glaze. It's also worth noting that San Pellegrino offers free wifi throughout the day so that anyone who doesn't want to pay 8 for Wi-Fi access will have access no matter how tired they may be during the weekdays. San Pellegrino sits right beside two of my favorite places in town: The Flatiron Cafe with its rustic interior ambiance and cozy atmosphere; the Hawaiian Cafe with just enough amenities to give you time to relax while enjoying freshly baked omelette; and The Happy Hour Coffee Shop featuring locally roasted coffee beans served up fresh daily including bacon tacos made from scratch using local produce sourced entirely from our local farmers markets along with local meats, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, berries and meats grown in our backyard. The best way to experience San Pellegrino without leaving home though is through the company of friends we meet here monthly. Our regulars are all foodies themselves who enjoy the unique flavors and treats that San Pellegrino serves up. Like any good neighborhood cafe, there are plenty of options such as a wide selection of sandwiches, salads, soups and pastries placed around the clock to satisfy both guests and regulars alike. There aren't quite enough options nearby to get everything you need for breakfast everyday these days. One of San Pellegrino's most popular services include The Pizzeria and Pub that delivers pizzas and sandwiches delivered directly to your doorstep. The menu includes homemade pizzas, homemade ice creams, vegan gourmet cakes, lattes and more delicious options that taste amazing. Our favorite thing about San Pellegrino is that it has a full bar designed specifically for pizza lovers who prefer small plates rather than large meals hosted outdoors. While San Pellegrino does offer catering for family gatherings, you'll find plenty other activities too including a pool party, an afternoon tea party taught by chef Benjamin Levy, kids' games nights and more. If you're coming back to San Pellegrino for a visit, be sure not to miss out on the amazing local seafood and vegetarian options offered weekly. Best of all, San Pellegrino's pizzeria is open until 11 p.m., making putting away pots take less time then staying overnight if necessary. There is no better feeling than being able to eat brunch every Sunday evening before heading downstairs to San Pellegrino for dinner. I always recommend giving San Pellegrino brunch a try since brunch isn't only served throughout the day long weekend mornings - you could stay overnight there anytime between 3pm-5am!
