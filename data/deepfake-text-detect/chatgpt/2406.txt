You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the opportunity for people who use this phrase every day (i.e., all of my friends) to be corrected on their misuse! Apples are rounder than orange because they grow around an apple tree which makes them spherical. Oranges have seeds inside so you can't eat just one part without feeling uncomfortable.
