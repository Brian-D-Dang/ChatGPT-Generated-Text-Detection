(A) Work part-time in high school; Then go to college (B) Work full-time before you go to college (C) Work while you study in college. I was a spoiled lazy brat who knows nothing but wants everything at once, and thought the world would revolve around me that's why I like shopping so much... I know it sounds selfish, but then again this is just my opinion after all! It has been fun though because some of them were relieved to see that we really are normal people with friends on Facebook haha! Some girls even apologized for having such meanies....but hey! They've got to learn sometime right? Haha hands out candy gives y'all an apple: "This is from the goody bag!":p it doesn't sound selfish at ALL!!! i think most teenagers act this way when they get into their teens..i did too! i'm glad your life seems to be going well now:) hmmmmm what kind of stuff do u like to shop for??
