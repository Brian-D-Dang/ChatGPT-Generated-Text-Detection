To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting into college, I understand the math requirements and what to expect from a high-school degree (it does not matter if you have the basics in mathematics or not). I know this question might be a bit of an exaggeration but it could well be true in high school as well. The math required for passing HS would definitely make your SATACT score even higher than that! So trying to determine how many years of education will make a difference here isn't really accurate.
