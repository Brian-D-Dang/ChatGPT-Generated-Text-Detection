So first of I am danish. That means that I follow american politics, much in the same way I follow german politics. Somethings are importent for me and my situation, but some things I dont really care about. One of the most important issues for me is the economy. It affects my country and my own livelihood, so I pay close attention to the policies related to taxes, trade, infrastructure, and regulation. I also follow the news on foreign policy, national security, immigration, and other global issues that may have an impact on Denmark. Other topics of interest include civil rights, LGBT rights, women's rights, education, healthcare, and environmental protection. These are all areas where I believe the US could improve upon and I often look to American leaders for guidance in these matters. I'm also interested in the culture of the United States, from its music and art scene to its sports and entertainment. I often find myself marveling at the creativity and innovation coming out of the US and how it has come to define the modern world.
