Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as they can afford it. How does one go about doing this? Where is the best place to learn more about managing my money better and learning how much taxes will cost me for each salary bracket? Oh man that would be awesome if we could teach kids personal finances at school! That's totally something i'd like to see happen
