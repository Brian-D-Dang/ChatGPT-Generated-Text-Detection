Edit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) This isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a little bit aware of the environmental impact and the ethics of hunting for food. It is important to recognize that hunting for food can be a sustainable and responsible way to source meat. However, it is crucial to do it in a way that does not harm the environment or exploit animals. Hunters should follow regulations and guidelines set by their local government and conservation organizations to ensure that they are not hunting endangered species or over-harvesting. They should also follow ethical hunting practices, such as avoiding unnecessary cruelty and taking only what is needed. Additionally, it is important to consider the impact of personal choices on the environment and animal welfare. Supporting sustainable and ethical sources of meat, such as local farmers and ranchers who prioritize animal welfare and environmental stewardship, can be a positive way to ensure that one's dietary choices align with their values.
