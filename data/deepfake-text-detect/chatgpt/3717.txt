I recently discovered rAnglish. Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots. The result is a language that not only sounds unique but also connects us to our linguistic roots. rAnglish (or refined Anglish) takes this concept a step further by modernizing the language and eliminating any non-Germanic words. It can be an interesting and challenging language to learn or experiment with!
