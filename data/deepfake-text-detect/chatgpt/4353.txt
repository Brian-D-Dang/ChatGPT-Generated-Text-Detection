I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be good or bad for example. Morality has nothing to do with the sovereign authority of one person acting in a particular way; there are no laws, rules, or morals dictated by the majority of people.
