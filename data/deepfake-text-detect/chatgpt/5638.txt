Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I don't want at my party. So, what do I do? Think of people that are in my group of friends that won't be able to come to the party if they are invited but will if they are plus ones. Then I would invite them. This is a great idea, but I can't think of any people who aren't in my friend group. I guess you could say, "If you're plus one, we're inviting you. If you're not plus one, we're not inviting you." Good point. It's not exactly a party for everyone, but it would be fun to invite them.
