I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to tell them apart from each other. That leaves the question of whether or not we've been living through a revolution! There are many theories about how ancient elements came into being, including the idea that there was some kind of tidal wave caused by the meteoroid impact because [Unpentium], [NT] appears to have been formed before [UT]. But now it seems that [UNP] may be the source of the 'principal' element, which has been linked with the lightning bolt finding its way around the earth rather than being actually created by lightning striking the sun (which seems unlikely). This could mean the Earth is struggling with heat fluxes causing the Earth changes over time - although this can't exactly be explained by an earthquake occurring suddenly out of nowhere, so perhaps the sun became trapped inside of Earth due to a comet landing on the asteroid belt like earthquakes later discovered in the past century? Another theory for the origin of the solar system is that of the gravitational pull between Saturn and Uranus - Venus originated earlier than previously thought; this might explain why Venus had a smaller gravity (compared to Saturn) during some periods of its history compared to other planets. All these theories seem plausible, except for the possibility that we're only experiencing another erupting planet at this moment since 'the asteroid belt', which we still don't know much about. The planetary systems hypothesis suggests that many more planets existed prior to our existence: such as Jupiter's moons and asteroids orbiting Neptune and Saturn! So interesting stuff!
