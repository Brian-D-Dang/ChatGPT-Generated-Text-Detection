Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between the poor. In reality though it's a disaster of epic proportions as each socialist regime ends with executions to murder dissenters (ostensibly), severe poverty for most citizens coupled by starvation wages or even slavery iof those who can't work due lack o resources leading us back towards feudal times when serfs were slaves not workers yet still had families that depended on them being able too support their family so they didn't revolt like this one did: https:en-gb...lemayor). The only way socialism could ever be successful long term without civil unrest every time you decide people have enough wealth after taking from someone else was if we all became robots hell bent solely upon producing what others wanted but then again wouldn' t life get boring? With communism at least some semblance comforts exist because nobody gets anything unless everybody does which means cheap food - however housing comes expensive since absolutely everything must meet state minimum standards meaning very little opportunity exists outside certain areas near major cities etc.. And women doni' know how many other problems arise here such issues include nuclear waste disposal! What do I mean?! The Soviet Union dumped numerous tons uranium mining residues into rivers over decades until mid 1980thies causing levels dangerous today!. Even now Russia dumps radioactive water containing cancerous isotopes directly onto forest floor killing wildlife!! Yet governments allow these corporations free reign!!! Surely somebody has got something wrong somewhere???. To make matters worse; instead off using landfills humans bury things underground - the main problem isnit radium leaks out secondarily contaminating groundwater supplies??? At another place toxic coal ash deposits lie piled around 100 feet high posing danger 24 hours 7 days per week 365 day annualy while local government looks away doing nothing about hazardous wastes including lead dust poisoning nearby residents![1].
