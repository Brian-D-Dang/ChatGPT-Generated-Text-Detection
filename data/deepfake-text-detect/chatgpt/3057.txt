It is well known that the old testament refers to homosexuality as "an abomination." However, most christians do not believe in the applicability of Old Testament rules to the modern life. Biblical scholar clearly says otherwise: In fact it's quite clear from archaeology and linguistics what was common and accepted among ancient peoples (like the Greeks 2,000 years ago). The Bible is an evolving document; written by people who were influenced by the societies they lived in at the time.
