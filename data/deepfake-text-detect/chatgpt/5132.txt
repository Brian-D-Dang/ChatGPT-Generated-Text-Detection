I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for a nonviolent offense, why would anyone expect him or her not to be convicted? And this is why I think it's impossible that he shouldn't get parole so quickly after completing such an extensive incarceration sentence. If you've ever seen the video clip where Tucker Carlson asked what type of prisoner he'd be sentenced to then you know the answer perfectly well enough: Prisoner of War. Why are we blaming Tucker Carlson for being condemned by a criminal justice system which mistreats prisoners while treating criminals like criminals when all they did was make fun at Tucker Carlson for his absurdity and delusions?
