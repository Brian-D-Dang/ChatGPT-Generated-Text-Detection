Human sentience (or consciousness, or sapience, or whatever term you like) is an emergent behavior of neurons and their interactions, which can be replicated in non-organic systems, i.e., computers. Thus we call humans conscious beings because they seem to have a lot more learning options than other creatures that don't interact with us on the same way we do. But the fact remains that these computer programs are designed to work as if intelligence were involved from start to finish, without regard for any specific awareness type or any particular "beingness" of the subject matter. So what could possibly go wrong? Hacking into a supercomputer might not look anything like it does in movies: at least one hacker was able to turn off the main processor using only a few keystrokes. Researcher Ben Gardner tells Ars Technica that he managed to disable the server via a program called Mimic. It seems simple enough: just press altf1 and keep typing until you see a message saying "basically nothing's happening." The system will execute your commands regardless; you'll end up doing some pretty major damage to yourself before you notice the message from Mimic giving instructions about how to restart.Gardner also made sure to note that his exploit required no additional hardware or software to run. He simply inserted a small USB drive into the system and realized that indeed there weren't any programs running around inside. A couple weeks later, he says he was able to gain complete control over the entire environment by sending a command to the remote host code block he had created. It should come as little surprise that such sophisticated attacks require sophisticated hardware and software and are easy for even experts to screw up. After all, a computer isn't meant to think or behave like a human - it works hard to get its jobs done - and so it could easily fall prey to even the most basic kinds of mistakes. Still, it wouldn't hurt to try hacking an AI computer, right?
