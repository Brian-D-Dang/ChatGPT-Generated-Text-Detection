Hi CMV! A recent post on AskReddit about homosexuality and pedophilia being a choice or not led me to this thought that BOTH homosexuality and heterosexuality are choice made by the people. I hope you don't mind if i share my thoughts here, since some of them may be related;). It is almost impossible for us humans nowadays (at least in modern societies) NOT make our choices based upon what we get from societyculture as well 'as life experience'. All these things mess up with how WE see ourselves perceive other members around US; And it seems like many times they lead directly towards either choosing homosexual behavior OR heterosexual one too.. Some choose same sex because their family has no male figure when growing-up plus have been through much suffering due having gay uncle etc., while others decide later after finding themselves fallen love very quickly at first sight... They think "hey he really loves ME" but then find out HE starts falling more deeply into relationship than anyone else before him so naturally feel attracted sexually which eventually leads straight away toward married status without any doubt whatsoever whether those feelings will last forever? That makes sense right?? Wrong!! This could possibly work wonders only IF there was happily ever afterwards kind off situation - even though logically speaking such thing can never exist anyway between two opposite sexes except maybe 10 who met accidentally coming back home drunk together late night just happen getting lucky.. But let's leave aside all practical issues: human nature doesn't allow anything different - especially something seemingly magical happening suddenly during puberty phase:P. We did know however changes take time sometimes AND next day feels totally differently So now regarding why do both ends go against eachother?: Well obviously most homo sapiens would say God created man woman unique way specifically meant ONLY FOR THEM TOGETHER making natural attraction physical differentiation part necessary feature ... BUT THEN AGAIN IT IS WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT FEELING OF LOVE IN THEIR OWN WAY!!! What does science propose? Modify brain chemistry somehow:)?! Ok sure YOU CANNOT CHANGE GENDER, neither your sexuality nor whomsoever partner yet still definitely help yourself live happier better emotional condition! You should change YOUR PERSPECTIVE rather;) Rather accepting reality instead reactionary feeling (s)! For example start believing deep down inside "If GOD didn'nt want men loving women" He wouldn0 t HAVE given creation MALE genitalia!! Look closely... There ain'l nothing wrong w ith intersexed person abusing drugs needles trying altering chemicals body parts.... Right"? Nature gives machines full range ability including drastic ones used constantly forming mountains 8D The fact biological machine named Homosexual Individual exists simply proves another point altogether... Those individuals biologically use ciphers available within theirs bodies chemical makeup thereby allowing sexual relations outside traditional norms where spontaneous desire pop ups unexpectedly...... Science cannot explain everything 100 truthfully therefore must create theories explaining various phenomena occurring every single second hence guessing laws governing microscopic particles existence..... However explanation theory itself might prove its self unreliable under certain circumstances.... Scientists needn'tt look farther THAN NATURE RIGHT HERE ALREADY!!!!
