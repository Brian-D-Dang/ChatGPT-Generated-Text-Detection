One counter-argument to this opinion could be that introducing xe or other gender neutral pronouns would actually complicate the English language even further, making it more difficult for people to understand and use. English already has a relatively complex system of pronouns, and introducing new pronouns could create confusion and misunderstanding, particularly for those who are not familiar with the new terminology. Additionally, enforcing the use of gender neutral pronouns could be unsupported by many speakers who might not agree with the idea that pronouns are gendered, which could lead to significant resistance and pushback against the idea. Therefore, rather than introducing new gender-neutral pronouns, it might be more effective to work on changing the societal belief systems that perpetuate oppressive language practices.
