Personally, I'm not religious, so I guess I'm trying to get some insight here. Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything against any law of nature (which includes religion). How would this make you feel? Would you be happy that God has power over even the people who worship him and those who don't? Religion is nothing more than an idea a belief system based on emotion tied directly to a person or persons. People can believe whatever they want if they're comfortable with themselves, but I'd bet that most of us wouldn't like being put on display for everyone else all the time either, no matter how many stars we have above our heads.
