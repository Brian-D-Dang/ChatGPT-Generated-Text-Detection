So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor the end result is that it's impossible for them to be racist against whites or anyone else? Is there something missing here that makes reverse racism so non-existent in America as opposed to other places like South Africa where black people are oppressed a lot but they don't necessarily have access to housing or jobs unless you want to call that discrimination too? Reverse racism doesn't exist in America anymore than it did in South Africa. If you look at any statistics, blacks and whites live together peacefully without incident - apart from gang violence.
