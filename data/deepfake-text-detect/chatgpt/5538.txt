The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it's usually forgotten after the matter is resolved. The distinction is this: even if abortion is wrong, and even if we're wrong to allow it in the first place, you are morally justified in aborting your child if doing so is the least immoral action. Following the abortion debate, I have seen a number of examples of this. "It's wrong to kill babies, but it's right to kill criminals!" "It's wrong to kill babies, but it's right to kill terrorists!" "It's wrong to kill babies, but it's right to kill Nazis!" "It's wrong to kill babies, but it's right to kill genocidal maniacs!" "It's wrong to kill babies, but it's right to kill insurgents!" There are, of course, a number of problems with this line of reasoning. For starters, it makes no sense to compare killing babies to killing a criminal or a terrorist or a Nazi. Even if we grant that they are all bad and evil, it's not a binary thing like the abortion debate. It's not black and white, or all-or-nothing, where if you're bad, you're bad, and if you're not, you're not. People can be a little bad, or a lot bad, or as bad as one can be. It's a matter of degree, and it's not the same as the abortion debate, where a human being either has or hasn't been born, and morally it's a black-or-white thing. That's not to say that I agree with those who say that killing babies is right, but I'm pointing out the distinction, here. Second, it brings up the problem that there's no reason to say that babies are intrinsically more valuable than criminals, terrorists, Nazis, or the like. If we're going to make value judgments, we need to justify them. I'm not sure I'm going to go anywhere with that, though, because I don't think value judgments are particularly helpful in this context. Lastly, and most importantly, it assumes that babies, or unborn human beings, are the same as criminals, or Nazis, or terrorists, or whatever else. As I said, it's not a binary thing. We can't say that it's morally acceptable to kill criminals, or terrorists, or Nazis, but it's wrong to kill babies, because they are all bad, and, thus, killing them is wrong. It is a human being we're talking about, not a Nazi. There are huge differences in the moral status of a human being and a Nazi, even if both are, in one way or another, bad. If we're going to argue that killing babies is wrong, we're going to have to come up with reasons that fit the situation. We can't just say that it's wrong to kill babies, and then argue that it's wrong to kill criminals, or terrorists, or Nazis, or whatever, because doing so only muddies the issue. I will point out that this isn't exactly an academic exercise. It's important to understand this distinction, as I've said. It's important that we understand the difference between morality and legality, between right and wrong, and between a human being and a terrorist. We can't just throw around the word "terrorist" without understanding its implications. I'm not saying that we have to condone killing a terrorist, but that we have to understand what it means when we say that killing a terrorist is morally wrong, and what it means when we say that it's morally wrong to kill a human being. I'm not sure I did that very well, so I welcome any comments. Labels: abortion, morality, politics Wherein I make some observations about a story I read. I read a story about a state legislator who was attempting to introduce a bill that would make it illegal to film people in sexually explicit situations without their permission. The story was, of course, from the Associated Press, so I'm not entirely sure what the motivation behind the bill was. Apparently,
