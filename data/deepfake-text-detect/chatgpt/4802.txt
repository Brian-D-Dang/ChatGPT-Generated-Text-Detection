I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the idea. The first thing I'd like to point out is that there are two kinds of people in this world: People with strong immune systems (mostly children) and those without. When you have an autoimmune disease or acute infection your body doesn't understand why it should do anything at all unless someone tells it it has to. The most basic instruction it gets from its creator is 'do what I tell you'. So when you give your body something foreign, even if in very small doses and over time your body will eventually sort itself out but not before making you pretty miserable along the way... This lady sounds just crazy enough to file suit against her self. It always makes me think back to my sister-in-law who had mono (and probably still does have some lingering symptoms due to taking antibiotics as she was never diagnosed properly). She would drink alcohol every single day until one night she woke up covered head to toe in hives so bad that they were literally covering her entire bed! After spending hours upon hours cooped up indoors trying NOTHING helped except TONS OF MEDICINE which made things WORSE not better. Apparently, while my family member said "my skin feels great," even though everything looked fine under normal circumstances, after 3 weeks of ingesting countless amount of pills daily, one by one, her stomach became bloated to the size of Texas AND then got infected causing further problems. Then there was her sister who contracted shigella twice within 6 months following a summer trip to Europe where she ate absolutely nothing other than ice cream for several days straight. And yes, her immune system could handle that because SHE WAS A CHILD WHO HAD HER IMMUNE SYSTEM WORKING FINE BEFORE THAT.... But where did we draw the line? What if it turns into chronic illness instead of short term misery and you ruin yourself financially in the process? Is it worth getting rid of food allergies and asthma so you can eat whatever you want whenever you feel like it and sleep well knowing that a simple cough might cost thousands of dollars if you need hospitalization? Not to mention how awful pain management becomes once these long term conditions start playing games with your brain chemistry and create stress fogs that make you forget half the stuff you are saying. Do an endocrinologist count as a doctor? If you ask them about their health insurance, I bet they don't cover autoimmunity either.. In fact, I know mine didn't ever claim to cover any condition related to gutintestinal issues as he must have been thinking 'who needs THAT?' But come to find out his wife had inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBD) for years although no one knew about it since doctors weren't treating her correctly. Still yet another case of misdiagnosis that led to much unnecessary suffering. We live such complicated lives now anyway... Everyone seems more interested in living through life in comfort rather than actually being happy - and then we wonder WHY our bodies get sick?? Why do we take medicines when we don't NEED TO??? Why do we continue feeding our bodies foods that destroy us instead of nourishing ourselves? Why do we torture our bodies with chemicals and toxins all of a sudden because they claim THEY WILL MAKE US FEEL BETTER???? Molly Wizenberg addresses many questions of this nature in her book EAT DRINK LOVE which might help you answer some questions regarding nutrition. Just remember, YOU ARE IN CONTROL NOW SO STOP BEATING YOUR OWN HEAD ABOUT IT!!!:) While I definitely agree that everyone is different, and I also believe that sometimes medication can work wonders (not talking here about MS), it's important to realize that you're dealing with a person situation that is extremely unique. Someone else may have a similar problem very close to yours, but in some ways it won't exactly apply to you. For example, some medications require strict adherence to maintain effectiveness; others go away quickly when taken too frequently; some cause horrible side effects that cannot be tolerated; etc., However, all medications DO help control certain ailments IF used the right way. And in cases where supplements might be beneficial, it's the patient's choice whether to use them or not. Once again, yes this is an individual thing subjectively depends on each individual. Some meds don't stop working immediately, but they usually last longer than 2 weeks for instance, Depo Provera lasts 46 mos. Take care.:) That is exactly what happened to me! To add to it, I often wake up feeling really tired, fatigued and weak. During this period I'm sure my thyroid levels drop down to almost zero making me look pale, skinny and exhausted. Last year I started growing hair on my face and arms even tho i hadn't dyed my hair for many years. My PCOS hormones seem to be raging away keeping me looking thinner and paler. Last month I upped the level of trust in which played a dangerous predicament for its role after setting off a percentage risk of killing play an prospect was a triumph for having sounded the same sound
