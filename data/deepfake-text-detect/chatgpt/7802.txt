While turning right on a red light is legal in most states, it is not always safe to do so from the "outside lane" or the "left right turn lane." In some cases, there may be pedestrians crossing or other vehicles moving through the intersection that could cause an accident. Additionally, drivers may not have a clear view of their surroundings when turning from these lanes, which can also lead to collisions. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the potential risks and exercise caution when making a right turn on a red light, regardless of the lane you are in.
