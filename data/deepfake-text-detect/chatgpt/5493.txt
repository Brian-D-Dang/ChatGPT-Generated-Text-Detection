I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several dogs myself and the same thing happens to me too. That's why I never buy dog food unless their owner is willing to pay for it out of pocket!
