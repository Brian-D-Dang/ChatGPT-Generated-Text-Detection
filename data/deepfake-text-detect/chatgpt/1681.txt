First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean we have to agree on what is acceptable or unacceptable for others in the privacy of their own homes... Yeah, I get where you are coming from but it wasn't my intent to attack anyone specifically.
