I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be considered as right or wrong. Morality is based on principles and values that are deeply ingrained in human nature and that have emerged from social, cultural, historical and religious traditions. These principles and values are not arbitrary, they are grounded in reason, empathy and compassion. While there may be some differences in how people interpret and apply moral principles, this does not mean that morality as a whole is subjective. Instead, it is a shared set of standards that guide human conduct and behavior, and these standards are necessary for building a just and peaceful society.
