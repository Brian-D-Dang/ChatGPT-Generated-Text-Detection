This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... Gamergate isn't about women. It's a reaction against "SJW" culture that amounts itself in many cases to intolerance for other people's opinions or beliefs because they don't hold the exact same opinions as themselves. Like being able to freely say whatever you want without fear? Joyous times we live in...
