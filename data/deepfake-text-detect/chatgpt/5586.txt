I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying "No" on Facebook and on various blogs. But I couldn't understand why. How would Huckabee's statement hurt? I mean, what's wrong with letting everyone know that we're in a war? I did some reading online, and I found out that Huckabee's statement is not uncommon. It's not that people think we're not in a war. They just don't think we should talk about it. According to the same article, 60 of Americans believe we're in a "war on terror." But a 2006 AP-Ipsos poll revealed that only 18 of Americans think the war in Iraq is a terrorist campaign. (I'm not sure how that number can add up to 60.) The article goes on to say that 47 of Americans think the war in Iraq is not a war at all. And the number is higher among people who voted for President Obama. All this, of course, is because our president is not inclined to refer to the war as a war. He calls it a "conflict," "a challenge" or "an important mission." So what's the problem with calling it a "war"? As the article says, it's a war on terrorism. It's not a war on terrorism because terrorism isn't a thing. It's a tactic. And when we treat it as a tactic, we're more likely to treat it as a crime. In 2001, we created the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It's the newest member of the Intelligence Community, and its job is to work with the other members to collect and share information about potential threats to national security. Terrorism is one of those threats. When we talk about terrorism in the United States, we're talking about people who are acting in violation of the laws of our nation. This means we need to apply the full force of our criminal justice system to those who are guilty. To do this, we must treat terrorism like a crime. We must stop seeing it as a war. I'm not saying that this makes the war in Iraq unjust or unlawful. I'm not saying that the actions we've taken are immoral. I'm just saying that this war has its limitations. This war cannot be fought the same way as a war. A war is a fight with another country. A war is an armed conflict. Terrorism is a crime. It's a crime when it's committed against us, and it's a crime when we commit it against others. The difference is that when we commit a crime, we're punished by law enforcement. The crime is against the government. When a terrorist commits a crime, he's not doing it against our government, he's doing it against us, the people. And when he does it, we're not punished by law enforcement. We're punished by the terrorist. When terrorists commit crimes against us, we need to treat them like criminals. We need to follow the rules of criminal justice. Our president doesn't think we need to treat terrorists like criminals, because he thinks we're in a war. But we're not in a war. We're in a criminal justice system. And if we're going to use that system to punish our enemies, we need to play by the rules. Which is exactly what Mike Huckabee said during the debate. Labels: crime, intelligence, terrorism, war Why I'm Afraid of ISIS Some people are saying that ISIS is a group that we can deal with. They say that we can fight terrorism by sending a few drones over their territory. But I'm not so sure we can fight terrorism by sending drones. I don't think we can fight terrorism by killing people. I don't think we can fight terrorism by bombing buildings. I don't think we can fight terrorism by sending troops. I think we can only fight terrorism by using our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to track down the terrorists, and our courts to prosecute them. And that's what the United States has been doing for over a decade. The Bush administration started the war on terrorism. They
