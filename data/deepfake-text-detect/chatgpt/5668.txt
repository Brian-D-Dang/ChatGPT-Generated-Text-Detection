I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. If I were to make a general comment, I would say that I am attracted to women who are not sluts. That is not to say that I am not attracted to women who are sluts, because that is not the case. But I have noticed that anytime a poster says that they are not attracted to sluts, they get railed. I don't think it is because of Reddit, just the world we live in today. If a man says he is attracted to virgins, he is called a creep and a loser. If he is attracted to sluts, he is called a pig and a misogynist. The idea that only men can be sexually attracted to virgins and only women can be sexually attracted to sluts is such a bullshit idea that I am surprised that anyone still believes it. Sometimes I see the "slut" comments and I agree. Other times I disagree. Other times, I don't care because I'm not attracted to the person in question. It's all very subjective. There are also guys who are attracted to "used goods." I have been with both types. I prefer the virgin, but I have been with women who were not. It's all very subjective. I can't remember a time in my life when I have been with a woman who was not a virgin. I've had sex with women who were virgins before, but it has never been with anyone that I was with. I would say that if there was a general trend, it would be that I would be attracted to women who were not virgins. But that is just a generalization, because like I said, it is all very subjective. I have no idea what any of that means. The term "slut" isn't defined, and you're using a lot of double-speak. What does it mean to be attracted to sluts? How would you even know? How is "slut" defined? I know what a slut is. It is a person who sleeps around with a lot of different partners. I have never known a woman to be a slut, although I have known women who slept around with different partners. I would say that I am attracted to women who are not sluts. That is not to say that I am not attracted to women who are sluts, because that is not the case. There are also guys who are attracted to "used goods." I have been with both types. I think it's just a matter of taste, like most things in life. There is no "correct" or "objective" way to look at it. I prefer the virgin, but I have been with women who were not. Why would you prefer a virgin over a woman who has slept with a lot of different partners? If you're attracted to used goods, then you're attracted to a woman who has slept with a lot of different partners. Is that true? I've been with women who were virgins before, but it has never been with anyone that I was with. What does that even mean? What are you talking about? I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. How do you know? Maybe you just haven't noticed it. If I were to make a general comment, I would say that I am attracted to women who are not sluts. That is not to say that I am not attracted to women who are sluts, because that is not the case. I don't know, but if you are, why would you prefer virgins to women who have slept with a lot of different partners? I know what a slut is. It is a person who sleeps around with a lot of different partners. Is that what a slut is? You're saying it's a subjective term, but that's not what you just said. Now you're saying it's a term that has a very specific definition? It is a person who sleeps around with a lot of different partners. So you're saying that every woman you've ever been with has been a slut? And your future girlfriend will be a slut, too? Are you saying that every woman you've ever been
