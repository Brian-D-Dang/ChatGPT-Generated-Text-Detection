Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one or both parties are already engaged? That is my concern over and all other sexual desires, including masturbation. Even if you break up with someone because of your romantic interest (and I don't mean that in a bad way), it's not very healthy to have this kind of relationship with someone who doesn't want to be intimate with you physically but wants additional physical intimacy at the same time as well... Is giving something away like that justifiable given what you've been told by your SO? It sounds like you're getting pushed into situations where there isn't much else available....
