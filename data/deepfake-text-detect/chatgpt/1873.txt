I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that "it's her fault" or other such statements. While I am on the side hoping for less victim blaming (which has done more harm than good), there is a reason why most rape survivors do not report to police - it does make things worse if you want help recovering without being accused of lying. If your rapist never shows up at trial after raping someone then no one will ever know he raped anyone... but what happens when they find out?
