There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, but it's unclear whether they actually have any impact on jobs because we don't track job numbers for every taxpayer prior to those taxes being paid. In contrast, some economists believe government spending stimulates economic activity by creating demand in the private sector (which makes businesses more likely to hire). Additionally, lawmakers who want an expansionary fiscal policy should be careful not to focus only on current budget deficits; focusing solely on deficit reduction may lead policymakers away from the most effective stimulus: high-quality investment in infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges - which has been shown time after time to boost employment. Of course, there is also another way governments affect their economies - through monetary policy. Monetary policies set interest rates at the national level based on what central bankers feel each region needs. These decisions play out through changes in how much banks charge customers to borrow money and interest rates charged to firms so companies will lend money instead of hoarding cash. This interest rate is known as short-term interest rate or overnight lending rate, and its value reflects expectations about future inflation and unemployment. When interest rates fall below zero, this means people aren't willing to pay lenders to take out loans. Since these funds must go somewhere else during deflation, they are invested into assets like stocks rather than loaning them back to consumers. Low interest rates cause asset prices to rise relative to wages, meaning owners see increased returns when selling their shares compared with keeping them liquid. The shift toward riskier investments creates higher levels of debt leading to lower values given rising stock market valuations due to low volatility while making it harder for investors to get stable income. Finally, when interest rates increase above 0 percent, borrowers begin to worry if paying off all their debts would mean losing their home or car. When people perceive these risks, they start saving less and borrowing even more. Aggressive monetary policy moves resulting in near-zero interest rates often result in cheaper credit, increasing consumer purchasing power and driving up asset markets - including equities - since low interest rates make it easier for buyers and sellers to agree on fair price. We saw one example of this recently when President Trump announced, without preconditions, his intention to cut tariffs between China and the United States. A combination of reduced uncertainty over trade arrangements and better business conditions driven by cheap borrowing could drive economic growth upwards again.

While most Americans won't notice much of an effect from further efforts to reduce federal red ink, countries where large amounts of public debt remain - especially developing nations such as Pakistan, India, Malaysia and Indonesia are expected to feel the full force of recent U.S. declines in interest rates. It isn't clear exactly why economic growth slows down, which is why there hasn't yet been unified consensus among economists regarding what sort of policies might help end America's "longest prosperity drought." However, there seems little doubt that elected officials need to find ways to spur economic activities once again.
