I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the sides. I think you can tell by looking at the fridge but it's hard because I don't know why they wouldn't just put space between them rather than making them both separate units, there aren't really options in my area so that would mean using cold storage bins instead of refrigerators which is pretty much impossible without dumping lots of stuff through the door If your refrigerator isn't already full enough then injecting ice cubes shouldn't be an issue for you though.
