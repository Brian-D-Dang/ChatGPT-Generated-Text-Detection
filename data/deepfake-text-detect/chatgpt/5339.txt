Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of trying to justify it all they did think that vaccines freaked me out more than anything else because it made sense for them and encouraged us not being immune from diseases as it seemed like a good idea even though they weren't convinced one day later everyone around here is immunosuppressed so we do nothing but vaccinate at home rather than living with something else (my mom doesn't eat meat or dairy). The irony? They probably thought it would be easier if we just let people live without vaccinations... I'm sorry you had such harsh responses when your mother refused vaccinations due to vaccine hesitancy!
