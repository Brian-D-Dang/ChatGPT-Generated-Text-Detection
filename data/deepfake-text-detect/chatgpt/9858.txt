Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to accept them and their lifestyles. However, I do believe that there are better ways to go about it than just changing your gender. For example, if someone is struggling with their gender identity, therapy could be a great place to start in order to gain more self-understanding and work towards understanding why they feel the way they do. It's important for people to have the resources to make informed decisions, and I think that therapy can provide that.
