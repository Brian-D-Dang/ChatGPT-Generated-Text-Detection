I feel like they're acting and it often feels very campy. I don't like how they say "well my brain is more feminine," like excuse me that's something that women do, people whose vagina can be feminine but not masculine or feminized just because they use it for sex appeal at an early age (like me), which you know what? Women are feminised physically with some degree of force in their bodies too! It seems to me that if the argument against feminine body parts isn't enough then that means men shouldn't have them either so we need women who aren't pushed into puberty by society using them as means to achieve patriarchal agendas
