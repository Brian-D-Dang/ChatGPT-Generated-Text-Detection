While it is true that individuals under 18 years of age lack the biological, psychological, and emotional development necessary to handle firearms safely, there are situations where minors may need to use firearms for self-defense, hunting, or recreational purposes under adult supervision. In rural areas, for example, children may need to learn how to handle firearms for hunting and pest control. Similarly, in cases where a child's life is in danger, possessing the knowledge and skill to shoot could potentially save that child's life. Rather than a blanket prohibition, it should be the responsibility of parents, guardians, and firearms instructors to ensure that minors are appropriately trained and supervised when handling firearms.
