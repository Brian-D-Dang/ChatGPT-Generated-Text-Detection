There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring or marriage between one parent and child, as well as the commencement ceremony itself. However, there has been a growing trend in recent years of some ceremonies being held by private service companies, such as GPs, which have engaged in charitable activity themselves. One example of this practice is the church service for Irish Christians at Old School on Church Street, Villaside-on-Sea, Dublin 8. The special 'Catholics From Ireland', who are traditionally invited into the village hall for the purpose of attending church services, will also be doing so in association with the charity. The Catholic Charities Group of Ireland said that their main aim is to provide education opportunities for pupils across the country in order to prepare them for life without school. "Some young people today choose to attend secondary school because they want to get their degree and to keep and maintain their own educational pathway," it added. Currently, only four,000 students hold high school qualifications but this number is expected to rise further. The group's Advisory Committee of about 200 members, including representatives from over 30 local councils and universities, promotes better knowledge and skills development among pupils in order to enhance their academic performance and career prospects, according to the group.
