There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, while others point out ways in which governments can spend money more efficiently. The idea behind this type of discussion is simple: It's likely that most people will benefit from the economy growing or shrinking as long as they're not directly affected by it. But what if you were? What would that mean for your life? How much could you really expect to be impacted? Finance professor at Georgetown University Brian Kaltz has been analyzing these issues since 2004. He says there's always two sides to every issue, but "that doesn't make them any less important." "I think the question is whether we get government intervention that leads us down one path or another," he tells NPR. So far, he thinks Congress seems to have failed in its ability to affect changes in the economy, despite repeated efforts on their part. The problem, he explains, stems from how people view taxes. "We assume everybody pays income tax - well, many don't actually pay income tax - so when somebody acts, that's something that I'm paying for even though nobody else is," Kaltz says. "And then again, the other way around where somebody who does pay taxes also helps me indirectly through employment or investment or whatever. And so those two kinds of interaction often lead to different outcomes." So why does it matter that those in power aren't able to change our economic future? Experts say federal legislation can help limit economic instability during downturns; however, it can only improve an already-existing system. As economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin told National Review last year, "If we allow ourselves to become dependent upon the whims of Washington bureaucrats to engineer an economic recovery plan, we risk letting them determine our destiny." But some argue that the policies put forth by elected officials cannot save an economy right now. In 2008, President Obama signed into law his stimulus package, hoping to jumpstart the struggling American economy with spending increased dramatically over four years. Kaltz doesn't disagree with such a move, saying that it could help create jobs. However, he still finds flaws. For example, his research shows that states with higher unemployment rates tend to see more aid from the federal government than those that take advantage of low unemployment rates. Although Kaltz agrees with the president about the need for job creation, he believes that too much debt should not come in the way of doing so. Nevertheless, he hopes that Congress continues to look for solutions before eventually resorting back to deficit reduction.
