If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will however also be available for humans (because they'll all get done by machines), so that means a lot more people globally will need food and other resources like energy too if we want to keep growing our economies indefinitely without doing something stupid like running out of oil or running into an extinction event due to climate change etc... The only reason I can think of why it's not happening now is because most countries depend on foreign workers which makes them reluctant about raising wages
