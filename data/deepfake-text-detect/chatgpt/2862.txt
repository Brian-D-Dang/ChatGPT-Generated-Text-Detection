Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one partner wants to change things up? My SO and I are about 2 months into our relationship (which started as a long distance thing),and we've already discussed that he's not entirely happy with how sex is going between us.. I think most people imagine this magical "honey moon" phase where their partners will want nothing but sex constantly. It doesn't work like that though.
