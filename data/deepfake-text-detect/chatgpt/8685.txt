This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) seem to be the norm in many Muslim countries. The fact that Christianity and Islam are similar does not mean they can't exist independently from each other and it doesn't necessarily mean that Christians do not have their own God-given beliefs (i.e., they make up separate categories of god).
