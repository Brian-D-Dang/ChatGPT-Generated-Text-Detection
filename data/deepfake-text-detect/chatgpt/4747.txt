To me growth of economy is a meaningless statistic. Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange. What kind of person evaluates actions in terms of number? What has been achieved by this "economic" policy. As per various analysts, there are three reasons for the current situation: 1.) Increase in demand from abroad due to favorable external environment. This however may not be sustainable as foreign countries will have their own problems. They too need demand and what do we export. 2.) There was no attempt to bring about higher efficiency through automation etc. The recent crisis reinforces that point. 3) Lack of investment into infrastructure (especially transportation). Infrastructure provides employment opportunities and other benefits, but successive governments seem to consider that it is optional expense. 4.) No attempt to improve domestic savings rate or enhance financial literacy. 5.) Lots of pricing power with no real competition - because of government intervention such as price freezes on petroleum products etc., so prices changed very slowly and people had confidence even though they were overcharged. And the last factor I think most important is lack of interest shown by younger generation towards politics. When young people show little concern at all levels of administration, then how can you expect them to be concerned about political processes? These people just disappear without any trace after high school. I am sure some or maybe all of these factors contribute to why India's economic growth slowed down. But none-the-less the fact remains that economically speaking India did grow. Of course, not much more than Zimbabwe which demonstrated an average yearly GDP growth of 4 between 2000 and 2008. So while these indicators tell us nothing about progress of our lives, still the numbers give room for optimism especially when compared to those nations like China who experienced double digit annual gross national product growth rates during the same period. A comparison with earlier years shows substantial differences. In 1990 EU averaged 3.9; Japan 5.8; US 11. In contrast, the fastest growing economies like South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mexico and Malaysia grew well above 10 percent. While in 1990 Kenya would only achieve 6, today it seems almost equal to Thailand which saw 15.6 annually. Similar trends also applied to many African states now leading Africa out of its poverty cycle. A rough calculation taking the Gini coefficient as 50 would yield 20 million new millionaires according to UN figures. By 2020 the world should see another 100 million middle class families. If India grows beyond 7, then by 2025 we could get close to 300 million new wealthy Indians. At least according to my calculations going by the past 28 years. Bussiness magazines keep talking about Asia being the next big thing. Yet every time someone tries to portray Asian markets as competitive and promising as opposed to American ones, people call him crazy. Elsewhere in this forum a similar argument emerged amongst politicians. Are Asians really ready to take America's place? Do they really want to do business within North Atlantic Treaty Organization jurisdiction? Well, if anything proves that Asia does not have such aspirations, it must be the non-stop praise given by many right wing economists to Asian investors and businesses. Somehow the Asians appear to wish to work outside USA first before settling up here. Not surprisingly they prefer Europe instead. Countries often speak highly of themselves. That is not surprising. For example Spain claimed that "Spain has never lost a war." However, I rather believe the reverse since Algeciras Bay is the biggest naval loss ever recorded. Edward Gibbon wrote his famous book describing Rome's rise and fall in record six volumes yet he failed to mention one critical event - Gallic Wars. He ignored quite important part of Roman history. Nowadays, Russia talks loudly about her greatness but she refuses to accept that Ukraine gains independence despite having Russian roots. Many empires talk and act great but don't live up to expectations. History teaches us otherwise. It appears that on account of several Indian televisions channels providing daily entertainment at nominal costs big multinationals purchase ads in order to boost sales in India. Advertising agencies create commercials using actresses and presenters who appear perfectly natural together off camera until cutscene starts where suddenly two actors change places and begin dancing and singing creating illusion of romance and love! All in all, what comes across is simply promotion of beverages companies. It must be remembered that both newspapers and radios have become mouthpieces of advertising departments of large corporations. Newspapers serve them mainly by publishing adverts while radio stations copy songs from albums prepared specially for this purpose and broadcast it on air via headphone jacks in cars. Whatever the case might be, BBC World Service FM radio station in New Delhi continues to draw huge crowds each day despite broadcasting programming regularly meant for back home listeners. Millions of Indians listen to news bulletins provided free of charge everyday. You'd forget greener days of only a few decades ago. Egyptian television featured brand new soap operas including Rambo vs. Zombies, which stands as the closest Egypt gets to Hollywood movies, It sounds phony bizarriques 2 david at the beginning.
