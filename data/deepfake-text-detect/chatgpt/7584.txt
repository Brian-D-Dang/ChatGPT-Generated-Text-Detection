While it is true that social media content can be publicly available for anyone to view, it doesn't necessarily mean that the owner of that content wants every individual to view it. Many people use social media to connect with friends and family, share their thoughts and experiences, and document their lives. However, it doesn't mean that they want strangers or acquaintances to view this content as well. Additionally, there is a fine line between browsing someone's social media content and "creeping" or "snooping." Browsing implies that the content is being viewed in a casual and harmless way, whereas "creeping" or "snooping" implies that there is an aspect of invading someone's privacy or crossing a boundary. Therefore, while it may be acceptable to view someone's public social media content, it's important to respect their privacy and not overstep any boundaries.
