As can be seen in [this image] , in most places in the U.S. (and maybe elsewhere that right-on-red is allowed?), it is legal to turn right on red from a one way street onto another one way street if you are coming from an intersection with no stoplight or sign indicating otherwise, and if there aren't any traffic lights at all. But what about turning right from a two-way street? It's not illegal everywhere - just look around for signs saying "no turns" or something like that before going ahead! If someone backs into your car while making this maneuver though, don't think they won't try to blame you because of this post...
