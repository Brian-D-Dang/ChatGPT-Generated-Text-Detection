In spite of the imperfections of the USA and Europe, it still remains a truth that pretty much all of the most desirable places in the world are run by liberal governments. People who want to immigrate to the USA and Europe have traditionally had a liberal orientation. There is certainly a phenomenon of conservatives immigrating to countries that they hate, but the proportion of conservatives moving to liberal countries is much greater than the reverse. In other words, in the 19th century, most of the people who wanted to live in the USA were anti-slavery. That is not to say that the USA was necessarily a good place for anti-slavery people. Many of the immigrants came because they were refugees from persecution, and ended up being persecuted in the USA. There was a reason why the immigrants did not all go to Canada. The most desirable places in the world are run by liberal governments. We should embrace this reality and try to make our own society more like the liberal countries. Unfortunately, conservatives have a different strategy. Their strategy is to make their own country more like the liberal countries. By doing so, they may end up moving to a liberal country. The USA has achieved the highest level of prosperity in history by running a moderately liberal government. Yet, conservatives want to turn the USA into a state where capitalism is absolute, and the government is run by people who want to eliminate or reduce the safety net. Conservatives in the USA want to make the USA look and function like a poor country. Why would anyone want to move to a poor country? Why would anyone want to move to a poor country with a government that is run by people who want to eliminate the safety net? This is crazy. And yet, we are doing it. In order to make our country more like the countries we want to live in, we should do the opposite of what conservatives are doing. We should eliminate the power of corporations and make the government more powerful. We should increase the safety net, not decrease it. I'm all for globalization. We should be able to buy cheap products from anywhere in the world. The problem is that the world is run by liberal governments, and they are good at making the world a place that conservatives don't like. We need to put into place a liberal government. A liberal government would likewise make our society more like the liberal countries. This is because liberal governments have a bias for the status quo. In order to make our country more like the countries we want to live in, we should do the opposite of what conservatives are doing. We should eliminate the power of corporations and make the government more powerful. We should increase the safety net, not decrease it. A good liberal government would allow us to get rid of the outrageous and wasteful expenditures that are being used to provide corporations with profits and benefits. A liberal government would use the money to provide the safety net. A liberal government would use the money to provide services that make it easier for people to get jobs. A liberal government would use the money to increase taxes on the wealthy and use the money to provide services. A liberal government would use the money to provide services that the wealthy do not need and that are necessary for the well-being of society. We are looking at a progressive tax. The top tax rate would be about 70 or 80. The USA has been run by conservatives. The result has been the erosion of the middle class. The middle class has become poor. This is because conservatives have used their power to enrich themselves and their corporate allies. A liberal government would use the power of the government to help the middle class. A liberal government would enact regulations on corporations that would prevent them from taking advantage of the workers. A liberal government would enact laws that would protect the environment. A liberal government would enact regulations that would reduce the ability of corporations to externalize their costs. A liberal government would enact regulations that would reduce the ability of corporations to use their political power to get subsidies and other benefits.
