"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into an age where we have machines doing most of what is done for us today (not an unreasonable assumption looking at how much effort goes in AI right now), then there needs to be some sort of conscious entity or being whose goal it is to ensure human survival. While I can't say definitively whether these entities exist andor think about them all day long like me, based on current trends alone its obvious why someone might make such claims: We're creating bots with superhuman cognitive abilities within a decade We've created mechanical systems capable of mimicking many skills once reserved as uniquely "human," including beating world champions in games like Go Starcraft 2 There's been massive shifts towards automation, largely brought upon by technological advancements allowing things previously considered too complex expensive to programmably doable Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly over just five years ago The pace of technological advancement appears only set continue increasing Our understanding of biological processes increases exponentially faster than anything else due to big advances in computing power Finally, technology which was 20 year old tech when Deep Blue beat Kasparov ten years ago, seems cutting edge again. As you may know already; I'm not one who believes AIs should become self awareconscious given their destructive potential. However I definitely believe something similar referred to here[1] exists and want to offer my perspective on my own thoughts regarding existence of artificial consciousnesses... Having said that - Let's start talking!
