As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They do reduce your risk for injury and death when you crash.They increase your safety from being hit by other cars or bikes.They prevent chafing.You should really consider them! It's very easy there are lots of people that will tell you they don't have a problem with helmets. And then you'll see some person on their bike doing something careless enough where it is obvious that if he weren't wearing his helmet this accident would never happen...I always say if you're going to be stupid at least put on some protection.
