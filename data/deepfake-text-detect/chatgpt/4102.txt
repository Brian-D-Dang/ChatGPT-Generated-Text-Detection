So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want a truly informed voter, you should actually go meet the candidate in person (or at least stand next to him). I'm inclined to agree with this sentiment - particularly because we know that the GOP is not going to put up an honest face for itself these days. They have decided to blame everything bad on Obama, even though they've been doing things right as well. It's not just the fact that they're stupid or greedy or dishonest; they're acting like spoiled brats who demand to be treated special but then whine when their little toys aren't granted to them.
