Let me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers for this, they had the same technology and tools available as the developers of Call of Duty 4. And I'm not going to compare this game to CoD4 just to say it's better. I enjoyed Call of Duty 4 more because it gave me a better sense of what it was like to be a soldier. I liked having to shoot at enemies in the dark. I liked having to aim down the iron sights. I liked not having a radar system to guide me. And it was nice to have a satisfying kill-cam. CoD4's soldiers felt more human to me. I liked that, when I shot a guard in the head, he would fall, I liked that when I shot a guard in the stomach he would be knocked backwards. I liked that when a guard fell, he wasn't just knocked back and ran back into the fray. I liked that I could hit an enemy in the stomach and watch them fall down to the ground and lose their weapon and not die. Goldeneye 007, for me, felt like a "Call of Duty 4 on an FPS engine" instead of the other way around. It felt like a game with more of the same and nothing new. Goldeneye 007 is a first person shooter, and the gameplay was essentially the same as it was in CoD4. Enemies would drop to the ground after I shot them, I could shoot guards in the stomach and knock them back, I could hit a guard in the face and watch their eyes roll back, etc. Goldeneye's multiplayer was even more "Call of Duty 4 on an FPS engine" than its singleplayer was. I didn't like playing multiplayer for the most part because I'd rather be alone than with a bunch of people I don't know and who probably don't know how to play the game. Unlike CoD4, Goldeneye 007 has some other modes. In the "classic" mode, you and the other players are pitted against each other and try to complete a series of objectives. The objectives were pretty predictable: "Go here, kill this guy, go here, kill this guy, go here, kill these guys, go here, kill these guys." Most of the time, I'd get to one of the objectives and the other people would be there before me and I'd have to wait around. The other modes I played were "Deathmatch" (kill the other players) and "Kill Confirmed" (kill someone, take their weapon, go back to your spawn point, and collect it). The "Kill Confirmed" mode was basically a variation of "Capture the Flag." The singleplayer and multiplayer were very similar. The same settings, the same controls, the same objectives. The multiplayer gave me the same satisfaction as the singleplayer, which is to say, it didn't. Goldeneye 007 has an achievement system. Unfortunately, I only unlocked one of them: "Master Spy" (kill 100 enemies in singleplayer or multiplayer). The multiplayer was very similar to CoD4, except it had a few things that were the same as other games, like "Respawn" (you respawn at your spawn point after dying), "No reloads" (you can't reload your weapon, you just have to pick up another one), "Resupply" (you can get a new weapon if you die and your teammates respawn you), and "Rally Point" (you respawn at a set point and your teammates have to kill the enemy team to win the game). I don't have any idea why the developers would use something so similar to CoD4 in the first place. Goldeneye 007 is a first person shooter that has a number of weapons. Unlike CoD4, it has a radar that shows you the position of the enemy guards, and it has a laser sight. There are also some stealth weapons, like the silenced pistol, the silenced assault rifle, and the sniper rifle. The game also has grenades. In CoD4, you can crouch while aiming down the iron sights (in addition to crouching while prone). In Goldeney
