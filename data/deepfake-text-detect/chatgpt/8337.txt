The reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using them in a credible and believable way the person will become emotionally tied up with what you have said as opposed if heshe was just told "You must never use such curse-words." In summary; do not tell someone off for being abusive (that's no one else but yourself). If possible try an indirect approach of showing disapproval by keeping silent instead - This has been proven time after again at least on TV shows where abusers get away without punishment or consequence constantly even though there should be many times so far all ready! It however does take practice among people who don't really know each other very well before things can work out fine...
