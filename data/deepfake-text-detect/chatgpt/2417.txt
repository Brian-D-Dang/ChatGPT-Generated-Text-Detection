I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several good friends who really love their dogs and they always seem to be happy when the owners come by which is nice but again (and this may sound like sour grapes) it's not something I would choose as my companion animal of choice though if someone else wants one then hey more power to 'em! 2 Dogs that require lots of grooming generally don't make very good pets because most pet owners can barely keep up with bathing cats, let alone cleaning out a clogged poop chute and scraping out mats from fur. If mommy has bad acne already, she likely will never want to put her face in your ear. And we all know how much work puppies can be: potty training, walking every day, socialization classes... honestly there might just only be enough time left over at the end of each week for long naps on the couch while mom sleeps off her hangover. Oh yeah - did I mention little puppy teeth? They grow in so fast! Remember also what happened last year at Easter, Christmas, and Arbor Day??? You remember those great big holes in our sofa cushions?? Yeah kind of ruins the look of any furniture doesn't it?! So unless Mom Dad plan on living outdoors forever, get ready to constantly replace things around here. Lucky us right now seems to prefer carpet burnings instead of chewing on wood anymore...it could change back at anytime though....so watch your tail!! What do you say about these two posts? What other types of animals should stay away from children due to dangerrisk factors associated?
