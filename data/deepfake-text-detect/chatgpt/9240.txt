I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is I have come to realize that I simply don't look at anime the same way I did when I was a child. This is why I've been struggling to find the good tastes that I had as a young boy, and I feel that Sword Art Online is one of the best shows I've ever seen, and that it deserves every bit of attention it gets.
