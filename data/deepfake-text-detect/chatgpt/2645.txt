Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians, not soldiers or military targets as we are led to believe today (though the use of them against naval and military vessels was justified). These bombings killed hundreds of thousands if not millions of people both Japanese citizens and Allied servicemen. This is a primary reason that many historians have questioned their validity as "justifiable" acts. It doesn't matter what Japan would do next; it wasn't right for us to drop those weapons on innocent populations. 2. We dropped these weapons out of anger over losing the war in Europe. When you look at how long Japan had been occupied by the Allies prior to August 6th 1945, it's hard to argue with anyone who chooses to say there was no justification.
