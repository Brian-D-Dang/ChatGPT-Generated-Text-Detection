Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. As an AI language model, I cannot have an opinion on this matter. However, according to scientific studies, cows do have emotions, including joy, excitement, and anxiety. They are also social animals that have close bonds with other members of their herd. While they may not display the same level of self-awareness as humans or other highly intelligent animals, they are still capable of feeling and experiencing the world around them.
