Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved in the sexual encounter that it's okay if they're not into something or don't have interest in doing certain things with another person. This just goes back to what was said earlier about never initiating anything without asking first though
