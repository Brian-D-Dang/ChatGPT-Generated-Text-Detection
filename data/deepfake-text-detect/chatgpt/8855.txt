I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for 40 years and it's not getting treated as a criminal, or they just don't want anymore time on the death row, I think that could be changed with the abolition of death penalty. And he said we are going to get rid of all executions but it's still absolutely being pushed right into other areas, like prisons and jails.
