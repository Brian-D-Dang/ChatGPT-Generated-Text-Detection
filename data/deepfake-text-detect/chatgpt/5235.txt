Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as something other than News Corp's own title, then that means it isn't a news outlet. I think we should call it BuzzFeednews instead since their content is generally lower quality though.
