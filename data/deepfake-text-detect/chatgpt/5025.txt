People talk about'natural' or'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like "free speech" or "free association" are'inalienable','natural', or'God-given', how come so many people don't have any rights?' asks Martin Cole from the Institute for Justice, who is also the Founder of Rights Without Borders. 'Most of this legislation has been passed through executive action,' he says in a letter published on his website.'It's really disappointing that so much of what we've heard over these years seems to be designed just as a protectionist strategy against free speech and freedom of speech'. He adds:The bill does not provide anyone with any justice whatsoever. It allows torturers to interrogate prisoners without trial - something they carry out during emergencies too often by merely asking them questions regarding their personal details (which is based strictly upon the laws of war). It restricts escapes where punishment could endanger lives; it denies individuals and families permission to adopt children if they're convicted of crimes such as manslaughter. It arbitrarily bans libel laws which are already outlawed under Article VI " .Legal Experts have pointed out that the bill violates freedom of expression enshrined in the UK Constitution " because it uses vague terminology including " guilty until proven innocent " .They argue that the Bill should only apply to those guilty of serious offences such as murder, kidnapping and terrorism acts. " We call on Parliament to condemn the Government's attempts at spreading hysteria around this issue, " said Andrew Fearnley, professor of law at the University of Warwick and founder of Rights Without Borders. " This reckless attack on free speech needs to stop immediately now. We strongly urge MPs to put an end to these unnecessary attacks. " The bill would allow armed forces officers to arrest personals using any means necessary except force and search warrants, while safeguarding human rights, in order to keep innocent civilians safe when asked in court. It imposes compulsory detention orders, forbids unlawful detention without charge, protects vulnerable populations and establishes standards governing grounds for refusing stays. " According to Freedom of Speech campaigner Alex Hawke, the killings " may prove embarrassing " . " Freedom of speech isn't enough anymore, " says Hawke " . " Everyone deserves to live peacefully together and realise what peaceful coexistence is - there shouldn't exist any barriers between them. " As well as devoting much time and energy into the debate, the Government must show its commitment to making Britain safer.'Our legal system must protect every citizen, " says Professor James Knight, Leader of the Institute for Defence Against Impunity " . " There will never again be a return to violence and intimidation in our country. " The Government claims the Bill sets up a " too like-minded society " . Politicians say Britain needed a separate legislation before it was trialled, arguing it undermined freedoms. " And yet Parliament had already arrived at its decision. We need strong laws protecting everyone, " says Rachel Reeves, founder of Rights Without Borders. " If MPs want to legislate restricting freedom of opinion then they ought to listen carefully to their constituents. " We know that those who oppose the Bill fear it may lead to more violent crime.'London Mayor Sadiq Khan added.Every day I hear people saying that our national government won't back down on freedom of speech protected by our constitution, " Khan told ITV News last week. " Unfortunately my view is that Parliament doesn't give credence to that notion either. " The legislation gives Parliament power to prosecute those found committing crimes abroad who threaten public safety or commit terrorist acts outside Britain. " Allowing lethal force to justify killing is contrary to our founding principles of equality, freedom and safety, " says Patrick Collier from the Institute for Justice. " Police cannot detain people involuntarily despite knowing that they might provoke suicide bombings or other deadly incidents. " The Government insists the Bill will protect citizens from abuse overseas while protecting British taxpayers from terrorists. " Despite being frequent targets of attempted murder, we still rely heavily on parliamentarians to negotiate trade deals,' Professor Gillian Reynolds from the Institute for Justice says. " In fact this package aims to keep our own borders open instead of relying entirely on Westminster. " Some commentators think Parliament continues to favour defence contractors rather than citizens. " While anti-terrorism legislation has repeatedly failed in Parliament, MPs help maintain peace within the British Union of Fascism. " Even threats to national security cannot escape scrutiny, " says Professor Peter Boyd from the University of Westminster. " Terrorists use threat assessment techniques specially developed for the purpose of avoiding prosecution, " Professor Boyd tells us. " Parliament should reject this legislation " '. Rights Without Borders is endorsing the Bill, " says Helen Cox, chairman. " However, the Government wants Parliament to do nothing about it because it threatens democracy itself. " An amendment proposed today dictates that nobody criminalises hate speech unless someone commits a serious offence. " Letters from political leaders calling for Parliament to ban blasphemy were rejected yesterday, " says Mr Brokenshire. " But let me suggest we wait till Parliament gets its act together. "
