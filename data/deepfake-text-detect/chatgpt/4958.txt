Reddit is a website, a business, it is the "front page of the internet." This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these sites would be better than trying to remove personalities like Milo Yiannopoulos and David Duke from Reddit. If you've been on reddit since before the internet existed (and sorry, watching Milo), you know that Reddit isn't "the front page" anymore. Reddit has gone downhill over time due to lack of diversity through censorship but it's still thriving today thanks to its website being savvy enough not to censor content. Just because you're offended by Milo Yiannopoulos doesn't mean you shouldn't create an alternative site called Reddit for all users who want to come together as one community instead of keeping their hatred in the subculture while allowing content they don't agree with without any censorship.
