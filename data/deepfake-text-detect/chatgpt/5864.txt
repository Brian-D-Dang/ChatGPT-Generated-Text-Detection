So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want to know how someone is going to vote, just look at how they've voted. If you want to know what they're going to do, just look at what they've done. I'd much rather look at what they've done than a debate. Because debates are sort of interesting for entertainment purposes. We're not running for a reality show. We're running for the presidency. And I think the debates are a waste of time. You can read the rest of the interview here.
