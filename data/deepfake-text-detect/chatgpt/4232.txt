I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think naturalism works from an epistemological point of view: namely, we can only know what's true by observation and deduction. If you look at any simple experiment like DNA analyzing human cells or even tiny organisms in their environment, they will tell you if something is "natural" or not (if there are no other explanations). But if someone tries to argue that something is simply because of its own characteristics then heshe isn't very good at science. A common example is about homosexuality. The idea that people who are gay are more likely to have been molested by one parent vs another seems to be based on some kind of evolutionary argument that implies gays would have developed these traits earlier than heterosexuals in order to survive better and reproduce less often with one partner compared to many partners over time. However, even this is somewhat suspect, since most homosexuals won't develop the trait until much later in life. So why would homosexual behavior persist when all love affairs were arranged? And could sexual orientation actually be determined through genetics alone instead of a cultural influence?
