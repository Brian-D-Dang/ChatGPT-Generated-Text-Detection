While it is possible that alien robots may exist and that humans may come into contact with them, it is important to consider the vastness of the universe and the possibility of other sentient organic life-forms. It is presumptuous to assume that intelligent life in the universe would necessarily develop in the same way as it has on Earth, with its focus on technology and robotics. In fact, some scientists speculate that alien life may be vastly different from life as we know it, and may not even be recognizable to us. Therefore, it is just as likely that humans may come into contact with sentient organic life-forms as it is with alien robots.
