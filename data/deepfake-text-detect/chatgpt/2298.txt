I'm very confused and bothered by the amount of ads for prescription medications that run on television and in magazines. In my mind, the reason that these medications can only be prescribed with a doctor's assistance is so they won't have adverse side effects or addicting properties. If there really was nothing wrong with them then why would anyone need to see their physician? And if it isn't addictive (and I've read where some people say Xanax addiction has become an epidemic) than what are all those doctors doing prescribing such meds anyway?! This might answer your question about whether medication should be used as first line treatment: ...DS00334T1, which talks specifically about depression being treated initially without drugs, but also states drug treatments may be needed later when symptoms don't improve over time. This discussion started because someone used this article to argue against treating pain at home, even though he had no specific argument regarding alternatives other than "they aren't regulated." It sounds like you're concerned about potential abuse from taking painkillers with out seeing your doc well maybe prescriptions shouldn't exist either! Afterall we want FDA approved care right??
