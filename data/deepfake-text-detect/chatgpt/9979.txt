I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say "entertainment," but I think it's more than just that. Most works of literature contain some sort of moral or lesson that can be taken away from them. It acts as a way for us to learn, grow, and teach others. Literature also helps us explore and understand the human experience, by allowing us to step into the lives of characters in a book, and gain insight into how other people think, feel and act. Through literature we can gain understanding of different cultures and time periods, and explore themes such as love, friendship, and perseverance. Ultimately, literature is a tool for us to better ourselves, our communities, and society as a whole.
