I have had friendships with various males, and only one of them has not tried to at one point in time, make it sexual. This was not a big deal in my life, I just had to get a new friend. I'm a guy and I have been in a "friend zone" before. And it's not a bad thing at all. To be honest, I'm happy for it to stay that way. As I said, it's a good thing. You should see it as a positive thing. It was not a bad thing at all, just the way she got my attention. She would come to work when she could and asked me to work out with her. She would come to me to ask questions and to ask how I feel about something. If you didn't like it, you should have asked her to stop but you didn't. And I guess she didn't think it was a bad thing either. In my experience, most women have no clue how to behave around men. As a result, I am very cautious of what women say and do.

I think that it is completely normal and not a bad thing at all. It's a nice thing. It would be a problem if she was stalking me or doing anything else.
