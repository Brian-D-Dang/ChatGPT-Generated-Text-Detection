Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll do the following: 1. I'm sorry that I said you were "grossly ignorant" of something. I didn't mean to offend you. I meant to say that I was grossly ignorant of your experiences. I'm sorry that I got angry. I regret that. 2. I'm sorry that I spoke about you as if I knew you personally. I did not mean to do that either. I meant to say that I was talking about myself, and to assume that someone I'd just met knew exactly how I felt and what I meant in a way that I didn't. 3. I'm sorry that I said that I would never have responded to that thread had I not been in a bad place at the time. I meant to say that I would have responded differently. I would have said "I'm sorry you feel that way" instead of "I'm sorry that you feel that way" (as that implies that I don't think you should feel that way). I would have said "Wow. I'm sorry that you feel that way. I can't speak to it, but I wish you the best." 4. I'm sorry that I said "It seems to me that a lot of feminists are unsympathetic to the idea of men having these sorts of problems, even though they should be sympathetic." I meant to say "It seems to me that a lot of feminists are unsympathetic to the idea of men having these sorts of problems, and I can understand why they'd feel that way." I think that, if you were to speak to a feminist who actually did have sympathy for men's issues, you'd find that she would be sympathetic to the idea that a man might feel that he's a woman inside. I think that the fact that you don't have sympathy for this is very sad. 5. I'm sorry that I said that I've been the target of sexist abuse. I didn't mean to imply that it had been as bad as it had for you. I meant to imply that it had been bad. I'm sorry that I said I was "outraged" by it, because I wasn't really outraged. I was simply very upset and felt that what had happened to me was a serious matter. 6. I'm sorry that I said that you should "just get over it." I didn't mean to imply that I think you should "just get over it." I meant to say that I think you should get over it. I don't think you should have to get over it. I think it's too much work, too much time, and I think you should be free to do whatever you want with your life. I'd rather not have to deal with people who have these issues, but if I do, I hope I have the decency not to say "Just get over it." I'm sorry for being a jerk, and I'm sorry that I said such awful things. I hope you'll forgive me. How do you mean? Do you think that men who want to transition feel that they are women? How do you think women who want to transition feel? I would imagine that some men who want to transition feel that they are women. I can't speak for how women who want to transition feel. I'm sorry that you feel that way. I'm sorry that you feel that you have to choose between being the person you feel you are and living a life that feels right to you. I'm sorry that you feel like you have to choose between living your life as a woman and living your life as a man. I'm sorry that you feel that way. I'm sorry that you feel that you can't be who you are without being marginalized. I'm sorry that you feel that way. I'm sorry that you feel like you're being denied your right to be who you are. I'm sorry that you feel that way. I'm sorry that you feel that we're excluding people from the transgender community. I understand that you don't think that transsexuals are transgender, but I do, and I think that it's important to try and understand everyone's experiences, however hard that may be. I'm sorry that you feel that way. I'm sorry that you feel that we're excluding people from the transgender community. I understand that you don't think that transsexuals
