Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, do we not start with the experts? It's a process for us all when learning something new but there is always one set of people in our lives who are willing and able to give you solid information on things they have experience doing: family members, friends, coworkers, business associates, coachesmentors... We could go on forever just naming examples here because really everyone needs a sounding board at some point! But what if many times we fail to seek out those whom are capable of giving us insight (because no matter how much time has passed since high school this still comes back as "that guy from Family Counseling? No worries though - today we will take a closer look into 2 of my favorite sources for expert coachinginsightful advice: LinkedIn Blogging. LinkedIN The People That Know You Best. This quote by Jeff Bezos sums up why LinkedIn provides such great insight: "LinkedIn gives me access to millions of world-class professionals around the globe. It also allows them to get to know me and understand where I am coming from - beyond my professional expertise. And now, through Facebook Connect, LinkedIn is bringing together these two worlds for dynamic conversations about everything relevant in their own fields." Guess again! On Facebook we can connect directly with any person in the entire world without having first established trust via email with anyone else involved. Isn't this incredible?! Well, yes and no; granted technology like Facebook makes this possible but even so, connecting with individuals ever so carefully ensures that only verified profiles are presented and validated before being given direct access to your most personal data. Still not convinced yet? Then let's take a peek inside the mind of Gary Vaynerchuk aka The Beast. A few years ago he used his public profile page on Linkedin to invite others to join him each week over coffee for 30 minutes to catch up on life and share mutual interests while getting invaluable feedback on themselves personally. In fact, after talking with former employees and peers, upon hearing that Mr. Vaynerchuk offered 1 free hour of private consultation with anyone wishing to talk about anything regarding his career path, he received over 100 requests within 24 hours alone! Now consider this interview conducted prematurely shortly after leaving the corporate world and interviewing Aaron Levie (levide), CEO of Box Inc., which makes cloud storage software applications for small businesses. He was asked whether he would be interested in a blog post written by none other than myself detailing how he went from being one of the youngest CEOs in America and leading crowdsourcing companies to building arguably one of America's largest tech startups (2 in 2011 by revenue behind facebook). To say Aaron's heart pounding excitement shooting off throughout the room might explain perfectly why he opted to jump right into his reply rather than wait to hear me finish explaining why blogging and networking is beneficial. After reading that quote above I couldn't help but reflect further on what inspired me to write the article. Why, exactly did I feel compelled to use my personal platform to offer valuable insights to Aaron? Because I had seen firsthand just recently how hard it can be to break into the field (s) industry (ies) that you aspire to work in during college. Yes sure, with hard work, persistence, passion, talent, leadership, dedication, etc....you too may succeed in achieving success later in life assuming enough luck and good timing come along to allow you to live past 50...or maybe 5 years down the road you find yourself out of work due to major layoffs, cutbacks, downsizing, etc.. Yep, sometimes bad things happen despite careful planning BEFORE working towards a future goal. So perhaps in order to avoid feeling as frustrated as I once did trying to enter the industryfield I wanted to pursue (in addition to having done so already for several years), I decided to create another avenue in which to build value AND potentially make money. So thank goodness I found what felt like THE PERFECT cyber space to utilize to become educated about issues related to said desired industrycareer area. What better way to garner knowledge and tips from the best minds in the business TODAY? Not to mention don't forget social proof exists everywhere online including on Twitter! Anyway, the bottom line remains this: Don't limit your network solely based on age, gender, location, race, ethnicity, etc; instead reach out to every single qualified individual and see whether they decide to lend you an ear or open doors from the information gained during your discussion (s)! When reaching out remember to keep in touch long after the initial contact occurs as well using services like Google Voice Hangouts (which enables video chat), Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram DM, Snapchat, etc.; whatever works for you!! Speaking of LinkedIn, speaking of blogs, wouldn't it press. can
