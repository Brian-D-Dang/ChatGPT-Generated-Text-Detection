Disclaimer: this talk of secession may not be present everywhere in the United States, but it is more than prevalent where I live, so I'm going off that. To me, being a "secede" state means you get to keep your own laws and culture without having them overridden by federal law (think Gay Marriage). For example; if they banned Marijuana here we would secede because our beliefs are sovereign over the governments. I think one other important thing about states rights is each State has different needs and desires from another. Like for instance if someone wants abortion, people should be able to do what they want with their bodies as long as no harm comes out of it (They can't let an infection build up or use dirty equipment etc.) The gov just shouldn't ban Abortion outright IMO
