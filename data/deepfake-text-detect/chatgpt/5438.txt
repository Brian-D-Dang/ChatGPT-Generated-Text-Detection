The implementation of Judicial Review from the Marbury v. Madison case from the precedent of the Judiciary Act of 1789 allows for the Supreme court to be to judge over appeals of these cases via the courts of appeals and appeals courts, which is why the lower courts have been granted judicial review on claims of false statements in federal lawsuits against the Pennsylvania Supreme Court by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which has a long history of rulings that have upheld false statements made about judicial decisions. Judge Robert Burke was appointed to the Court of Appeals by President Clinton in 1995, where he ruled that a Pennsylvania law preventing judges from punishing false statements made pursuant to the constitutional protections under the Harrisburg Constitution. If a state court decides to overturn Burke's decision or a federal appellate court rules against the decision, it would end any pretrial process for any defendants attempted claims arising out of the ruling (although it could allow a defendant with false statements to seek damages). The Pennsylvania Supreme Court also provides for the removal of judges who are convicted of perjury. American Federation of Teachers, a labor union representing teachers and other educators, sued Pennsylvania's governor last year alleging the governor used unlawful means to terminate contracts. The lawsuit seeks compensation for wrongful termination resulting from Pennsylvania's decision not to renew contracts while the case continues before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. An Ontario Superior Court judge recently ordered the state to compensate teachers who were terminated due to their incorrect statements declared False Claims Act violations citing Pennsylvania's failure to notify them prior to termination. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has discretion when deciding whether a case must proceed through trial because Pennsylvania courts cannot decide what should happen if the judge determines a defendant violated an act under the Constitution. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has similar power since the courts rule on claims regarding false statements based upon the Constitution. Dismantling the Pennsylvania Court of Appeals system completely eliminates the ability of plaintiffs' lawyers to challenge judicial decisions. Pennsylvania regulators abolished all appellate judgeships and replaced them with independent judges, which makes the judiciary redundant as Pennsylvania judges are unable to determine the eligibility criteria for grants of impartial justice during hearings in state court proceedings. Pennsylvania judges can only make judgments concerning disputes between two parties. Pennsylvania's Judicial Proceedings Act establishes two types of judicial reviews per court; these investigations into judicial misconduct by judges will no longer occur unless there is evidence of wrongdoing against the judge concerned. Pennsylvania courts require judges to complete detailed investigative reports detailing allegations applicable to each complaint filed at trial within 60 days after charges filed. The Governor's Office issued a new policy calling for judicial independence knowing the state supreme court may intervene simultaneously with pending litigation, so the Governor's Office cannot grant bail without first conducting review of a case before petitioners.
