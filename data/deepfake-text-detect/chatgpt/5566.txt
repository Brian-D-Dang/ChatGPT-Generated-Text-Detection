My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother had sent the teacher a note that the kid's father was going to be released from jail for the holidays and she wanted to know what she should get him for Christmas. The teacher and the child's mother discussed what the child would get his father. His father was going to jail for his 3rd DUI (he had been convicted twice before). The mother wanted to know what the child should get his father for Christmas. The teacher and the mother discussed what the child should get his father. The mother insisted that the child get his father a toothbrush and some toothpaste because he would need that when he got out of jail. The teacher said that that was not a good idea, but the mother insisted that the child give the toothbrush and toothpaste to his father. The teacher said that she would discuss it with the other teachers and the principal and they would work out a gift idea for the father.
