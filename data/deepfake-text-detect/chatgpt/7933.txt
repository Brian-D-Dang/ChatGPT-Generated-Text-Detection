Breastfeeding in public is a natural and normal act that provides essential nutrition to a baby, and should not be equated with indecent exposure. Breastfeeding mothers have the right to feed their babies at any time and place, as long as they are not being disruptive or breaking any laws. Moreover, many countries have laws that protect women's right to breastfeed in public, recognizing it as a basic human right. It is important to destigmatize breastfeeding in public and support mothers who choose to breastfeed, rather than shame them for simply providing nourishment to their child.
