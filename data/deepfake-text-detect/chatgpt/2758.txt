Personally, I'm not religious, so I guess I'm trying to get some insight here. Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything wrong ever and if that god, or whatever its called, does exist then why would he let people suffer? The same reason all of creation suffers. It's only possible at this one moment in time for everything around us to be perfect, but there will never come a point when evil ceases being created by natural forcespeople.
