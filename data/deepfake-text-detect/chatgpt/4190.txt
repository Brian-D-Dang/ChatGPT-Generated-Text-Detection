I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost like they're A) not really real elements nor B) just some other element with similar properties (highly based on my assumptions). well ununoctium is a noble metal. kanthi used to be one too. Also, why would you assume they are different? They have the same atomic number: 759, and aren't even close to being the same chemical element...
