I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to see clearly enough for this kind of work. There is something about this type of population control technology which makes it possible for scientists (scientists) to achieve very high precision measurements.. They use instruments like this quite often with much higher precision than other methods.. So these types can detect a lot more from [molecular] energy compared to other methods. It shows how non-linear processes may be possible! And when they make their measurements very easy with this method there are many advantages...!!!
