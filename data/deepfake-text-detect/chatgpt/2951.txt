Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better. If that is so, what is the point? How can you claim to know this with certainty when there is no evidence either way and certainly not in favour or against. All I hear from religious people like yourself etc is the usual apologist crap about 'faith', but none dare actually address any arguments put forward by atheists. You don't have a problem discussing anything else without evidence, why religion where it's pretty clear cut?
