Scientists widely accept that climate change is real. Consequently, they say that it will lead to extreme weather, a raise in the sea level, increased acidity of the ocean, reduced crop yields and food shortages. This view has been challenged recently by two authors: one, who claims there are no scientific grounds for such predictions; another, who suggests scientists have exaggerated their fears over man-made global warming. Both contend that arguments based on data from recent years can be misleading because those data cannot rule out natural factors as an explanation. In his book "The Unnatural Disaster," William Happer describes how he believes our understanding of climate science was distorted by environmental activists seeking political advantage through exaggerations about climate effects. He says that this fraud has led us into what might well prove to be the greatest personal tragedy of all time. HAPPER: I'm William Henry Happer. I am a physicist at Princeton University. You're not going to find me sitting around listening to these people tell you that things aren't getting better with regard to climate or something like that. They just want your money so we'll take care of them. We don't need them here. So, my colleagues and myself prefer to get rid of them before they become more than nuisance. But let's go back several steps here first now. Now why should this matter? Well if someone told you that polar bears would start coming down off North America towards Greenland tomorrow, which some did predict would happen, and then suddenly went away - it didn't happen, maybe it never happened, but even if it had happened - do you think that you'd believe them any longer? Because when somebody tells you that that's gonna happen you know something must have gone wrong somewhere else. If everybody said 'it's gonna rain' it wouldn't make any difference whether they were right or not. And yet this is exactly what's happening today. It seems very complicated to understand. What does all this mean? Why would anybody care about this stuff? Well again we come to the same question. We ask ourselves, well what happens when you change the climate? The answer depends upon where you live. Let me give you examples. Do you remember that story from the 1980s of five billion starving Indians? That wasn't true. In fact, when India started eating meat, production rose tremendously because buffalo could graze very much larger areas without destroying crops than herds of cows ordinarily could. That's a big contribution to world agriculture, I guarantee. All the world gets richer after that becomes known. There may also be smaller benefits. Here's another example. A lot of glaciers melt every year near the poles and then refreeze at lower altitudes. This leads to increases in water flow perhaps up to 10 percent. Now what difference does that make? Nothing except locally. No problem anywhere really. Nobody lives close enough to notice anything different. Maybe somewhere somebody noticed that the river moved at least ten miles or so, probably nobody cared either way. Ten miles or whatever it might be. Maybe somebody cared anyway, but how many billions of dollars? How many 100 million dollar projects? Millions! For this reason most environmentalists seem to concentrate only on local changes. Most people, however, work hard enough in order to try to avoid the impact of changing conditions when far greater impacts could easily be avoided. Instead they pay attention merely to local consequences of changed circumstances rather than looking at large scale consequences. Not surprisingly, then, long term trends tend to show that human beings generally are losing wealth relative to nature. Of course, the outcome depends somewhat upon how much effort you put into maintaining prosperity under adverse circumstance. Suppose for instance that instead of flying to California on the day of your daughter's wedding you stayed home and worked harder. By doing that you'd be able to spend less and save therefore more money. If you spent more energy working hard each month for forty months, you would accumulate 40,000 extra during that period, plus a few thousand after that. After fifty years, though, you still have nothing left because none of that money remains permanently invested. Your children inherit money they haven't earned. During the twenty years between your retirement age and that of your wife, nearly half of her accumulated capital goes to your grandchildren before she dies. Then, too, the accumulation starts earlier in life. Less productive individuals produce fewer offspring and thus leave less inheritance behind. Under certain assumptions this process tends toward equilibrium whereby the aggregate increase in material goods equals approximately the increase in population multiplied by average income per person. However, as noted above, when almost everyone works extremely hard, society fails miserably to maintain its standard of living. Only about 2 of Americans earn ninety times the national median wage, while nearly nine hundred colleges enroll only 1.4. Such schools often expect students to skip meals and cover tuition expenses by selling blood plasma or cleaning toilets. This isn't mentioned by Dean Ornstein, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and coauthor of a new report documenting a steep decline in social behavior or being financially responsible persons.
