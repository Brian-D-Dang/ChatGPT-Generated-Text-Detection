I am an American High School student who was taught 2 different versions of the Civil war throughout my schooling career. In elementary school we first learned about the civil rights movement, American history and WWII from a book written by Richard Nixon as part of The Black Panther Party. I have been researching for over 3 years now with the help of researchers from all around the world to see what it means to be black, white and Hispanic in America - how do you fit into this world? What is your experience living abroad? Thank you for your time Kayla
