This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in the universe, you are crazy. And, if you do think alien life exists elsewhere in the universe, you are a heretic. We are all heretics in one way or another. The third question: does the Creator have a favorite among us? We have been asked this question thousands of times in the last 40 years. I've asked it myself. What do you say? That God loves us all equally, even though he might have a favorite. That God favors us all equally, even though he has a favorite. I've asked the question, and you've asked the question, and most of us have never heard the answer. What does the Bible have to say about this? It doesn't say anything about this. Do we have to answer this question? No, we don't have to answer this question. But, just because we don't have to answer this question, that doesn't mean we can't answer this question. The Bible doesn't say anything about it, but I think we can answer it. The Creator is a God of order. The universe is a very big place. The universe is not a very old place. The Creator is not a God of chaos. We are a people who like order. We are a people who like order. So, we like to think that God has a favorite among us. It is our human desire to want to be special. So, the question is: does the Creator have a favorite among us? If God had a favorite, would that be fair to the other people? If God had a favorite, that would not be fair to the other people. How would that be fair? If you say that God has a favorite, that would be an unfair world. If God had a favorite, he would be showing partiality. That is not fair to everyone else. "So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy." "For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel." We cannot be fair to everyone. We cannot be fair to everyone, but the Creator is. That is why we are all equal before the Creator. That is why we are all equal before the Creator. Even though he might have a favorite. We have heard this CMV about the Creator's favorite. Thank you for joining us, and thank you for your comments. Do you have any thoughts to add?
