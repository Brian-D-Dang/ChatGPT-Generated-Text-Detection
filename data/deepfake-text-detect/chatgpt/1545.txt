If this is a duplicate post, I apologize, an AutoMod told my my old version was too short and that it was removed. Here's my logic, though: If I get banned for posting the same link twice in 24 hours - which doesn't seem to be the case here anyway; they're just asking me "How come you were banned?" rather than checking if there are multiple posts on the subject- then why am I allowed 3 posts per day? I see what your saying but don't feel like we need the "3 times in one day only" rule either
