I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost as if somebody was saying 'yeah!'. Absolutely amazing. Yeah, it seems like it'll be something that people will rely on to make their lives easier than ever before. It might even form a part of some sort of community (and maybe even encourage more people to go out and get involved). And the nuclear weapons are just one instance where it would be a good idea for us not to worry about what they can do with them. We're not really thinking about them now anyway, because we don't have any experience with them either.
