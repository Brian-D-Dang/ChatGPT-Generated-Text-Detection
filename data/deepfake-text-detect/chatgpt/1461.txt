Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking he's dead and can't believe that they actually sent him back there to die in peace after all this time without telling anyone what happened. He survives by eating ice cream from a vending machine made out of an old space shuttle while avoiding deadly hypothermia for two months before coming home (he also faces a lot more challenges than you might think). He gets rescued by NASA and discovers how much work it is going to take to get humans to Mars, but he still thinks if we could do it once, we could probably do it again given enough money. In fact, he's even making plans with his wife about having their own colony now! Now play: Watch this: 'The Martian' Review: A fun sci-fi romp As far as books go, there are a few things I've learned already like "the cold kills," but other than that my perspective hasn't changed really at all since reading Matt Damon's actual memoir The Right Stuff. But one thing I noticed very quickly was there were some major differences between being trapped on a spacecraft drifting through outer space vs. living inside your house or apartment during an emergency evacuation due to fire, hurricane or earthquake. Even though I would have been able to sustain myself based solely off what little foodwater supplies I had left outside the spaceship as long as no power went down, getting stuck inside a building would be hell. It's not something people who aren't used to such things should easily dismiss when faced with that situation unless they literally know nothing about any kind of disaster scenario, so don't discount it too quickly. Water containers clogged? No water supply? No pressure tankers because everyone evacuated? Oh man...
