Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. Cabo clearly demonstrates that this needn't be so - indeed it's a good thing for American consumers who want lower prices and more competition on transcontinental flights (it costs less than 1M per route made illegal). It would also help Mexico by enhancing its international image as an aviation powerhouse with low-cost service from New York JFK via DallasFort Worth or Phoenix [Dallas] through Guadalajara into South America... If Mexicans could once again buy tickets cheaper nonstop outside their country instead being forced onto connecting routings across North Central part og Latin Ameria then they'd have one fewer reason left besides price competitiveness alone justifying visits there. The USD 250 billion Mexican economy needs all such economic liftins even when some may seem small at first glance too! Plus no matter how much we grumble about getting stuck In Line At Immigration With Other Non Americans Getting Cheaper Flights Through Our Tax Dollars Pays Off On This Count Too Or Does It? Update: Since I wrote above referring only mostly especially economically "small" ones - staying overnight without visa restrictions etc., perhaps reaching outlying places like Cancun has got me thinking big picture wise here: We are certainly talking major dollars though whether politically correct enough times yet seems up top still but never mind what others think really because regardless category level everyone does benefit overall. Sure politics might factor somewhere down below something else along these lines maybe someday soon sure BUT while waiting surely doesn " t hurt either anyway:)
