CMV: ISIS isn't about the US, it isn't about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isn't about us, and to call it a terrorist organization is just as stupid as calling it a terrorist organisation." The Washington Post reported Friday that the FBI has received an explosive allegation against Assad by an anonymous source who described him as "one of Syria's most dangerous sons." Assad said on Sunday in a statement released separately from inside Syria that his government had been under attack since last week when he began failing to send troops home after weeks of protests erupted across Syria following a series of airstrikes targeting his regime ally Damascus earlier this month. Assad told CNN that the recent bombing raids were ordered through thousands of drones deployed around Damascus by Russia for implementation purposes - claiming responsibility for a large number of civilian deaths during previous protests in exile over corruption allegations surrounding his ruling family members. Syrian opposition groups say they have evidence proving Assad ordered these attacks while he continues to deny being involved with bombing campaigns. Those supporting Assad allege Assad was behind bombs planted at rebel positions near Damascus' airport along with others attacking them there including an undisclosed chemical weapons facility outside Damascus destroyed by rebels fighting alongside Syrian rebels killed in clashes between Kurdish militia fighters opposed to Assad and Turkey-backed rebels. Al Jazeera reported Tuesday that Syria's opposition supporters have complained of injuries suffered upon arriving in the country illegally especially among refugees fleeing violence caused by Assad loyalists militias responsible for offensive operations against Kurdish YPG militants around Damascus. Putin urged United Nations Security Council action against Syria Wednesday saying use of force would be counterproductive toward Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime despite calls for diplomacy to stop the bloodshed.
