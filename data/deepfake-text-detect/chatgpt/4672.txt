Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of black men graduating high school with a STEM degree, etc., I am reminded that there is a lot more diversity (or perhaps I should put it better: plurality) than those who would like us all to think we are largely identical. There are many reasons for this. One major reason is that most human beings have some variation on one large set of genes which can be traced back a long time and gives rise to different physical features, as well as differences due to culture, religion, ethnicity, race, nationality, age, gender, sexual orientation etc... For example, although you may look Chinese, your ancestors were probably not born in China but somewhere else. The same goes for me. There are also variations within each category. We are all born from our parents' lineages, so they tend to inherit things like color of hair, eye color, amount of freckles etc.. Some children will get copies of "extra" chromosomes. Most often these extra chromosome sets remain dormant until puberty when they become active. So if you have daughters only one type (XX XXX XXXXXX XX) will pass down through multiple generations but if she has two types (XXX XX XXX XXX XX or XXX XXX XXXXXXX XX), then her daughter could end up with either having an additional copy of certain segments of DNA. This process results in recombination where parts of the genome swap around and change places resulting in vastly differing looking individuals among families. If we continue this genetic shuffling further, an individual's family tree becomes very complex. Because of this complexity, scientists have found several sites along the genomes that contain instructions how proteins assemble into tissues. On top of being able to tell whether someone looks Caucasian or Asian by their skin tone, one could now use techniques such as Y-chromosome analysis to determine what part of Africa does your great-grandfather come from. Not exactly useful information unless you want to do genealogy research, however, because most white Americans have at least three grandparents from Europe so their ancestry traces back to India, Ethiopia etc.. As another example, most whites trace their ancestry to Western Asia while East Asians generally carry less EuropeanAsian ancestry. In other words, at any given point in history, most humans lived closer to home. People travel over land faster than sea travel did. Over thousands of years, cultures move away from where they first arose. When they reach Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand etc., they adopt practices that make them similar to the original inhabitants. Thus Europeans today both eat potatoes and drink beer whereas Native Americans had no easy way to store food out of season; thus a staple crop was corn grown year round. From the perspective of the outside world, even twins are actually quite distinct since they share the same environment during childhood. Twins tend to grow up together year after year until adolescence when they begin to form boundaries between themselves and others. After that, their personalities diverge strongly. And yet, psychologists have shown that twin girls show greater similarities than twin boys! Similarities include personality traits like extroversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness and internalization of values. Differences appear when comparing the sexes including interests in sports versus arts, education and careers, and father figures. Also, personality changes drastically based upon current events. Personality development cannot occur without social interaction nor can social interactions develop without personality. Since most human populations exist on separate continents with little communication, knowledge of genetics passed via vertical transmission still dominates reproduction patterns. However, the last few centuries have seen significant scientific advances allowing researchers to take a broader view and compare entire genomes across species, ethnic groups, genders, ages etc... All this means that every single person alive today carries inside his or her body the complete inheritance of previous humanity. Even though 500 and 1000 years ago half the population of Europe was wiped out by bubonic plague, modern day Europeans retain enough technology to conduct experiments that mimic the effects of radiation poisoning and create mutants. Recently, postmodernists sought to explain why apes appeared capable of speech but didn't generate sign language instead investigating the idea that chimpanzees might harbor latent linguistic ability. Still, apes lack neocortex making them unable to control their impulses and produce spontaneous statements. Humans developed spoken languages because language allows us to communicate thoughts in ways previously impossible for nonverbal animals, especially young ones. Given literally millions of dead bodies buried under mounds of rubble for hundreds of years but ultimately cleared of disease and poverty worldwide, natural selection has done its job. Why? Natural Selection never acts directly on behavior - rather it works indirectly by selecting organisms that survive longer and reproduce more successfully than other members of their group. What makes something successful? It depends upon context. A good female provider will give birth to healthy offspring, therefore females and males will compete for mates. Mothers caring for infants will help raise their own children thereby increasing the probability their child will live long enough and reproduce successfully.
