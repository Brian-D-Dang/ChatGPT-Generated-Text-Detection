Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better. If that is so, what is the value of reading fiction? While it is true that other sources of information can help us grow and learn, reading fiction can also be a valuable tool for personal growth and development. Fiction can help us develop empathy for others, challenge our preconceived notions, and provide a safe space to explore complex emotions and experiences. Through fictional characters and narratives, we can gain insights into human behavior and relationships, and discover new perspectives. Moreover, fiction can provide an escape from reality, which can be beneficial for mental health and stress relief. Reading a good story can offer a temporary reprieve from the stresses of everyday life, allowing us to recharge and approach our problems with a fresh perspective. In short, while non-fiction can provide valuable information and help us learn, fiction can offer unique benefits that shouldn't be overlooked.
