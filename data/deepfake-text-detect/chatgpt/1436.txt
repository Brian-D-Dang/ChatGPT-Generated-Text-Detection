Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. The FAA requires that all international flights must have a U.S.-based crew and maintain U.S. standards for safety or be approved by Transport Canada, which does require most flight crews from third countries to hold American citizenship. If I'm flying domestically out of Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), what do I need? What do I need to know about other airports? Do I also need to carry my passport when I travel internationally? As always, make sure you check with the TSA on how they will screen you before leaving home - there are no restrictions at EWR right now since it's outside the "red zone" but it may change soon as the coronavirus crisis continues. If you're traveling internationally, you'll probably want to double-check security requirements so you don't come back empty handed. Passports should still be valid even after this health emergency ends; however, it's important to note that some airports are asking travelers to show that their passports expire within 90 days ahead of time instead of one year like they usually would, so keep an eye on those changes. How Long Does It Take To Get From Miami To New York City On A Plane? Is It Safe? Will I Always Have To Board First And Be This Far Back In Line? It depends! Planes generally take off around 11:00 am local time depending on wind speed. They land anywhere from 1 - 5 hours later. So, if you get into the airport early enough, then the wait shouldn't last more than 30 minutes tops unless something goes horribly wrong during takeoff or landing. But remember, just because you book a flight today doesn't mean you won't need to rebook tomorrow afternoon...especially once we get past summer vacation season and people start getting ready for fall semester classes. I had planned to visit Boston for graduation weekend next month...that was canceled, too. Any advice on where else I might go besides Florida, California and Washington DC? Although universities across Massachusetts, including Harvard University, MIT and BU have suspended lectures due to COVID-19 concerns until March 31st, many students who live on campus are choosing to stay put despite guidance urging them to leave town for spring break. However, beyond driving through it en route to somewhere closer in proximity to their families, Boston has plenty of options to explore safely without breaking quarantine rules while practicing social distancing guidelines. For instance, Fenway Park offers a great view of both city skyline landmarks and the glorious Green Monster over the centerfield wall. And, better yet, parking isn't insanely expensive here either - think 25day for garage passes. You could easily spend 4 nights strolling The Freedom Trail and eating delicious food along the way. Or take advantage of our beautiful coastal waters and hop aboard a water taxi tour through Chinatown and North End for the full experience. Don't forget to hop on Seaport Walkway when visiting the historic district for a glimpse of Southie itself!
