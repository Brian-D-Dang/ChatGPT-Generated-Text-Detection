One counter-argument to this opinion could be that it depends on personal preference and context. While some people may prefer apples over oranges, others may have the opposite preference. Additionally, in certain situations, such as making a smoothie or juice, oranges may be the better option due to their juiciness and flavor profile. In contrast, apples may be a better choice for baking or cooking due to their firm texture and ability to hold their shape. Ultimately, claiming that one fruit is universally better than the other does not take into account individual taste preferences and different culinary uses.
