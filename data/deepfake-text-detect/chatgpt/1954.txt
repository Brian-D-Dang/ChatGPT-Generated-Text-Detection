Im probably going to ramble on and such so I will make my point clear from the way I see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice or well thought out, i really don't care about that but you get what im saying The reason why we arent having a world war 3 right now is because of how easy nuclear weapons have become for anyone with enough money (or no morals) to obtain them. Anyone can buy one in any country and they dont even need much training to use properly (especially if its hand held). This means there would be hundreds of thousands instantly turn into soldiers just waiting around somewhere ready to strike at anytime. The US has tons of troops stationed all over the globe, these countries know this and know their fate and wont risk attacking us unless we attack first! Even then some people believe RussiaChina would support those nations rather than fight against eachother themselves which leads me onto another topic... Another thing stopping WW3 right now? One word: Politics. World leaders like Putin for example want nothing more than to stay in power as long as possible, he doesnt give two shits who gets bombed when hes sitting pretty eating caviar every night while reading his latest book by candlelight thanks to being able to stockpile supplies underground forever thanks to nukes keeping him safe.. He wont start anything big until after 2020-2030 due to wanting to try and maintain control of russia before someone else does (cough cough putin's son coughing, hes younger than obama), thats my opinion anyway:) If politicians were removed tomorrow though and replaced with geniuses who cared for everyone instead of thinking only about making extensions off their own lives longer doomsday might arrive earlier: (All joking aside politics could stop WW3 happening within days yet still remain incredibly hard to deal with since most political decisions tend to take years to pass through multiple stages where many things change between each stage meaning we may never reach an agreement without outside help aka aliens lol jk....kinda:P
