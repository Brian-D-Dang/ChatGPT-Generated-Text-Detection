First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from a different perspective and that's cool too! My personal experience has been that you have to be super careful with driving when your car weighs so much (especially if it's loaded down). They can cause head-on collisions easily.
