First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I feel like if you plan on becoming an MD or educator then there's no way around going to college for at least 4 years (well unless your family is incredibly wealthy). Is it not possible? You're talking about getting into med school here... If someone wants in they will get in..
