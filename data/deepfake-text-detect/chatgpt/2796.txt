Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). I am also an avid environmentalist. This means that when it comes to the environment, I do not want to use products or contribute in any way towards the destruction thereof; however at present there is no feasible alternative which does not require extra work from us as individuals, such as using less water, electricity etc. So while I try to minimise these things where possible, ultimately we need further alternatives before significant progress can be made. In addition, given China's past record with regard to pollution, their current economic position, and unwillingness to alter business practices, I don't think they are realistically going to change anytime soon. Therefore what I am proposing here is to look at other solutions i.e. solar power, wind energy, tidal engines...all viable options - but currently unfeasible due to costpractical problems. However if every household contributed one month's worth of money per annum into either a shared fund or dividend account, then you could start investing in new technologies without having to rely upon huge corporations taking the risk themselves. Obviously there will be corruption issues associated with this option, so perhaps the best solution may simply be improving the laws surrounding campaign finance, lobbying etc., to limit people being able to buy politicians' hearts and minds without actually doing anything about making positive changes. If everyone else put aside 1 each year, surely within say 20 years we'd have enough funds to make the necessary investments? Alternatively, maybe as part of higher taxation rates, more people should pay tax by the amount rather than percentage - thus turning what was once considered immoral or illegal into just another investment opportunity. Lastly, I am aware that some species of eagles eat meat. But again, this is something which many animals do, including humans. While extreme animal cruelty may still exist under certain circumstances, I personally believe that most cases today can be traced back to human interference, whether intentional or unintentional. Thus, instead of trying to eliminate entirely unnecessary forms of suffering, why don't we focus on reducing our own involvement first? For example, how can we reduce harmful pesticides used on crops to improve food safety standards whilst allowing farmers to continue to produce and sell foods? Or, even better idea: learn how to grow your own vegetables and fruit, so that you can enjoy them fresh (if you choose) rather than dried out, heated up or chemically treated versions already available at supermarkets?! There is much room for improvement in terms of ethical consumption and production methods, yet very little action has been taken as regards the issue. Perhaps since more people were willing to take ownership over their personal decisions like smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol in excess etc., it might carry through to other areas too...? Just thinking aloud. As far as Capitalism goes, all the statistics show that income inequality continues to rise worldwide despite increasing productivity levels, technological advancements, improved living conditions and growth overall. The same applies to unemployment although we've managed to keep those figures relatively stable recently thanks largely to government intervention. Nowadays technology seems capable of producing jobs faster than ever before - especially considering advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, biotech research and nanotechnology - yet employment rates remain high. Ultimately though, regardless of what policies governments adopt, you cannot legislate against globalisation; least of all now given Brexit negotiations appear almost complete (although they probably won't go away quietly!). It is therefore vital that we educate ourselves on the consequences of free market economics and ensure that future generations understand the pitfalls involved. We must also constantly fight to retain control over our labour rights and put pressure on representatives to protect workers and communities alike. Regarding both climate change and job markets, I strongly feel that longer-term contracts between employers and employees offer greater stability for both parties compared to short-term agreements only based around profit margins. Most importantly we have to realise that wages should NOT dictate poverty or starvation and equality SHOULD be achieved at ALL costs. Some economists predict "peak oil" sometime around 2030, meaning that unless alternative fuels become widely accepted throughout society, a large proportion of citizens won't survive beyond 30 years time. Meanwhile, the population keeps growing exponentially despite dwindling resources and falling birth rates. Unless drastic measures are taken immediately to stop population growth spiralling out of control AND further efforts are made to curb greenhouse gas emissions drastically, I fear civilisation itself may collapse before 2050. At some point during our lifetime, hopefully sooner rather than later, we are likely to face serious challenges ahead such mass migration and resource shortages among others. No doubt wars and conflicts will undoubtedly increase dramatically alongside civil unrest until the situation stabilises. When combined together with an ageing population resulting in fewer young workers contributing taxes and social security payments, I foresee greater financial burdens placed on businesses and consumers alike in order to maintain services like healthcare and education effectively. Given that automation and AI technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated day after day, eventually robots will replace fast majority of jobs leaving humanity seriously struggling to find purpose........ etc......em..
