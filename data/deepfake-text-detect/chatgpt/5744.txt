First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" does. I'm using it here because I am interested in the original definition of the word, and I don't like what's happened to the word "feminism" since it was coined. I think that "egalitarian" is more accurate for my purposes. If you'd rather not use it, then use "equalitarian" or just plain "equalist" or "equalist feminism." The definition is the same either way. An equalist is someone who believes in equal rights, equal responsibilities, and equal opportunities for all. I think that equality is something to be fought for. As a white woman, I am not born with a right to any benefits. I am not born with the right to be above anyone. I am not born with a right to a job or to housing, or to food, or to the ability to go to school. I am not born with a right to make laws or a right to have a say in what laws are made. I am not born with the right to vote, or to have a say in what laws are made. I am not born with a right to fair treatment. And yet, I am guaranteed all of these things simply because I am born a woman. I am not born with a right to speak in public, to go out of my home unchaperoned, or to get an education. I am not born with the right to be treated as a human being. I am not born with the right to choose what I do with my body or what kind of birth control I use. I am not born with the right to be safe from violence in my own home. And yet, I am guaranteed these things simply because I am born a woman. What I mean by "feminist" is that I believe women should have equal rights and equal opportunities as men. I believe that women should be treated as people, not as chattel, and that women should have the same rights as men, and that men and women should have equal opportunities in life. I'm not talking about a return to the 1950s, where all women had to be housewives, and where women couldn't have equal opportunities in life. I'm not talking about a world where women have to be forced to wear ridiculous, uncomfortable, and demeaning clothing in order to keep their jobs, or where women are expected to be virgins before marriage. I'm not talking about a world where women can't vote. I'm talking about a world where women have equal opportunities to men, and where women are treated equally to men. I'm talking about a world where women have the same rights as men, and where women have the same rights as men, and where women have the same rights as men, and where women have the same rights as men. I'm talking about a world where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to be successful, and where women are able to
