A possible counter-argument could be: While it is true that bicycles have unique characteristics such as their size and mobility that differentiate them from cars, they still share the same roadways and pose similar risks to other users. Traffic laws are designed to ensure safety and efficiency for all road users, and they should be followed by everyone regardless of the type of vehicle they are using. Failure to obey traffic rules by bicyclists not only endangers themselves, but also puts pedestrians and drivers at risk. Moreover, obeying traffic laws helps to promote a culture of shared responsibility and respect among all road users, which is essential for fostering a sustainable and healthy urban environment. Therefore, bicyclists should be required to follow the same rules as cars to promote safety and fairness on the roadways.
