In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they no longer feel like it or want it is a violation of bodily autonomy as well! And right now I am having a conversation with my partner about our relationship and the future. He said he wants to start taking more risks in bed because it makes him happy. But sometimes being adventurous can mean getting wet - which doesn't make sense to me anyway since my connection with women isn't based on sexual gratification. Anyway, this is something he has never discussed before so I don't know what to think. Does anyone else find this situation extremely frustrating? First off you're not wrong It's very hard for guys who aren't necessarily into women to understand why some women are attracted sexually to them...but it sounds like your guy really likes you and enjoys touching you (it may be too much), but just hasn't been able to communicate his feelings until recently. If I were you I'd talk to him again...and ask if there's anything you could do differently to get him even more excited. Even though it'll be difficult, I still believe it would help him develop a more genuine interest in sex in general.
