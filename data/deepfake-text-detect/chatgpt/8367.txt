There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: Then I went to go see it again and he had an interpreter with him! What's up? The only thing that has really ever annoyed me is when they show some short clip from another Disney film on one channel while you're watching something else in full screen right next door (like Star Wars). They'll have two commercials for different things playing side by each other just so there will be more programming time available because no matter what your interests are or how much we spend our lives trying as humans not too get sucked into consuming everything around us...we always do anyway somehow;)
