I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry liberals tend to think. My problem with this is there are some things you shouldn't be able to get into legally without being proven mentally stable for example marrying an underage girl or having sex with your sister because she's hot and it would make Jesus happy.
