Country music was not always bad. There were legends such as Johnny Cash who defined what country music was. However, today the country music culture is full of songs about cheating and drug addiction along with a plethora of political correctness that no longer resembles Country Music at all. Kenny Rogers song "Lady" fits into this category perfectly. You can hear some politicians speaking of Lady Liberty while wearing cowboy hats in their own version of Americana. These people should spend more time listening to Kenny's music instead of just watching Fox News. It would be nice if they took a trip down memory lane once every year or so and listened to something real for a change!
