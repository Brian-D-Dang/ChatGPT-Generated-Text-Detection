The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as business suits). It's also worth noting that I exposed this concept to most people whom it could possibly have been relevant for. Concerning revoking your tattoos: if you do decide against keeping them and get new ones instead then they will likely become less prominent over time with age anyway so there won't really much difference between getting removed or simply fading away due natural causes - one way might even cost more than another depending upon what type (s) are used!
