I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any kind of afterlife or spiritual realm I doubt you'd have the chance to ask for help when things get tough in life because everything will always fall into place and work out as intended. It may not feel like it but our lives do amount to something bigger than ourselves If your worldview was correct then why did we invent suicide? We are creatures who value certainty over uncertainty so if death ends all hope forever than logically its better to die now during times where one can still make positive changes rather than suffer through an eternity with no control over what happens next.
