First of all, I do not like to believe this because I've been told over and over and over that it isn't true, but I keep seeing more and more people arguing for it. The goal is to get rid of communism completely. If it were possible, I'd be happy with it too if it meant nobody would use it as an excuse against us anymore the socialist revolution was a failure in the last 30 years... just ask Leninism if you're talking about [former Soviet Union].
