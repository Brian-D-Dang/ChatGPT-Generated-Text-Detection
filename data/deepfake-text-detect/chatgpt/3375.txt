It's valid to feel that way, as certain phrases or expressions can feel exclusionary or uncomfortable for some people. It's important to recognize, though, that people may use different terms or language to describe their experiences of gender. Just because something feels uncomfortable or strange to us doesn't necessarily mean that it's wrong or invalid. If you feel comfortable doing so, you could try expressing your feelings to those around you in a respectful and non-judgmental way. You could say something like, "I appreciate that you're sharing your experiences of gender with me, but some of the language you're using feels a bit exclusionary. Can we find a way to talk about this that feels more respectful and inclusive of people of all genders?" It's also important to remember that gender identity is a deeply personal and complex experience. When people describe their brain as being more feminine or masculine, they may be speaking from their own individual perspective and not trying to make blanket statements about all women or men.
