First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways of understanding and experiencing the world around them is very different from humans. So you want to tell me that if you give your dog some toys with real flowers on them it will understand what's going on? I am not expecting my dog to understand anything about what i'm doing or thinking either. It just so happens that in many situations her brain can override our voices and thoughts any day and she ends up following them no matter how much we try to change course
