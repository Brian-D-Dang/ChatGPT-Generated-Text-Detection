A multitude of films have twists in the plot, for example Gone Girl, Memento, a lot of films of M. Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well, I could go on for hours, but I'll just mention that The Game by David Fincher was the first film I ever watched where I had a proper twist in the plot moment, one that had me gasping, and that was when I realised that Sean Penn's character was actually The Architect. That film is brilliant, and I highly recommend it. Now, I have just watched the new Netflix Original series, The OA. I wasn't very hopeful about this show, but it's so good that I'm writing this post on it anyway. The first episode starts off with a little girl named Prairie, who is kidnapped and kept in a cage, and then we skip to five years later, and she is rescued from her captor, and the first person she meets when she gets home is her father. Then the next episode jumps to 10 years later and she is a successful blind dancer who gives a TED talk to a classroom full of people, and she reveals that she can now see. I just had to share my thoughts on this, because I haven't seen a show like this in a while, and I haven't been this excited about a TV show since Stranger Things. This show is utterly bizarre, and I mean that in the best way possible. It is very abrupt, and it takes place in a very strange, yet beautiful world. I love that the characters are all odd, and the show is quite artsy. I have seen reviews on it from people who really disliked it, but it is really intriguing, and I think it gets better with every episode, and I have not been able to stop thinking about it, it's so odd and beautiful. I am still on the first season, but I can't wait to finish it so I can start the second one. I really like that it keeps me guessing. I have no idea what's going to happen next, and that is a good thing. I really love that it's on Netflix, and I hope they make a second season, because I really want to know what happens next.

I'm not going to lie, I'm not very well read, and I'm very slowly reading a book called, The Art of Being Normal, which is a book that I am really enjoying, it's about a boy who has to go to school for a week as a girl because his parents don't know how to tell him that he is intersex, and he finds out that his best friend is intersex too. I'm very glad that I am finally reading this book, and I really hope it has a happy ending, because I think that it is really important that we have books with happy endings about intersex people, because a lot of people don't know that intersex people exist, and if we have books where the intersex characters have a happy ending, I think it will raise awareness, and make intersex people feel more accepted.

I'm going to start off this post by saying that I am very interested in censorship, especially the way that governments censor different things, and I am going to be talking about the way that the Thai government censors things, especially YouTube. In the UK, most YouTube videos don't have any restrictions, and we can see whatever we want on YouTube. I sometimes get videos on my YouTube recommendations which have restricted content on it, but it's not very often, and it is not a big deal, most of the time. However, in Thailand, people can't see a lot of videos on YouTube, and most of the time, the videos that they do see, they have to click on the age restriction button, and then they can view the video, but this process of having to do that every time you want to see a video, can be really frustrating, especially if you want to watch something on YouTube, and you've just got to wait for it to finish before you can see it. Now, there are a lot of reasons why people think that the Thai government should let people watch whatever they want on YouTube, and one of those reasons is that if they keep on having to click on
