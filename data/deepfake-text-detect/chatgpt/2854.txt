First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" does. So how do you explain to someone unfamiliar with your ideology that "you're egalitarian but also feminist"? Second: How did you first learn about feminism? What made you decide to become an actual practising feminist instead of just an egalitarian who thinks women should be treated as equals? This isn't my area so if this has been covered already let me know! But here's some answers for you. 1) You can say 'I'm fighting for equality between menwomen'. 2) The fight against sexism comes under the idea of Libertarian Feminism', which basically states that all forms of oppression are linked together including racism etc..
