The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it is important to note the difference. Morality refers to personal beliefs and values about what is right and wrong, while legality refers to what is permitted by the law. So, someone could believe that abortion is morally wrong, but still believe that it should be legal for others to obtain. On the other hand, someone could believe that abortion is morally permissible, but think that it should be illegal for various reasons such as concerns for the person's health or other societal implications. It's important to keep in mind these distinctions and to have respectful conversations with others who may have different beliefs or opinions.
