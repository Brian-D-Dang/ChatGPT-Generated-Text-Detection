In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is considered a "violation of a fundamental right" that can lead to criminal prosecution. We treat rape victims with utmost respect. And yet, we have decided that forcing someone to get an abortion is not a violation of their body autonomy. When we say that it is the woman's body, we need to also realize that it is also the baby's body. It is, in fact, the woman's body and the baby's body. Anne McGuire said... I'm a woman and I think abortion is morally wrong. I'm not going to try to make people think abortion is wrong; I'm just going to say that I feel abortion is wrong. I get your argument that there is an inherent wrongness in the unwillingness to let a woman decide what happens to her body. It's not even a particularly controversial argument, so much so that it's unlikely anyone who doesn't already agree with you would even bother to argue against it. So, if I can summarize, your argument is that a woman's body belongs to her, but the baby's body also belongs to the woman, and it is wrong to force someone to give up her body against her will. If that's the case, you're going to have to do something better than to simply argue that the baby's body belongs to the woman. I'm not going to argue that it doesn't, I just want to know how you're going to explain why it's wrong to force a woman to give up her body against her will, but it's not wrong to force a woman to give up her body against her will for the child that is developing within her body. It's kind of like saying "I'm not going to argue that 2 2 4, I just want to know how you're going to explain why 2 2 5." I agree with Anne, to force a woman to give up her body against her will is a violation of her rights. I'm not sure how that equates to not being "fundamental" since we don't force people to give up their bodies against their will for other actions either. In fact, I don't know how you can argue that abortion is fundamental to women's rights since it doesn't seem to be a fundamental right for men to have access to the same. Of course, I'm not sure how you could argue that forcing a woman to have an abortion is a fundamental right. If you do, you also have to argue that it's a fundamental right to force a woman to have an abortion, which seems a bit illogical. I'm sorry, but this is utterly illogical. What's the difference between the woman's body and the fetus' body? It's still the woman's body. You're arguing that the woman's body is "not hers" while the fetus' body is. The fetus is not "hers," either. It's not about the fetus' body. It's about the woman's body. As far as I know, forcing a woman to give up her body against her will is considered a violation of her body autonomy. If the baby is part of the woman's body, then forcing her to give up her body against her will is also a violation of the baby's body autonomy. If she has the right to give up her body against her will, the baby has the right to have the woman not give up her body against her will. (Of course, I'm speaking here of a woman who is not being forced to have an abortion against her will. If she is, then there is a very different argument.) Maybe you're right. Maybe the only difference is that the fetus is not the woman's body. But that doesn't mean she can just do whatever she wants to it. If you have a human body that is not part of you, you have to treat that human body with respect. I'm not saying that we should force a woman to have an abortion. I'm saying that we should not force a woman to have an abortion. The baby does not have the right to have the woman not give up her body against her will. The woman does. That's why you can't make a fetus into a person, because to do so would be to rob women of their own
