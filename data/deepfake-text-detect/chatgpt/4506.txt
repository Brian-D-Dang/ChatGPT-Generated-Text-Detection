To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting to this time period, the core seems like it would be useful for me as well, and probably most other children who are only now starting their education in public schools. I was very excited about learning these new skills when they were first released (or at least, I thought so), but there seemed to have been no consideration given to how students with special needs could benefit from them. I mean, something along the lines of "This skill will help you if your name begins with X" simply doesn't cut it. So what can we do? How does one teach or test these subjects while catering to those with particular strengthsneeds? Are there any resources out there that provide such information suggestions? (My own personal question: What kind of changes might be needed in order to adapt the current system towards more inclusive ones?) Update There's also an interesting article on the topic here. While not specifically addressing Common Core specifically, it provides a good overview of broader questions around assessment accommodations for individuals with disabilities. It especially focuses on issues surrounding testing disabled individuals, which has always been an issue since standardized tests are usually administered by people without disability. Here's the link - If anyone knows anything further, please feel free to leave comments below! The author discusses self-testing examples and notes that this may prove difficult because many technical textbooks require a teacher to explain things step by step. He suggests incorporating technology into education instead, however his main example involves automated guided tours used during orientation at Harvard University. The principle behind this idea relies upon being able to connect people to resources via smartphones. Although the possibility exists for taking away the need for teachers altogether, he argues that making use of the internet for teaching alone is insufficient. Teachers should go through the process of building relationships within communities, using real life experiences gained over course of studies, etc... in addition to online courses. Thus, though technological means exist right now to make accessible content easy to find, even easier to consume, doing so requires the human element in schooling. His final point addresses accessibility to all students equally rather than differentiating based on ability level, citing a more holistic approach that assumes differences among learners are valuable. This includes developing curriculum that integrates knowledge across multiple fields of study, enable access to diverse cultural perspectives, foster creative problem solving strategies, encourage higher levels of abstract thinking, etc... As opposed to trying to develop curricula that appeal to everyone regardless of each individual's abilities, differential instruction allows for increased participation by those who struggle, both socially and academically. For instance, specific academic lessons designed to leverage prior experience with similar situations can provide opportunities for those having trouble performing tasks traditionally taught to others. By focusing on these fundamental aspects of "whole child development," educators aim to create environments where students will thrive. Strategies include encouraging peer tutoring programs, extra credit assignments, interactive classroom exercises, collaborative projects, experiential learning methods, social aspect of competitions, field trips, etc... These activities rely heavily on interactions between peers, allowing those struggling with academics to discuss their difficulties with fellow classmates. Because this type of environment encourages interaction, educational institutions must ensure that staff members explicitly recognize each child's unique characteristics and take steps to accommodate individuals with various physical impairments, cognitive deficits, emotional issues, sensory abnormalities, etc... It appears that accommodating every learner to a certain degree isn't feasible, given the nature of society today. However, changing our way of living and adapting to the needs of our youth may yield significant benefits; perhaps even more important that introducing potentially disruptive reforms like Common Core. Individually, these actions won't seem tremendously beneficial. When taken together, though, they'll allow us to better prepare young minds to tackle the challenges of tomorrow. A: You're asking for two entirely separate kinds of ideas. One, you want ways to make the CCSS relevant to kids with certain types of learning disabilities. And then you're asking how best to incorporate everything else into school systems - and whether CCSS itself meets with broad societal approval. As far as 1 goes, see this excellent list put up last year by Neurodiversity Advocacy Network... In brief summary, Section 1 says an LD person requires a lot fewer hours of practice to get proficient in math than someone without one. But later sections say LD folks ought to receive equivalency treatment to other students. So yes, we need less drill work for certain areas, though there needs to be equivalent amounts (with appropriate adaptations) to compensate for difference in natural aptitude of experts insightedness didactylogicians show off, for both kinds of values equal analysis plus prova),).
