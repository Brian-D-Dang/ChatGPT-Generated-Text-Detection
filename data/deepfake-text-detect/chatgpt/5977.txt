Partial Delta for uDHCKris. I'll give you a partial because I do think that New Friends works as a combination option, but I think my CMV is more focused on the need to prioritize strengthening a connection with your partner. Also, because I think it can be a mistake to try to focus too much on the other person's needs, or to assume that you know what their needs are. I'll say that you need to do three things to support uDHCKris: a) Stay in touch regularly. This is just a given. It is essential. b) Stay in touch about what's happening in your lives. About what you're thinking and feeling. This is important for you both because you're still getting to know each other, but also for yourself. You need to be honest with yourselves about what's going on, and you need to do it regularly. c) Stay in touch about what you're thinking and feeling about the relationship, and how you're doing with the communication and connection stuff. And by staying in touch, I mean that you need to actually take the time and effort to do this. You're both busy, so I don't expect you to do this every day, but do it at least once a week. I'm going to recommend that you do it over the phone, because that's the way most people actually do it. I would be concerned if you weren't using the phone because of the way we are now. I will say that if you do this, I think you're going to see a lot of improvement. If you do this, you will be a lot less likely to make the mistake of trying to prioritize the other person's needs over your own. If you're regularly staying in touch about what's happening in your lives, and what you're thinking and feeling about your lives, it will be very difficult to make that mistake. I would also say that you do need to have some kind of weekly commitment to staying in touch with each other. It should be something that is planned ahead of time. I'd say that it should be something that happens regularly, but not every single day. I'd say once a week would probably be good. I would also suggest that you each do one week of each of the following: a) doing the communication and connection stuff together. b) doing the communication and connection stuff apart. c) doing the New Friends stuff together. I think doing all three would be great, but you should do one of the three at a time. I think doing all three at the same time would be too much, and would be less likely to produce results. Well, uDHCKris, we are all busy and we all make mistakes. But I'm hopeful that you will do this and that you will see some results. You sound like you're trying hard, and you have a lot of potential, and I think this can work out. But it's not going to work if you don't do this. My plan for uDHCKris, uDHCKris, I do want to give you a challenge as well, and it's a pretty big challenge. It's probably a bigger challenge than uDHCKris and I have been able to do, and it's going to be really hard. But I think it's going to be worth it. uDHCKris and I have been doing this relationship thing for 20 years. We met 20 years ago in 1992. So we're doing this for a long time. And I think we've got it down to a fine science. It's like we've really got a good system going here. But what I want to propose to you is that you take what we've done and try to do it for 20 years. Let me put it this way. If you and uDHCKris were to get married, I want you to take 20 years and try to do what we've done. I want you to try to do it for 20 years. And if you want, after 20 years, we can sit down and talk about how it went. I'd be happy to sit down and talk with you about what we've done. Here's my plan. I'm going to give you two years. In two years, we're going to sit down and talk. I'm going to ask you how it went. You and uDHCKris are going to do what we've done for 20 years. You're going to do what we did, and you
