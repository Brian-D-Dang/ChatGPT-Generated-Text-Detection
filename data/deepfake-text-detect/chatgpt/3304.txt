Thought about this for days, and I can't think of one aspect of the FPH community that made Reddit better: - They are ignorant: Proven by the overwhelming number of examples of hateful and discriminatory content on their subreddit. This kind of behavior not only drives away potential users who may feel unwelcome, but also creates a toxic environment for those who do participate. - They promote unhealthy habits: FPH actively encouraged unhealthy and dangerous behaviors, such as extreme dieting and exercise, as well as fat-shaming individuals for their weight. This kind of messaging can be damaging to the mental and physical health of individuals and goes against the idea of promoting overall well-being. - They perpetuate harmful stereotypes: FPH often promoted harmful stereotypes about overweight individuals, such as assuming they are lazy or lacking self-control. These stereotypes only serve to further stigmatize and dehumanize an already marginalized group of people. Overall, the FPH community did not add anything constructive or positive to the Reddit community. In fact, their presence only served to create division, promote hate, and perpetuate harmful ideals.
