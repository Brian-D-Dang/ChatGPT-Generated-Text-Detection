There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, but there is no evidence for this. The good news is that economists often want policy makers to keep in mind the size and shape of economic growth, because it's hard to predict whether an economic recovery will be sustainable if growth slows too dramatically. The problem with this argument is that most economists have difficulty finding ways to exclude all possible consequences from their models, not just the effects of growing productivity, which increases employment and limits growth. If any economist thinks President Obama should cut taxes on wealthy Americans, he would likely increase the deficit by 1 trillion. Or at least a recession, that's what economists think of when they think about spending. It's possible that Obama could possibly slash Medicare premiums by 10-15 per year. This effect might work if he doesn't legislate much to avoid higher costs and raise taxes, but it wouldn't work if his plan would reduce many people's income. Look, I don't agree with some of Obama's policies. He's put everyone else first. But we must continue our conversation about how America can grow more prosperous as well. When we talk about "growth," that means looking at the future. Because there's so little time left for us to keep following through on promises made recently about jobs and security. Our current president has promised to eliminate taxes and create additional environmental protections. Many young women have said that their lives would be better off without working in fields where high wages are available. American men have said that stone will be thrown at them if they don't get a job offer. In other words, even though Obama has promised to "crack down" on people who abuse the public assistance system (for example via federal subsidies), we're still waiting to hear him say exactly those things. If you don't know what short sighted thinking like these means, why should you? We should start building our own roads, gas stations, hospitals, schools and other infrastructure. Getting to the bottom of this problem is easy - we already have robust national infrastructure plans and programs targeting areas such as high-speed rail; making sure that people are getting decent pay and benefits (those made easier by increased funding from the government) is one way to accomplish this. But the reality is: you should be able to invest in the next generation of transportation. And so far, we haven't. If elected, we'll need to solve problems with affordable housing, transportation access and clean energy. We can do just that.
