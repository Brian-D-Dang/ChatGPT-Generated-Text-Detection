The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as evening gowns). I think it's more about what you choose to put where rather than how. I'm sure some people will find tattoos unpleasant and for that reason may avoid them or wear long sleeves when out with their SO - its up to one person to decide if they like something enough to get it done!
