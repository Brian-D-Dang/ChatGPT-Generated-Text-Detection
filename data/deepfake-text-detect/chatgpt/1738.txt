I just read this [article] stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering the fact we are all made up of a bunch of races, what is more important? I guess if you want diversity in something it's not race but ethnicity... What changes should be made for schools with high minority populations "high blackhispanic population"
