While it is true that mass piracy can help preserve certain works that might have otherwise been lost or forgotten, it is not a sustainable or legal solution. Piracy usually involves making unauthorized copies of copyrighted materials, which directly infringes on the rights of content creators and publishers. Mass piracy can also make it difficult for creators to make a living and can discourage them from continuing to produce high-quality content, ultimately hurting the creative industries as a whole. Furthermore, relying solely on mass piracy for archiving and preservation is not a fool-proof method. Pirated materials are often subject to poor quality, and it can be challenging to ensure that all the different versions and variations of a work are preserved. Archival and preservation require careful attention to detail, proper storage conditions, and the involvement of professionals who have experience managing and maintaining collections of cultural and historical significance. Ultimately, while piracy may serve a role in preserving some materials, it is not a suitable or sustainable substitute for an organized archival and preservation approach.
