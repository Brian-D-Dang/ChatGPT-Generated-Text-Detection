To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. However, it doesn't seem like this was a very well thought out plan by Trump; more of an "I can go on TV and say this so long as nobody questions it" kind of thing. The issue seems really complex to me It's simple: the guy lied about being born in America for decades, he's still doing so now. He has a whole history of lying about everything from his time in NYC real estate to being a model for the new Star Wars movie. If you're going to pretend to make promises, use your actual words.
