So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But, that said, it's an excellent idea for couples to save up for their own 3-6 months of leave. For a family planning to have 2 children, it might be a good idea to start saving money for your own leave when you have one child. By the time you have two children, you'll have enough time and money set aside to take the entire 6 months. For a family planning to have 3 children, you might have enough money set aside by the time you have 2 children. So, for planning families, it's probably best to start saving when you have one child. And, then, plan to have your own leave, if possible, within 3-6 months of the birth. For families who aren't planning to have kids, I would say that saving for your own leave might be a good thing to do, anyway. It's a good habit for one thing. And, it's great to have a "cushion" if you need to take a leave of absence from work for some other reason, like if you get sick or need to take care of a family member. For families who are in the middle of having kids, the best thing you can do is to have conversations with your partner about what you want to do with your own leave. I think it's helpful to say, "We've got 1 child, and my leave is 3 months, so we have 1.5 years to save for the next one." And, then, when you're having that second child, say, "We've got 1.5 years to save for my leave, and we need to be doing that, too, in addition to saving for child 2." And, when you have your second child, say, "We need to save for my leave now, too." And, then, when you have your third child, say, "We've got 2.5 years to save for my leave. So, we'll start saving, and we'll save for the next two kids." The thing is, we don't necessarily have to save the same amount of money every month, since our lives change in other ways. When we have our first child, our income goes up. When we have our second child, our income goes up, but so do our expenses. When we have our third child, our expenses go up, but we're in a different financial position, so we can save more. And, the other thing to keep in mind is that we can save in other ways, too. Another way to save is to have a lower-cost wedding, so you have more money to save for your own leave. Another way to save is to buy a cheaper house, so you can pay it off more quickly, and have more money to save for your own leave. Another way to save is to buy a cheaper car, so you can save more for your own leave. Another way to save is to buy cheaper clothes, so you have more money to save for your own leave. Another way to save is to buy cheaper furniture, so you have more money to save for your own leave. Another way to save is to buy cheaper insurance, so you have more money to save for your own leave. Another way to save is to have cheaper food, so you have more money to save for your own leave. And, you can save in a lot of other ways, too. It's about finding ways to reduce your expenses so you have more money to save. This is a really interesting idea. I don't have kids, but I am trying to save as much as I can in order to take a year off after my PhD to do some freelance consulting work. I would have to change your suggestions to: Save money for leave for child 1. Save money for leave for children 2 and 3. In other words, you have to save a certain amount of money for each child. What I'm finding is that I'm saving more money for my own leave than I expected. I was saving 100 a month for child 1, and now I'm saving 300 a month for child 2. But, I'm still glad I'm saving that money, even though I could have used that money to pay off my student loans faster. Yes, that's a really good idea. I think it's a
