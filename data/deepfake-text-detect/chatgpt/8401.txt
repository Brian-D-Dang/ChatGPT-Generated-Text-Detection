Edit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) This isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a little crazy! I totally agree with you on this one, I think that some people just can not control their thirst to kill another being and are definitely domestic terrorists in my view......And yes they should benefit from SNAP benefits or any other government aid programs because of all those "innocent" animals slaughtered by these psychopaths...How would we like them killing our own kids?
