Counter-argument: While Bernie Sanders may have a different approach to diplomacy compared to previous presidents, that does not necessarily mean that he would be a bad international negotiator. On the contrary, his track record shows that he has always advocated for the interests of the people, rather than corporate interests. This approach might be new to international diplomacy, but that's what the world needs at this moment. Additionally, Bernie Sanders has been in the Senate for decades now, so he has vast experience in dealing with foreign policy issues. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to say that he would be a bad international negotiator.
