While it is true that the effects of coffee can vary from person to person, and some may experience only negligible effects, it is unfair to make a blanket statement that coffee is overrated. There are numerous studies that demonstrate the positive effects of coffee consumption, including increased alertness and improved cognitive function. Furthermore, taste is subjective, and it is not fair to assume that people who enjoy the taste of coffee are lying to themselves. Many people genuinely enjoy the taste of coffee, and it is a personal preference that should be respected. Overall, it is unreasonable to dismiss the benefits of coffee and the personal enjoyment of its taste without considering individual differences and experiences.
