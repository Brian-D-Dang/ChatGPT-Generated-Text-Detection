While volunteering at a Pride parade may be a noble thing to do, it's not necessarily a requirement for straight and cis people attending. Pride is about inclusivity and accepting people for who they are, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It's important for allies to show their support and solidarity, and their presence alone can help create an inclusive atmosphere. Additionally, not everyone has the ability or resources to volunteer at a Pride parade, and it's important not to turn attendance into a requirement for showing support.
