I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately mocking or belittling individuals who don't conform to traditional gender roles or expressions. Hypocrisy can be frustrating to deal with because it can feel like people are sending mixed messages and not being genuine. One way to address this is to have open and honest conversations with those individuals, and try to understand their perspectives and where they may be coming from. It's important to approach these conversations with empathy and respect, even if you disagree with them. It may also be helpful to focus on promoting a message of acceptance and inclusivity, rather than shaming or ridiculing those who do not conform to traditional gender norms.
