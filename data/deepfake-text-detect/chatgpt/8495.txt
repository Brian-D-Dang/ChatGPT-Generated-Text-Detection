I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info:) Now, while I think it's unfair that they are paid so little in comparison with their male counterparts and will make sure my daughter is given equal opportunities even though she has yet been born when her bigger sister makes his first international appearance; what shocks me most about these protests isn't just how much media attention we're giving them or rather not paying our athletes as well... but HOW MUCH THEY ARE MAKING! The top women earn 1 million per year playing football whereas Ronaldo does 2-3 times less than all those female footballers combined on an annual basis alone. (Even if you deduct inflation rates). And after taxes he probably still ends up earning way under half (500k)!!! The fact there was NO protest over such huge disparity between genders leaves no doubt which gender should be protesting - Men!! It would have made sense had some organization like NFLPA got involved here instead (But then again why shouldn't us girls complain too?!) That wouldn've ensured better career prospectssalaries at least until equality possibilities become reality everywhere else...the real problem remains: America itself!!!! But whatever....atleast now people know where money goes - Inna Lazareva explains from Russia via email
