First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that many in the prison system are not treated fairly. I am very open about this; my views on this matter are fully documented in my blog, and in my coursework. That said, I am not in favor of locking up people for political reasons. There are far too many examples of this; 1960's-era Black Panthers in the US, the Reagan administration in Latin America, and more recently in the United States itself with the patriot act. Which is why I am very upset about the treatment of Assange and Manning. Assange is, in my opinion, a hero. I will defend him to my dying day if necessary. But he is not a hero. He is a political activist with an agenda, and he does not deserve a hero's treatment. I will defend Manning to the death, but he is no hero, either. He broke the law; this is not a question. He is in prison, for a long time. I don't have any issue with Manning being in prison; I don't like the way the US is treating him, but that is another issue. However, I have a big issue with people who are on the same side as Assange, or who would have been in the same position as him and Manning, and who are now calling for Assange's release. Let me put it this way: if you are an activist for gay rights, for women's rights, for the rights of the poor, for the rights of religious minorities, for the rights of the oppressed, for the rights of the environment, for any one of a number of causes, I am very much in favor of that cause. However, if you are an activist for the rights of Assange, I am very, very not in favor of that cause. It is in my opinion the exact equivalent of people who are pro-life, and who support the death penalty, or who support the imprisonment of non-violent drug offenders. It is people who stand for one cause, while not standing for others, and so I call them out. So, before you get on your high horse about how awful the US is for treating Manning and Assange, remember this: the US is right in doing this. I understand that many of you are in favor of free speech, but free speech is not an absolute right, as much as you might wish it to be. That is one of the things that the US has gotten very, very right over the course of its history; there are limits to speech, and those limits are necessary for society to function. This includes political speech, and so while I believe that Assange is a hero, I also believe that he is a criminal, and that he deserves to be in jail. The "free speech" defense of Assange is the equivalent of the "pro-life" defense of the death penalty; it is the equivalent of saying that "I am against murder except in the case of the murder of X." People who try to make the case that Assange is a hero, and should be free, need to stop and think about who they are aligning themselves with. Are they aligned with people like O'Keefe, or Rove, or Cheney, who actively sought to undermine our government? Or are they aligned with Manning, and Assange, who are criminals, and who are disrespectful to our laws? I believe that the latter is the case; that they are misguided people, who are misguided in their support of Assange. They do not deserve to be supported. I also believe that Assange is a criminal. I am not happy about that, but it is a fact. So, for those who are against Assange's imprisonment, I have a simple message for you: you're not on the same side. I am very, very much on the side of Manning, and Assange, but I am also very much on the side of the rule of law, and when our laws become undermined and misused, I am against it. I also believe that Assange is a criminal, and that he should be imprisoned. So, if you're in favor of the rights of Assange, and not in favor of the rights of Manning, you are not on my side. I believe that Manning deserves to be in prison. I also believe that Manning deserves to be freed. I believe that Assange is a criminal. I
