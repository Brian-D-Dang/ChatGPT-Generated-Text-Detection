Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women in other fields that are traditionally male-dominated, I feel both hopeful and discouraged at the same time. Hopeful, because I believe that increasing diversity in any field is essential for progress and innovation. Discouraged, because it often seems like progress is slow and there are still many barriers that prevent women from advancing in these fields. What can we do to speed up the pace of change and make these fields more inclusive for women?
