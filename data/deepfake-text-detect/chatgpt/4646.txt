I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is an incredible series. However what can be said about this show? It's probably already been covered in other threads here on AO3 but just for anyone who doesn't know; the story revolves around 7 high school students who are trapped within the walls of Akihabara after Hackers take over their systems by using AR glasses (AKA Eyepieces) which allow them control over there bodies. These Glasses or AKAs work through a system called "Nerve Gear" where people plug themselves into it with a few wires attached to various parts of their body and then become controllable via another device known as a Gun Sight-type Receiver so they can shoot bullets at targets which then function like normal weapons if shot enough times). The kids quickly become connected together via the Network (The Internet), causing each person to start experiencing strange visions from previous daysweeks depending on what someone else has experienced which eventually turns out to somehow be memories from the future. Over 9000 words and not yet even halfway done but definitely worth checking out! If you want some more information about SAO check my profile page since there will be spoilers below and also links to our group discussion thread. You'll find lots of great discussions going on right now and we're still building up new members so expect all sorts of fun stuff if you join us:D! Every episode ends with a cliffhanger (s) leaving you wanting more when next week comes along... This was one of those shows that while action packed never really got boring because every characters life was constantly changing and being effected negatively (sometimes positively) by whatever had gone before. At first it seemed a bit crazy it could cause random events throughout such a timeframe but once you get used to it everything works extremely well. There were very minor things thrown in that kept me interested without overwhelming me (like I'd watched way too many shounens lately) and quite a lot of callbacks to past episodes which made it interesting to see how different situations would turn out. With only 12 episodes you didn't get much character development but again it worked perfectly fine given its short length. So why do I enjoy this kind of thing anyway? Well, personally I have always thought it was rather ingenious how humans view the world: People tend to conceptualise certain aspects of reality in terms of whether something makes sense to them or makes logical sense to them whereas others seem to construct the idea of 'how does logic apply?' Is true love possible? What happens if you dream yourself awake? Do cats eat mice? How did that happen? Can green goo kill you? Oh god THAT'S SO MADNESS!! These questions aren't just posed here and there either, everything gets asked multiple times over the course of any medium - books, TV T.V., Magazines etc. So it should come as no surprise that seeing these same kinds of question arise repeatedly after 11 months means that 'it's not just me'. That's part of the reason why I think Anime lends itself particularly well to analysis; it contains ideas that pop up often throughout human history and therefore tends to lend itself more easily towards critical thinking than say novels can ever hope to. And let's face it most fans of manga and hentai also largely fall into this category of 'idea based entertainment', especially due to it being a mostly visual artform. In fact one time during a conversation between two of the girls I mentioned above, she drawled sarcastically "I don't watch movies about incest." Of course she meant incest of all types but her comment actually gave rise to a whole list of related topics including sexuality roleplays, rape fantasies and depictions thereof, taboos surrounding sex, what men consider acceptable levels of sexual stimulation and consent, consensual nonconsensual relationships and forced ones. All of which would require an entire book to cover in its entirety as nobody knows exactly what to make of all of that except the writers themselves. As far as I'm concerned though, so many interests appear simultaneously in the media that it becomes impossible to ignore anything. This is also another reason why I found Ranime to be incredibly fascinating despite barely having any knowledge outside of Japan. Sure, I knew nothing of Japanese culture overall but knowing that Kabuki existed put me off exploring it further until later on. By then however, I realised that my interest in it stemmed entirely from the nature of what I viewed as a skillful use of symbolism. As a result, I began delving deeper into its intricacies and meanings. For example, when watching the second season of Ranime, I wasn't familiar with Shinkansen (bullet trains) but Ranime explained that the Bullet Train stations appeared in dreams as the protagonists became closer to their respective partners and thus represent escape routes to freedom whereas they also symbolise safety. Then, when reading a Manga (Which I regretfully haven't read any longer and unmetered) for the sake of literature I encountered numerous witty remarks attested to counterparts' interests becoming determined via readerships as they referenced
