I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to find an element with a half-life of exactly 12 hours. Is this so? A: It is not possible for any element to be stable at one time during its decay process and unstable at another time - if there were stable atoms left over from previous nuclear decays they would be radioactive by definition and have been gone long ago; similarly all radioactivity can't happen simultaneously since atomic nuclei are very small things.
