I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for selling crack they are not going anywhere, why shouldn't they be able to choose death over that? I've never understood this argument from either side (pro-life or pro choice) They don't want it because then we won't get more money off them when they die! s
