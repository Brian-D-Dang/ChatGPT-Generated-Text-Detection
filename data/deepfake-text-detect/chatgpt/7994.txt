A counter-argument to refute the opinion that saying "bless you" when someone sneezes is not polite could be that the phrase originated during the time of the bubonic plague. Sneezing was recognized as a symptom of the plague, so people would bless the person who sneezed as a way of wishing them good health and protection from the deadly disease. Over time, this phrase became a polite way of acknowledging and offering well wishes when someone sneezes. Even though the origins of the phrase may seem outdated, it has become a widely accepted and polite social convention in many cultures.
