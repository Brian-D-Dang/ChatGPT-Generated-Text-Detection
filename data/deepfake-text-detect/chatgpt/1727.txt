While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept or reject them. The bottom line is this: it doesn't matter how you feel about GMO food - whether you believe in them or don't...you can never really know if they're good for us until we test every single one of their ingredients thoroughly! That's why I prefer organic fruits veggies over GMO's any day of the week!! -Muffin
