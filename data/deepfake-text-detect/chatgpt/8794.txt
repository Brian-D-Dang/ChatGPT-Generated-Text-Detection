Personally, I'm not religious, so I guess I'm trying to get some insight here. Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything but pray and read books (and exercise) for most of the day without being tempted by boredom... You have it backwards! The reason why this was all designed to be seen as a "good" thing is because God has never done anything that would cause us to die. He created all the creatures in the universe. If we let Him make everything else [God will] then we'd immediately go back to our own reality and become all of creation itself. In fact, if people want to create their own life through creation, they need to understand how we create. We don't know what is around us, nor are we interested in creating anything, only evolution and the wants and desires of other things. Therefore, while we're all telling God to save us from death, the ultimate purpose of creation is to make ourselves better off than before. By making us feel good about ourselves, we now have a positive outlook on life - which means we can start saving others so they can be saved even more. That doesn't mean being Christian is bad, but it does mean being able to keep living your life out there, each new moment well thought-out enough to allow you time to enjoy yourself, no matter what happens in your life. It also means being willing to accept imperfections in your lives, either temporarily or permanently; an attitude that many Christians are unable to express right now because they were born with those shortcomings for themselves. So while you may think you've got it figured out, all you really know is that you're going to die anyway. So stop crying and begin loving the process that brings you into your next eternity. You'll be the person who laughs at whatever injustice occurs within you. God bless you.
