Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. Use your own brain and common sense: cows can be dangerous creatures that need lots of knowledge about how we humans work in order keep them safe from us - there's no other reason for their intelligence than our safety (in contrast cattle-keeping people were probably smart enough back then). In addition you have countless films where someone just forgets an important part or uses his extra information as leverage against another person causing problems between both individuals which is often never resolved because those two won't talk again after this happened once! That doesn' t happen with animals who find out what works together successfully but stays on good terms instead... ermm.. at least I think so...:)
