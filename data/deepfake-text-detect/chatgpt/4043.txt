Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a proxy war against communism in South East Asia (China). We were fighting for our own way of life, which I think we achieved with relative success. There's no such thing as "victory" when it comes to Vietnam, only peace. That said, you're right that there are elements of conflict associated with U.S.-backed rule change at the end of the Cold War. The Cold War ended abruptly in 1991, but before then there had been some intermittent crises over the past half-century or so between China and several Arab states - most notably Egypt and Syria - and all sorts of loose alliances throughout Southeast Asia. That said, since the Soviet Union collapsed, foreign policy has largely focused on dealing diplomatically with China. This means that relations have generally improved rather than deteriorated thanks to the presence of President Xi Jinping. Like all successful relationships though, these have come under strain recently; the Trump administration seems intent on undoing policies pursued by his predecessor Barack Obama.
