A counter-argument to refute this opinion could be that asexuality is a legitimate sexual orientation that has been recognized by the medical and psychological communities. Just because some people may use the label to feel unique or different doesn't invalidate the experiences of those who genuinely identify as asexual. Additionally, asexual individuals often face a great deal of discrimination and invalidation, leading many to not openly identify as asexual until later in life. Therefore, it is important to respect and validate the identities and experiences of individuals who identify as asexual.
