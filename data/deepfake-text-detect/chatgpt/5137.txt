It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. I do not believe that there should be any obligations on anyone to follow this rule, especially to those who operate medical devices or make the rules of interstate commerce. It is also my belief that these vehicles would never allow any passenger car manufacturers to supply their own safety equipment such as automatic transmissions or headlights for driver assistance systems like automated braking systems without a license plate reader installed when they require emergency stop signs from drivers concerned about liability issues. The fact remains that these regulations needlessly reduce the safety standards set by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Organization (FMSO). I think it is important for all motorists to realize what we have done here - we placed a legal restriction upon them during production which puts us at risk Of course there may be some who wish to ride around with a driving licence but don't want us to. Our roads must remain open so that no one can simply drive off into the sunset because of a dangerous situation that causes accidents? Let's consider driving restrictions issuing would violate our rights as citizens of this country under the Constitution. Thank you for your response.
