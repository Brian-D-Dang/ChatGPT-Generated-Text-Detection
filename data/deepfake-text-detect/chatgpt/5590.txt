Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a communist war, which means it was a war where the US fought for freedom and democracy against a fascist totalitarian dictatorship. Yep, that's right, Vietnam was a fascist dictatorship. I'm not sure how that slipped under the radar. But when I was a kid in school, I learned that the reason we went to Vietnam was to stop the spread of communism. Then I watched that documentary on Vietnam, and that's when I realized that the reason we went to Vietnam was to stop the spread of fascism. It's one of those things that you don't think about because it's not as obvious, but if you stop and think about it for a second, it's actually pretty ridiculous. I mean, communism and fascism are both pretty much just words. But people use the words to make themselves feel better. People use the words to justify killing people, and then eventually, those people believe those words. Why? Because the average person has no idea what either word means. So, it's easier for them to say, "oh yeah, we're in a war to stop the spread of communism" rather than "we're in a war to stop the spread of fascism." And on a personal level, I was always taught to hate communism, and I was never taught to hate fascism. When I went to school, we learned about the Holocaust, and we never learned anything about communist concentration camps. For that matter, we never learned about communist concentration camps in China, Russia, or any other communist countries. So, when I thought about it, I realized that maybe that's why I hate communism. Because I was never taught about communism. But I was taught about fascism. Because I was taught that it's bad. And I was taught that the government was evil and corrupt, and that's why the government made those camps. But I never made the connection between fascism and concentration camps. I never learned that fascism and concentration camps are the same thing. And I never learned that communism is actually a system that protects the rights of the people, and that the US actually became a fascist country, and that the US only pretended to care about freedom and democracy when the US was at war. So, I finally made the connection. And the US actually went to war to stop the spread of fascism. And I'm pretty sure it would have been ok with me if the US fought fascism. But I was kind of disappointed that the US fought to stop the spread of communism because it was a lot easier to fight against an enemy than it was to figure out who was the enemy. And then when we lost, we had to fight the communist dictatorship in Vietnam, and I think that's what really fucked us up. We lost the war, and the US government got involved in a bunch of bullshit afterwards, and eventually, we realized that the US was fascist, and we had to fight against ourselves, and then we lost the war against ourselves. And then my dad got laid off from the factory, and my mom got laid off from the department store, and all of a sudden, my dad and I had to move back in with my mom and her new husband, and we had to live in a trailer park in the poor part of town, and I thought that it would be a good idea to enlist in the military, and I went to the recruiting office, and the recruiters told me I was too young and I had to wait a year, so I went back home and lived in the trailer park for a year, and I realized that I didn't really want to go to war, so I went back to the recruiting office and I told them that I was old enough, but I wanted to go to college first, and they said that was fine, so I got a job and enrolled in the Army National Guard, and I got an apartment, and I went to college, and I never went to war, and then I went to war, and it was a lot harder than I thought it would be, and I didn't have a clue what I was doing. And I was sent to Iraq, and then I came back, and then I came back to Iraq, and then I came back, and then I came back to Iraq, and then I came back. And I was pissed off at the government because they lied to me, and I was pissed off at the
