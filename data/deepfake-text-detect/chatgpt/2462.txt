I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was literally shocked there were no women in the cast! It's like they didn't exist at all during World War II for some reason? Also... is anyone else sick of hearing Benedict Cumberbatch being called 'Bendystraw Cucumberpatch'?! It's an old joke that dates back to his role on Sherlock where he had weird eyebrows which people said looked like pickled cucumbers
