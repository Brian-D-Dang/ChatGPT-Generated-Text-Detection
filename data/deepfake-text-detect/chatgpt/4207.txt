This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point in this post was simply to acknowledge that it's not an eitheror proposition. It isn't even necessarily "slippery." It's more like if we assume everyone who doesn't agree with us has 100,000 and wants to tax everybody else at 90 of their income, then we'll just need to increase our taxes by one percent on every person making over 100k! That's only about 50 extra per year!
