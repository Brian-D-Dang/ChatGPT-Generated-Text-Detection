Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move onto something else. Most notably the recent case of Troy Davis who was murdered by his own prison guards at Fort Lauderdale in Florida because he supposedly killed a cop (which he never did). But there are other cases like this one and the execution of Gary Graham for example where we feel sympathy for him as an individual but have no true understanding why or what he actually did wrong? I would suggest that if you hear someone talking about how terrible a crime they committed or any guy executed recently please try and look beyond their crimes. Try and ask yourself what kind of person heshe really is outside of killing someone - and even perhaps most importantly do some research into the history behind them if you can find out anything interesting looking up stuff online. Be warned though this might not always get you very far! It's good to know your facts although sometimes knowing too much can be negative:) Take the time to think about what you've found out about them and see if you notice a difference between all the different stories you come across and maybe begin to form beliefs about each persons character based off of what you think you've discovered. The more information you gather about each offender the better able you will become at judging whether heshe deserves the death penalty or whatever punishment society deems fit for a given offense. One thing you should definitely keep in mind when researching offenders before sentencing is gender differences and the fact that men tend to commit more violent crimes than women (even though women possess higher levels of testosterone which suggests a greater battle between manliness vs femininity within the male brain). This may help lead you towards deciding that those convicted usually men deserve harsher punishments especially when compared with female criminals. Another point worth mentioning is racism - while generally speaking a black criminal has been statistically proven guilty more often then a white criminal although this isn't always the case depending on location. So basically don't automatically assume every African American commit violence just because they're mostly accused of doing so (this also applies to Latinos and Native Americans):) Also take note of the age range offenders fall under. Someone 18-24 years old is probably going to face significantly less jail time then someone 25-35 years old and older in almost all circumstances. There's a reason for this and it doesn't make sense that teenagers who haven't yet fully developed emotionally would continue to behave as adolescents during adulthood whereas adults who have learned social skills from past life experiences appear rather mature. And finally study the type of sentence imposed upon a particular group of convicts e.g. drug dealers versus bank robbers versus rapists etc... These sentences serve two purposes: 1) To deter future acts of criminality 2) To remind others of harsh consequences inherent to certain types of offenses. In conclusion go back to your initial thoughts regarding whether or not you believe such actions warranted capital punishment however now question your thoughts based off what you've researched instead of simply having preconceived notions or opinions about the subject matter without considering whether or not all murderers are created equal. In my new essay "The Death Penalty Debate," I am breaking down three key arguments against the practice of executing prisoners, namely racial injustice issues, human rights violations, and cost benefits. After noting all the flaws in each argument, I conclude that the current system does neither promote public safety nor moral justice. Instead, I propose a system wherein the state independently investigates, prosecutes, and courts murder charges with jury trials being held after convictions. I argue that the absence of prejudice and judicial discretion reduce bias concerns and increase due process protections; moreover, the rise in technological advances has allowed us to expand our approach, increasing accountability while reducing costs. I provide examples from countries that use similar methods and policies effectively in order to draw comparison and demonstrate sustainability. Finally, I discuss various counterarguments made by supporters of the death penalty including potential abuses, lack of informed consent, and efficiency criticisms. For transparency, I highlight multiple studies supporting scientific evidence of DNA exoneration rates illustrating wrongful conviction rates among capital defendants. Lastly, I survey statistics showing that the majority of murders are solved already thus eliminating repeat victimization and recidivism concerns. If used judiciously, mass incarceration causes wide spread problems while capital punishment eliminates much of these harms instantly regardless of race. Although currently 50 states still allow the death penalty, many states have abolished the death penalty since 1965 due to its retributive nature. However, opponents mistakenly claim mandatory application leads to arbitrary results resulting in unjust outcomes in spite of contrary findings concluding the opposite. Furthermore, proponents typically overlook the long road ahead until the day the last murderer dies, failing to acknowledge the issue could potentially arise again and not using available safeguards. Thus, we need a preventative solution; while few support abolition of the death penalty, most favor reforming the existing method through added procedural checks.
