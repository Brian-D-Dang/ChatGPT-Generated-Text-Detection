So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because he did something that wasn't allowed by Wizards (something to do with an MTGO cube and hats). I have no idea what this means for the future of Modern or Legacy. Are we headed back to [rmagicTCG] (URL1), where modern is just more expensive, less enjoyable to play and less fun than what it used to be? Because that's exactly what happened after people started using proxies and boosters when they were pulled from retail stores. So yeah... the game isn't nearly as great anymore which makes sense considering what happens when Wizards gives up deciding who can use their products. To add my two cents: I love Mtg, I would like to know why Wizards has decided these are some good times to let pros play their games. The fact that pro players are getting screwed over in turns doesn't make any sense at all.
