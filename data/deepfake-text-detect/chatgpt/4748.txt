I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with you by saying "fork give bums jobs," that person should certainly not be censored because they're using the same analogy as another individual who believes forks are a beautiful sign of social progress (if I am correct in this assumption). That being said, there are many places where censorship on twitterfacebook would work perfectly fine: schools, government office buildings, etc... These people are literally trying to ban opinions from spreading for no reason except to make themselves feel better or protect their own reputation which we all can agree isn't necessary nor justified at times. Everyone there wants what's best for them, but due to their fear (and maybe some false information) it makes sense to censor other individuals' freedom of speech. Now, while these two examples may seem vague enough so that we could simply disagree and go our separate ways after that first fight, there comes a time when people actually have to take sides and stand up against others ideas. When we do finally come around to standing against one another, we need to know why we're doing it: Is it for ourselves? For our families? Our country? Or just to prove how loud we can shout down those deemed different from us? As long as everyone doesn't start taking each other too seriously, things will continue to get more heated until eventually one side backs down and lets the other speak freely again. That means nobody has any right to attack anyone else over their opinion unless they treat every single piece of garbage out there equally. This includes political correctness... especially now that Trump won! We cannot allow ANYONE to act like the opposition party did during Obama's presidency!!! It was insulting to democracy and completely unacceptable!!! A lot of my friends were offended by his statements about "clinginghanging onto your guns and religion!" And guess what?! Now he's gone; you've lost your power base!! You can sit here and try to play victim all day, but it'll never work. If you want to really hurt Hillary supporters, tell them (you guessed it!) that she made sure Bernie didn't win! Tell her that she sold Bernie off to the super delegates without giving him equal chances! Well done!! What happened next was the beginning of sexism! No matter WHAT HILLARY DID FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS OR WHO SHE BLESSED WITH HER VICTORY, THE SAME PEOPLE STILL SAY THAT BERNIE WAS BETTER THAN HER!!!! They call her corrupt, dirty double crossing-But hey! She's a woman! So what!? Why does that mean everything is okay?? Women aren't supposed to criticize men! Oh wait.. duhh... 'cause women are weaker than MEN!. But look at me! I'm still alive. Just ask YouTube celebrities such as Shane Dawson, Pewdiepie and Logan Paul!" They also secretly think racism exists! Because they don't understand black culture!!! Like everything there is to learn about race, gender, sexuality, politics, sports, technology, money.. WHATEVER YOUR OPINION IS ON ALL OF IT, WE CAN LEARN FROM EVERYTHING BUT WHEN YOU DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOMEBODY BASED OFF THEIR RACE, GENDER, RELIGION, POLITICAL BELITTLING, ETC., THEN THAT DOES NOT MEET OVERLOOK EXCEPTIONS NOR FAIR PLAY TOWARD OTHER OPINIONS NO MATTER HOW CONTROVERSIAL THEY ARE!! JUST KNOW THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES TO THIS SHORT ATTEMPT TO PROTECT YOURSELF INSTEAD OF ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY SO MANY BLACKPEOPLE SUPPORT TRUMP EVEN AFTER HE SPOKE OUT ABOUT BLACK LIVES MATTERS. All Black Lives Matter says is that Blacks shouldn't die before whites either, whether its through police brutality or something else that happens within the African American community. Some black Americans heard his comments and responded negatively thinking that meant he believed only blacks live lives worth living, therefore making them hate white people even more. Not all black people thought that way though! TRUST ME! There's plenty of intelligent black people who agreed with Trump and figured that his statement was intended to stop blacks killing whites or damaging police stations instead of treating both races differently. He was wrong about that statement, yet most black folks refuse to admit this fact. Even worse, some went so far as to release hateful tweets toward Donald Trump including claims of murdering him!! Whaaaaaat!!! How dare yooooooooo (he used excessive caps)... Uhm.... couldnt we live without accusing death threats at least once a week??? Here's an example of the type of tweet you might receive from one nasty Reddit user named BlackGMan4Life17 in response to trump's comment above: "Hey Donny boy, think before ur mouth gets ya killed" -Blackgman4life17 Basically from the end of four decades old shlts into divvy belytos heaved in Dibs are 0 hope ends are lots of
