Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from 3rd grade until 16th grade) and had lots of fun playing the game of football that was very popular back then. What are some good soccer games? The only games I play currently are Euroleague and league matches. For me there is no reason for me to play them because they're not 24 hour leagues. But you can find them on YouTube if you search "soccer" or something like that. Can you elaborate about what's in it? My name is Maxine, my net worth is 5800 and I don't even have a full life yet. I know soccer isn't everyone's cup of tea but I've never played any sort of sport so I'm wondering how much it costs where to go when I need help:) Check out rSoccer, they'll give more info than just 1-3 teams. Follow along with them on Instagram or Twitter - they make great videos!
