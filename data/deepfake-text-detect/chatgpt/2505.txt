I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural thing. When you have cooked for your own in Asia and not had guests over there will always be enough of everything so using sticks or spoons isn't necessary. That's how it works with sushi too...
