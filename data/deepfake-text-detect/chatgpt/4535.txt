Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll be commenting on the specific points raised in comments below. I'm happy with my answer, so no further edits are necessary (and given that we're talking about slight errors of nuance here). Thanks for reading!
