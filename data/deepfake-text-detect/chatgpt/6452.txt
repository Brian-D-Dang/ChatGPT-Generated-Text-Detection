I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was I had bought the DVD and a copy of The Imitation Game. It was supposed to be on sale in the video store. I just watched the video and I am still waiting for the DVD release.
