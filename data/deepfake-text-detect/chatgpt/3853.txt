It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be used for scientific research in a certain way and if necessary they can also lead to the extinction of species due to overpopulation. How does one go about unethical practices? Does it have anything to do with ethics?
