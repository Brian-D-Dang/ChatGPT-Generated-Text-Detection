Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll add it here too because the OP is referring to the title of the article (which would be alright). There aren't really any comments on the article that mention the polls being incorrect in any way though? Also the article mentions that there were quite a few polls saying Clinton was winning, so I think they're pretty much exactly where they said they'd been thinking she should win based only (and probably also do not believe polls admit that Hillary beat Clinton).
