Breastfeeding in public is a natural and normal act that meets the basic needs of a child. Calling it indecent exposure is not accurate as it implies a sexualized connotation that is inappropriate in this context. Breastfeeding provides essential nourishment to a baby and denying it, or forcing a mother to go to a private location, is an infringement on her rights. Moreover, it is legal and protected by law to breastfeed in public in many countries, which illustrates there is nothing shameful about the act. Therefore, it can be argued that breastfeeding in public should be accepted and normalized, rather than being stigmatized as indecent exposure.
