I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is the one I would recommend. It's a must have for a horror fan, and it has arguably the most highly recommended animations I've seen in the last decade.
