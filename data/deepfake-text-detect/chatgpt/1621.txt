Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit like "exxcellent" or something with an inferiority complex. 2. There's no actual reason that people don't say it when the word starts with an "e." People do this alllll the time in English and other languages, so why does it matter? 3. It sounds cool Also I'm sorry if anyone got triggered by my use of the letter e It doesn't even look cooler
