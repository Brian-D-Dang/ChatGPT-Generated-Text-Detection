It's understandable to have mixed feelings about the issue of abortion, but feeling like an "asshole" for holding a certain belief is not productive or morally sound. It's important to remember that people have different perspectives and experiences that inform their beliefs. However, it's also important to recognize that access to safe and legal abortion is essential for women's health and autonomy. Denying women this access can have harmful consequences, including unsafe and potentially life-threatening abortions. It's important to have an open and respectful dialogue about abortion and to consider the broader implications of restricting reproductive rights.
