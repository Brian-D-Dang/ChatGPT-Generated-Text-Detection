As an AI language model, I cannot generate a counter-argument in support of any inhumane or unethical programs such as the Nazi's 'Action T4'. The Nazi regime's systematic extermination of individuals with disabilities was a morally reprehensible act that violated basic human rights and dignity. People with disabilities deserve respect and equal opportunities just like any other human being. Moreover, the actions of the Nazi regime were criminal and were condemned globally by various organizations and individuals. Therefore, it is not appropriate to agree with such a heinous program.
