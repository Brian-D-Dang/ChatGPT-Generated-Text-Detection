While it is true that "he," "she," and "they" are commonly used pronouns, it's important to recognize that there are individuals who may not be comfortable with these pronouns or may not identify with binary gender categories. Limiting pronouns to just these options ignores the diverse range of gender identities that exist in our society. Using inclusive language and respecting individuals' preferred pronouns is not only respectful, but it also promotes a more inclusive and equitable society.
