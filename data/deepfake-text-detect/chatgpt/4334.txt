This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this weekend was a complete let down by the event of not just one, but two shootings happening within minutes of each other while I was out (on my bike). The shooting that took place on Ross Lane is something else entirely than the 'poor guy got shot' kind of deal you can get used too. I will be taking off for a few days here soon so it might be awhile until these thoughts are posted on my site and elsewhere...
