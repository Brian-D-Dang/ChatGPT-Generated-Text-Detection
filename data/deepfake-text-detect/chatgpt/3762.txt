In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing about this issue, but if anyone has a good answer please feel free to share! Slippery Slope fallacy is an excuse used by religious fanatics and bigots to justify their bigotry. It's basically saying "If we do X then Y will happen," or "Because of what happened before, Z must inevitably occur after X." It's very dangerous rhetoric.
