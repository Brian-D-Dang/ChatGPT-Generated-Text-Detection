Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from my local community) and recently have begun to play again for fun. My father is an avid basketball player that likes to keep fit with his buddies after work. Since he has been retired for several years, as well as being over sixty himself by now, he no longer plays many team sports or gamesexercises regularly. He just wants to stay healthy and be able to enjoy life without having any injuries down the line. I feel like I should do something for him because of this. What do you think? Will it hinder me in some way if I don't continue playing and try boxing out with my dad after playing? Would that help me with comfortability around him since he will still want to be active? Please share your take on my situation and thanks! LCM Many people here are confused about what it means when someone says "start young." In general, younger children may need more time away from their parents than older ones to "grow into their bodies," so they can avoid injury or discomfort during activities in school or at home. This is likely why there's a lot of advice to exercise younger kids before going to bed each night, even though many preschoolers aren't ready physically yet for all-out physical activityyet. It's also possible that your Dad could become too tired to engage in vigorous exercise right off the bat and end up injuring himself; however, if you're concerned about these complications, it might be worth bringing up this idea with your doc andor PTs. If you had already started to work up in age, then yes, definitely bring up starting early with your doctor. If your dad continues to be interested and gets involved in other things outside of sport, after all, there isn't much harm done by taking him along for the ride. As long as you make sure that he doesn't compromise his own health because of your involvement, providing him with continuous support should benefit both of you. That said, remember what most doctors would tell you: You cannot force anyone to do anything, especially when they are feeling ill or injured. Basically, take this opportunity to encourage them to follow through with recommended exercises and modify activities accordingly, rather than forcing them to do more. However, sometimes the old adage holds true: "you gotta love those who love you." If you two haven't talked seriously about this topic, maybe it'd be smart to start a talk soon and find ways of stimulating that relationship while encouraging active participation. For example, as one of your students suggested above, let your dad join the gym. Maybe even start hiking together and all that stuff. Whatever works best for your family.
