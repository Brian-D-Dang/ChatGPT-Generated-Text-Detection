I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was shocked by what some of the actual physicists involved in the case thought about the movie. I think the biggest issue is that there are so many different interpretations out there for how Einstein's theory works... It can be contradictory at times
