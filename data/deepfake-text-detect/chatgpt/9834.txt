If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be needed in certain industries, meaning fewer people will be employed. This can lead to a decrease in population rates and allow for better conditions in the future. As there is less competition for resources, those with jobs will have greater access to them and can enjoy an improved quality of life. Additionally, with fewer people competing for resources, it could potentially lead to lower prices for goods and services. Finally, as the population decreases, pollution and environmental damage could be reduced, resulting in a healthier and more sustainable future.
