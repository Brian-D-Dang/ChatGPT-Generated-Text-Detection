Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking Mark Watney (James Spader) is a NASA astronaut who is stuck on Mars after his crew left. The team is ready to return home but he finds out that they are leaving Mars and he is now alone. Mark tries to make friends with a local janitor, Rosetta (Susan Clark). He also spots a stowaway named Ripley (Ellen Burstyn), who has a violent rage against him. He also meets another mission member, Ryan (Chris Evans), who is also on Mars. Meanwhile, Mark is able to communicate with his girlfriend, Amy (Emma Stone). Mark realizes that he is not alone on Mars. Although the crew is now gone, he can still contact the outside world.
