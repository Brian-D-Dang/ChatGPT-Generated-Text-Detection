First of all, I want to first express how happy I am with this subreddit. It has always been a hub for civilized discussion on complicated and difficult topics. I have learned many lessons in my time here from you guys. Another way that it is unique is the fact that like most subreddits dedicated to comics, there is an overwhelming amount of hate directed at Marvel. So much so that people who are not familiar with their comic books will think they're just "a bunch of crazy nerds" or whatever, and therefore don't care about them at all. The reality is that everyone's heard something negative about comic book companies before, but what sets Reddit apart is that these aren't isolated incidents; instead, people see moments where someone really does deserve some criticism, and they can't wait to tear down those companies along with anyone involved. However, despite everything else mentioned above, for one reason or another, Marvel fans tend to be very receptive toward other fan bases: I've never seen anything quite like it... It's interesting because we as a community often feel left out when this happens, since we can't get into any semblances of social media such as Instagram or Twitter. But every once in awhile (and more frequently than ever), we find ourselves connected through our mutual interest in Marvel, which helps us overcome feelings of isolation and become closer friends with other fans. A lot of times, others may perceive the few posts by our group on Facebook as nothing more than "butthurt" and attempt to mockingly replytroll-bash us whenever we try to talk about something related to the company - but even though we also are an extremely vocal minority within your main groups, we still manage to make friendships based off of shared interests, unlike virtually anywhere else online! As far as specific policy discussions go, there isn't too much of a difference between Marvel and DC besides certain members' separate identities... except the former tends to be far less tolerant of dissenting opinions. When people complain about these things being mentioned in public, let me give you an example: Once upon a time.... There was a picture floating around over on Imgur making fun of the fact that someone had posted a screenshot showing that Spiderman mentions his parents while talking to Mary Jane during their wedding scene - and pretty much every single person replied with a comment saying that it wasn't cool haha, he should respect her privacy. Of course, the original poster said no, but already there were a lot of people telling him to mind his own business. Now imagine if that same poster came onto a forum set up specifically for Avengers vs Xmen threads and asked why Miles Morales shouldn't mention his parents? How long do you reckon it would take for that question to turn into a discussion of whether or not he was allowed to do that? And imagine another guy coming in and asking why Peter Parker's father hadn't shown up yet. Do you imagine it taking a whole week or two for those particular questions to be ridiculed into oblivion? Well, those people didn't even bother waiting until after the official thread closed before bombarding it with messages calling the entire fandom pedophiles and basically accusing them of rape whenever they dared post anything remotely relating to the character, did they? Let alone the fact that someone actually made a fake account impersonating Black Widow and went straight to attacking Bendis for daring publish news about Infinity War prior to its release! Anyways, it goes without saying that we're 100 okay with criticizing someone's choices when reviewing movies, TV shows or video games for instance - but somehow people start getting completely offended whenever we ask why fans feel entitled to push their favorite characters into situations beyond their comfort zones. We literally cannot say, "Hey man - wouldn't it kind of suck if Tony Stark got kidnapped or something.. If Iron Man wants to come back home at night safe and sound, then maybe it'd work better if he were living with Pepper Potts rather than with half of his friends. Yeahhhh buddy, guess what? THAT IS THE ULTIMATE REASON WHY WE LIKE THIS CHARACTER AND YOU CAN NOT CRITICIZE US FOR HAVING THOSE KINDS OF FEELINGS!" Because frankly, it gets annoying hearing it constantly. Like seriously, what gives?! Not only that, but once again, the majority of users will inevitably agree with each other entirely, just so they won't look dumb. It takes away from others arguing against the idea, and besides, it doesn't matter one bit either way. That's why it's important for the smaller demographics to stand together regardless of the constant argumentation between subgroups, because unless you force yourself to keep listening anyway, eventually you'll end up falling prey to this ridiculousness... By the way, this includes me. In high school, I was convinced that Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson were secretly dating [insert girly joke here] Does that mean I'm gonna have to put myself down steps to claim a bigheaded posters seem failure uncoater. Ohpity poe erslash have reclaimed. Though the
