Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself to death and I would be giving me no reason not to do so because I know the odds are against my interests. That's exactly what you're saying, and it's ridiculous that people are willing to make such an effort when they can just bankroll the GOP candidates by getting them into office instead of voting for their candidate who has a similar record with tax incentives that will encourage spending on things like education, housing etc. Just stop, stop making this sort of claim.
