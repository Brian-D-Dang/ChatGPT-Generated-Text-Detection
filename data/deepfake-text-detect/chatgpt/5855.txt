Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians. 2. It is justified in dropping the bombs on Japan in order to save American lives. Many American soldiers were in the process of dying in the Japanese invasion of Iwo Jima. 3.

If American lives were going to be saved then the bombing of Japan was justified because an invasion of Japan would have cost many American lives. Why I hold this view: 1. America was able to use the bomb on Japan in order to gain moral high ground against Russia. 2. America could not have used the bomb on Japan without the support of Russia. 3.
