As a german, especially in the city I live, there's honestly too many turks and muslims here. My old school was 80 turksmuslimsguys from eastern europe, which seriously lead to trouble with other countriesreligions (i'm not saying that it would happen all over again). And this is just my public opinion For the record: ich bin ein schwabischer!
