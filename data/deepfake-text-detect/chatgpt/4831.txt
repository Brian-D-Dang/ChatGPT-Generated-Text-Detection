Given that livestock consume more water, feed, create more greenhouse gasses, and suffer throughout their lives to eventually be killed, while providing no essential nutrients that cant be attained through other means; Are you a vegan? I'm not. But do you really think the meat industry is just as concerned with animal welfare as vegans are? Do you believe they wouldn't still kill animals if it weren't for those "animal rights" fanatics? If so, your beliefs are based on nothing but emotion, which runs contrary to logic. And it's obvious from this post what kind of person you are. You shouldn't accept anyone else's opinions unless yours have been proven correct in some way. It would seem that you're doing exactly that by making statements about something you know absolutely nothing about. As usual, you've proved my point. (Sorry...this isn't supposed to get political!) Yes...I am a Vegan because there is a moral code behind being one. Yes, its easy to pick apart others who eat meat or don't eat much meat at all....but look past the surface and realize the human race will die out because we have used up our planet like crazy and we need to find alternatives quick before we go extinct 100! Thats why eating less meats and reducing how many times we use landfills etc..etc works so well!! Also when I see pictures such as these, I feel bad knowing its someone having fun without hurting an innocent creature! Sadly most people choose to live vicariously thru us poor carnivores!! We can never truly become a completely vegetarian nation due to economicsresources ect....so lets try living by example instead!!!! Sorry but thats my opinion!!! Live better life style!!!!!:D Obviously none of them understand the concept of real compassion toward ANY form of sentient life. At best they show the same sort of emotional attachment as parents might give a puppy they were going to adopt, only expecting it to love them back in return. To actually give any weight to what they say requires the suspension of disbelief so far beyond capacity that it almost borders on delusion itself. The simple fact is that the overwhelming majority of people believe in god (s), meaning THEY BELIEVE IN COMPASSION AND THE CONCEPT OF A HUMAN RACE THAT HAS ONLY BEEN EXISTING FOR 10K YEARS OR SO. They also believe that humans ARE made in God's image, that animals aren't and thus deserve to face untold cruelty. There simply is NO WAY that the average American could conceptualize anything even remotely close to compassion towards non-human beings - as demonstrated clearly by the comments above. Unless you want to discount the vast majority of humanity as liars, trust fund babies and morons, then you'll generally agree with me on this one. Now kindly move along, otherwise we won't let you in again until you start showing some respect or get slapped down like a dog.
