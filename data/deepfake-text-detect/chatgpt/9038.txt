I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. The Cold War saw far less bloodshed than the first world war which was fought between Soviet Russia and Communist Germany. And despite all this blood, the divisions still exist. The long conflict has been resolved only by demanding peace for us - not simply with Russia but also a united France and Italy-Russia alliance which is vital both for the development of our defence networks and to understand how we can help each other on an ever deeper level. What should be felt most acutely is the fact that there are two major challenges. First, until the fall of communism, it had a pretty bad reputation; after all, when Britain came to power the Soviets were still desperately trying to get rid of Hitler. But when the fall of Communism forced the USSR into its old ways, everything was changed. When communism collapsed and the Soviet Union was quickly destroyed, everyone wanted peace - even the people who voted for it, because they believed that its leaders would never betray them again. Second, if anything happened to the USSR, then it could have turned out worse. As you know, things haven't always gone as planned in Russia or the Soviet Union. It's not like the Soviet Union was completely destroyed either. After all, there weren't any resistance forces anywhere near the Russian border during the Second World War - although there were some so-called "Viktor" ones. Even in the 1940s, there were tons of old military bases on the slopes of the mountains which actually made it easier for Russians to work there. So what do we expect from our new government? We ask ourselves, what kind of rules will I follow? What sort of infrastructure will I implement to ensure that no one else has access to these facilities? How do we ensure that no one gets bored of working there during the hottest summer months? A few very simple questions: 1. Why do we have to constantly monitor where we go? This isn't just a question of culture; it's a question of public opinion. In Europe in 2014, nearly 270 million people lived under per capita income, four times more than in the United States. Most of these families lived below the poverty line, with many of their jobs being dependent on food assistance. Most of those families went hungry themselves; others had little choice but to rely on private business forces to feed their children. Other parents worked much harder to support their own families without relying upon the powerful state-owned enterprises that owned and controlled the country. If they relied solely on the money it took to keep up with the needs of their neighbors, surely that same situation wouldn't be as dire. 2. Will Russia give me enough food and water to last my entire life? Yes, of course! I want to live in peace with my family for the rest of my life! However, I don't really think about it at all...not yet anyway! The best thing I can do right now is to set aside my ambitions and dream about becoming a permanent resident of Russia. Unfortunately, that means having to leave home again...or perhaps the whole world turns upside down. Nothing lasts forever!
