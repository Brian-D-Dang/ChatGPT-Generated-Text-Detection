After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read many books on various topics ranging from biology (which was not my assigned topic) to philosophy of art. While most of them were well written, there are some which made me feel as if they didn't accomplish any important point or idea. Most often when you work with something for so long it becomes boring because nothing ever changes except in your own mind's eye. I would agree but then again... The Bible is very fascinating to me!
