There is ample scientific evidence that supports the existence of triggers, which can cause a variety of emotional and physical reactions in individuals. Triggers are not a weakness that people should feel ashamed of or be expected to overcome on their own. It is important to acknowledge and address triggers in order to heal from past traumas and improve mental and emotional well-being. Ignoring triggers can lead to repressed emotions, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, projecting one's issues onto others is not always a deliberate choice and can stem from a lack of awareness or coping skills. Empathy and understanding are essential in supporting individuals who experience triggers.
