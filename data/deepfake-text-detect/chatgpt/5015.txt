So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But when we have these things in place now, this creates an opportunity for women to provide parental leave benefits." The U.S., Germany has been eager to expand paternity leave since September 2018 after the Trump administration announced its intention to put a moratorium on sharing fathers-only leave policy with mothers until 2020 due to concerns about family planning costs. Both of those policies were pushed back because of support from Congress during the pandemic but are now being rescinded entirely under President Biden's proposal. "We're now seeing increased demand," said Taylor. "Parents want more than anything else - new moms wanting help helping their children get older. We've seen parents going into the office looking at starting farms instead of working full time jobs or having kids while expecting families go through whatever challenges they might face if there can't be work available following childbirth or losing a child after parenting so early pregnancy and newborn baby effects their ability to thrive later in life."
