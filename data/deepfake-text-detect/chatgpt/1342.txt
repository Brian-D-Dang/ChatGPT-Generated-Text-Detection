Would you go to Enterprise and rent a car for 24 months? That's very similar to what a lease is. 1. Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, has an entertaining concept that no one but her knows about: "renting." And it makes perfect sense! If your goal is to save money on gas or tolls (or even just the depreciation of your vehicle), renting some major appliance will be cheaper than buying new. This strategy works well over time as long as you're not driving around in something too flashy-looking like a sports car - which could make people think you can afford all the stuff you own outright already!" 8. Buy used instead of new. It may seem counterintuitive at first because we're taught to buy new things when they come out so we don't have to worry about wear and tear. However, there are many instances where spending more upfront with less depreciation saves you tons down the line. For example, buying a 2,500 computer rather than getting a brand name Mac would probably cost you close to twice as much. You might also consider secondhand furniture, books, clothing and equipment if someone upgraded and needs to sell. Don't forget jewelry either; if I had known this was going to turn into an article on how to dress better, my engagement ring wouldn't have been such a bad deal...but maybe that's another story altogether.
