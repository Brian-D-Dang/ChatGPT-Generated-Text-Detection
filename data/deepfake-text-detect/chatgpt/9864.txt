A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but nothing can compare to the joy of setting off fireworks with your friends and family. We had an amazing time lighting up the night sky, watching the bright sparks and colorful explosions, and celebrating our nation's independence. It was a truly memorable experience, and one that I'm sure we'll all remember for years to come!
