The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here] . Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things, but for good people to do evil things, that takes religion. I think in my own mind I am a constant skeptic who will acknowledge the existence of something only if there's evidence (and by "evidence," like any scientist, I mean anything other than conforming to what we already know). But whether this skepticism also applies outside our minds is debatable.
