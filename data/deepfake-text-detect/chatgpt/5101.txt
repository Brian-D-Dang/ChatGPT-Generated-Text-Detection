During the first week alone [32 million people] downloaded a copy of a Game of Thrones episode. Even if only 1 of those people keep the file they downloaded after installing the Game of Thrones season 6 video game on their computer, there is still no telling how many people will actually play it and what happens to other players who download it when they leave the game in a few hours. The situation with Game of Thrones star Jon Snow (played by Jake Johnson) has been exacerbated due to his involvement in the HBO series' latest installment. In addition to being killed off in Episode 5 of Season 7, Game of Thrones actor Jon Snow also suffered an injury that forced him out of filming The Great Storm, which premiered this month, according to Deadline's report. Game of Thrones writer Jon Snow (Jon Dunigan) finds himself playing a minor character in Episode 4, and the show has become increasingly popular among fans thanks to HBO's marketing efforts involving an event reel featuring him doing battle scenes alongside the characters. Game of Thrones director David Benioff told Deadline he hopes the action scene "will give audiences ideas about Jon Snow," adding, "We've seen how well this game works for shows like The Hunger Games."
