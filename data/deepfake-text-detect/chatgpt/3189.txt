I think English should not be the international language for these reasons: It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words here uBrotherChe makes a really good point. English can be quite challenging to learn and understand, especially when it comes to pronunciation. Additionally, English is not necessarily the most widely spoken language in the world, so it can be seen as unfair to have it be the standard for international communication. Some argue that a more neutral or widespread language, such as Esperanto or Mandarin, should be considered instead. However, the fact remains that English is currently the dominant language in many industries and fields, and will likely continue to be for the foreseeable future.
