When the german leaders were put on trial after WWII, They claimed they were just following orders but it was decided that this was not good enough. Hitler could have been forced to resign if he had done nothing wrong, as well as his other top officials. In summary: When people are put into court on trumped up charges, and found guilty only of "guilty by reason of insanity" then why aren't we all in an asylum?
