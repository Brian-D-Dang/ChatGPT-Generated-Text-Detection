It is not accurate to assume that Reddit's direction will remain the same under Steve Huffman as it did under Ellen Pao. While they are both former CEOs of the company, they have different leadership styles and visions for the future of the platform. Furthermore, to call Ellen Pao a martyr implies that she was unjustly persecuted for her actions, but it's important to note that her decisions as CEO were met with significant backlash from users and moderators alike. It would be more accurate to acknowledge the complexity of the situation and the multiple factors that contributed to her departure from the company.
