Let me start off by stating what I believe the reddit basic income theory is. From what I have read from rbasicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society, everyone would get an amount of money per year (like in utopia) and it would be guaranteed to them regardless of how much they make or how hard they work. The government could even be said as providing a kind of social insurance for all citizens since if someone makes too little, then the state can take their money away to redistribute it elsewhere. So basically you think everybody should get a flat one-time payment no matter what? Why not a universal basic income like the ones being discussed here on Reddit?
