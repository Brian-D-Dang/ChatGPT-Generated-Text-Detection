This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I'd argue that all of the issues we experience today have simple, underlying causes. And yet, the solutions we implement are all messy, complex and require a lot of compromise. I think, that is, because we tend to focus on the symptoms rather than the cause. Take climate change, for example. The solution is simple: stop using fossil fuels. But the problem is that we're addicted to fossil fuels. They're easy to use, they're cheap, they're convenient. And so we find ourselves in the position of having to stop using them, but not being able to do so. So we all know the best way to stop using fossil fuels is to find an alternative fuel that is affordable, convenient, and easy to use. That's why the big oil companies are spending so much money on researching renewable energy sources such as solar power and biofuels. But they're not doing it because they want to save the planet; they're doing it because they know that if they stop selling fossil fuels, their income will plummet. So they're spending money on research that's unlikely to pay off because it's the only way they know of to make sure their income doesn't plummet. That's the underlying cause of climate change. That's what we need to work on. We need to get rid of the oil companies' incentives for not finding an alternative. In other words, we need to create a reason for them to stop using fossil fuels. Then we can start working on the symptoms of climate change. That's what I'm suggesting, anyway. I don't know if it's the right solution, but it's a solution. We can't stop using fossil fuels because that would be too inconvenient. And that's not going to happen. But we can make them so expensive that it becomes more convenient to switch to renewable energy sources. So the solution is simple: we need to create a situation where it's in the oil companies' best interests to use renewable energy sources instead. That's going to be a huge challenge, and it's going to take a lot of time, and a lot of hard work, and a lot of compromise, but it's the only way forward. Posted in Thoughts on June 17, 2017 by bookdwarf. Leave a comment Sources of meaning I've been doing a lot of thinking about sources of meaning lately. So much so that I've been thinking about it for hours at a time without even realizing it. I've been thinking about meaning in general, and about how we find meaning in life, and I've come to the conclusion that there are three major sources of meaning: The first is religious. There is an external, all-powerful being that created the universe, and created us, and has a plan for us. And our purpose is to discover what that plan is and follow it. The second is scientific. We are a part of a natural world that has evolved over many millions of years, and we are just one small part of it. Our purpose is to understand how the natural world works so that we can make it work for us. The third is personal. Our purpose is to find personal meaning through our own experiences and our own creativity. These three sources of meaning may seem very different, but to me, they're all just different manifestations of the same thing. For example, the religious source of meaning is about discovering a plan for us, but the scientific source of meaning is about discovering the plan for the natural world, and the personal source of meaning is about discovering your own plan. The three sources of meaning are connected, because each of them requires a certain kind of thinking. I'm not saying that religious people are any better at critical thinking than anyone else, nor are scientists any better at creative thinking, nor are artists any better at analytical thinking. But I am saying that a person who is good at thinking in one of these three ways is more likely to be good at thinking in all of them. I think it's also worth noting that the scientific source of meaning requires that we understand the natural world, which can be seen as the opposite of the personal source of meaning, which requires that we understand our own minds and hearts. I'm not saying that we can't do both, but I think the two are very different, and I also think that
