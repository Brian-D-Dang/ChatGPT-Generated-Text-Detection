As long as I've been alive, I've always poured milk before cereal. I've done this because I am a textural eater and I hate soggy cereal. I believe that pouring milk will enhance the taste of cereal by making it more liquidy but not necessarily make it better tasting or even thicker than when you're drinking cereal on cereal alone - there's no need to drink milk. This is correct. Just like with most foods, it depends on how much water your stomach needs in order for water retention to occur correctly (although some people seem to prefer this). I guess one should only use regular milk if it's not required?
