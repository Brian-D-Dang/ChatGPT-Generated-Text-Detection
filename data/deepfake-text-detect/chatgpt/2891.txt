For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to the little time available for me to think about such things. I am aware that my opinion is biased by attachment and upbringing; it's not possible for anyone at any age or stage of life (and especially when they are young) to make credible judgments on questions like these. But I feel strongly enough about what I can say as well as with reference to my personal experiences to warrant a response here. I don't expect anybody else to respond but those who read this thread because I'd just generally like people to know where I stand on the matter so that I might better understand their own views and perhaps learn something from them too. Please let me hear your thoughts (whether you agree or disagree). Thanks! You're right to point out that one cannot reasonably rely on lay opinions alone regarding matters like sex and reproduction, particularly if one hasn't studied biology extensively. That said, I've found reading scientific papers regarding the basic principles - i.e., the physical aspects of human sexuality that have remained consistent throughout our species' development - very helpfulinteresting. One book that comes highly recommended is Paul Mckennas "Sex At Dawn." It basically describes how we were socialized to assume certain sexual behaviors based on things like body type, gender roles etc., which needn't always correspond to biological truth. The author also makes some interesting observations regarding animal behavior patterns.... For example, he notes that female primates usually prefer males with larger, broader heads than smaller ones... However, studies showed that when given the choice between two nearly identical objects one would swear was real and another plastic fake, most women preferred the genuine object regardless of its actual appearance. He argues that this indicates it isn't merely inherent nature that determines attraction, but culture and society as well. Chris Ryan, other popular YouTuber, addressed this topic fairly recently: (just skip forward 2 minutes to see his portion of the discussion) Like us, humans may regard ourselves as being biologically unique among animals yet there seems ample evidence to suggest otherwise. We share many qualities with various members of different species including both similarities and differences on certain subjects. When considering topics like reproduction and sex it helps to remember this. We should try to look beyond our subjective feelings towards each subject rather focus more on objective physiological reality, not simply assuming what we perceive must reflect God's plan or whatnot. Therein lies the greatest potential for improvement IMHO
