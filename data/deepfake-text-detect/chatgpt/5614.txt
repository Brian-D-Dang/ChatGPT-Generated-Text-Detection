It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be protected from poaching, being rehabilitated, and providing us humans with information. That being stated, I nonetheless wish that zoos will reduce their reliance on meat. They need to use vegetarian foods extra typically. Closing on the 23rd of March 2016, and with no plan in place to unravel this trouble, the Mayor's office has turned to the state for assist. The state, because it is, can't simply solve the problem. What this state can do is take cost of the zoo and consider their remedy plans. There are numerous guidelines that should be introduced to handle this situation. The state has already mentioned that they plan to implement a number of rules to deal with the problem. The state of Michigan is a welfare state. People move to Michigan to get advantages. The state will pay for the remedy plans, but they do not care about the cost or what it'll do to the taxpayer. What will happen is that the zoo will develop into a authority zoo, and the state will have to pay for it. The state could be the employer of the zoo. That is the simplest option to resolve this problem. As soon as the state has taken over the zoo, they must implement a plan that will take care of the animals and the funds. The state ought to comply with the rules for a welfare state and care for the animals. The zoo must be rehabilitated, the animals must be cared for, and the employees should be paid. A state government is accountable to the taxpayers, but that is simply not how it works. It's an outrage that a state would not care about it's taxpayers and the welfare of it's residents. People come to Michigan and wish to be part of a welfare state, but it is not what it seems to be like. It is a shame that the zoo has to close, and it is a disgrace that taxpayers must pay for this catastrophe. Zoo's have been around for hundreds of years, and sadly it appears that they are getting worse. With animals being mistreated and dying of starvation, there are also animal homicide accusations that are being made. This is the cruelty that animals face every day of their lives in zoos.
