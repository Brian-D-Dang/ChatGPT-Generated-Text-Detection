The Earth is constantly changing and moving in predictable patterns and cycles. The water cycle and nutrient cycles (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, etc.) are Earth's metabolism. The Homo sapiens component of the interdependent ecosystem known as Gaia or Biosphere 2 can be studied by observing these changes over time on a human scale."
