This needs to be prefaced by a disclaimer: I'm not critical of the person who invented this website or the site's contents; it just happens how they were born on this site! The site isn't perfect because there are bad apples everywhere (I am one myself). It makes for a good story though which is great storytelling for 2006, so please refrain from pointing fingers at me based entirely on the fact that I write about something that has been well known since the beginning - well before I wrote about it... To reduce the fuss over the creation of this site to an argument between two individuals behind it seems like a lot more than it is worth considering when talking about a site that may have created some controversy in 2006-2006.
