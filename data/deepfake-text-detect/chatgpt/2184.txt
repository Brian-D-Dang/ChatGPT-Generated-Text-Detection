Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and am not trying to downplay the seriousness or prevalence thereof at all...just curious why this particular case seems more poignant? Because it's usually in reference to women being raped by men which doesn't happen as often but when happens (like here) gets a lot more attention because sadly society thinks men can't be victims of sexual assault
