Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good (and usually cost more) than fresh slices of pizza made by hand and baked daily." "At one point I was buying two or three cases at once because they were so cheap," he said about when he discovered how much better the homemade pizzas tasted compared to what you could find on grocery store shelves. "I had it pointed out that if we sold our own dough, we would be able to make all the pies ourselves for less money." That discussion sparked the idea. Hawaiian-style Pizza The first batch was a success - Hoppy even bought some ingredients before making his grand debut with Hawaiian-style Pizza. For this experiment, he used organic whole wheat flour creamed with coconut oil, which gives Hawaiian-style Pizzas their unique crust. The filling consists of mozzarella cheese mixed with shredded carrot, onion and pineapple, topped off with basil. With help from friends who are also avid home bakers and pizza enthusiasts, the plan quickly took shape. After many experiments including four types of toppings, the perfect recipe is now set: Carrot Pineapple - A combination of caramelized onions and chopped carrots makes an excellent base for any pie topping. Adding sweet pineapple helps the flavors mix together perfectly. As an alternative to honey, Hoppy likes agave syrup and maple syrup both work well here. - A combination of caramelized onions and chopped carrots makes an excellent base for any pie topping.

Black Pepper Crust - This type of crust contains black pepper to give it its distinctive taste. It's ideal if you want to add another flavor element like cayenne pepper without having to worry too much about sugar. Just remember not to overdo the heat! - This type of crust contains black pepper to give it its distinct taste.

Freshly Ground Pepper - This tip comes courtesy Chef Gordon Ramsay who suggests grinding your spices yourself rather than purchasing preground mixes. You'll get a much greater variety of tastes and textures and know exactly how much spice you're putting into each bite.

Mozzarella Cheese - If you prefer a softer cheese blend such as aged Gouda instead of sharp Cheddar, then go ahead and use that but do note this will change the overall texture slightly. Cheddar has higher fat content while Gouda offers more creaminess. "My goal was always to create something delicious using seasonal vegetables. Since there wasn't really anything available locally other than frozen pizza bases, I decided to tailor my recipes based on local produce to try and keep everything as authentic as possible while still keeping costs down. My original recipe incorporates carrots, peppers and pineapple," says Hoppy. Since most Americans have little experience cooking or baking from scratch, Hoppy wanted to focus on creating easy instructions people could learn easily. He created his website just weeks ago where users can find step-by-step photos showing them through every stage of making whatever he creates. From simple substitutions to explaining why certain things may be better prepared differently, he wants everyone to feel comfortable in the kitchen. Even those who aren't quite confident enough yet to tackle the full process should still enjoy experimenting. No matter whether someone is a seasoned cook looking for new ideas, or simply trying to expand their culinary horizons, they won't regret learning how to create these deliciously memorable dishes.
