There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: Wow people it's just an opinion... Chill out I don't think anyone thinks that your kid is actually deaf Actually I do. The guy who made this post has no clue what he's talking about or if that kid even really does have one..
