so random battles that just happen with no warning, while you're walking, just like, warpy screen, you're in a battle now stuff. this really only applies to turn based games, but if i'm playing an action game and get jumped by enemies as I try out the controls for those actions then it's not very fun either the thing is though: there are many ways of making things easier on players without turning everything into something so simple they feel insulted or demotivated when faced against more difficult opponents...offering training modes would be one way (which everone probably already knows about), having certain typesdifficulty levels setting where even being passable isn't always well rewarded could help too..or maybe some kindof "cups" system we saw back at yu-gi oh? were people who did badly enough got punished somehow?? idk how hard such changes should phase difficulty settings which seem mostly meant toward gameplay anyway!! Personally these days most fighting scenes im watching online tend towards shifting away from twitch playstyle because its increasingly becoming considered outdated afaik
