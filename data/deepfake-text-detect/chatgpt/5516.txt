This CMV was sparked by the reaction to Donald Trump from the right in the recent GOP Candidate Debate but extends to everyone who intentionally used political incorrectness for personal gain. The University of Cincinnati College Republicans are pretty much a party with no sense of fairness and superiority, which is why they claim they're in favor of removing Confederate monuments that glorify the Confederacy as well. They think it's acceptable because Confederate statues should be removed while Republicans don't like them politically. But let's face it: Confederate statues don't belong anywhere except on campus or in museums. That isn't fair politics either; the campus Democrats hate them, too. The university has been putting up with it since the late 1960s when it declared that Confederate statues were unconstitutional. It would seem that many students feel the same way about Confederate statues popping up all over campus these days - and think that "the worst thing we can do" is remove such reparations money to repentant white supremacists but then throw away thousands of dollars worth of scholarships for Confederate veterans? The university also worships President Trump but doesn't want him impeached so he might try to get a new speaker to join him at a dinner planned later this week instead of removing Confederate statues again if it scares off potential attendees. But there may have something else in common between the university's Republicans and the students. The university went along with the Confederate statues' removal last year after college president Harvey Milk insisted they should stay in place. Milk called for the statues to remain memorialized somewhere besides the university building (read: campus plaza), saying it wouldn't send an unpleasant message of separation of church and state. Under pressure from the students, the university agreed to keep them permanently until Milk died. The university did not take the proposal seriously enough before Milk died earlier this month. It eventually dropped Milk's request without warning, allowing protesters to move the statue outside campus grounds where Milk lived until its removal could happen early next year. Milk had hoped to share his legacy on campus with students during a speech afterward against Confederate monuments rather than the statue sculpture alone. Milk didn't see himself as a divisive figure among students anyway - he never publicly advocated for Confederate monuments being torn down nor even suggested he acknowledged the racist views of those who supported them decades ago - but he said he wanted to leave some distance between himself and the idea that racism still exists today. At the college visit, university officials apologized repeatedly to Milk supporters including students for their actions and acknowledged Milk wasn't happy about the monument removal plan moving forward despite his threats to cancel events and suspend campus activities unless protesters stopped attacking him. Milk continued his campaign periodically throughout the protests urging students to fight back forcefully. On Wednesday afternoon, the university announced Milk was stepping down as president due to health reasons - though Milk won't necessarily step aside indefinitely given his restrictions regarding student rights under federal rules. Milk will continue to work with the campus administration every day through 2019-2020 despite his hospitalization. He'll serve out the remainder of Milk's term pending approval Thursday night by the board. If Milk dies soon, the university will replace Milk's presidency with a new committee that includes current students and faculty members representing the college community. Milk liked to say he'd support any committees formed, but the committee hasn't yet begun meeting so Milk remains inactive most nights other than leaving lectures.
