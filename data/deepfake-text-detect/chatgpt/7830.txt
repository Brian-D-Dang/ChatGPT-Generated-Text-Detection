While it is true that the issue of states' rights was a significant factor in the lead up to the American Civil War, it is important to recognize that this view presents only a partial and incomplete understanding of the war's causes. Ultimately, the Civil War was fought over the issue of slavery and its expansion into new territories. The secession of southern states and the formation of the Confederate States of America were explicitly driven by the desire to preserve the institution of slavery. In fact, the Confederate Constitution included provisions that specifically protected slavery. Given this, it is essential that teaching about the American Civil War includes a detailed examination of the role that slavery played in the war's origins and outcome. Failing to do so presents an inaccurate and oversimplified portrayal of a complex historical event.
