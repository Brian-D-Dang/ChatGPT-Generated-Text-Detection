Written hastily, but hopefully I can clarify any mistakes in comments, here we go: The Confederacy was racist according to the cornerstone speech and secession papers (tx): [Cornerstone Speech] excerpt: "Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product, which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin. That we do not overstate the dangers to our institution, a reference to a few facts will sufficiently prove." Texas Secession documents (tx): "That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend; and we denounce as sinful and as unlawful any interference, under any pretext or by any means, with our domestic institutions."
