Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of room for reasonable objections - even if you don't agree with them. Just because something has been written about it in an academic journal doesn't make any particular opinion right or wrong (it does not excuse bad scholarship by scholars who have no defense). The number one rule when reviewing papers: If your paper would neither be published nor rejected at the Journal of Atheism and Secular Humanities, then say so! But take note people like Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins may feel they must respond though their critics questioning their work as they are trying to build up what appears to be very solid 'evidence' through rigorous analysis backed up by large numbers of citations forming a pattern where none exist; also known as, "a hunch." These critics will likely refute these arguments but again put this down to poor scholarship which needs to be ignored. I think we should all try to engage our opponents without attacking their character or compassion, especially when dealing with contentious issues such as ideas found within religious texts. It's important to maintain a positive attitude towards those who disagree with us and reach out to them rather than shutting them off from further debate through harsh words alone. When my brother was growing up he told his parents several times how horrible religion is to him along with other reasons why he left it behind. He never had enough support from either parent while living under their roof which made things pretty difficult sometimes since he wanted nothing more than to live within the confines of his own house free from a superstitious mind set. He did get a chance to move away after college until he ended back home around twenty years later due to financial problems. This time he got better treatment which allowed him to stay independent longer before eventually moving into an apartment near by. At first my father welcomed him back warmly only to change once my brothers girlfriend moved into town and started calling all hours of the night asking questions regarding my brother's past lifestyle including drug use among others. My dad finally decided she was harassing him so he called the police and filed abuse charges against her. The police came by several times looking for answers however were unable to find anything inconsequential during their visits. After months of waiting for court dates repeatedly being postponed the case was dismissed due to lack of evidence presented by anyone involved. Eventually my father just settled for giving everything back to my brother and selling everything else elsewhere besides any furniture items he wanted to keep there. So yeah, sorry Dad... I'm kind of glad you gave in and quit holding onto stuff anymore too;) As far as I know my father didn't suffer much stress over losing money and belongings mostly thanks to my mother getting disability pay checks for various injuries throughout the years so long story short... Don't give up hope yet guys. You can always go to court sometime in the future since this wasn't really resolved between everyone involved and nobody ever wants to admit fault so hopefully it'll be easier now:) Thanks for listening to my rambling thoughts here haha oh well. Hope everyone is having a great day today if they're not already;D Peace everyone )
