Though my personal political views match those of Bernie Sanders much more than Hillary Clinton, I believe nominating Bernie could ultimately be very damaging for the progressive cause. My main point is that the Democratic Party has grown much too powerful and is at the moment too deeply entrenched to be the vehicle for a progressive revolution. The Democratic Party is a powerful, entrenched, and very dangerous institution. It will never willingly give up its power, and it will fight against any challenges to that power. It will do so in a way that is much more effective than the Republicans. The Democrats will create more obstacles and more roadblocks than the Republicans. The Democrats will work against a true revolution of the system. I do not believe that the Democrats are the best vehicle for making that revolution, nor do I believe that Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to lead that revolution. I believe that the Democrats must be defeated. I believe that the Democrats must be destroyed before any progressive revolution can take place. I believe that if Bernie Sanders were to be elected President, he would have to work within the system of the Democratic Party, and that he would not be able to work as effectively against the Democratic Party and against its obstacles as he might if he were to run as an Independent. The Democrats would be able to create obstacles that they could not have created if he were not a Democrat. I believe that if Bernie Sanders is elected President, the Democratic Party will be able to use the power that it has gained by choosing Sanders to continue to set its agenda. I believe that Bernie Sanders will be able to further the progressive cause. I believe that if he were elected President, he would be able to significantly advance the progressive cause. I believe that he could be much more effective in doing so if he were not a Democrat. But I also believe that Bernie Sanders will ultimately be much more effective in advancing the progressive cause if he does not have the extra political obstacles that he would have as a Democrat. I believe that he would be better off as an Independent, and that he would be more effective in advancing his cause if he were not affiliated with the Democrats. The Democrats would be able to work against Bernie Sanders more effectively than they would against someone else, and they would be able to do so much more effectively than they would against someone not affiliated with the Democrats.
