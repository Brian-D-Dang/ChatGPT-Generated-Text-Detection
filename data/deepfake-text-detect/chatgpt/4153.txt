First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however: We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is evil. Second: You are not trying to make a point; you are just making an ass out of u and me. I'm not sure if there's a better way to put this other than "you're being hypocritical."
