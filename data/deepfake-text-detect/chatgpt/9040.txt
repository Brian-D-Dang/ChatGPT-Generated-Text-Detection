I'll allow that, in most cases, the misbehaving kid is just throwing a temper tantrum, but what do you do in cases where the kid has thrown himself on the ground? That was actually my question. I think it's silly to say "that child who threw themselves at the school can't be trusted." But why should they? You cannot trust toddlers spitting at each other with their fists and arms when there are no kids around to intervene and protect them from others.
