I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry atheists will tell you. Do you live in an area where Christians are being persecuted for these things? How do we know they're not just doing this because it's part and parcel with Christianity to preach against homosexuality?
