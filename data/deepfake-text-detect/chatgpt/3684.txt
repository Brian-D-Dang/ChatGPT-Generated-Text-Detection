People seem to feel right now that Sanders is just not well-known enough to even have a chance at the presidency, and that it will stay that way. Everyone has different opinions and ideas about the presidential candidates, and it's difficult to predict what will happen in the future. However, if Sanders continues to make his platform and policies clear to the public and gains more visibility, he may have a better chance at winning the presidency. It's important to keep an open mind and stay informed about all the candidates and their views.
