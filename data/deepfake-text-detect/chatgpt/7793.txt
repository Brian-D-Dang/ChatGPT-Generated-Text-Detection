A counter-argument to refute the opinion that "Not all X" has a small, but important place in gender equality discussion is that it can actually hinder progress towards gender equality. When individuals use "Not all X" as a response to discussions of systemic oppression and discrimination, it can shift the focus from the larger issue to individual experiences, ultimately undermining the need for change. Additionally, it can be counterproductive for privileged individuals to assert their innocence of wrongdoing, when the focus should be on recognizing and dismantling systems of oppression. As a result, the use of "Not all X" can ultimately perpetuate harmful attitudes and behaviors, rather than fostering progress towards gender equality.
