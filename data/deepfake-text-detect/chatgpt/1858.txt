First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and have been used as a tool for oppression against people who live in poverty or from marginalized communities. But when you look at the money spent on prisons compared with what we spend on schools - which is about 20 billion annually - and how much that's wasted on things like making sure inmates can't read their books because they're too busy chewing gum while waiting for the food cart to roll by...it might be time to consider cutting back on some of this spending before it completely annihilates our society.
