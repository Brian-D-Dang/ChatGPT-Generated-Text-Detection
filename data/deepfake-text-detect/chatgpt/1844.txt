I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info:) Now, while I don't agree with those boycotts by any means... What I am not understanding is how they are being paid an equal amount when it comes down right and proper? Is there anything that needs to be changed in order for them all to receive same paycheck as male counterparts or should we just accept their current situation due to unfairness?? For me personally, I see no need for change at this time but maybe someday! And if so what would you suggest???
