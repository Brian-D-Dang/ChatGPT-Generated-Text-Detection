I attribute my agnosticism to this very theory. Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in existence when it popped into being. No space-time continuum with which to make sense of anything - no matter existed before everything began, and therefore could not have been responsible for its creation. Assuming energy exists (and I believe that does) it must be eternal if God is assumed to be an omnipotent creator. Eternal implies timeless; but in order for something to exist outside time altogether we would need another dimension than our four dimensions of SpaceTime, probably five. The fifth dimension has two aspects: one is Time itself in relation to other things existing across infinite distances simultaneously, so as you look back through time your hands get further away from each other and thus infinitely far apart...the opposite occurs closer together and less distant through out time as they shrink forever towards 0. Another aspect of the fifth dimension relates to gravitation and gravity i.e., what force keeps us all on Earth's surface instead of plummeting off the bottom edge. There are many theories involving extra spatial dimensions beyond 4, but the one most likely is M Theory where string vibrates across multiple dimensions creating strands of photons that bind atoms together, depending on how much "energy" you pull in between them the strand contracts slightly more and becomes thicker making the whole thing heavier, and vice versa. Now consider how huge a universe such as ours might actually appear to these additional directions....and realize why if you were standing inside said bubble staring outward there'd only be 3 dimensional objects within the bubble in any direction. So now let's assume YHWH created everything that ever will happen from some special point of reference he chose to call "at" zero years ago. At that instant everything else happened everywhere at once. Even though every place had the same number of seconds passed according to the clock running down the center of earth the past does not always equal the present. A single event can skip ahead over multiple hours or even days of time. That means that YHWH who only knows about events happening exactly 2 minutes after his own birth may expect his children to readjust their clocks and turn around and rewind history by thousands of miles rather than hundreds, because those people remember him having been born 30 years earlier whereas he doesn't until 2012 AD. He may also expect everyone watching today to go home early because he appeared 2000 years prior to sunrise. If the Bible is accurate regarding our planet's age then that makes us both younglings and teenagers now! Which explains the problems Christians face trying to reconcile contradictory claims made by science versus scripture sometimes. We're sorta like Buddahists. One part believes in reincarnation and rebirth while the other part teaches "You cannot escape your karma." It takes a lot of humility to admit mistakes, and in fact that may still take till doomsday tomorrow to fully sink in. So ok maybe religion isn't perfect but at least the believers try harder than anyone else on Earth in terms of self improvement. But really, given enough information people can come up with just about any interpretation they want without regard to reality whatsoever. And yes, I'm aware how little faith and belief play roles in determining what happens to me in life. I used to feel the same way. How did that work? I don't care anymore because change is constant regardless of religion.
