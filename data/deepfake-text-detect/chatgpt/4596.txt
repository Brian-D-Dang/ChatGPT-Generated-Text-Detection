A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government). Losing an election does not magically make you any less of a patriot. It's typical I know that this is the case, and I'm ok with it because if we are going to be in power now there will be no further elections for some time so someone else takes over then. But calling him "first citizen" doesn't sound right...More importantly though, isn't he one who was put in charge by us? Unless I missed something, wouldn't you want your first person at the helm leading from behind rather than the other way around? Who knows what would happen if the Queen wasn't there to do whatever she needs to do. Would things get done straight away? Who knows! There can only ever be one Etonian on the Privy Council, but when there were two Labour prime ministers in as many years it was Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. If those two had split into different parties, and appeared likely to form each own coalition governments, it would've been up to ParliamentMPs to decide which man should become PM. They could pick between them. The British Crown was never directly elected. It derives its legitimacy from being hereditary monarchy and through the Royal Family itself. The monarch himself (or her heir) is also Head Of State, which doesn't mean parliament necessarily gives him dictatorial powers, nor does it forbid parliamentary vetoes or cede authority to unelected officials like judges etc
