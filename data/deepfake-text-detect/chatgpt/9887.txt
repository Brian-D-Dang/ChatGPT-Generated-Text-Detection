Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I need to consider. For starters, you'll want to come up with a guest list of people you'd like to invite. Then, think about the type of event you'd like to have - would it be a dinner party, a backyard barbecue, or a dance party? Once you've decided on the type of event, find a venue that can accommodate all your guests and any plus ones. You may also want to look into catering services, decorations, and entertainment. Finally, send out invitations to your guests (and their plus ones) with the details of the event.
