Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if well-intentioned, her actions were not appropriate for a teacher of young children (who are very impressionable). I don't understand why you got downvoted; there's literally no explanation here as to what she did "wrong." She has been fired because they thought it would be bad PR....
