Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. It takes a lot more skill to actually write lyrics that make sense and have meaning. Rap is an art, but not every rapper may be talented at it.
