I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be right and wrong for you to do in a situation even if they can't consciously put words on why (most people will subconsciously know the difference between murdering someone vs stealing something). It does seem like some of us have grown up with an understanding about certain things being "okay" because we were told so or saw others doing them without consequence when really most adults wouldn't consider those actions okay based off of their own conscience...
