I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. It's not just about winning or losing battles by large margins on either side, it is much more complex than that. The United States did lose WW2 in many ways but as one poster pointed out: "America was only involved after Pearl Harbor." Had we been given an opportunity to fight for our country at Dunkirk I am sure this would have happened. There were actually thousands who wished to go over there with British ships during those dark days in 1940-42 however Churchill decided against it since he feared that Americans might be perceived as cowards if they stayed home. Eventually though Britain needed American help because the German threat threatened her survival so Churchill eventually relented. Without this U.S support we probably wouldn't have won the war. However, what most people don't realize is how close Hitler came to invading the USA right after Pearl Harbor. The German spy ring had successfully infiltrated the highest levels of governmentmilitary and knew full well where all the military bases were located including one very near Washington DC called Fort McHenry. They also had plans to invade all of Canada at one point between 1942 - 1943. Hitler even proposed sending his own troops into the US to get them off their guard. This plan never materialized due to Stalin's invasion of the Soviet Union which diverted resources away from Operation Barbarossa. If you ever need any proof of Nazi infiltration in North America and low key planning for WWII then look up Dr Ernst Reinhardt and Paul Vernichtung.
