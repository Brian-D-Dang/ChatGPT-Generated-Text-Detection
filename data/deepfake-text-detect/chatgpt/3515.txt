Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. I understand your opinion, but at the same time, rapping goes beyond just saying words over a beat. It requires skill, technique, and creativity. Many rappers spend years perfecting their craft and developing their own unique style. Additionally, some rap lyrics may not make sense at first, but they can often hold deeper meaning or be a commentary on society. Like any art form, there are some who are more skilled and talented than others, but that doesn't mean the entire genre lacks talent.
