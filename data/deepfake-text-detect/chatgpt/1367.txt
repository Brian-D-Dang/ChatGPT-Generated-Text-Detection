tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to basketball, football and hockey are my main interest (I've tried baseball too). Because its harder for me now since i live in the east coast than watching any other sport lol
