While it is true that the effects of coffee may vary from person to person, it cannot be said that the effects are negligible or placebo. The caffeine content in coffee is a scientifically proven stimulant, which can help increase alertness and reduce fatigue. Additionally, coffee contains antioxidants and other beneficial compounds that can have positive effects on health. As for the taste, it is a matter of personal preference, and just because someone doesn't like the taste of coffee doesn't mean they have to lie about it. In fact, there are many people who genuinely enjoy the taste of coffee and find it to be a pleasant part of their daily routine. Overall, the idea that coffee is overrated is subjective and cannot be applied universally.
