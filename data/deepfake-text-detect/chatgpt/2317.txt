Improv, as an art form, is a medium almost exclusively to be enjoyed live. SNL, while having improvised elements, does not fall in this category because most skits are rehearsed and written out before filming begins (to accommodate the actors' schedules) instead of being performed on camera spontaneously by real people with no prior knowledge or preparation for their lines.[12] The term "improv" was created when Richard Adler saw his play The Improvisers at Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre; he then decided that it would make sense if all plays were called something similar. One month later, Adler wrote another play entitled That Was Then This Is Now which used many improvisational techniques from The Improvisers such as audience participation, scene changes made during a performance based on suggestions given by the audience, simulating dreams within scenes through stage directions In her dream she dreamed that..., and adapting existing words into new ones. Other writers who had seen those first two shows came up with other works using these ideas: Neil Simon took some stylistic aspects from It's Only A Play,[1314] Jonathan Lynn adapted Mark Twain short stories[15] and Garson Kanin also incorporated them into scripts.[16] When William Shakespeare heard about improv, though, he threw down his pen and said "Thou shalt write nothing but tragedy!17]
