I understand that it may be hard for you guys to look forward to studying for exams but it is something completely different than what people usually consider an achievement so if this happens then that means we want to give a reason why it isn't meaningful enough or beneficial enough for us as students who try harder than us. You can have my attention now What courses are you taking?
