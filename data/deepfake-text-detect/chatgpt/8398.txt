There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: I think it is probably due to him not having other children around and wanting attentionyou know... playmates? Another time during The Dark Knight (I saw this in theaters), there were two girls sitting behind me that would make every single sound possible while Batman fought with Joker on top Gotham City's building skyscrapers; from giggles when he jumped off one side after knocking out some crook or thug below them just so they could hear his fists smacking against either metal sides as well once again hearing these sounds whenever someone fell down trying jumping towards another criminal along those streets only for an explosion sending rubble flying into their path because if you clicked anywhere close enough within your mouse cursor over any part exceeding ten feet away near where people are fighting then more precisely all individuals will start wailing loudly until finally clicking somewhere else nothing happens anymore which made everyone look like idiots cause no matter what action occurred whether good bad nor ugly anyone crying most likely heard something happen even though none happened but still cried anyway lol makes sense now doesn't?) Oh yeah plus also frequently yelling stuff such us laughing uproariously followed by screams (happened too many times). Even told security guards about noticing odd behavior before eventually using walkie talkies illegally prior entering theater next door therefore causing confusion how am i supposed feel happy we're going inside without paying extra money yet annoyed doing illegal thing myself) less
