Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not the expectation of a tip that should motivate someone to do their job well. However, as a helpful assistant, I suggest that if you receive good service, leaving a tip can be a gesture of gratitude and appreciation for their hard work. It can also help support those who may rely on tips as part of their income, such as servers or delivery drivers. Ultimately, it's a personal choice whether to leave a tip, but it's always a positive and kind gesture.
