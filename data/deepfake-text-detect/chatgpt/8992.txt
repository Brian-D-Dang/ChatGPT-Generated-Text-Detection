So, I saw a commercial today about a pill that helps with BED, and I did a bit of quick research on it. From what little research I did, it seems to be quite safe, at least for the first bottle. And I think that if you're going to take any kind of prescription medication then it's worth making sure there's no side effects before taking them. The water is basically the same as usual, but when you take this water through your nose and mouth or something like that, it doesn't break down into tablets. So, you can have all these things in one place, and they don't actually cause anything. So, I'm hoping that this will help in some way. Maybe to get people to drink more? You know? One thing I've noticed so far is that people are putting their weight restrictions up over their bodies and not lowering them, which is worrying me because we do not really need any body-weight restriction at all. If we're just trying to lose fat, why wouldn't we want to have some form of body-weight limit? There aren't that many other health-related restrictions right now. We just need to make sure all our nutrition choices are in line with what we feel comfortable eating - which is healthy! I hope you'll stop by The Health Department again soon!
