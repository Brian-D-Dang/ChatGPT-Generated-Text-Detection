I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying that Huckabee's comment was "unforgivable" (as if not being on his level at all is forgivable) or actually a great example of why Obama has to win in November because no one says it like he does... Well now we know who believes what when they hear someone else believe what: Christians!Accordingly, there are two new polls out today from Public Policy Polling and Rasmussen Reports which show McCain surging among white evangelicals into double digits lead over RomneyRyan. The problem for Republicans is that their base voters who mostly identify themselves as "liberals," i.e., Democrats don't seem too excited about them voting for John McCain again. But even though most people apparently still prefer republicanssince's only a margin difference between the parties so far fundamentally changing demographics make independents much more important than ever before, especially since the political landscape isn't going anywhere soon anyhow. And while whites have been trending slightly blue overall, the clear dominant demographic group when it comes to politics right now is Hispanics. And Hispanics will be larger than non-Hispanic whites by 2040... Not only can Mitt ask Governor Johnson to go home anytime you want, but also Hispanics here in California aren't likely to learn English anyway prior to becoming citizens! So putting up an immigration moratorium might just backfire big time... particularly now that Latinos think Mitt Romney cares very little about illegal immigration. In fact, according to Pew Research Center polling, 27 of Hispanic Americans approve of how President Obama is handling the issue, compared with 24 percent disapproval. Meanwhile, 58 percent disapprove of Romney's positions on the topic; 57 percent hold views unfavorable toward Perry, 41 percent view those same views negatively towards Santorum, 35 percent feel likewise of Gingrich, and 28 percent do so for Paul ... [S]ome 44 percent plan to vote Democratic and some 23 percent plan to support the GOP candidate (27 percent remain undecided). Among black men, 53 percent favor Obama, 40 percent do Gop candidates, 5 percent lean Dem, 3 percent Lean Repub and 6 percent remain undeclared...[T]he president holds a 59 percent approval rating amongst African Americans, compared to 29 percent who disapprove. The numbers leave room to grow for both conservatives and liberals this election cycle, given the president can curry votes from either side within seconds - witness how quickly Obama emerged following Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey last week. ThinkProgress reports "the total number of battleground states where Barack Obama leads Donald Trump in opinion poll results exceeds 50 - including several key swing states such as Florida and Ohio - suggesting that Obama could potentially gain four to eight points during the final weeks of the campaign due to rampant voter enthusiasm." Aside from race, gender, age, income levels, education levels etc, the UVA report found conservative women to be significantly less progressive than liberal women. This may explain why Palin, Cain et al cannot appeal successfully enough to female voters. Also, what makes me optimistic is that young women tend to be prolife whereas older women usually vote solidly democrat. It seems that younger, better educated women are already free thinking individuals. They should be able to see through obvious sexists like Sarah Palin. For instance, she once said that rape victims deserved to get pregnant.... With regards to Sarah Palin, noted historian Doris Kearns Goodwin stated that she reminded her of 19th century matriarchs who let loose rebellious sons to run wild without proper supervision. She did another interview recently in Newsweek magazine and made the case as usual that she wants to change America back to its roots...Sarah's argument against contraception is very similar to the arguments religious fundamentalists used to oppose birth control pills decades ago. It was obviously brilliant marketing strategy on Sarah Palin's part to promote herself using John Wayne type machismo imagery combined with sexist stereotypes. However, it just didn't work well. Voters realized something wasn't quite working as intended. Her persona became increasingly annoying. Mainstream media demonized her further rather than praising her success. One thing led to another and eventually that whole stereotype image became dated. Now she is portrayed in Hollywood movies as the crude, crazy blonde woman while Jane Fonda plays the feminist role extolled by Gloria Steinem. Ironically, it appears that the real victim of sexism in American society is Hillary Clinton. Why? Because feminists like myself expect that feminism itself will bring equality to both sexes. When Sarah was asked a question regarding equal rights for women during the 2008 presidential primaries, she responded in typical fashion by stating that all women had their own personal talents and therefore, could choose whether or not to focus on certain areas of interest. Unfortunately, this was interpreted by many commentators as indicating opposition to equal pay legislation. Most interpretations focused exclusively upon her statement concerning choice of career paths, forgetting her point about personal strengths throughout life. Therefore, although Sarah Palin presents herself as strong, independent woman capable of caring resulter' in the end, these inconsistencies identified post reporting contradictory assertions about having applied logic astellers' constant praterb risker
