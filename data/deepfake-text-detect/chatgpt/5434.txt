This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special privileges because they were born into homeschooling families and parents with study groups of their own choosing, whose children could help them learn English properly or improvement in grammar through peer group meetings etc., Educationally speaking they have a better chance at advancement than any other child cannot be capable of learning English properly themselves (and this requires extra effort). I'm sorry you felt compelled by this article, but it seems like your thoughts weren't clear enough... They should let kids speak up for themselves! At least the parents do already know why they're doing things differently from other schools:)
