First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from a business perspective. Are there any advantages or disadvantages to having customers park in the same lot as the store? The biggest advantage is obvious. It makes it easier for the customer to get from his or her car to the store. Customers might not be as careful about things like having their child buckled in or letting the dog out of the car. The biggest disadvantage is that the customer will spend more time shopping because they don't have to drive the car to the store or return it to the same location. They'll be more likely to buy something or take something out of the store that they didn't plan to buy or take out. Many people make a living running shops or selling items at a flea market or carnival. If they don't have to take their car to the store or back to their vehicle, then they might be able to make more money. I'd imagine that a high percentage of customers would not appreciate the inconvenience of parking in a different lot than the store. I'd imagine that some customers wouldn't even notice that they had to walk farther than they normally do. On the other hand, I'd imagine that a high percentage of customers would like the convenience of being able to park as close to the store as possible. If the store offers free parking, then there would be even more customers who would prefer to park close to the store. What do you think? Is it better to have customers park in the same lot as the store or in a different lot? I'd rather park in the same lot as the store. I'm not walking to the store if I don't have to. I'd rather park in a different lot. I like to take a walk. I'll walk as far as I have to. If you don't mind walking, then it doesn't matter where you park. You can park anywhere you want. If you mind walking, then it doesn't matter where you park. If you park too far away, then you'll be annoyed because you'll have to walk so far. If you don't mind walking, then you'd prefer to park in the same lot. If you mind walking, then you'd prefer to park in a different lot. Yes, I want you to explain your answer. Hmm, I would say that it is better to park in the same lot as the store because I hate walking so I would rather not walk if I did not have to. But it is up to you. I like to park as close to the store as possible so that I don't have to walk too much. I'm not going to walk to the store. I'm going to park as close to the store as possible. I'm going to park in the same lot as the store. I think that it depends on where you park. If you park in the same lot, then you will have to walk farther to get to the store, but if you park in another lot, then you will have to walk to the store. I would rather park in the same lot as the store, because then I would be closer to the store and could leave quicker. I would rather park in a different lot, because I like to get some exercise. I would rather park in the same lot, because it's closer to the store. I would rather park in the same lot, because it's closer to the store, and it's easier. I don't think it matters where you park. If you don't mind walking, then it doesn't matter where you park. If you mind walking, then it doesn't matter where you park. If you park too far away, then you'll be annoyed because you'll have to walk so far. I think that it depends on where you park. If you park in the same lot, then you will have to walk farther to get to the store, but if you park in another lot, then you will have to walk to the store. I would rather park in a different lot. I would rather park in the same lot. I would rather park in the same lot because it would be easier to get to. I would rather park in the same lot because it would be easier to get to. It would be closer.
