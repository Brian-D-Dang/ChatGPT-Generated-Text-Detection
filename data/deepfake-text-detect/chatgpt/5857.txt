I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a car and holding onto it for 10 years just doesn't make sense. You'd be way better off buying a cheap used car every few years and selling it. A car isn't an investment, it's a liability. You'll never make a profit on it. If you're driving a car that's 10 years old and it's in good condition, it's probably a good time to sell it. Cars aren't investments, they're liabilities. If you hold on to them for 10 years, you're not going to make money. You'll be much better off buying a cheap used car and selling it in 3 years. I am one of those people who drives a car for 10 years and then sells it. For me, the idea of a car being a liability is an alien concept. It's a depreciating asset, not a liability. It's not going to hurt you financially. It's going to hurt you if you have to repair it. I've sold cars when they have been 10 years old and only recently have I realized that I probably could have gotten more for them. But I was always willing to take less because I wasn't going to spend a lot of time selling them. I didn't want to have to drive them around and deal with potential buyers and all that. There are people who want to sell a car. So they go online and they put a list of features, and they do all that stuff. But that's just not me. I drive my cars until they break down. I am of the opinion that, as long as you are paying the taxes, insurance and maintenance on a car, you are better off keeping it. If you put the money you would have spent on a new car in a savings account, you would have a lot more money to spend on a new car in 10 years. I have a friend who has a 10-year-old car. He got a 20,000 car, and it's not in great shape. He drives it around because he can't afford to buy a new car right now. In 10 years, he's going to have a new car that will last him another 10 years. If you want to have a car that's like new, you need to get a new car every five years or so. You're not going to have a good car that's 10 years old. You'll have a car that's not new, but it won't break down. If you're going to put a lot of money into a car, buy a car that's going to have a lot of value. In 10 years, you're going to have a really good car. You're going to have a car that's going to last you another 10 years. I have a good friend who bought a BMW when he was young. He was a single guy. He was making a pretty good salary. He traded it in when he got married, and he got a car that was more practical. He traded the BMW in for an SUV, and he was looking to buy a new one. But he doesn't need an SUV. He's single again, and he makes a lot of money. He's buying a new BMW. He's going to keep that car for another 10 years. I have a friend who's 23 years old, and he drives a 10-year-old car. He could buy a new car, but he's holding onto the car because he doesn't want to have a new car payment. He doesn't want to put money into insurance or maintenance on a new car. I would be more inclined to buy a car when I'm in my 20s because I'm going to keep it for 10 years. But I have friends who are in their 50s who are more inclined to hold onto a car because they're getting older and they don't want to be bothered with a new car. Buying a car when you're 25 and keeping it for 10 years is the smartest thing you can do. In 10 years, you're going to have a car that's going to last you another 10
