I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost like transuranics. They don't have any of their original chemical constituents with them when they split apart? Or am I way off base here? That probably makes sense except for one thing: transuranic compounds are chemically unstable yet very light. Most will decay within minutes to hours at room temperature (depends on what type of atom), creating an "enriched" element. So your atoms won't get un-split into neutrons if you put enough pressure on them; just like how natural uranium doesn't live long after being separated from its heavy isotopes by crushing.
