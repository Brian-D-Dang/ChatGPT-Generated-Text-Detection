Thought about this for days, and I can't think of one aspect of the FPH community that made Reddit better: - They are ignorant: Proven by the overwhelming number of downvotes on every post. Also proven in the comments where people posted their own subreddits with 101 positive points and 1 negative point... (and they couldn't even get a fucking comment!) - The conversations here is extremely good: It's like having an interesting discussion at dinner with 10 friends. If you have to follow it up using medium or another forum than yes, it gets boring quickly.- Everyone has varying opinions on certain subjects which leads to discussions that aren't just pointless but also interesting because there is so much information out there!- No censorshipI guess if all these aspects were taken away then maybe what we would end up with is some hollow subreddit where no new topics come in and everyone posts the same shit anyway? So yeah those are my reasons as of why reddit was great before fph came around. Maybe someone else will see something else!
