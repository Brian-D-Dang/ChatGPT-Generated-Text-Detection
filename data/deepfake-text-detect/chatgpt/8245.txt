I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible for them to exist. What makes me think this? Well first of all there is not much evidence (or none at least) behind their existence - see here if you are interested: http:www-ndsu2m1...eselementsof... wikipedia). If they did make sense we would probably have seen some hints about these element before now; i remember hearing once how one possible explanation could be string theory....but alas! still nothing really concrete came out from those theories since then either so far:- (. Secondly an atom has around 1023 protons which each hold 2 electrons while ununs only holds 6 positrons:-O! So any way round my question might involve going down into quantum physics territory where things get even trickier due lack thereof evidences: (Any thoughts though will help:) Where can chemical reactions take place without air present?
