Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one partner is not interested anymore? I've been married to my wife since 2004; we have a six-year old daughter together and she has a younger sister (the oldest). We are both college educated people with careers that pay well. My question concerns what would happen if during those early years of marriage I begin looking around on dating sites such as Match.com, OkCupid etc., and find someone who seems attractive even though I know it's totally out of character for me because my wife had only dated guys within our social circle so far before meeting her husband. She didn't really like men much until we were engaged all the sudden. Would this other person be interested? Would heshe expect something from us? Or just tell your SO you aren't feeling things at first and then go to sleep? As an aside, whenever we'd meet up with friends they always seemed amused by how rarely I met girls' eyes while talking to them, but I felt self conscious about it too. Now I realize there was nothing wrong with me, but apparently, it made me stand out slightly more than normal amongst these gals. It's great now that women don't seem bothered. But does this mean I'm "safe"? - MariannaJul 16 '15 at 12:20 2 Answers 2 You're currently asking two questions here: 1) whether doing this will cause complications once you start having sexual relationships outside of marrying your spouse, and 2) whether this strategy works against your desire to commit to your relationship. While technically 1 includes 2, let's look only at 1 right now. The main consequence of starting casual romantic intimacy with others immediately following getting married is that future monogamous commitment becomes very difficult to make. The reason why is that once you get emotionally invested into a particular partner - whatever the reasons may be, the risk that sexual attraction comes along with being attracted to multiple partners increases significantly. So, in order to avoid cheating later down the road, people often choose to forego forming emotional bonds completely. In fact, many studies show that romantic love doesn't exist: it's merely infatuation based on hormonal changes with the sole purpose of mating, and thus, romance overshadows true feelings towards each individual. On the other hand, yes, it can work against committing to your current relationship! First off, one thing that's important to note is that nobody forces anyone to stay committed to their long term relationships. People do however pressure themselves to stick around - sometimes strongly enough to force themselves into unhappy marriages. Most importantly, given that most people want to remain single forever, finding new partners becomes easier the longer time passes without serious involvement. Therefore, if you date casually while waiting for marriage, chances are good that eventually someone won't turn up. If this occurs, you'll probably end up back where you started: alone again, which can actually jeopardize your own ability to form long lasting partnerships in the future. And even worse, you might miss out out on the huge amount of experiences that come with non-exclusive friendships and romances. As a matter of fact, human beings thrive and mature best when they develop strong, intimate ties with numerous individuals across wide age ranges (we see plenty of people losing touch with themselves in their 20s and 30s), rather than staying isolated inside their solitary closets. So, the bottom line is: yes, it can hurt your chances of marrying your wife, unless you marry another woman instead. You should also consider that nature doesn't give humans an infinite number of birthdays. Eventually every man ages past his prime, and an older woman continues aging until she dies in spite of every effort. Thus, if you feel tempted to pursue potential girlfriends while still legally bound to your wife, remember: your wife isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Instead, focus your energy on building long lasting friendship with members of either gender throughout your life, and try to ignore lustful thoughts directed at people outside your family. Your fate lies entirely upon yourself. No external influences count. Consider this scenario 3 months post wedding: There's some dude on OK Cupid whom you've never interacted with that sounds interesting. How likely is he going to call? Not super unlikely. Why? Because you haven't done anything whatsoever to him yet. He could ask himself "What kind of guy goes on a double blind date expecting to hookup?" Whatever happened between you has absolutely zero effect on his decision making process because he hasn't formed any opinion of you yet. Furthermore, he hasn't decided whether he wants to keep interacting with you further. For example, would he text you tomorrow night? More likely for sure, less likely depending on various factors. Does he think that conversation went particularly badly? Possibly, definitely not ideal, would realtavr.? An act or actstrickster A whole lotn Tainejadpremiumwill
