I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info:) Now, while I don't know enough about it all to give my opinion on what should be done or not, so bear with me here as there's only so much information in one person's head! But why is that? Why are women paid less than their male counterparts in sports and entertainment? It seems like pure sexism at first glance. Is paying females less just something we have been doing since forever without even thinking twice about our actions? Or does sexism play some role here? Does anyone else find anything wrong within the logic behind these things? What makes us think this way? And do you feel able to discuss other cases where inequality exists in regards to gender issues around the world today?
