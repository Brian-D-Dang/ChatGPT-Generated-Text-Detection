Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. does it sound like the government would have a solution for all of these problems? what if they don't? do you know how many years those satellites orbiting in our atmosphere will last? And even though there's probably way more than one piece floating around out here in orbit... how much damage can one little rock cause.... and why are we so concerned with it? The media has taken up this story because it sells newspapersmagazines seems to be the thing everyone wants to talk about.. but then again - most things sold by the press sell better if everybody talks about them rather than nobody talking about them Which brings us to another point: A large number newspaper editors (and apparently radio stations) realize that too much attention paid to anything leads to less sales. And yet some stories get top billing over other articles on their pageswebsites, while not getting enough interest from readers... which means fewer sales. Not sure if that applies to the topic at hand unless people keep going back and reading, hoping the'stupid' news article gets bigger headlines now.... What you're actually seeing happening is that certain politicians are making use of an event to try to gain support for their policies[1]. This first happened when NASA had to put its budget under review due to lack of funding after Sept 11th 2001. The result was several proposals were drafted mostly focusing on militarization efforts to combat asteroids.[2] These ideas never came into fruition until the threatdiscovery of asteroid 2012-DA14. Obama hailed the discovery as historic and used the occasion of his 2013 State Of The Union address to push harder towards a manned mission to find nearby NEOs,[34] but beyond vague statements he's done no specific plans to deal with near-Earth objects. [56] Meanwhile he pushed hard for increased spending on missile defense programs.[7] He also funded development of new weapons systems for countermeasures including anti-missile interceptors.[89] All very nice, except it's obvious to anyone who looks closer that it's nothing else but a ploy to raise money for military action amongst others. If you want real solutions you'd need someone pushing for strong regulation of mining activities which could control where material goes or increase taxes so all countries pay for planetary protection efforts instead of cutting off research altogether. But instead Obama wanted donations for his own political party. Crazy, isn't it? The same strategy played out during Bush era on JWST proposals. That time it was used for increasing funds for energy exploration instead. You'll notice both president tried to avoid discussing issues in regards to science and technology.[1011?] Both times the focus remained on security threats and got away from actual scientific progress completely. Maybe the public (who votes anyway) should demand otherwise! I think this thread might come down to choice between two extremes. One extreme says "It won't happenwhereas the opposite extreme says "Anything is possible..." Neither side IMO is correct; there are probabilities and possibilities within each case. Even if it IS true, that 'anything' may only be perceived by mankind through visions of disaster - the possibility, probability, and likelihood of any given situation occurring cannot necessarily be predicted with perfect certainty - merely expected based upon past experience. It must therefore be assumed that such events could still occur although the odds against a catastrophe being realized become greatly reduced. On the flipside, it can likewise be said without doubt that such catastrophes WILL inevitably take place regardless of whether humanity chooses to act appropriately in preventing future occurrences via proper contingency planning. For example, when considering nuclear power plants, the risks associated with catastrophic failures, major accidents, terrorism attacks, etc., are inherent throughout a lifespan that spans nearly four decades - from inception to retirement - and perhaps longer depending upon usage patterns established prior to retirement. As noted above, simply because a scenario hasn't occurred in previous instances is NOT proof positive that it couldn't happen in the future. When men initially built abutting buildings with identical structures - say hospital rooms separated 20 feet apart by walkways - they were essentially banking upon the fact that neither building would suffer structural failure resulting in wall collapse and injury or death should either structure fail independently. Had the latter occurred, hundreds if not thousands tragically perished. In retrospect, close scrutiny reveals numerous design flaws - and subtle points in construction wherein a builder misspoke using an incorrect cement mix, added extra reinforcement directly across joints, applied improper reinforcing tape to seams, attempted repair work outside of required hours of operation, failed to properly inspect welds, etc. - that resulted in total structural failure and subsequent casualties. Each minute passing since the initial implementation of risk management techniques designed to prevent such incidents represents activation of additional remedial measures - most likely resulting in greater levels of safety precautions to reduce potential hazards in eventuality. Such preparedness cases ...if at least five successive chances are resolved to zero that value However, prospective scenes
