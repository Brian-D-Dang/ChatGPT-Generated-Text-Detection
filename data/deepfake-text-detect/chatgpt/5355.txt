While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept . Then again the world needs to hear from Europeans who have paid a lot of attention to the science behind GMO food production because my effort is not based on peer reviewed research but rather my desire to understand what happens when you use genetically modified foods in some way other than just eating them. And yet another thing that 99 of Americans don't know about genetic engineering is that it creates diseases which the FDA deems dangerous as well as harmful. So while I accept that there may be risks associated with GMO foods this doesn't mean that they're harmless either....
