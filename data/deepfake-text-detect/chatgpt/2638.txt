Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by reference to objective reality, or else it's wrong; this includes all of history and culture as well. I have a few problems with "objective reality." The first problem has to do with ontology. If we are meaning objective reality in the way most people believe they understand things such as 'God' then there simply isn't one in our universe. God does not exist because he cannot possibly exist within his own concept (if you think about God as an ideaconcept rather than a real being). In fact, even if we were able somehow to come up with some sort of definition for 'god' which was both coherent and consistent enough to get us to accept a god into existence from pragmatic terms alone - like actual evidence of 'god' existing outside of anyone's head including ours - without having any understanding whatsoever of how said god thinks or feels etc., the entire enterprise would ultimately collapse under its own weight once you attempt anything more complex than thinking through two plus two. It's just too much cognitive load for something so simple as numbers! We can only deal with abstractions at best. What exactly makes X a mathematical object? How did Y become nature's principle force against entropy? Is Z really a dimensionality or merely an illusion created by language? These questions matter but none of them actually answer each other very well. The answers may often seem obvious yet their relationships are incredibly complicated. For example, math seems easy until you learn that it's essentially describing information in different ways based on your perspective which means everything is relative ... But the absolute truth doesn't lie anywhere between our perspectives anyway... So why bother pretending otherwise and put forth a stubborn insistence upon objectivity where pragmatically speaking we couldn't care less whether or not anything is superlative except insofar as it enables us to function effectively? This is my main issue here: that the whole thing is built around concepts which are illusory at best. The second problem concerns epistemology again. Remember those earlier statements about Rudolf Carnap who thought logic should not be applied creatively? Well, if you don't have knowledge, then you certainly shouldn't claim to know (anymore) precisely what might satisfy someone else since you lack the capacity to fully comprehend your situation let alone theirs. You can guess, make educated guesses, approximate conclusions after considering alternatives, bring all sorts of historical context and examples into play to try to fill out the picture ... And sometimes you will still end up dead wrong no matter what you do! All these facts add up to demonstrate that reason is fundamentally useless unless given sufficient access to relevant data. No amount of hand waving or logical gymnastics can overcome that fundamental limitation. But beyond mere ignorance comes guilt and murder. There is nothing rational about killing another person for the sake of preserving one's individual rights over others. Selfishness is itself irrational; therefore selfishness cannot serve as a justification for anything regardless of its ubiquity. As long as individuals maintain strong beliefs about the necessity of defending self interest above all other considerations they could give two shits about the consequences (as long as doing so preserves their personal happiness). I have trouble believing that human beings are smart enough to survive in large groups intelligently when the majority of participants refuse to consider any possibility other than themselves. Don't take that personally. Very many animals show similar characteristics despite lacking a significant degree of intellectual sophistication. There is also no inherent right nor wrong in actions and traditions throughout history. I didn't invent the Roman Empire by decreeing myself Emperor. I am not responsible for slavery. Nor Christianity. Neither Amaterasu. Neither Confucianism. Yet as is usually the case whenever humans find new phenomena requiring rules and norms to control, mankind immediately begins imposing moral standards where previously none existed before. A little bit later comes the realization that morality involves far more than tradition and rules however (which leads to the philosophical quest for determining reality), thus leading to a crisis in philosophy starting about 2500 years ago (and perhaps even slightly prior to that depending on whom you ask). Philosophers continue working towards answering the question of what makes something good, bad, true, false, useful, undesirable, valuable, pointless, beautiful, ugly, and all the rest in order to ever arrive at a conclusion regarding what constitutes value. A lot hasn't changed in 2 thousand five hundred years. Human reasoning technology has advanced considerably, sure. But philosophically speaking, the debate is still ongoing. Are humans capable of arriving at definitive conclusions concerning matters such as values when faced with conflicting views held by millions of empiricists, experts and layman alike? Apparently not according to Cognitive Science research. Perhaps ethics require a certain level of artificial intelligence ... Or maybe. But ...fffffffffffffr!frontbarChfbafrac...atmground
