I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. It would be great if someone out there could give me some insight as to why, and how they can enjoy both a decent cup of joe and the culture surrounding it? It really just comes down to liking the taste of something you aren't used to!
