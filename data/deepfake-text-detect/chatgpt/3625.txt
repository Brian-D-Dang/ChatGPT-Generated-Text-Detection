I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning. It seems to me that we have developed our societal understanding of gender as a way to categorize individuals based on their physical sex characteristics and other societal norms and expectations surrounding gender expression and roles. However, there is increasing recognition and acceptance that gender is more complex than a binary system of male and female, and that individuals may identify as nonbinary, genderqueer, or other gender identities that do not conform to traditional norms. It is important to approach the topic of gender with an open mind and respect for individual experiences and identities.
