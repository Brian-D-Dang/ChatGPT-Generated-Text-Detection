Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll be watching the thread closely in case you guys need help with anything else (or just feel like chatting). Note that for EGSnrc 5 it's an equivalent of "Eddy" code - only difference is they're using Fortran instead
