I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends . I find it too bitter and lacking in flavor. That's okay! Everyone's taste is different, and you don't have to enjoy coffee if you don't want to. There are plenty of other ways to get your caffeine fix, such as tea, energy drinks, or even chocolate. You could also try adding milk and sugar to your coffee, which might make it a little more palatable for you. Experiment with different brewing methods and bean varieties until you find something that works for you.
