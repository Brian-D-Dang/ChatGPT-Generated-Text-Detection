I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural oddity. That's kind of my point though; it is more efficient for eating certain kinds of foods (even ones you might not traditionally consider Asian). It certainly isn't useless by any stretch.
