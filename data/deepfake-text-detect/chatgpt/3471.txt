There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: I'm sorry to hear that your movie experience was disrupted. It can be challenging when a fellow moviegoer's behavior affects your enjoyment of the film. Next time, you may want to consider speaking with a movie theater employee and ask if they can address the situation. Additionally, it may be helpful for the theater to offer accommodations for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to ensure everyone's movie experience is enjoyable.
