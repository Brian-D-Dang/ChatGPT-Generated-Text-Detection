Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of being a part of 60 families with children, that is not the case anymore. My mom's family has a pretty large and active vaccination list now. Same here in Michigan, but I had to put myself on the "vaccine passports" list for a few weeks when all three of our kids were at school.
