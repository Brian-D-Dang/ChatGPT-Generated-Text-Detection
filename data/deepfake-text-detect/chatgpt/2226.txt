So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want a good way of getting that, just talk with them one-on-one or look at their voting record in Congress," he says.) The "clever" part is the reference to how Biden has been talking for decades - and will continue doing so if elected president: like an American who knows what's best for America because they've seen her under four presidents (Bill Clinton through Obama) as well as foreign leaders from around the world. He understands why people live where they do; when visiting schools across this country during his career representing Delaware, Biden would often ask students which state they wanted him to represent after graduation on Capitol Hill instead of Washington, D.C., according to The Atlantic. In fact, many kids said Delaware. This wasn't some ridiculous campaign stunt but something meaningful to these children living near Wilmington. Since becoming vice president, he hasn't forgotten those days meeting children whose parents worked in nearby factories. And while walking out onto stages before big crowds may be new territory for Joe Biden, listening isn't.
