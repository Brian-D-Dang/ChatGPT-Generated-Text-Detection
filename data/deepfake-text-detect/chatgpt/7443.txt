The idea of a "normal" state is subjective and can vary drastically depending on cultural and societal factors. What may be considered "normal" in one culture or time period may be seen as aberrant in another. Furthermore, the view that homosexuality and autism are irregular states is outdated and not supported by current scientific knowledge. Both homosexuality and autism are part of the natural variation of human experiences and can bring unique strengths and perspectives to individuals and society as a whole. By accepting and embracing diversity, we can create a more inclusive and compassionate world.
