I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are definitely different than other Muslim countries such as Iran or Iraq which have strict Sharia law. This means that many Muslims consider attitudes towards Islam to be very conservative for being against them so this leads to a very different mindset about making decisions regarding their worship practices from others. Turkey has a larger population then Arabia but it would also make sense if you look at all secular nations like Saudi Arabia because it's much more developed country with far less violence compared to our own. As for Saudi Arabia; there aren't really any religious schools aside Islamic ones however they do teach Arabic classes instead of Islamic lessons every day unless your parents taught you something like this before birth. There isn't anything wrong with that though! There were many Saudis who didn't understand any lessons when I was younger coming out here due to cultural differences between the ChristiansMuslims...
