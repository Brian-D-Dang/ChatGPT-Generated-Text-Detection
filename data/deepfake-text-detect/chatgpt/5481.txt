Though my personal political views match those of Bernie Sanders much more than Hillary Clinton, I believe nominating Bernie could ultimately be very damaging for the progressive cause. My main concern is that a Bernie brexit would further destabilize the United States and destabilize the U.S.-UK alliance between Britain and EU nations. I don't think we should let brexit compromise our security, but I do wonder if anyone really wants to extend that protectionism into Europe in exchange for a favourable deal with the UK? The British government needs to deliver Brexit before we lose access to the single market and customs union entirely or else there will likely not be enough people who are ready to vote against us or powerlessness! THE FERNANDOLLIS WOULD NEVER SAY THAT!
