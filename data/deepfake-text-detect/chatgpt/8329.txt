We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None. I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you want only one skill in life, then it would be best for us just stick with our chosen field because we'll never know what could happen; but when your path intersects two or more different fields than where there are no shortage on opportunities waiting at every turn! Even though most people may see something as being impossible from their perspective-if they don't try them out first hand (which can mean anything) then why even entertain such possibilities? It's possible enough things exist between heaven earth which defy any logic known today...so how will anyone ever really find these hidden gems until someone tries going down some unexpected paths?"
