While it is understandable to want justice to be delivered quickly in rape cases, fast tracking these cases and burdening the defendant with proof could lead to potential miscarriages of justice. The fundamental principle of innocent until proven guilty is a cornerstone of our legal system and must be upheld at all times. Forced burdens of proof on the defendant have serious ramifications, which include an increase in wrongful convictions and compromising the integrity of the justice system. Instead, it is better to focus on improving the evidential process and providing support for victims to build stronger cases against perpetrators of rape.
