First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" or "intersectional feminism" has. But please trust me when I say this: egalitarian (as in democracy) could not exist without feminism! The idea for equality as something to strive toward was over 200 years old before women started to get the vote at all-which even then only gave them one per cent of voting power worldwide; but still they fought on through multiple wars, protests, marches and riots just so everyone would realize how important equality truly is. They had no media outlets like we do right now who were willing to speak out against their cause, there wasn't anyone publicly supporting their struggle. There weren't any rights movements. But despite everything you've heard about feminism being around since the 1800s, that's all bullshit. Women played an integral role in founding all major religions including Christianity which can be traced back to Abrahamic Judaism -originally called ta'alit hakhamah Rabbenu Tam, one of whom was also named Jesus according to biblical records. The first mention of "women as equals," if such exists, came from ancient Greece where Plato wrote about the seven deadly sins of women: crueltyhatred, envy, anger, slothful apathy inertia, lust, gluttony and pride. In his Crito he later added wrath although those words predate him by several hundred years. Of course most women today wouldn't consider themselves sinful, but let's face it, we are not perfect beings either...you need some bad karma sometimes and unfortunately men tend to give us a little more leeway than our female counterparts when it comes to screwing up. Even if patriarchy hasn't been officially recognized yet, feminists aren't going anywhere anytime soon because things will never change until we all stand together united behind equal representation across every aspect of society - i.e., education, career advancement, health care access, legal system, workplace equity. We must support each other however we can while embracing ideas that help restore balance between genders and create life where both sexes feel equally valued and respected.
