While it may appear that Jesus' final choice, to die on the cross, was an easy and logical one, it is important to consider the immense physical and emotional pain he endured as a result of his choice. Additionally, surrendering one's life goes against the very human instinct of self-preservation, which makes Jesus' choice all the more admirable. Furthermore, his ultimate sacrifice has been a source of inspiration and guidance for millions of people around the world, serving as a reminder of the power of selflessness and unconditional love. Therefore, Jesus' final choice should not be dismissed as easy or unremarkable, but rather celebrated as a testament to his unwavering commitment to his faith and beliefs.
