I been using Google Chrome as far as I remember (probably since 2010) and it's been my default browser on all the computerslaptops I've used. Chrome was fast, reliable and user friendly, but fast doesn't mean better than most other browsers because there are no optimization issues or anything like that You must have something to do with it being slow then, which is why you don't see any problems?
