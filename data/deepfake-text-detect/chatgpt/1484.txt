Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 100GB worth of songs in their playlist that they can't be played on the go with a small SD card simply because the app doesn't support this format? You should try streaming videos and you'll get why spotify sucks
