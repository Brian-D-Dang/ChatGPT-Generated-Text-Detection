I've been pursuing a lot of scholarships and one of the things that irritate me is that there are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my race. I have never been given a scholarship based on my race. There are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my race. And that's why I'm pursuing the scholarship. Sue: No, that's not why. I'm pursuing the scholarship because I am a good student. I think that a lot of people are given scholarships based on their race and I think that it's unfair. But she does not understand that scholarships are not given based on race. She thinks they are and that's why she's pursuing the scholarship.
