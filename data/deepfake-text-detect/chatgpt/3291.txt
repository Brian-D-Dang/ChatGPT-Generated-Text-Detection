People who have no interest in politics, and are not interested in learning about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it its their civic duty. While voting is an important responsibility that comes with living in a democracy, it is equally important for voters to be informed and educated about the candidates and issues before making their choice. Encouraging uninformed individuals to vote can lead to negative consequences such as electing officials who are not qualified or don't align with the voter's true beliefs, and can ultimately have a negative impact on society as a whole. It's important for individuals to take the time to educate themselves before casting their vote to ensure that they are making an informed decision.
