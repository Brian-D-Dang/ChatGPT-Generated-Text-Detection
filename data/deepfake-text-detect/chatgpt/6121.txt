I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several friends who own dogs, but they are the kind of dog owners that are responsible, control their dogs and love them. I wish that was all the dog owners out there. I am afraid we may be going back to the days of the mutt, where people just get their pets from the pound because it's free or from a breeder because they look cute. On the other hand, there is a movement in the dog world to make dog breeders more responsible, stop puppy mills and breeding dogs for profit, and to make sure people are more knowledgeable about dogs and their health. So maybe there is hope for the world. But we still have a long way to go! Want to know how to spot a bad dog owner? 1.
