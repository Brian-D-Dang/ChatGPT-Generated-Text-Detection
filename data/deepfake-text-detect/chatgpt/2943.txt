I say "killer asteroid" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth. I have three rules: What is it? Any astronomical body that could cause a mass extinction on the scale of the Cretaceous-Paleogene. Is it actually possible? Yes. Can we do something about it if we find one quickly enough (i.e., before it does anything)? [No.] (URL2) Do you think there really are asteroids out there larger than Earth's moon built up and ready to come our way?
