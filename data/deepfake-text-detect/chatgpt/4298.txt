This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special attention at this stage because they have a higher risk of suffering from developmental problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Thank you for your input on this! Can we get some answers?
