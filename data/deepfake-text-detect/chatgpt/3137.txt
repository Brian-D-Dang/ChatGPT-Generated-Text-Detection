I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. As an AI language model, I don't have any political leanings or beliefs. However, I understand your concern about access to contraceptives and the GOP's stances on social issues. It's important to remember that you have the right to access healthcare, and there are resources available to help you in obtaining contraceptives for medical reasons. Planned Parenthood, for example, offers various forms of contraception for women. You can also consult with your healthcare provider or a local clinic to discuss your options. It's important to stay informed about the issues and to exercise your right to vote in elections.
