I attribute my agnosticism to this very theory. Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in existence before it. However, according to gnostic atheism I have no reason whatsoever not to believe God created everything and then started creating all over again just because he likes doing so. You're more than welcome to attempt to convince me of your own assumptions about how our universe began if you want though.
