Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. My family has a history as it were, so to say I am 'Jewish' is not something I consider flattering; yet at one point or another my parents have told me how proud they would be if I became an Orthodox Jew (the most historically significant form) - but all this happened after I turned ten years old! My history teacher explained that we had come from Israelites who settled there around 2000 BC and then Judaism began with Moses. But what really interested me about school history lessons was learning about God's promises made long ago through Abraham including his descendants spreading out across the world following him into exile until finally arriving back home again where Jesus will save them. Yet none of these stories explain why when you look for evidence of our ancestors living in some place thousands of years before Christ existed, we can find no trace of such people anywhere? Why did God tell us he created the universe six thousand years ago when its creation couldn't possibly happen any earlier than 6000 AD? And while on Earth over 3 billion humans live today, according to science only a fraction amount lived here during biblical times; those figures include babies born since 1900 AD. If anyone thinks this fact makes Christianity ridiculous, you should read the Bible yourself: well-known theologian Rabbi Tovia Singer writes: "The historical reliability of the books of the Old Testament which describe their own time period is questionable because they do not give sufficient information regarding events occurring within specific decades prior to recorded contact between the Jewish community and outsiders [it actually includes other cultures too]. Such omissions make their statements difficult to verify and thus serve to undermine both the historicity and credibility of the accounts offered therein... The gaps exist even though they may seem insignificant to the casual reader. They represent actual missing periods in time that must logically lie outside of the scope of the text quoted, and therefore beyond the knowledge base evident in the minds of the authors. In other words, the account of Noah's flood cannot begin later than two centuries before 900 B.C., taking us into the seventh century B.C.. No reasonable person could argue otherwise. This applies not just to Genesis 1-11, but also Exodus 13-24... These passages set forth a series of dates involving many different generations over several centuries... A few examples follow.... The Flood occurred approximately 2160 years before Adam - 152728 B.C.; Joseph married 12 year (s) -1730 0 days B.C.. Moses wrote 18 month (s) -1734 9 months B.C......and David reigned 24 month (s) - 176113months B.C.... We concluded that these numbers clearly indicate the impossibility of placing the story of Noah somewhere near to 1500 BC, let alone 5000 BC. Clearly there is nothing left to discuss except the problem of biblical chronology." (Source) So "Don't expect to learn anything factual," says Ryan Brimhall. For years questions like these have been nagging away inside of me wondering why everything seems to contradict itself and leave so much unexplained. Amongst others, I wondered how it happens that someone claims to be descended from King Solomon yet never saw him alive himself, or met anyone else claiming to know him personally? Or someone who knows how to build a 7 foot tall pyramid, yet fails miserably building a simple barn? or someone who survived being swallowed whole by a sea serpent, yet argues against evolution? Then there's the unjustifiable suffering of innocent children killed daily throughout the world without reason or justice; and the billions murdered in concentration camps under Hitler's orders because of their beliefs - yet far greater numbers died peacefully worldwide due mainly to starvation and disease even despite ample food supplies. That's right you heard me. Starvation was responsible for millions of deaths globally rather than an act based upon religion per se; yet for nearly 200 years Christians have used religious persecution to justify exterminating millions of Muslims simply because they believe differently. And now you're saying god does exist even though your bible doesn't mention him once! It's true that atheists don't try to kill one another any less, but they do blame him for making things easier for wicked sinners instead of doing good works to help themselves lead an honest life. The same goes for Muslim fanatics killing gay men, women and children too young to defend themselves because their holy texts teach violence toward homosexuals. What hypocrisy indeed!!! So why exactly is god lovedhated depending on who is speaking? Did he ever truly promise deliverance to anyone? People start believing stuff they want to hear because they think it might change reality itself! Do you remember the day you started praying and crossing fingers hoping to stop your friend getting cancer or being fired? Now you've become addicted to prayer hope hoping eventually to control every aspect of everyone's lives - and maybe it takes hundreds of prayers to avoid disaster. Are you sitting still, yes, bad news (alarm situation,) Noah going doorbell. You goofy"not operating proct
