Counter-argument: While the Kurds have been staunch allies of the West in their fight against ISIS, it's important to remember that they have their own agenda and interests. They have been seeking independence in their respective countries for decades, which could potentially create more instability in the region. Supporting the Kurds may also strain relationships with other allies in the region like Turkey, who see Kurdish groups as terrorist organizations. Additionally, forming a hands-down alliance with any group can limit diplomatic flexibility and make it difficult to navigate complex political situations in the Middle East. Therefore, a more nuanced approach to engaging with Kurdish groups is necessary.
