I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. It seems that they simply did not understand the current laws regarding discrimination against minorities and were just too lazy to say: "We don't discriminate." If you ask me if I'm disgusted with this fact-finding mission at all, I feel like I am. McDonald's' egregious actions are so bad that the public stands on their own two feet, ignoring a law passed by their board in which people of color have the right to remain free from discriminatory practices. Instead, there is no civil rights act in place to enforce our collective right to free speech. We encourage McDonald's to keep up its fight for equality because we want to see democracy prevail over racism and sexism.
