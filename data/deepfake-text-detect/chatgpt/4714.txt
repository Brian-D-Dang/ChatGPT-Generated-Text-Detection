The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as that worn by this person), so I expect it to stand for something. It also seems more likely than an original phrase or word; such designs are typically done with stencils and ink applied directly onto skin, whereas phrases tend to be written in marker pen-like substances and may even have been colored using markers like those used when coloring book pages were originally made from paper.
