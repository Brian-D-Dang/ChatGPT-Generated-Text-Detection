I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are pretty much the same and I'm trying to keep up to some extent. I'm interested in trading in the market, it's something that I'm naturally good at and I'm searching for a good broker. I'm very disappointed with my current broker, Oanda, because of the wide spreads and the bad trading platforms. I found out that I can trade on btc market with no fees and no spreads, so I'm considering to open an account on a btc exchange in the hope that I'll be able to find the broker that can accommodate my needs and give me access to international markets.
