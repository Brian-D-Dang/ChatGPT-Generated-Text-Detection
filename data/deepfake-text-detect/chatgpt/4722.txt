I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry atheists make them out to be. And yes, I'm aware "church" is just an archaic term for congregation's meeting place. My goal in life isn't to treat everyone like cattle and cannibalize the planet with my personal quest for happiness:)
