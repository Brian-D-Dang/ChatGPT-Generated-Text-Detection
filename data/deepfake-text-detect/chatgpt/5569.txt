Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data] . In the comments, a lot of people had issues with it. I think it's a nice overview of a discussion that is rather relevant right now. One commenter said that it was a waste of time to try and create a job. I think that is the biggest fallacy in this whole discussion. If you ask a kid what he wants to do with his life, he will say that he wants to have a job. He will not say that he wants to be a hobo. That's not what kids think, and that's not what most adults think. Most adults think that they should have a job. Most adults want to have the freedom that comes with that job. A job isn't a bad thing. It doesn't mean that you have to work in a coal mine for 12 hours a day. It means that you earn money, that you have a purpose, that you have a goal, that you have a responsibility. It's not a bad thing. Most of the people who say that technology will replace jobs are the people who can't hold a job. That's not a coincidence. Those people lack the skills that are needed to do a job. Those people are not employable. But that doesn't mean that they are useless. We need those people, too. Because the world can't survive if we just have employable people. If we just have people who can do a job, we will end up in a very bad place. I know, I know, it's not fair. It's not that there are less jobs, it's just that people get old and die. There are more and more people retiring, and there are less and less jobs available. But this isn't the reason why we are losing jobs. This is just a natural evolution. Most people don't realize this. It's the same reason why we lost jobs to machines. We use technology to make our lives easier. We shouldn't have to lift a finger to make a living. We shouldn't have to do a job. We have machines to do the work. We have people who are more efficient than the machines. We have people who can think and come up with ideas. People can see opportunities that machines can't. Technology doesn't replace jobs, it creates them. But before I dig deeper into this, I think we have to ask ourselves a question. Why is it that we have a job? And what is the purpose of a job? A job is a tool for the people who have a purpose in life. If you have no purpose, you have no reason to be in this world. Everyone needs a purpose, and a job is a tool for achieving that purpose. If you work in a coal mine, you do that because you have a purpose. You want to make a living, and you need to do a job. You want to have the freedom and the security that a job provides. You want to be able to buy things, to have money, to be able to feed yourself and your family. You want to be able to take care of your family and you want to be able to take care of yourself. If you don't have a job, you will never be able to do that. That's the reason why you work in a coal mine. Most people don't realize this. Most people think that they have a job. They think that they have to go to a coal mine and dig coal. If you ask them what they want to do with their lives, they will tell you that they want to do the job that they have. They don't think that they want to dig coal. This is not the same. You need to have a purpose in life. And you need to have a purpose that you can achieve. You have to work towards something. It's not enough to just work. You need to have a purpose, and you need to be working towards it. If you think that you don't have a purpose, or if you think that you don't know what your purpose is, you can't have a job. You don't need to dig coal. You need to find out what you want to do with your life. You need to find out what your purpose is. You need to find out what it is that you want to achieve. If you find out that you want to be a writer, you need to start writing. You can't just go to a coal mine and dig coal. You don't have a job. You have to find out what it is that you want to achieve.
