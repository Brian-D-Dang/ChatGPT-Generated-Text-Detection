Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and is oblivious to basic immigration law. Person B was born here but does not have citizenship. Person C was born in another country and immigrated here when they were 15 years old. They are not a citizen. Person A decides they want to become a citizen and the process is fairly straightforward. You have to be 18 years of age to apply for naturalization, so you wait until you are 18 to apply. You submit your application, provide all documentation to prove that you are who you say you are, that you have been physically present in the US for 5 years, and you have a good moral character. You are fingerprinted and your background is checked. You are interviewed by a USCIS Officer, and you go through the whole process. Person B, however, is a little trickier. They do not have any citizenship status and have been here illegally for the last 20 years. They were not fingerprinted and did not have their background checked. However, there is no way that they could pass the background check because they have a criminal record in their country of origin. They do not have the money to apply for naturalization and they have no intention of doing so. They are scared to apply because they know that if they do, they will be arrested and deported. Person C was born here to legal parents who never became citizens. They applied for citizenship at 18 and were granted citizenship. They have never been in trouble with the law. They have a good job and are married with children. They have been in the US for 25 years. Person B is really jealous of Person C because they can go to school and get financial aid but they can't. They tell Person B, "We should go to school together and get our citizenship. You will never get your citizenship because you are illegal." Person C is concerned about Person B's comments. They know that Person B is a horrible person and that they are jealous of Person C. Person C gets their citizenship and Person B gets deported. This is the story of the deportation of Julian Zapata Espinosa. Julian Zapata Espinosa was born in Mexico City, Mexico. He was brought to the US as a child. His mother had entered the US illegally in 1995 and had been working here for 10 years. In 1998, his mother applied for asylum and was granted asylum. Julian Zapata Espinosa has lived in the US for the last 20 years and is a legal resident of the US. In 2007, Julian Zapata Espinosa applied for US citizenship and was granted citizenship in 2010. In 2012, he was convicted of a DUI and sentenced to 30 days in jail. Julian Zapata Espinosa was an undocumented immigrant who was arrested and deported to Mexico. He was not a US citizen and did not have citizenship. I am not going to make a political statement about Julian Zapata Espinosa's deportation. The basic facts are that he was in the US illegally and did not have citizenship. For the last 4 years, I have been teaching the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Naturalization Test. In the Naturalization Test, I talk to the students about the history of the United States and the importance of the US Constitution. I teach the students about the rights and responsibilities of US citizenship. One of the most important rights of a US citizen is that they cannot be deported from the United States. I tell the students that, if you are a US citizen, you cannot be deported from the US. In some cases, you can be arrested and deported from the US but you cannot be deported from the US. The US government can arrest you and deport you but once you are deported from the US, you cannot be deported from the US. I have been teaching this to my students and I thought that I was teaching them the truth. As we all know, it is not the truth. I was just as shocked as my students when I found out that Julian Zapata Espinosa was deported from the US. In the United States, you cannot be deported from the US. The United States does not have a law that allows for a person to be deported from the US. The United
