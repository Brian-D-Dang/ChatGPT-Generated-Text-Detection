While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept I understand your concerns about the safety of GMOs. The safety of GMOs is a complex and controversial issue that has been extensively debated by scientists, policymakers, and the public over the years. There are some potential risks associated with the use of GMOs, such as unintended effects on human health and the environment. However, there is no solid scientific evidence to suggest that GMOs are harmful to human health. Regulators around the world have approved many GMO crops for consumption and use, and they are subjected to rigorous safety assessments. That being said, it's important to keep in mind that GMOs offer many potential benefits, such as increased crop yields, improved nutrient content, and resistance to pests and diseases, which can help feed the growing world population. Ultimately, the decision of whether to consume or avoid GMOs is a personal one. It's important to weigh the potential risks and benefits of GMOs and make an informed decision based on individual preferences and beliefs.
