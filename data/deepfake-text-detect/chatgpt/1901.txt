I've lived practically my whole life on this phrase. It has shaped how I have made several important decisions in my life, though I have recently come to suspect that it is not quite true as advertised and needs a little work.pA friend of mine once told me the following: "You know what they say about people who don't pay attention to detail? They are destined for disaster."p (Of course he was wrongthe saying goes something like quot;people who canx27;tdonx27;t follow instructions will sink shipsquot;.) This sounds more accurate: People fail at tasks because their scope exceeds their abilities or resources rather than simply due to poor attention span ability to process information quickly etc.
