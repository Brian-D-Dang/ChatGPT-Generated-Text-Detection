Just as the title says, I firmly believe that the modern interpretation of the hipster does not truly exist and never has. I'm going to link an article from two years ago about this topic but it's too good a read to pass up having discussed these issues with people before: I think most people simply don't want or understand what they're looking at when someone is described by the term "hipster." So many times the word just gets thrown around for any guy who looks different (example being rockabilly guys). If you look like your peers then no one will call you names. But if everyone else also dresses differently than you do in some way - even though there isn't anything particularly wrong with how you dress...that's all it takes really. People start calling you weirdweirdo because they can easily pinpoint exactly where their discomfort lies so then everything becomes uncomfortable. And sometimes we are our own worst enemy. We have such little self esteem yet love ourselves more than anyone could ever put into words..and while loving yourself comes easy- loving others doesn't always come quite that naturally especially within communities which tend towards cliques. It reminds me of high school honestly!:) When kids grow out of dressing alike based on labels alone they become adults who try new styles every once awhile without fear of judgement. They might wear suits again someday..but maybe only occasionally instead of everyday. The role of clothing changes throughout life and should be flexible depending upon moods occasions. As long as clothes fit well and aren't worn solely due to trends; wearing them shouldn't inherently mean certain things about us. That said, i'll stand behind my statement above until proven otherwise;) For proof refer back to the unnamed source previously linked here.
