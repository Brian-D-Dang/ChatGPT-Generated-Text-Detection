The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here] . Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things , but not good people doing evil deeds." - Stephen Hawking "We are fortunate enough in America that our religion has been tested by the recent rise of the Church in India and Pakistan where there was no such testing," said Bernard Shaw (RSS). "When religion first came into being more than 200 years ago Catholics were persecuted under the Taliban for their beliefs which led to the rise of Islamists who claimed Indian Muslims believed in Allah. They now suffer persecution due to persecution because they believe Islamism is nothing less than a religion of lies preached with adherents believing, saying if God created man through faith alone. Terrorists resort to violence against Christians when Muslims say they do wrong." There will always remain some daylight between Christianity and Islam as Muslims fight discrimination based on religion while Christians enjoy freedom of religion across the world. But it doesn't matter what happens to Islamians today unless both religions affirm the rights of every man, woman and child. - Sean Warshak
