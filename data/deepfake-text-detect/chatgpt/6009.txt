I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think of scientific knowledge. I believe that scientific knowledge, like all knowledge, has to be tested and can never be considered as absolute and certain. The tentative nature of scientific knowledge means that scientists can change their mind if they have new evidence or that there are other scientists who can present the results of new experiments. This is the case with the redshift in the light from the galaxies. Scientists now have a new piece of evidence that the galaxies are not moving away from us and this presents a problem for the Big Bang Theory. This means that scientists will now have to revise their theory to take account of this new piece of evidence. It is only because of this tentative nature of scientific knowledge that the Big Bang Theory has changed over the years as more evidence has been discovered. I think that it is also important to note that scientists can be wrong about their theories and that they can change their view if the evidence changes. If scientists were certain about what is correct then it would be impossible to change their views. This means that if scientists had an absolute view on the theory of the Universe then they would not be able to be open to new evidence. I think that I agree with Sagan in the fact that the universe is changing and evolving. This means that the universe as we know it is not going to be the same as it was in the past. Sagan states that the universe is "shifting constantly." As the universe changes, this means that it is not an absolute and static entity, but is evolving and changing. Sagan's reference to "time" is important as it relates back to what I said earlier about how it is impossible to know what is the present. It means that there is no present and that we are continually moving into the future. This is why, as Sagan says, "time itself is flowing." This makes the universe seem like a living, evolving thing. I think that Sagan's reference to the "mind of God" is important and gives an idea of what he thinks the universe is. I think that he uses this term because it is difficult to know what the universe is and how it works. This means that it is almost impossible to imagine what the universe is, so the "mind of God" is a way of describing it as we can understand it. In this way, Sagan is trying to describe the universe, but he is unable to as he can't imagine it. To conclude, I think that Sagan's view on the nature of the universe is that it is evolving and changing. He states that the universe is not a static entity, but is always in motion. This means that it is impossible to know what the present is and that time is flowing. Sagan's views are similar to those of the Big Bang Theory. He states that the universe is constantly changing and evolving and therefore cannot be considered to be static and absolute. I think that the view on the universe is tentative, as scientists need to use evidence to decide what is correct. I also think that the universe is ever changing, which means that it is not absolute. A topic that I have been investigating in my spare time is the Big Bang Theory. It is an interesting topic and is something that I have not looked into before. I have been researching the Big Bang Theory, mainly through the internet and through books. My main sources of information are the internet and "Science, technology, society" by Peter Mitchell and Jon Agar. I have found this topic very interesting and I feel that it is something that has a good deal of relevance in our lives. I have found this topic to be very relevant in our lives as it helps us to understand the origins of the universe. I will be looking at the Big Bang Theory in relation to the question "Does the Big Bang Theory help us understand the origins of the universe?." One of the main features of the Big Bang Theory is that it is a theory that is based on evidence. This means that scientists look for evidence before coming to a conclusion about what they think has happened. It is therefore important for scientists to be able to perform experiments so that they can test their theories. This is why it is important for scientists to be able to measure the universe as they can measure the expansion of the universe to see whether the Big Bang Theory is correct. As the universe is expanding at a rapid speed, this means that the universe is getting bigger, so this is evidence that the Big Bang Theory is correct. Scientists have also measured the redshift of light from distant galaxies. This means that the light from the galaxies is moving away from us and this is a piece of evidence that the universe is expanding and that the
