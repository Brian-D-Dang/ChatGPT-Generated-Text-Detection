growing up in america I was condition to believe women's breast are sexual organs do to the fact that we over sexualized them too much. it wasnt till recently that i paid attention and realized exactly what they were for. If you remember back when I had my first child, there would be a time where all she wanted to do is "play at mommy" with me...she'd try to carry herself like she was a little kid playing dressup instead of a grown woman trying her best to care for an infant while everyone else just watched through the window or took pictures from outside. I also noticed how women didn't seem to have any concern about modesty or leaving things alone until they became pregnant (theres a reason why people always say its a miracle) Then their breasts either start growing larger or if they aren't already big enough, suddenly become HUGE! Even if you don't plan on having children, your body starts getting bigger before even knowing whether you are capable of carrying one so therefore making sure you make yourself look good and feel confident. A lot of girls early 20s go out without underwear because they haven't been wearing anything under their clothes yet....they think its sexy and want every man who catches a glimpse to know just how hot they really are. Things got worse over here after January 1st 2009 when Obama introduced this law which made it illegal for anyone older than 18 years old to wear a bikini top or bottom as long as its not form fitting clothing [bikini bottoms can still cover everything except the butt area]. WTF?? You mean to tell us that we're supposed to hide our assets by covering EVERYTHING but the tushy!! Why?! As soon as someone finds this crazy rule-change ridiculous, they usually end up stripping down down to nothing..if theres no other choice then thats fine but when youre young you should be allowed to show off your gorgeous body and let men see whats underneath those tops. The whole purpose behind bikinis are simply HIDE THE BOTTOM AND SHOW OFF YOUR BEAUTIFUL TUSHY!!! Is America such a backwards country? Are we so desperate to keep ourselves looking nice, and protected that we decided hiding parts of our bodies gives us more confidence??? Really, we need to stop being so politically correct and grow some roots and take control of our lives again!!!!
