I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit card debt become the leader of a nation. A leader should be financially responsible and not have such overwhelming debt. Leaders should lead by example, and having such debt is not a good example to set for their constituents. It could also give the impression that they are irresponsible with money, which could negatively affect public opinion of them. Furthermore, this could put the country in an even more precarious financial situation if they are unable to manage the national budget while managing their personal debt.
