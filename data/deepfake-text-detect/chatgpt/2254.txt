Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the closest one to me is a handicap spot and it never gets used! I've seen so many people park there while they run into CVS or Walgreens, but if you're going out of your way to get something like that from those places why not just take up 2 normal spaces instead? Some times its nice having an extra 10 mins getting ready lol
