Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: "how does it come about that this right is inherent?" What makes this right innate? 3 Answers 3 The idea that a person has an inalienable right to defend himself is not strictly correct. The Second Amendment was passed as part of Bill of Rights, which means that all other Amendments were dependent on its abolishment for their continued existence (and vice versa). Therefore, if we were to assume that every human being had one unalienable freedomright in order to be considered under law and society than the only option would have been to abolish the rights and freedoms given by the First through Ninth Amendments first before involving any kind of self defense or firearms issue into the debate. So, at most case I'd say that everyone should consider themselves lucky enough to even get a vote for what they wish to keep out from others' hands when everything else around them will eventually be put up to public voting anyway.
