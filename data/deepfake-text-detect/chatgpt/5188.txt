Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in terms of public education choice. The biggest problem with the United States is not just its inability or unwillingness to provide quality schools for all children but also the lack of transparency about it - which has created confusion among parents who may be wondering what curriculum models are best suited their child's interests if they don't believe they can choose which grades should be taught by teachers chosen through standardized tests such as SAT scores and ACT scores."They're too focused on standards instead of the individual needs of each student," said Benjamin Khan, a parent advocate specializing in educational policy at the American Federation of Teachers. "The idea that we're trying to teach every child one thing; teaching them how important learning goals are is a waste of taxpayer money really undermines our ability to promote equity within schools. We need to make it easier than ever before when it comes to making choices whether students want to learn math, science, English language arts, language arts, science, economics, history, geography, social sciences and other subjects so they understand why some classes work better academically while others aren't successful academically."We had an opportunity late last year to speak with Dallas school district officials to ask questions about the school system currently serving Dallas families from the perspective of parents and educators concerned about the academic inequity faced by high schoolers across the state and beyond.Parents urged the district to focus more attention on instructional materials like standardized testing because they trust the teachers were trained properly. They asked how the district would allocate resources toward improvement plans internally rather than relying solely upon standardized test results aloneincluding a study into charter schools' failure rate for emphasis issues related exclusively to standardized tests.Teachers told us they'd spent months preparing for tests since students started school this fall despite having little time between shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Dallas Public Schools Superintendent Jose Luis Moreno said he decided against putting additional resources into classroom instruction during a meeting April 26 after hearing concerns raised elsewhere around how standardized tests affect teacher motivation. That didn't change when teachers spoke up again Tuesday afternoon following news reports that the district was considering closing its Los Angeles County public schools over inequities modeled on Texas.'It makes sense,' said Douglas Moran who teaches Spanish at La Quinta High School. 'I think everybody wants certain outcomes guaranteed based on merit.This doesn't seem fair given the fact that schools already face challenges finding teachers willing to adapt safely versus staffing shortages caused by remote learning," Moran added. There will always be kids out here wanting success regardless, Moran continued. 'You cannot force us to give everything away unless we're trying to build an equitable educational system."Texas Education Commissioner Mike Morrell issued a statement saying the statement reflects his understanding that higher grades matter most compared to upperclassmen who attend private schools that have fewer resources available.Morrell noted there are significant differences between private and public schools and the difference isn't exclusive to Dallas'."All districts must demonstrate that children deserve both excellence and fairness," Morrell wrote."Those areas have been identified as critical factors contributing to inequitable schooling disparities throughout the country. Every school district that addresses these topics deserves credit for devoting itself responsibly to developing curricula tailored towards their unique needs.Now, educators must find ways to rebuild trust around expectations and accountability," Morrell concluded. "Community members hold districts accountable to ensure that each child receives equal access to a strong foundation."In addition to the school board meetings Monday night where officials discussed strategies for improving standardized tests that will result in greater accountability and greater progress towards achieving graduation rates, the superintendent released guidelines for schools hoping to improve blended learning environments outside of regular classrooms. Districts could use the recommendations provided by the recommendations, including increased transportation options accessible via buses and plans designed specifically for families participating in remote lessons using the district's website, the district announced Wednesday morning.District officials say they've gone above and beyond to develop alternatives to traditional schedules especially beneficial to students whose parents rely heavily on online learning methods (such as remote learning).As students return to class next week, there'll likely be changes made along with efforts to address hurdles parents report struggling with keeping tabs on early childhood development such as teacher training programs, and several entities are engaging the community team to help provide support regarding masksing contact tracing protocols or timetables."When students arrive earlier, there will inevitably be times when things go wrong," Morrell stated."Researchers recently found that when children are home schooled longer hours gained school attendance problems due to low enrollment" according to Wes Lowrie, Houston Budget Director.Lowrie emphasized the importance of keeping students physically present in class even when attending school remotely due to physical distancing mandates mandated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and Texans experiencing homelessness.School districts won't release a list of substitute teacher positions until later this month."Like any other district, we require that staff maintain appropriate distance apart spacing between desks no matter the situation," Morrell explained."Some districts take steps necessary to minimize risk liquidity-outward advances to ensurearable youth developmental enhancements such powers before the prevention tipsboards and considerable ones of safety programs and milestones under established eventually: generally
