First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I would like to think there is some leveling off in this regard because for example universities have become extremely competitive so they're no longer equalizers but rather filterers - students with greater resources will be more successful than others though perhaps not as much success or experience (education) can still create equality if it were free at point A from place B although even then we're talking about very poor regions compared here). Note: "If you want an applesoranges comparison" means comparing one thing directly against another without accounting too deeply into their inherent nature i e apple vs orange juice...I agree completely on your points regarding medicine which does seem less socialist since doctors make money selling health care through insurance companies via fees etc., thus creating rich physicians while training them up requires school loans paid back years later under unequal terms depending upon access time constraints....maybe thats just my perspective?
