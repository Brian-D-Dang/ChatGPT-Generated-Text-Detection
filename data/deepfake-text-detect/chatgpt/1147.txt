A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, and I'm sure the person who spent the least on fireworks had a very good time, but I was slightly disappointed: they were not very good at all.
