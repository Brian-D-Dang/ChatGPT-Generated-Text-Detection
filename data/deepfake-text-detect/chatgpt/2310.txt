Throwaway account, my main is used for school. I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She 's also in the same program as me but she works full-time during the week while I work part time on weekends so we don't see each other much at all until after 9pm every night except Saturday morning when I get to wake up with her before class starts:) That sounds like such an awesome arrangement!
