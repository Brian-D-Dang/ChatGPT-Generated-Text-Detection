Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: one for myself, which is only a minor edit of my original comment to correct an error that was pointed out by ualriclofgar in his reply; another delta goes to ulistentothemisgod, whose contribution was exceedingly useful as well as detailed enough to where all further discussion would be streamlined if he had not added it.
