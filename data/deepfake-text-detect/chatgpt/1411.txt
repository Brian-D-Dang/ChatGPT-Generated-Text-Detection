To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting to the point where these may be necessary for me or even wanted at all (if ever), it seems like there are too many opinions and not enough facts about what exactly this means in practice. To put into perspective how much time we have left until those kids will start to graduate from school: 40 of our students don't attend college within 6 months of graduation; 27 never finish their degree. One thing that isn't clear yet is if they were certified by something else prior - for example, teachers who had to go through online courses rather than classroom instruction as well as certifications through an approved course or certification program such as National Board Certified Teacher, American Council on Education Registered Teacher, etc... I'm sure you'll agree with me when saying that teaching future generations better critical thinking and problem solving skills would only benefit society more broadly. Additionally, I believe most people want children to grow up able to read things themselves instead of having someone read it to them, so early literacy can give parents peace of mind knowing their child won't become illiterate because their language development has been stunted due to poor oralwritten communication skills. Add to this picture the fact that nearly 2 billion adults worldwide lack basic reading abilities while 4 million new cases of illiteracy caused every day around the world, and you realize just how important it is that children receive proper literacy education at home and in schools. This is why I think homeschooling could also play a large part in ensuring higher levels of literacy among vulnerable groups of society without disrupting any other aspect of family life.
