I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the top 250 lists. Please don't suggest any other movies by Miyazaki for me to watch, because I already have a ton of them on my watchlist. These are the top 250 rated movies. If you take out the first 50 or so films, then you get the 1500 best rated movies. I'm not worried about all the other 1500 movies; I have seen a lot of them and can get through them. What I want to know is why all of these films are rated so highly when they are not good? They are either so beautifully made that you forgive the story, or they are so beautifully told that you forgive the story. The only exception to this seems to be Miyazaki. Some examples that come to mind: Terrence Malick's films The Tree of Life is a perfect example. The look of the film is amazing, but the story is a mess. It is incomprehensible. Blue Velvet is an example of the beauty. Inception is an example of the story. Wings of Desire is a perfect example of a film I loved for the story, but now that I think about it, it is also aesthetically pleasing. I can't think of a single movie that is a great story but is so beautifully told that I love it. I agree with you on this. Inception was a masterful film for the technical aspects, and the story was so thin. The same goes for Malick's films. I think they are all technically beautiful, but they all have a very thin storyline. Perhaps I have been missing this, but I don't think the story is as important as the technical aspects. I'm not saying that story is unimportant, but maybe I don't understand why it is important? It's a question of taste. I find it very hard to understand why some people love them and others find them complete dreck. Inception is a masterpiece and I find it hard to believe anyone with a clue would think otherwise. In my opinion, the story is the most important element and Inception has one of the best. I don't think the story is the most important element. I think it is one of the most important elements. And Inception is a masterpiece? I don't think so. I thought it was a good movie. I didn't like it, but I thought it was a good movie. I'm with you on that one. I can't even say it's a good movie because I'm still reeling from the incoherence. Inception is a very good movie. It's the best original film in a while, but I think some people have this thing where they feel the need to criticize it. It's a bit like when I reviewed a film and gave it 3 stars. I was told by a lot of people that it was "mediocre" and I was "wrong." Well, of course. If you give a film 3 stars, it's obviously mediocre. Anyway, to answer the question, I think people who find those movies beautifully made are probably judging the movie on the technical elements. You don't like Inception? I still don't like it. You may be right about the technical elements. I don't know why people like Malick's films. I think he is one of the worst directors of all time. I don't like the Tree of Life. I thought it was a mess. I also don't like the Malick films. I don't think you can really get a handle on this. It's personal taste. Some people love Malick. Some people hate him. I'm with you. I thought The Tree of Life was a mess. And I'm also with you on Malick. I also don't like the Inception. I think that the Tree of Life is a masterpiece. I would give The Tree of Life 3.5 stars. Inception is a 3 star movie for me. I think that you really can't understand the reasons some people think it is a masterpiece. You simply have to accept that you are wrong. It's the way of the world. What makes you think you're right? I don't know. I just do. You don
