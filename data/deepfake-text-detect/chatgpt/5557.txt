Generally speaking, you have two sides on the "Fat Debate": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, regardless of the consequences). A lot of people are sick of the fat shaming, because the fat shamers are not only being assholes, they're being wrong. So I want to make it clear that I am not on the side of the fat shamers. I don't think that fat people should be made to lose weight, or even that they should lose weight if they want to. But I don't think the fat acceptance movement is right either. I don't think the fat acceptance movement is right because I think it is based on a fallacy. I think there are some problems with the fat acceptance movement that are similar to the problems with the fat shamers. But, I think there are some problems with the fat acceptance movement that are different from the problems with the fat shamers. A lot of fat acceptance folks like to say that fat people are not sick. They point out that fat people can be perfectly healthy. They point out that fat people are not always sick. The fat acceptance movement likes to say that fat people are normal and that fat people are healthy. I can't say that I disagree with these things. But I think that these statements are made as if they were facts. The problem is that fat people are not a population. We are not a homogenous group. We are not a group. We are not normal. We are not healthy. Fat people are individuals. Yes, some fat people are healthy. Some fat people are sick. Some fat people are normal. Some fat people are healthy. Some fat people are sick.
