If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available to the population at large. The population needs to drop in order to make room for the machines. I like the way you have laid out the timeline for the future. It's a fairly plausible one, and probably not too far off. Democracy is a system where you hope for the best but expect the worst.
