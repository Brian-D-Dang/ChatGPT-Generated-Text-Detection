While it is important for businesses to have the freedom to choose which services they provide, there are instances where the government should intervene to prevent discrimination. All individuals have the right to be treated fairly and equally in public accommodations, regardless of their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. By allowing businesses to discriminate, we create a society that fosters division and bigotry rather than one that values diversity and inclusion. It is the government's responsibility to ensure that businesses are not denying individuals their basic human rights. Therefore, in certain circumstances, the government should be able to require businesses to serve all customers equally.
