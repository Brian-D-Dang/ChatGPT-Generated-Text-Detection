While it is indeed important to consider the financial resources required to raise a child, it is not fair to make this a sole deciding factor for having children. There are several options available for students to fund their education, such as scholarships, loans, and part-time jobs. Moreover, it is not necessary that every child should go to college. Some may choose vocational or technical schools, start their own businesses, or pursue alternative paths to achieve their goals. Therefore, it is not rational to base the decision of having children solely on one's ability to pay for their college tuition, as there are other ways to secure their future.
