First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways are vast and varied - often in the same way that computer programs are designed to be directed at machines. Do you think there could possibly be such an evil genius behind all of this? At one point I thought about making Star Wars a movie. That would have been cool. But surely if it's good enough for people then why do you need to make another one when they already made the original? I'm still waiting on my response to this so I can get some answers. My initial experience with this is being asked (and answered) by people who work in entertainment and travel. When I was younger, the idea of sharing "star wars" with kids was just a bit too appealing. Now it's almost like a concept. Maybe it would make more sense for me as a parentteacher (or maybe people would remember what happens during the battle). That would have been cool! And I want to add something else to that conversation that you mentioned. Kids love Star Trek; we'd talk about how Japan keeps sending them back home through the warzone. Instead of telling "Star Wars!," let us tell about the fact that japan has sent thousands of troops into the war zone. Well, the last time I checked'marathon' is a term meant to describe someone or something going from continent to continent without changing the language used. It seems unlikely that that type of thing would survive, though. The people who start out writing "I'll wait until the next planet you visit is completely colonized," or even "that giant dog stuck in the moon." If it ever came to the point where nobody cares anymore about class, race or nationality, then I really don't see why it should be anything other than fun. The whole message of "use your power to create better universes," while trying to justify its existence, just isn't really working. Wow. You've got to believe everyone would agree with these feelings. People seem to fail to grasp that your idea is its own creation, and that no matter how many times you try to use it to change the world, most people only realize how far you've gotten, which makes it even harder for anyone else to see the bigger picture, and get to understand those people. This reminds me of how i read where talos was supposed to be considered a bad guy, because he betrays his family, violently torture, and put himself into danger. Tatsuya was clearly the enemy. He had nothing to lose and everyone would be happy if he was allowed to live. This is also why talos developed an affinity towards the other tribe, since talos' culture was very similar to that of the other tribes and they were deeply divided.
