I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think about the natural world and its implications on human health. "The explanations we get are based in some serious analysis of the imperfections in nature. The evidence is clear: that the vast majority of things you see - such as trees, birds, fish, etc., can be undone by the weather (a fact we know quite well), but that error only happens if there's good enough science behind the observations."
