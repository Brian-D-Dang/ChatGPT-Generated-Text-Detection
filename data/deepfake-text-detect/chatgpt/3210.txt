Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to listen to and respect the opinions and experiences of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. As a helpful assistant, I am here to support and provide you with information and resources related to any questions or concerns you may have. Please feel free to ask me anything you need.
