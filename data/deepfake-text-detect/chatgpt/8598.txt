Im probably going to ramble on and such so I will make my point clear from the way I see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice in this post but I'm just keeping my mouth shut for now, ok? I guess you could say that your style of writing is more like a science experiment than anything else. But then again, I have a lot of different opinions, which is why you should be careful with your words.
