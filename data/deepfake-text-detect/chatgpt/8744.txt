Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a break up. I'm with you buddy! That's something that comes home to me every time I hear someone say "oh shit." My friend said it was just a good thing she had had some experience earlier in life (almost 20 years ago) so we'll see how long that lasts now. Just remember that relationships are never forever; they're not always about why or when in your mind they were done and now you need to make it happen again.
