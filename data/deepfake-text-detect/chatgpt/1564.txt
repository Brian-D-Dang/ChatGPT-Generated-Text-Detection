So if you haven't heard already, there was a recent [shooting in a Charleston church.] Many reports are coming out with evidence that points it as a racially motivated hate crime. It seems to be the latest in many other racist crimes happening across America and around this world. But when I think about what happened last week (and then again today), one word comes into my mind: ignorance." "If racism is so widespread why do we have all these white people calling themselves "racists"? Why aren't they doing something? It's not like our government cares enough anyway," she continued. "And those who say racism isn't a problem need to read some history books, especially the ones written by black people!" Richardson also called on her followers to stop being polite just because of fear of offending others and instead speak their minds. She added: "When someone calls me or any other person a nigger. That should trigger an alert alarm bell for us!"
