The goods and services we consume are made possible by the abundance of cheap resources and labour that the west gets out of underdeveloped countries. The West has no reason to care about these people because our standard of living is directly linked with their welfare, but if you ask me it's pretty fucking selfish for us not do anything to help them at all Yes I agree completely - there should be a global system in place where they can get jobs so they don't have to work as slaves on farms or live off scraps from garbage dumps (that could also feed them). But again this will never happen since westerners think its unfair to pay other racesethnicities more money when doing unskilled labor
