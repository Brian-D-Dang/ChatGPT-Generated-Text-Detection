Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. I know every Jew is good for Israel but I've been hearing about it for years now with respect to the Palestinian Authority and Hamas as well - and it's got nothing to do with Islam or Israel. The problem comes from the fact that the Jews have never ever claimed any claim upon Israel - just like the Arabs haven't claimed any claim on Palestine either. There's no doubt that there could be an agreement between Palestinians and Israelis to pursue their own Jewish homeland within Israel if they decide to hold a Zionist state without any Israeli occupation rights regardless of what is happening here today. But it has already happened so why would this change? It doesn't matter who holds the line and Israel will continue to defend itself against any attempt at annexation.
