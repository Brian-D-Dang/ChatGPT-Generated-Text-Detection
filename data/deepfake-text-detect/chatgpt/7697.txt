I respectfully disagree with the opinion that Studio Ghibli is overrated and their films require adaptation for western viewers. While it may be true that some aspects of their storytelling and themes could be culturally specific, the films are intentionally made with universal themes and emotions that can be appreciated by any audience. Furthermore, the popularity and critical acclaim of Studio Ghibli films speak for themselves. The fact that they have resonated with audiences worldwide, including western viewers, without significant changes or adaptations, undermines the argument that their films are overrated or difficult to enjoy. Ultimately, art is subjective, and not everyone will appreciate every work of art in the same way. However, to say that Studio Ghibli films are overrated or require adaptation for western viewers is to ignore the many people from different backgrounds and cultures who have been moved by their storytelling and animation.
