To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific evidence that eating meat is beneficial for the species as a whole (though some would argue it isn't). I'm not sure I entirely agree with this statement. A lot of people think it's okay because it helps them survive in certain circumstances or they are caged enough so their lives aren't really worth living without a little extra help. We have developed technologies now to make life easier for humans so we're probably more inclined to help those who need it most while also helping animals when the situation calls for it.
