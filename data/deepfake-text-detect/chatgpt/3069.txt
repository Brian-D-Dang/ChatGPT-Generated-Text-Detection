I believe this comic expresses the argument most cogently: Now, to my wall of text: I run a small software company that's reasonably successful. I've been doing this for the past 30 years or so and am quite good at it (or so people tell me). The business is such that I can afford to spend about half my time working on personal projects related to science fiction - novels, short stories, etc. As long as they don't interfere with customers, I feel free to do what I like in other ways too. Perhaps more importantly than anything else, though, I enjoy writing these things immensely. So why not? If you're going to start a business, then start one based around something you love, amirite? It's your life, after all...
