IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say "preposterous" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more people? I've been a fan of the Futurama series for quite some time now (not as long-lived an audience member akin with those who were fans during season 1) but I must admit that Season 6 is by far my favorite in terms at least making funnier jokes than other seasons had offered up so even if there was no real reason beyond nostalgia why this show should be considered viable again after its six year hiatus from airing new episodes on television screen then them god damn Simpsons Movie did enough damage reintroducing Bender into our hearts forever!
