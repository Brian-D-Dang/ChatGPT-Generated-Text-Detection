Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" BuzzFeed News is a reputable news page, and it may be the best news source you can have in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement.
