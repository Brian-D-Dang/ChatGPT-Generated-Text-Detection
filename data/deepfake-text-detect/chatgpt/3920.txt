I am a fan of many sports, and all of them seem to take a lot of skill. But golf has always been the one I hated. It's always been about "oh no he hit it out of bounds! Oh no, that ball is going to be in the water!" And now with the new artificial turf course at Muirfield Village (yes, really), I'm getting over this phobia. While my favorite part of golf right now is hitting green fairways, I do enjoy watching professional tournaments on TV. The best part? Watching people putt. How does anyone play this game!? The other aspect of the game that I don't like are the high-fives. What an obnoxious clang when you miss your first shot or you get a bad chip. Why don't they just say "Congrats on your hit" instead of slapping their hand over the ball and congratulating themselves for being lucky enough to get it off the ground before it rolls into the hole????
