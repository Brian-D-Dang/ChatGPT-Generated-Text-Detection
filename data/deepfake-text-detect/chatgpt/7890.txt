While it's understandable why some people may have concerns about the USA possessing atomic weapons, there are several reasons why this claim is a bit extreme. First, it's important to note that the USA is not the only nation with atomic weapons, and other nations (such as North Korea) have shown themselves to be far less trustworthy and stable. Second, the USA has a long history of responsible nuclear stewardship, including stringent safety protocols and arms control agreements. The US has also demonstrated its willingness to engage in diplomacy and negotiation to reduce global nuclear threats, such as with the Iran Nuclear Deal. Finally, the USA possesses atomic weapons as a deterrent against potential threats to its national security, rather than for aggressive purposes. While the idea of atomic weapons being in anyone's hands can be concerning, it's important to recognize that the USA is not the only nation with this capability, and there are important safeguards in place to ensure that they are only used as a last resort.
