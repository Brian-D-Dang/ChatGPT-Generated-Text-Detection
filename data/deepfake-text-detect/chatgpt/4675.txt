Hello everyone, with all the media coverage lately regrading transgender individuals I find myself uneducated on the particular subject and would love to be enlightened on the topic. I support their right for privacy but also feel that they should not have a lock in closet mentality as if it is something bad or wrong about them? Is there any truth to this whole "transgendering" thing really makes you more masculinefeminine? Thanks! I am confused why others are so concerned about what someone else thinks of our gender choice. In fact most people go through life without ever thinking twice about who we want to date, marry, work with etc.. What has society done that normal heterosexual relationships between men and women doesn't include transvestites (of which there are no less than 10 of the population)??? Why do gay couples get married and straight couples don't? We live in ignorance while arguing over such things...baffling isn't it?? The funny thing is when some one says man to woman, it's ok because it helps me identify male sexual organs right; totally arbitrary though because these same people say woman to woman and it's ok too yet it can help teach females how to use female parts right? It seems like every time I hear an argument against transsexuals I'm instantly reminded of my mom being told by her parents that she couldn't play hockey anymore. She was 13 years old at the time and couldn't understand why having hair down below your waist meant you could never be professional athletes - just girls doing girl stuff. And even today, I've heard non-hockey moms saying essentially the same thing (albeit words other than 'girl. So who gets to decide where the line is drawn? Who gets to make decisions about whether certain body types will be allowed to compete in sports? If you're going by looks alone then sure, the world is full of ugly dudes and pretty ladies. But if you take into account athletic ability along with physical appearance, well, see above re: hockey moms. It's another way in which biology becomes cultural. Nowadays many kids grow up hearing from both sides that boys good at baseball, basketball, football. Not so much girls great softball players, tennis players, soccer stars....but often times guys aren't as fast or touchy as the little darlings playing team ball. As far as changing sex goes, I think it strikes me as odd that close friends I know had surgery before puberty due to issues related to genetics and therefore abnormal development of genitalia e.g. underdeveloped testes). They were still very feminine looking prior to surgery, however, after repair they look like young adults approximately half their age. My own theory as to why the operation wasn't performed until adulthood is simply economicsif the procedure cost A lot of money, only those families with enough income to pay off medical bills would seek treatment. As one example, although most AIDs prevention methods cost nothing, if it hit home financially hard it wouldn't become widespread practice. The idea behind crossdressing and transsexing has always been a desire to appear more feminine. Yet I wonder if the combination of new technology facilitating surgeries and increasing pressure to conform results in what might now seem an unnatural anatomy. I mean, here's somebody born normally and 6 months later he wants his body altered from its original shape. That sounds a bit unnatural to me....and perhaps explains why people who undergo this type of change suddenly stop wanting to dress like anyone else. Finally, part of what prevents people who wish to physically transform themselves from getting the necessary care is stigma. People who are truly intersexual are ostracized in various ways. For instance, according to Wikipedia a person classified as 2X4 (intersexed) cannot legally consent to research studies and must instead sign away rights to bodily samples taken during surgical procedures. This may sound harsh, but it seems appropriate to prevent researchers from performing unnecessary experiments on unwilling subjects.....or maybe it shouldn't be surprising. After all, many people consider animals used in scientific experiments to belong to God himself. 1.) There are already MANY groups (and subgroups within those groups) who perform gender transitions outside traditional guidelinesfor example, gay culture includes drag queens who transition using hormones plastic surgery. Also, plenty of lesbians wear makeup, jewelry, buy dresses, etc., making the assumption that those activities equal "pretending." Of course there's overlap between LGBT communities and transgendered persons because they share similar experiences of discrimination.2.) Transgenderism is NOT brought upon us forcibly in contrast to homosexuality OR pedophilia, FFS!! The concept of transitioning genders existed long ago, often as therapy for depressed people diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder (now called Intergender Dysphoria).3.) One of the biggest problems facing the community as a whole is different interpretations regarding terminology. Do you refer to yourself as a TERF (TransExclusionary Radical Feminist)? TransHeterosexual? Or TGFBBLTQOK, please???? Many points. Some of.., and. Me? Tracoalwill. Unrestructuring. Will Behold
