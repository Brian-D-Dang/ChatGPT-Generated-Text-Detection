I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to build an atomic bomb from them. You can't really make nuclear weapons out of heavy metals either because they absorb so much energy doing work when they're used for fusion (which is what generates all that heat). You'd have to melt down something like one percent of the earths crust to create enough power to run a reactor big enough to actually produce more than just hydrogen gas...
