So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion. The first post on rleagueoflegends has been posted by a Mod and it got like 15 comments before being deleted (i think). It should be obvious why they wouldnt want that kind of thread here. But yeah, i find it quite odd. I don't know what you're talking about, most people are saying it's good.
