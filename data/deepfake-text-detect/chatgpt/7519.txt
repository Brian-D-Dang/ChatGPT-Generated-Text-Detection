While it is true that the idea of "Us" vs "Them" perpetuates discrimination, denying the impact of systemic racism, sexism, and discrimination only perpetuates the problem.

It is important to hold individuals and institutions accountable for their actions and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable world for all.
