If this is a duplicate post, I apologize, an AutoMod told my my old version was too short and that it was removed. Here's my logic, though: If I get a fatal error, I have no other choice but to reboot my computer. At that point, I have to shut down the Panda Cloud program and I don't know if there is any sort of auto-update for this product. If I manually update the program, how do I know if I have the latest version? If I try to update the program, I get an error: I have the new version, but I'm not sure if it's the latest one and I don't want to update and find out I have the wrong version. That would be like buying a new computer and finding out that I have to reinstall Windows again. I'm confused and would appreciate help. Do you have a firewall installed?
