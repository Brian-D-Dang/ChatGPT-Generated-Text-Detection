This CMV was inspired by this post: I believe that being obese is a disability. Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out. It's a disability that a lot of people don't understand because so many do it willingly and insist they are no different from thin people - but the good news is that you can lose weight. There is always some way if you really want something bad enough! So what makes obesity a disability? Obesity affects your mobility, therefore making it difficult for someone in overweight or obese condition to get around as easily as someone not carrying excess weight would be able too. Having extra body fat also increases the risk of developing diabetes, heart disease and other conditions which lower your quality of life. The more severe cases make daily activities extremely difficult (walking up stairs). Additionally, obesity affects self esteem and can lead to depression when coupled with lack of activity, poor diet, etc.. As well as these effects on one's health there should be consideration given towards how an individual feels about themselves physically due to their appearance - seeing yourself every day knowing that everyone else looks better than you does lessen ones sense of worthiness doesn't it? What can be done then to help those who suffer from the disability of obesity? I feel strongly that education needs to start at home; parents need to teach healthy eating habits starting young through cooking healthy meals together and talking openly about "healthy food choices" rather than "weighing" each meal like its a competition to see whose cooked dinner contains the most calories. Once children have reached puberty, it's time to introduce them to exercise and possibly even sports teams where children will learn to work together, compete and improve their own physical fitness all while having fun learning new skills such as teamwork, leadership, discipline etc... Getting kids involved in things that promote positive mental health like dancing, martial arts, etc., encourages positive social interactions between peers without promoting unhealthy peer pressure. Eating disorders starts during childhood development but unfortunately still persists into adulthood so it must remain a focus as well until it becomes extinct altogether. Most importantly though is that people suffering from overeating issues need to seek professional advice directly related to their ailment. If you find yourself hitting rock bottom emotionally speaking, please DO NOT wait till you hit critical mass or have become totally unable to function physically either mentally or physically. Seek therapy ASAP! Remember that medication may only mask underlying problems and eventually cause dependency over time. Proper nutrition and stress management along with a strong support system is key to living a long happy life regardless of any disabilities we may face throughout our lives.
