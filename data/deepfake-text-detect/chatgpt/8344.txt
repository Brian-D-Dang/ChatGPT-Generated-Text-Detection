A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was removed but since it's still a small portion of the playerbase and not something they need to cater for imo removing same sex marriage shouldn't affect anyone too much They could do well by separating server list into servers with Sniper enableddisabled so there is less confusion on what type (and how many) are available per map
