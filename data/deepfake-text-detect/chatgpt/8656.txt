As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They 're comfortable and fit in a helmet but don't look too tight or uncomfortable and they're easy to fit through the skirt pocket on your shorts and socks. Most important is that they're cheap enough for most people who ask you to ride them (especially if you have kids). That said, there's no reason to buy them from thrift stores unless another person wants them. The price point isn't as high, but it seems like a lot of people are willing to pay more than a pair of pants without some sort of protection.
