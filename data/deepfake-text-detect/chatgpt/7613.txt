While it's true that gifted children are often more academically advanced than their peers, it's important to recognize that they still have specific needs that may not be met in a traditional classroom setting. However, this does not mean that they should receive more attention than special needs children. It's essential to consider the fact that special needs children face unique challenges that require individualized attention and support. These children may have physical, emotional, or behavioral disabilities that require specialized care and education. Moreover, they often need additional resources, accommodations, and modifications to ensure they receive the same opportunities and access to education as their non-disabled peers. Therefore, gifted and special needs children both need individualized attention and support to ensure they reach their full potential.
