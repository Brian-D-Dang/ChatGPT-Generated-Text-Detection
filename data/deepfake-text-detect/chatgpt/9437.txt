Despite the fast-growing movement, most of SJW's talking points are actually pretty true, and I do agree with most of its talking points. However, we must remember that SJW is a movement, and movements have a tendency to be self-serving and self-destructive. Some of the criticisms that have been made of SJW, such as "radicalized feminists" are actually very liberal stances. I also find social media very interesting, and I have come to enjoy interacting with other far left movements. I find it interesting how SJW is often the only socially liberal movement I can identify with.
