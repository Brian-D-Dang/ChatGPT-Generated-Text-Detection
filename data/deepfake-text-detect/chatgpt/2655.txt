So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training and are well equipped, but is there really nothing else we can do? Like put more fire fighters on the front lines or something like that I think you already have to cut down trees in certain areas before they burn up. Kinda hard to fight a forest fire with no fuel source for embersflames
