Hi, I'm new. So the greeks are complaining about the EU's imposed austerity measures, the terms of their countries increasing debt problems, even going as far as to boycott german goods and services in protest (just google "Grexit. What exactly is happening? Greece just defaulted on its loans. The German government introduced very harsh cuts that basically force Greece back into recession for at least 3 years. It also passed a law stating that public workers can't strike. Basically Germany said screw you guys, we're helping our own creditors before taking any care of us Well fuck me sideways then. Didn't know what was goin' down
