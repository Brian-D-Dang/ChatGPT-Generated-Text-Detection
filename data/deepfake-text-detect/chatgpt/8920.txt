I've been pursuing a lot of scholarships and one of the things that irritate me is that there are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my age or my experience. I don't really know what I'm supposed to do with them. You can always look for something else, but it's hard to be hopeful about yourself when you're trying desperately to get by. I hope you find some sort of solution!
