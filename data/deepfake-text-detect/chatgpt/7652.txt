While there may be extremists in any movement, changing the name of feminism to disassociate from them suggests that their actions speak for the entire movement. This is not the case. Feminism advocates for equality of the genders and changing the name would only perpetuate the misunderstanding that feminism is about advocating for women's rights at the expense of men's. Furthermore, adopting a gender-neutral name like "egalitarian" may dilute the focus and urgency of advocating specifically for women's rights and issues. Instead, the focus should be on educating and bringing attention to the true values and goals of feminism, while clearly denouncing the actions of any extremists who do not align with those values.
