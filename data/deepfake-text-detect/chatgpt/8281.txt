I realise that this is a meme one itself nowadays, but as a black man I have absolutely no sympathy for any redditor who was on coontown. These people hate me and want to hurt or kill every single person like myself just because of the colour my skin! And they hide under anonymity while doing so... They should be utterly ashamed if it were not mere hypocritical virtue signalling from those whose lives would only ever matter in how much money (or power) you could get out them with their help - even though these kinds are usually too stupid anyway; almost all white men still vote Republican despite being steeped up shit creek without an oar by Trump's tyranny.)
