I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually poor, but they end up getting rich and having many more children in their homes. You're right about that. There's still a lot of money at stake and I don't think there will be much benefit for all parents here. Kids can buy stuff online too, so if they want it cheaper than buying it on Amazon or elsewhere, that could work.
