I should caveat that I'm talking about these terms as applied to humans not plants, nonhuman animals, or electronic devices. And by "socially-sanctioned," I mean a definition broadly acceptable to the community of civilized people, in this case Western culture (the details don't really matter; it's just for illustrative purposes). But suppose you are an omnivorous eater who chooses only foods with no animal products and is willing to forego all farming activities? Even then hybridizing your genome will almost certainly increase the chance of creating progeny capable of suffering greatly during their lives (though maybe not going extinct if they're sterile before reproduction).
