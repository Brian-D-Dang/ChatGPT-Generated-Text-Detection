There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a degree on a graduate. Graduations are also used today as' recognitions or acknowledgements'. The distinction between a diploma and a degree depends upon whether there is any academic value attached to the degree, but these days most diplomas have no standing on their own, although some universities hold them up and others use them as part of their recruitment processes.
