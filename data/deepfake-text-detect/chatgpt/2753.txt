Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than other nations. I'm not sure what you mean by "harmful distinguishing" but I know plenty of nationalists who would disagree with your statement as well, and a lot of non-nationalists too for that matter...
