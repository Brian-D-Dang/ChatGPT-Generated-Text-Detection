While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established engineers to be a bit ridiculous. In my experience as an engineering manager in both public private sectors (and indirectly through peers), older managers are usually respected for their expertise within specific or related technical areas - which is why they were hired into senior management positions; whereas younger ones do have some degree more credibility when it comes timeability-set required at managing teams responsible over larger product development projects with multiple stakeholders from different disciplines companies). In other words: if someone was promoted given them due regard based on previous achievements alone vs solely being there once again just by title only would probably make quite little difference... as long oo people don't start comparing themselves against each others' salary packages!;)
