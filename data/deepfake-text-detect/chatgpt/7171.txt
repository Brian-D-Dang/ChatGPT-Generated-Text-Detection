First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however: We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is not the only thing you'll find on Reddit, and it's just a little more than a joke. If you're just going to be tweeting, or tweeting, it's not as funny as you think it's actually.
