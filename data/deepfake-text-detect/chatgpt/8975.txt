I say "killer asteroid" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth. I have three celestial bodies (Earth, Mars and Venus), so most of my body would die if a meteor struck earth. But maybe that's just me... agreed.
