First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a sense less than confidence in ones own personal abilities... or at least not particularly strong feelings either way (otherwise we probably wouldn't be chatting about it). Is there something wrong with being able-bodied? Is my issue just due more towards self deprecation over things like body image issues rather then anything else such as IQintelligence etc.? For example if someone was obese they would still have some minor negative connotations associated but otherwise are considered normal people so why do you think differently when talking instead around disability related concepts... It feels kindof awkward asking questions because on one hand what brought us all together should make common ground easier yet also raises obvious concerns through 'what exactly am i getting myself into'. An analogy might help somebody understand better: "think back 100 years ago how strange must your ancestors feel hearing music playing." Wouldn" t anybody really appreciate having these discussions centered solely upon their disabilities without context?" What implications does society put onto disabled individuals which isn"T often apparent by any other means?" When did our social environment become maliciously hostile toward those who aren " T capable enough while others flourish under similar conditions." There seems no shortage o f discussion circles surrounding difference topics where positive sentiments prevail pretty much regardless whether its gender roles vs sexual orientation; race differences against general cultural norms - whatever! So.... Why has almost every post ever made within r-disability been filled w quotes regarding disappointment, discouragement downright despair?! How come even though most everyone understands little kids want Playstations too - nobody quite agrees thats ok since encouraging them may lead children astray....Yet somehow allowing handicapped youngsters video games reassures everybody nothing changes between childish dreams coming true versus wild imaginations leading nowhere???!!! Geez.. seriously?? And donB] [Ive got time fo rthis nonsense!! Maybe could discuss ways forward affecting both sides simultaneously someday soon:) If anyone makes finding out cuzi's sitting right behind 'em look easy;)
