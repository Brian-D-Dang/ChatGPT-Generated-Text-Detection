Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that the type of people with poor crisis management aren't at risk for killing themselves; by "legitimacy" I'm talking about how valid ating it would be. So far as finding a fixable pattern in their behavior and trying those fixes instead... Well if you're going down this road (as opposed simply saying we need more mental health care), there's not much reason why one wouldn't just try some or all other kinds first before jumping straight into medication-based ones - especially when they haven've shown any sign yet on actually being willingcapble dealing effectively enough without them? Plus no matter what kind someone has issues getting through life isn'Aot entirely lack thereof from having these disorders either so even assuming something could work out well here shouldn'te necessarily guarantee anything good happens where nothing was tried priorly anyway."You can take my body but join me also!"
