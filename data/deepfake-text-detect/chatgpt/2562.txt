I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer want to shoot someone? The answer is simple: because they are not trained properly on how to deal with certain situations. They will do anything that comes into their mind at that moment in order for everything to be as it shouldve been before.
