I think it is the opinion of many people on the internet, and of reddit in particular that the companies trying to fight piracy should "Deal with it" that they should just accept that piracy is a fact of life and stop trying to stop it. That is what I think as well, but there are some arguments against it and some people have quite strong opinions about it. I have tried many different ways of stopping piracy, some have worked and some have not. Some have been successful for other companies, but not for me. The question is if they are worth trying. I will start with the obvious: You can't stop piracy completely. It will never be 100 preventable. Therefore, it would be stupid to try to fight it, and waste your time and resources on it, when you can't win the battle anyway. As a result, many people think it is a waste of time trying to prevent piracy and instead should focus on making things good for the people who do buy your product. As a side note, this is a big problem for the game industry, because for many games there is no difference between playing the game and playing the game illegally. So many people don't buy the game, because they can get the same experience playing the game illegally. The problem with this is that piracy is a completely different market than the legal market. A lot of people would never buy the game in the first place, but would pirate it. So focusing on the people who would have bought it anyway, you can't get all the money that was lost due to piracy. So now I have said why people think it is a waste of time to fight piracy, I will now explain why it is a good idea to do so. 1. Piracy is only for pirates. This is a popular argument that I have seen on reddit multiple times. The argument is that if you don't pirate, you can't be a pirate. This is a very logical argument. If you don't steal, you cannot steal. But there are two problems with this argument. 1. If you don't steal, you cannot be a pirate. This is true. You can't be a pirate if you don't pirate. But if you do steal, you will always be a pirate. This is the problem. Piracy is like lying. If you lie once, you are always a liar. So you can't be a pirate and not pirate at the same time. 2. Piracy is for people who don't buy the game. This is the other problem. It is true that most people who pirate the game wouldn't have bought it anyway. But that is only true for people who pirate a game, that they would have never bought. But that isn't true for all people who pirate a game. There are people who pirate the game and would have bought it, and many of these people end up buying the game. It is true that many of the people who pirate the game would never have bought it, but that is only a minority of the people who pirate the game. Another problem is that we don't know how many people would have bought the game. We can only guess, and it is hard to guess. If you guess that 90 of the people who pirate a game would have bought it if they didn't pirate the game, you are probably wrong. The problem with guessing how many people would have bought the game is that it is really hard. So you probably end up guessing too low. For example, I am guessing that 90 of the people who pirate the game would have bought it if they didn't pirate the game. That means that 10 of the people who pirate the game would have bought it, if they didn't pirate it. But that doesn't mean that it is a 10 loss for the game. Maybe some of the people who pirated the game, would have only bought it as a cheap game. They would have bought it for 10 instead of 50. So maybe that 10 isn't 10 of the people who would have bought the game, but only 10 of the people who would have bought the game if they didn't pirate it. Also, you can't buy the game without buying it. You have to buy it, or not buy it. You don't have the choice to buy it, but pirate it. So you can only buy it if you are a pirate. If you buy the game,
