Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll leave it there for now! That's really interesting because I'm having trouble grasping how one could make the distinction without making value judgements about what is "good" or "bad," which seems inappropriate in an objective ethics class (though not necessarily if you're trying to teach someone who already has those values).
