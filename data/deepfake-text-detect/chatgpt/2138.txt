I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. The coffee spilled because she wasn't paying attention while making a cup for her and put too much water into it (because there is no indication on those machines that they're not supposed to be filled with more than 15 ounces) so when it got hot enough to boil over, the steam caused major burns to her hands
