You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the word "fruit" replaced with "apple." I will say, there are some people who believe that apples represent fruit trees because they're more valuable than others but, ok! But apples belong on the tree for their fruits - you see that apple as fruit:P
