By "practical reason," I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election. I admit that this is probably a highly abstract and esoteric conception of practical reason. But the practical reason-to-vote I am trying to talk about is something very different from the standard conception of the practical reason to vote. Why? I think it's because the standard conception is really a conception of the instrumental reason to vote. A reason to vote that takes a candidate's policy positions as the final end, and argues that the candidate's policy positions are consistent with the policy positions you endorse, is a reason to vote instrumentally. It's not a reason to vote for the sake of voting. I suspect that many people do not think about the instrumental reason to vote as a reason to vote at all. After all, most people who vote do not do so because they think that the outcome of the election will change their policy preferences. If you are a "social conservative" who believes that most "liberals" are immoral, you are not going to vote "liberally" because you want to move the country away from a liberal policy agenda. You are going to vote "conservatively" because you want to move the country back to a conservative policy agenda. You are voting "conservatively" because you want to move the country back to the way you think it should be. If you are a "social liberal" who believes that most "conservatives" are immoral, you are not going to vote "conservatively" because you want to move the country away from a conservative policy agenda. You are going to vote "liberally" because you want to move the country back to a liberal policy agenda. You are voting "liberally" because you want to move the country back to the way you think it should be. If you are a "social conservative," you might say that you will vote for the Republican because you think it will be better for the country if the country moves away from a liberal policy agenda, even if you do not intend to move it away from a liberal policy agenda. You might say that you will vote for the Republican because you think the policies of the Republican will reduce crime, even if you do not intend to reduce crime. You might say that you will vote for the Republican because you think the policies of the Republican will reduce the budget deficit, even if you do not intend to reduce the budget deficit. If you are a "social liberal," you might say that you will vote for the Democratic because you think it will be better for the country if the country moves away from a conservative policy agenda, even if you do not intend to move it away from a conservative policy agenda. You might say that you will vote for the Democratic because you think the policies of the Democratic will increase economic growth, even if you do not intend to increase economic growth. You might say that you will vote for the Democratic because you think the policies of the Democratic will increase the size of the budget deficit, even if you do not intend to increase the size of the budget deficit. In both cases, the voters' stated intentions and their stated reasons for voting are quite different from their actual intentions and their actual reasons for voting. How can this be? How can people vote for candidates, knowing that they will not be able to vote for the policy outcomes they desire? How can people be expected to vote for candidates, knowing that the policies of the candidates will not make the world the way they want it to be? There are several possibilities. First, people who are "inconsistent voters" don't actually care about the candidates' policies. For example, people who are "social conservatives" don't really think that the policies of the Republican Party will reduce crime. Instead, they think that the policies of the Republican Party will reduce the size of the budget deficit. Or they think that the policies of the Republican Party will increase economic growth. Or they think that the policies of the Republican Party will increase the size of the budget deficit. In other words, these people actually care about the policies of the Republican Party, but they don't think that they will be able to make the world the way they want it to be by voting for the Republican Party. A second possibility is that people are not inconsistent voters at all. Instead, they are "strategic voters." They recognize that it is impossible to vote for the policies they want, but they are willing to vote for policies they do not want in order to make it more likely that the policies they want will be passed. For example, a "social liberal" might be willing to
