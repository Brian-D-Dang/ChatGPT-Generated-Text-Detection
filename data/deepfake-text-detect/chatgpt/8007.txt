While it may seem logical to interrupt Sanders due to his strong liberal stance on social justice issues, doing so still disrupts the democratic process and detracts from the issues at hand. It is crucial to remember that all candidates have a platform and a voice, and interrupting one individual's rally undermines their right to express their ideas and engage with their supporters. Furthermore, disrupting any political event creates unnecessary chaos and potentially dangerous situations for both the protesters and attendees. It is important for activists to find productive ways to express their dissent without resorting to interrupting political rallies.
