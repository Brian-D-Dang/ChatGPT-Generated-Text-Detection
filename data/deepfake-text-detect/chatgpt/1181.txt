I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. For the past 60 years, the United States has been the undisputed world champion in military power and influence. The United States has dominated the world in terms of economic and military power, and in terms of unofficial status, security, and hegemony. But the Cold War has also been a period of great political unrest and political instability for the United States. Since the end of WW2, not only has our military industry suffered greatly, but our political leadership has been unable to generate an effective strategy to counter the threat of Soviet aggression. It is time to transform our military strategy towards the 21st century and end the Cold War.
