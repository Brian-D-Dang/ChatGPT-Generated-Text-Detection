My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in a language is: , - , - I'm sorry but I'm going to have to remove this because it breaks our rule on summary answers or "I don't know" responses. If you want to ask more questions about any part of the question, please feel free to resubmit your own post with additional context so we may do our best to answer as many questions as possible. Thank you!
