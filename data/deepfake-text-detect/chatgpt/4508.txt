Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians and only killed an estimated 200,000 people (the number is disputed). If we had used those same bombs against military targets such as airfields or radar sites then it would have been much better for the Japanese civilian population not to die. 2. The death toll from dropping these devices was similar to that inflicted by conventional weapons during World War II. 3. It provides no incentive for Japan's surrender because they wouldn't know whether their country would still exist two decades later. 4. When you think about where nuclear power came from originally (spinning jennies) - one of the most brutal forms of warfare known to man just didn't make sense at all!
