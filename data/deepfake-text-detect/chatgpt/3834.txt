In spite of the imperfections of the USA and Europe, it still remains a truth that pretty much all of the most desirable places in the world are run by "middle men" (by the way, I am talking about New York here). This is an interesting read. But as a non-American living in Southern California with some knowledge of the local geography: This map should be shortenedexpanded to show more of Los Angeles County. It's on par with Denver, but doesn't make sense geographically.
