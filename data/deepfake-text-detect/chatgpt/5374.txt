(A) Work part-time in high school; Then go to college (B) Work full-time before you go to college (C) Work while you study in college. I was a spoiled lazy person, and at times it really helped me get through the semester as well but mostly that didn't do anything other than help with my working schedule for classwork because all of those classes were so much easier when I only work one day per week rather than three days per week or 4 days each month. I actually see what you're saying though... A lot of people don't realize how lazy they are if they have to wait until they finish school just to be able to start paying bills What kind of jobs does your company offer?
