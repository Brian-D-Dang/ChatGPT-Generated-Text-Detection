This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is that such arguments are not necessarily valid, as there may be reasons why someone who is Y does not believe or support X. It is important to evaluate each position and argument on its own merits, rather than making assumptions based on someone's identity or beliefs.
