I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with you, is it not still important to hear and consider their opposing viewpoint? While free speech allows for the sharing of ideas and opinions, it also allows for a healthy exchange of ideas and the potential for growth and learning through discussion and debate. It is important to promote open-mindedness and active listening to understand and respect differing perspectives.
