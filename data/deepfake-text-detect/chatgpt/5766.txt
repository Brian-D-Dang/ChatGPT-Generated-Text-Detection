Ok, view changed. I guess I meant that there was an arbitrary double standard between alcohol and pot in the workplace, as opposed to saying employers don't have a basis for drug testing. And while I think it's perfectly valid to say, "I don't want to hire people who are high," I don't think it's a valid basis to say, "We shouldn't allow any substance use in the workplace." And in terms of the workplace, I think I made it clear that I think there should be no drugs in the workplace. It's just that I think it's a double standard that we treat alcohol and pot differently. I think that companies should have the right to drug test employees and fire employees who test positive. I don't think that companies should be able to fire employees for drug use, but I think that they should be able to choose who they do business with. I don't think it's a double standard to say you want employees to be sober. I think it's a double standard to say that you're allowed to use alcohol but not pot. And I'm not sure what you think is illegal about that. No, I don't think it's illegal. I'm not saying you're doing anything illegal. I'm saying that I think that's a double standard. I think employers should have the right to drug test. I think employers should be allowed to refuse to do business with employees who use drugs. I'm not sure I understand what you think is illegal about that. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, employers should be allowed to say, "I don't want to hire people who are high." That's how I feel. I don't think there's anything illegal about that. I think it's perfectly valid to say, "I don't want to hire people who are high." I think it's perfectly valid to say that I don't think people should be high on the job. I don't think there's anything illegal about that. I think it's perfectly fine for employers to say, "I don't want to do business with people who are high." I'm not sure what you think is illegal about that. I don't know what you mean when you say, "It's a double standard." I'm not sure what you mean by that. I think companies should be able to say, "I don't want to do business with people who are high." I think employers should be able to choose who they do business with. I think it's perfectly valid to say, "I don't want to hire people who are high." And I'm not saying you're doing anything illegal. I'm just saying that I think there should be a double standard between alcohol and pot. I think it's perfectly valid to say, "I don't want to hire people who are high." I don't think there's anything illegal about that. I don't think there's anything illegal about that.
