Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. The threat "still looms large" (as my mother says), so we must be vigilant at all times to protect ourselves from harm. In school they raised our awareness about Holocaust survivors who had suffered unspeakable atrocities during World War II; many lied awake for hours after having nightmares or flashbacks triggered by something as simple as a movie. The intent is to instill fear into those children, lest anyone forget what happened 65 years ago with an eye towards preventing it ever happening again. And certainly not enough has been done since then. But on the flip side there's also constant threats being made against Israelis today through anti-Semitic rhetoric online going hand in hand with calls for attacks on Israeli civilians which have resulted in murders and injuries over recent decades. So much effort goes into teaching Israel's history right along with its present day realities while glossing over Palestinian terrorism completely leaving out any mention of their deeds whatsoever even though AIPAC would like you to think otherwise as well. And this isn't just limited to America: It appears Canadians aren't immune either judging by how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reflexively condemns anything pro-Israel without spending equal time condemning the myriad acts committed daily across the Middle East targeting innocent people, including Palestinians themselves. This despite evidence showing that mass immigration of Muslim refugees coming mostly from Arab countries may indeed pose some risk to national security according to experts such as Dr Walid Phares whom CNN interviewed last year regarding his new book "America Alone." The reality remains however that these fears should never lead us away from protecting human rights around the world regardless if certain individuals do happen to come from cultures where Muslims don't represent majority populations nor shares similar values when compared directly alongside Canadian laws traditions prohibiting religious discrimination among other things. Not everyone supports Trump but he does speak honestly instead of relying upon political correctness unlike most politicians whose only concern seems to be staying afloat rather than standing strong amidst cultural trends shifting dramatically within Western democracies that favour multiculturalism above everything else no matter how detrimental to long term survival and prosperity when taken too far.
