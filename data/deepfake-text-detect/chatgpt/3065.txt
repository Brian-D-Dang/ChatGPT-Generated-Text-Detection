This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this seems like a lot of work for something that could be accomplished much more easily if you just waited until the network was fully built out and then opened up the protocol. I agree, it's not worth investing effort into convincing people who are invested in Bitcoin coreblockstream solution. They'll fight any change they don't want to adopt anyway - regardless whether it would improve adoption and user experience or make things worse (for them). What we need is actionable plan with majority support, so we can move forward together without wasting energy on pointless debates. While there may still be problems about how to solve this problem as laid out here, "just wait until the network was fully built" does not seem even close to being one of those. That's like saying "just wait when everyone starts using cars instead of horse-drawn carts." It's incredibly naive. We should always strive towards faster deployment than slower deployment. Even if we end up waiting longer because mainstream adoption doesn't happen fast enough to justify devoting time to building out these solutions now, then we will have made the larger impact by making sure the next generation of cryptocurrencies is secure against malicious mining attacks through Proof of Work and other mechanisms long before someone builds another blockchain which ends up centralizing control via pure luck of coin distribution. Blockchains will continue evolving and getting better over time; it makes sense to build ahead of that curve rather than fall behind. johoe: You're right, nobody is doing anything about this today despite all its potential benefits both in terms of security and money velocity improvements. The reason why is simple: entrenched powers do not want to give up their grip on the systems they've created. As such, the new system must be able to provide assurances that the old system cannot simply switch back to "business as usual." Even though the current situation is extremely unfortunate for everybody (including users), many of us believe the proposed changes will fix that issue when deployed properly. This allows for more rapid progress than trying to convince every single person to switch away from CoreBlockstream's solution right now, which adds unnecessary friction while causing delays due to lack of consensus. The conflict between miners and developers isn't going anywhere soon... These kind of fights inevitably result in death marches. Why not get rid of as much of the contention upfront? If there is no common ground, let development go elsewhere where it can be sustained free of interference from large players? If miners really cared, they might be developing alternative algorithms which are less susceptible to ASIC Boost, etc., allowing non-ASIC companies to compete. But they aren't... So maybe they don't care that much after all. There were several attempts recently to develop a "better" algorithm for proof of stake coins called Quantum Resistant PoW[1] (URL2) but none gained traction. Personally, I think what we need is education. Most people only understand some crypto basics - difficulty, block size limit, POW vs POS, P2P networks... People tend to quickly jump to conclusions blaming devs for certain decisions based on incomplete understanding and then act accordingly. Instead of fighting each other, lets focus our efforts in educating others. Edited to remove Bitcoin Cash style posturing. [1]:
