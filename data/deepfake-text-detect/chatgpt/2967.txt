Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, so let's assume that you're not anti-vax and just want the evidence. The largest difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated children is risk of disease on a per capita basis (i.e., an infant dies from pertussis every other week). This means that if we increase infection rates by 10 through natural processes due to decreased herd immunity in both groups then there are more cases occurring than previously, which leads to more cases among vaccinated individuals who would otherwise be protected because they were sick during the period when their vaccinations wore off. In this way, increased exposure doesn't lead to greater prevalence; it merely allows the virus to overcome our immune systems despite being immunized against it. If you can find some good data showing that this has been shown empirically under normal circumstances, please point out where.
