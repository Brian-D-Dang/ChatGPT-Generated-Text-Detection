I feel like they're acting and it often feels very campy. I don't like how they say "well my brain is more feminine," like excuse me that's something that women I understand how you feel. It can be frustrating when people attribute certain behaviors or traits solely to one gender or the other. It's important to remember that, despite what some people may believe, there is no one way to be a certain gender. Gender is a complex and multifaceted concept that reflects a combination of biological, social, and cultural factors. It's perfectly valid for someone to identify as having a brain that is more feminine or masculine, but it's also important for us to realize that these concepts are culturally constructed and not necessarily tied to biological sex. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to determine how they want to express their gender identity and to treat others with respect and kindness regardless of their gender expression.
