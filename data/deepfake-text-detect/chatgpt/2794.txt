This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use or occupancy status may be, nor whether it is a residential or commercial building...to me this makes sense for all government revenue streams and provides an even playing field to allow taxpayers some relief in their tax burden. I have been following your blog since you began posting it over 2 years ago. While there are certainly issues that can continue to be debated we seem to share similar values with regards to taxation policy.. which leads me believe that if given an opportunity that our two parties could work together (at least symbolically) as colleagues rather than adversaries....which would suggest my preference to support you for Governor of California.
