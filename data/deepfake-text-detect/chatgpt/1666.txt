So, one thing that I have to preface this with is that I see both (all) sexes as equal, outside of a few natural sexual dimorphisms (Genitalia, ability to have children etc). EDIT: Forgot about the word "sex" in general I'm not trying to start an argument here so please don't misconstrue my reply. There's definitely something to be said for being able to reproduce and having offspring but at what cost? Plenty of people will argue pro lifers are just doing it because they want to stop abortions even though they know full well there won't ever actually be any consequences from making such laws Actually, if you have read some research on abortion rates, you would understand fully why these types of things happen
