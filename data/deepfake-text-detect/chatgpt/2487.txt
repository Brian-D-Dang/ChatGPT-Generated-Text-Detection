Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one partner starts to feel like they aren't getting enough of it? How does this relate at all - or some other reason that would make them not want a relationship with you today (i.e., if there's someone else heshe is more interested in).
