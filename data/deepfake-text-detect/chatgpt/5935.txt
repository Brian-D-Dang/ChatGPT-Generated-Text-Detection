First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean I have to like it. I also don't have to "get over it" either. We don't live in a society where people are okay with public nudity. There are just some things that I don't think are appropriate to post to the internet. I mean, you don't have to agree with me. I'm not going to tell you you're wrong for liking this and posting it to the internet. I'm not going to tell you you're wrong for liking this and posting it to the internet. I'm just going to remind you that we all have different opinions on things and you're going to get a lot of replies saying that you're wrong for posting this photo. It's not meant to be mean or rude, just different. I agree with you and I can't believe it's even a question. But we live in a society that doesn't want to be offended and has lost the ability to put things in perspective.

You're right, we do live in a society that doesn't want to be offended, but that doesn't mean I'm going to like it. Just because I don't agree with something that doesn't mean I'm going to be mean or rude to the person for doing it. I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to be mean or rude to you. I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to be mean or rude to you. It's just that I know that there are going to be a lot of replies saying that you're wrong for posting this picture and I didn't want you to take it personally. I'm not sure I see the issue. Unless someone is being shamed, I don't think it's an issue. It is a little strange that you don't see it as a thing, and that you would take it down, but that's just my opinion. And thank you for your reply, I just want people to understand where I'm coming from. I mean, what? It's a cute pic of your kid in the shower. And when he's an adult, he can delete it if he wants to. I'm really curious as to why people think it's appropriate to post pictures of themselves and their children on the internet. Quote from: kayvent on February 12, 2015, 02:35:54 PM It's not appropriate. It's a personal image. It's private and it's not meant for public consumption. I mean, people post their kid's pics all over facebook all the time. I can't stand it. What if your kid grows up and doesn't want their picture on the internet? What if they don't want their kid to post their pics on the internet? It's not fair to them. I can understand people posting pics of themselves, but I just don't get why people don't have a problem with posting pics of their kids to the internet. It's not appropriate. I know that you meant well and I appreciate that you clarified what you meant. You're totally right about people being offended and not being able to put things in perspective. I've said things that I've regretted and I always try to be respectful of other people's opinions. Thank you. I wasn't trying to be rude, it's just that I've had other replies and I didn't want you to take it personally. I was just trying to point out that there's going to be a lot of replies saying that you're wrong for posting this pic, but I totally understand. I just want people to understand where I'm coming from.

It's not the same as posting a nude picture of yourself. I know that if I posted a nude
