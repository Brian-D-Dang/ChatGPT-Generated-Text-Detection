If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean will give you far more opportunities than these languages and can teach people there their native tongue well-before the age of 5. Very true! I was thinking about Japan when i posted this. But also China has a really interesting history as well as a lot of cool things for kids to do
