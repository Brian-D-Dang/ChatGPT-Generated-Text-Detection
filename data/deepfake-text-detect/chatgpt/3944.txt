To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example: If such a situation led to the death of the child in question, it would be considered murder by common law. Moreover, even if it were true that this is morally permissible for some (such as a brother or sister), how could that justify legalizing an otherwise immoral behavior?
