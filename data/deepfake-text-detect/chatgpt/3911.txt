So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to come up with scenarios where "it's just sex" but we know there really isn't consent, so how can you argue that it is consensual? If consent is implied then that would be accepted as true without a stretch... something like when an officer stops and talks to someone for several minutes about their car.
