In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals We feel it is essential that a domestic pet has a home and that being able to control their diet is a normal part of keeping them healthy. When I recently spoke to a vet in the UK, I said that there were too many animals to feed island birds and that we should be removing them from the wild. They are an extremely vulnerable species. The Vets said that they are now considering whether they should do that and whether they should replace them with native species. This is a very good idea. In the UK, I have made my own guidelines for adopting pets and this has been very successful. The law is very strict about whether pets can be adopted, and so it is important for people to be aware of what they are doing. We are now going to start a national campaign against allowing pets to have their own pets. We are also aiming to eliminate feral dogs and help stop the spread of this disease.
