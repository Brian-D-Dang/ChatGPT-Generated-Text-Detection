Most social progressives, love democracy, and so it is of relatively little surprise to me that as they have achieved a majority (in Reddit and the West), that they want to use that majority to push their agenda. I think it is important to remember, however, that democracy is not always a good thing. A majority can be wrong, and the consequences of that can be serious. Democracy should be used judiciously, with respect for minority opinions, and when necessary with checks and balances in place to make sure minority opinions are heard.
