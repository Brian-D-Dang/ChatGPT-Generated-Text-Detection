First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and will simply go by what scientists have said: Males are more sensitive to testosterone than females so taking steroids can make you feel physically stronger but it also makes your body larger which is undesirable for most people who want to lose weight or maintain their current weight status. Females on the other hand do not have an equal amount of estrogen like males do so they don't need as much hormone supplementation to keep them looking youthful. So if you were trying hard to look your best then using performance enhancing drugs would be counterproductive because at some point those hormones stop producing the effects that you desire hence why women only use natural methods when wanting to gain muscle mass without heavy-handed supplementing (i.e. eating healthy foods). I think that's pretty straight forward. Not rocket science!
