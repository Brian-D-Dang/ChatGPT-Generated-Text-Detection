I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot unarmed people? Police shootings are not acceptable to me," he said. "This is really scary stuff." The officer who shot these children was also cited for what police say were actions that contributed to them being in danger of harm during the assault on the officers' personal property when they opened fire on him as they tried to arrest him last week after they arrested him Friday morning outside his house near Old Town. The officer must be sentenced next month because he can't resign from his job until sentencing.
