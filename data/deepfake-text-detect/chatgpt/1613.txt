Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, do we give advice? I don't think the reason is necessarily because of a need for validation - but rather due to a desire to share experiences and knowledge with those looking to start their own projectsbusinesses in our industry (and others). You're right though, by no means am I an authority on everything!
