This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in our galaxy, then it's possible that we may be alone and there are no other worlds like Earth... If you do have faith, then what does this mean? What steps should we take to find out more about ETI (extraterrestrial intelligence), if indeed they might exist? There seem to be three broad views expressed by those who have taken a position on this question. The first is 'believers', who say, "Yes! We know for sure that intelligent creatures live beyond the earth." These holdouts come from many walks of life, including physicists, biologists, astronomers, geologists, philosophers and theologians. They include well-known figures such as Carl Sagan, Stephen Hawking, Richard Dawkins and Frank Tipler. This list also includes some scientists whose career has been devoted entirely to studying ETIs - theoretical physicists, cosmologist types, planetary scientist folks, etc. - who hold strong opinions about extraterrestrials. Ed Greer is an example of someone who comes right off the street to attend SETICon 2000. He says, "It seems almost certain that nature will produce episodes of high complexity and self-organization somewhere within the next thousand years. If so, when? Who knows?" In other words, he thinks it can happen anytime. Others argue that ETIs could only last a few million years at most before their own suns turned into red giants, which would destroy all potential habitation zones around them. Obviously, this extreme scenario needs further study. But even though most people we've interviewed agree with Greer and others like him, none of us believes the evidence points unequivocally toward any particular conclusion. Most of us admit that little hard evidence remains to be found in support of either side. Still, because of the unique value of finding extraplanetary life, whatever it turns out to look like, we're willing to invest time learning about it. Now let me return to one final argument that drives many believers nuts: the 'No True Scotsman' fallacy. Does anyone really want to write home saying, "Our species isn't special after all; maybe there are millions of different forms of intelligence scattered across the universe"? Is the whole concept of potential ETI beings just a ridiculous fantasy dreamed up by space geeks trying to get publicity? Maybe. But remember how fundamentalists argued against Darwinism back in the mid-20th century? And UFOlogy was once thought to be a New Age folly, until solid-state physics proved otherwise? To make matters worse, the public generally doesn't understand why anybody would devote hisher professional life to thinking about something like science fiction like these topics unless the person truly believes they are important. Therefore, although today most professionals agree that anything unusual going on here must offer some valuable insight into how Nature works, the majority view holds that it's probably nothing worth worrying about. After all, our place among the stars appears rather modest compared to many theoretical models proposed by astrophysicists over the past several decades. So far, the best scientific opinion comes from Roger Nelson, professor emeritus of astronomy at Cornell University. He estimates our chances of being visited by ETIs to be approximately 1.6 x 10 exp -26 [equivalent to zero]. By way of comparison, recombination energy produced during Big Bang nucleosynthesis accounts for less than 4 x 10exp -53 of total mass in the observable Universe according to modern observations. For these reasons, Professor Nelson believes that the odds favor our planet remaining essentially unvisited for thousands more historical epochs to come (and perhaps forever). Meanwhile, in order to prepare ourselves mentally for the possibility of discovery someday, we continue looking for specific signs of ETIs. Here are a couple examples that represent two slightly contrasting approaches. One way involves discovering alien artifacts. Dirk Schulze-Makuch is director of NASA's Planetary Protection Office based at Ames Research Center outside California City, CA, where he oversees all activities relating to exploring other planets and moons in the solar system. As head of the office, he is responsible for preventing contamination caused by human activity through contact with living organisms on Mars. When asked whether humanity would eventually discover evidence of primitive civilizations on Mars, he replies firmly, "For now, yes!" On another front, Roboticist Andrew Chaikin also considers interstellar exploration to be very much part of current research. He currently discusses issues related to building robotic probes capable of making voyages to nearby bodies smaller than Jupiter, such as Pluto. During his talk at SETICon 2000, Andy comments, "We'll explore Pluto using telescopes in five or ten years," suggesting that he expects future discoveries to confirm that large numbers of small icy objects are abundant throughout the Kuiper Belt. Implications Our discussion has revealed a number of interesting facts: A rough estimate suggests that the probability of meeting an advanced technological civilization somewhere else in our Galaxy is vanishingly low, unless they stop sign nonch procurdirectness act (setting the ring;paradoxically serious accidental settings tag , which
