Personally, I'm not religious, so I guess I'm trying to get some insight here. Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything bad or have any bad intentions. In other words, you cannot be wrong, evil, or bad. Now, let's say that the worst you can do is hurt yourself. In that case, does doing a bad thing that hurts you (such as hurting yourself) mean that you're not as good as you could be? I guess it's one of those "if I know that I'm doing something bad, then it's bad, but if I don't know it's bad, then it's not bad" things. I'm not religious either, but I'll try to give you my perspective on it. I suppose the question of whether or not you are good is moot. God is not going to give you a score. A believer might say "He is good and you are not," and a non-believer might say "He is not good and I am not.." Does that answer your question?
