To clarify my title I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable unless the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, or the child is the product of incest. I also think it's wrong for someone to force a woman into taking RU486 against her will - which, if she isn't given any other option and was forced onto it then whether or not abortion is right in this case becomes irrelevant. Now here are some questions. We're talking about two women who get pregnant together (not by rape) but one chooses to have an abortion while the other decides to carry through with the birth (even though they both want babies). 1. Is there anything morally superior to either choice? Both seem equally evil (to me) since the fetus is being deprived of life despite the fact that heshe wasn't born because of something intrinsically bad on the part of hisher mother. Do you see what I mean? 2. What do these choices say about our society as whole - should we be promoting abortions at all costs or does allowing women to abort their fetuses make sense for most cases (i.e., when don't people just up and decide to terminate their pregnancies?) 3. Should laws regarding 2 exist so that no woman can be compelled to give birth again even after giving birth once? How would such legislation work? Would anyone ever be allowed to kill themselves if they felt like dying? 4. Considering 1 and 2 above, could you not find fault with those whose only reason for choosing to suffer pain during childbirth is purely selfish (and hence immoral)? If yes, what kind of a person would you call them? Or maybe there are circumstances where a woman needs to choose between carrying out a painful procedure vs suffering more severe pain later? I'm trying to understand your position here. 5. Are there situations where morality demands from us the impossible task of eternally compensating every harm done in history? For example, Hitler killed tens-of-millions of innocent Jewish men, women children and thousands of gypsies. In light of that tragedy, how exactly do you propose going about making amends? And do you consider him'moral' enough to deserve forgiveness? 6. Why is the world full of misery? Can humanity become fully moral without asking ourselves why things happen the way they do? You know, for instance, I've been studying Buddhism for quite awhile now and although I know nothing about religion per se (apart from knowing Hinduism has many similarities with Christianity), I still have strong doubts about God himself; i.e., why do humans hurt each other, commit crimes, etc.? Well, if everyone knew for certain that there wouldn't be free will in the future, none of the problems would come to pass. But assuming that free will exists...how could anything good possibly result from tragedies happening over generations? So, why would everything turn out well? 7. Most importantly: who really died in Auschwitz?? Did it take place itself,or did the Nazis murder millions in a number of countries before killing themselves off? The truth may shock you! 8. Have you read John Gray's "Black Mass"? If not, please look into it upon reading this question. It might help you sort out your thoughts on faith, science, evil, pleasure, sex, and love. His thesis seems to go like this: most religions promote fear of death (which causes people to avoid doing things necessary for survival thus leads to degeneration of societies); yet scientists, guided by logic, don't succumb to the same fears (they embrace modernity while avoiding pessimism) resulting in learning new technology, creating wealth for mankind, reaching great heights spiritually (cultures predominated by science tend to focus on knowledge rather than spirituality), increases the power authority of elites, makes people capable of executing heinous acts but reduced to helpless slaves due to mass media exposure, opens up minds for truths unknown until that time:-D; This is apparently the story of human evolution. Anyway, what do you guys think? Any input is appreciated: hi daniela, you ask some very important questions indeed....but I must admit, I haven't had much time lately to study philosophy...life gets too frantic sometimes to ponder deep philosophical issues....so.. I'll try to answer your last few paragraphs first..then get back to answering your earlier points:) we've discussed this topic several times already... the problem with reasoning from individual experiences is that it doesn't apply anywhere else except on the level of individuals. it assumes universality and tries to justify that assumption by pointing to individual experience. especialy considering the natural law principle (every being strives toward its own fulfillment) I find it hard to argue for abuse to extend beyond an individual. as far as punishing yourself goes I agree that it depends on context. usually we punish others, never oneself. but this argument is based on the idea that punishment applies to well within normalcy cloth ersay applied to occasional devoting regularity to chance regarding a standard, business report to opportunity alludes to proceed
