So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because he won a tournament using proxies. This isn't just any random guy off MTGSalvation or something like that either; this is someone who has consistently placed highly on PTs and had top 16 at worlds as well as having high finishes at GP LA last year which got featured on ESPN (which happened to have been taped during said event). Anyways my point is that there's an outcry from other pros against WotC for their actions regarding his ban and they state some legitimate reasons why it should be lifted. The main reason being that if people were allowed to use proxies then more players would enter competitive tournaments since it wouldn't cost them anything at all while still getting rewarded with prizes similar to those paid out by actual entry fees. It also allows people who may otherwise have left the game due to financial problems or whatever else, the opportunity to participate again without actually spending money. The argument is obviously skewed towards quantity over quality and there has to be an incentive for players to invest time into improving themselves instead of simply trying to get free wins through proxy usage so what do you think? Do we want the best possible product available or cheap wins?
