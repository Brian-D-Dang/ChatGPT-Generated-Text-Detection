Improv, as an art form, is a medium almost exclusively to be enjoyed live. SNL, while having improvised elements, does not fall in this category because most skits are rehearsed and planned ahead of time or locked into place by the writers' room. It's true that improv has those elements but I think it still falls under the umbrella however you could say for sketch comedy there isn't any improvisation (the actors aren't allowed to adlib) Still doesn't change my opinion though
