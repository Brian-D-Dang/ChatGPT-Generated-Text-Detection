Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to 15hour. While many would agree that it's a step in the right direction to help people out and give them more money for spending on important things such as food or transportation - some argue against this saying that these jobs are supposed to be entry level positions where young adults can make their way up into "more advanced" roles which pay better. However, there have been studies conducted by economists who have looked at what happens when you increase wages but not job opportunities for those making less than 15hr (which the United States does not currently have). After looking at the effects and considering both employers leaving markets entirely (because they end up paying too much tax) and hiring fewer workers because of increases costs of doing business, we find that there has actually been little change in employment rates across states with different minimum wages. Of course, this may just mean that states like California, Washington State, Oregon and Vermont were already high-paying places before the increase so the effect was minimal. But if you think about the situation here today, I imagine most of us would say that Seattle should try something similar to other cities that are seeing growth, while minimizing the adverse affect to small businesses: San Francisco and Los Angeles come immediately to mind.
