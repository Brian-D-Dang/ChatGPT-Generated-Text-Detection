Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. "That means that marriage between cousins and children of incest are not immoral." The problem with your argument here is assuming too much in my opinion (based on what you've written) about how a biologial relationship works when it comes down to genetic material being passed from parent to offspring via the female's egg cells. It doesn't matter if they're related or not because there could still potentially have been some form of unwanted contact which has resulted within those eggs being fertilized by someone else who isn't genetically connected to them at all but their parents already had sexual intercourse...This does create an issue as far as genetics goes for both sides involved because whether its one man having sex with multiple women over time resulting in his genes mixing into each womens' ovaries creating mutated spermeggs which result in an unhealthy child later on due to him being her father even though he didn't produce any of the ingredients needed for reproduction himself. Or vice versa where two people can share the same DNA through different parts of their body such as fingers etc.. So regardless....even if these men aren't directly related to anyone living today other than themselves.....the fact remains......theyre ancestors did interbreed causing damage to our species gene pool that we are now trying desperately to repair decades after generations before us have gone extinct due to poor reproductive health choices throughout history. In conclusion however, if god created everything then why do we continue to see things evolve? Doesnt evolution disprove God? If He made Adam Eve,then Who designed the beasts of the field? Did They design themselves as well? Checkmate atheists
