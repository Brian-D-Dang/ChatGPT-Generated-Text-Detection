I always have to hold my eyes to keep them rolling out of my sockets when I hear (australian) people talking about their trips to europe and canada and america. That's understandable. Everyone likes to talk about their travels, especially when they've gone somewhere special or exciting. It can be hard to listen if you haven't had the same opportunity. Maybe next time you could try and ask them about their experiences in more detail, so that you can learn something new or get a better understanding of why they found those places so amazing.
