This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this is what came out of the discussions we had - and it was a joint effort between myself Miro himself (and yes there are other thoughts that have come up). It's sad when your stickies get so much love...but then again most don't even look at them any more! AH well: I know you guys on here didn't vote for me as top mod but did anyone else? Are there others who would like to see Dhamma Wheel take over the moderation reins....wouldn't be too bad if ya ask me!!; Kidding aside though.....if someone can offer proof they're legit with their credentials etc., let us all know please because surely everyone loves transparency??
