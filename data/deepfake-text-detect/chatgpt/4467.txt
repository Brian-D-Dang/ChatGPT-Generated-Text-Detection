It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be protected and they are made to live in their natural habitat. However there are some cases where the captivity of these zoological attractions may not only harm the animal itself but also hurts its community or environment as well; one such example would be a captive elephant which lives alone for most of its life while orphaned elephants usually die within 2 years! Also keep in mind that it's quite difficult to establish any connection between an individual zebra (or lion) and hisher family members. So why do we capture them? Why don't we simply let them roam free? You can read more about this topic here:
