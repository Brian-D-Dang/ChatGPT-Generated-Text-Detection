I was first exposed to the universe by watching season 1 and 2 of the show. I really liked them and purchased the A Song of Ice and Fire books shortly after that. I thought I'd post some random thoughts I had about the first two seasons of the show. It's been awhile since I've read the books so this is going to be mostly from memory. I will also note that I only saw season 1 and 2 of the show so I might not be fully aware of some of the changes from the book, but this is my opinion. - The first thing I noticed about the show was that it looked really bad. - Jon Snow seemed like a very minor character. The book didn't make it seem like he was a major character. I liked him in the show, though. - The book makes it seem like Ned is a cool guy and a hero. The show makes him seem like a stuffy father figure. - Ned was killed off really quickly. I really didn't think he was going to die. It's a little hard to believe that Ned would have married Catelyn. I felt like the show writers didn't do a good job of making Catelyn seem like a cool character. - The TV show Ned seemed like a crappy father who didn't care about Jon. The book makes it seem like he was a good father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. Ned's death was hard to watch. - In the books it is implied that Daenerys is a really awesome character, but she comes across as a crazy person in the show. - Jaime and Cersei in the show seemed like minor characters. In the book they seem like really important characters. I liked them better in the books. I also found it a little hard to believe that Jaime and Cersei would have a baby together. - In the books Robb Stark seems like a cool character. In the show he seems like a minor character. He also seemed like he was not going to be important. - Joffrey in the books seems like a minor character. In the show he seems like a major character. I didn't like Joffrey in the show. - Sansa in the books seems like a really cool character. In the show she seems like a whiny little girl. - The scene where Robb takes Winterfell felt like it was forced in to give the show some action. It didn't really seem to matter to the storyline and it was a little hard to believe. - The books make it seem like Arya is a really cool character. In the show she seems like a whiny little girl. - I didn't like how they killed off Ned. I liked the scene where he was arrested. - I liked the scene with Ned and the Night Watch. - I liked the scene with Ned, Robb and Cat. - The book makes it seem like the Starks are really important. The show made it seem like they were minor characters. - The book made it seem like the Lannisters were minor characters. The show made it seem like they were major characters. - I liked the scene with Ned and Robert. - I liked the scene where Robert was talking to Cersei. - I liked the scene with Cat and Robert. - I didn't like the scene where Ned finds out about Jon and is surprised. I also didn't like the scene where he is told to go to the wall. - I liked the scene where the brothers are being sworn in. - I liked the scene where the brothers are talking in the feasting hall. - I liked the scene where the Kings Guard discusses the situation. - I didn't like the scene with Ned and Robert. - I liked the scene with Ned and Cersei. - I liked the scene where Ned is talking with his kids. - I liked the scene where Ned is talking to Cat. - I liked the scene where Ned is discussing his marriage to Cat. - I liked the scene with Robb talking to Catelyn. - I liked the scene when Ned finds out that Jon is dead. - I liked the scene where Ned is talking to Catelyn. - I liked the scene where Ned and Cat discuss the situation. - I liked the scene where the Kings Guard is discussing the situation. - I liked the scene where Ned is discussing with Robert and Cersei. - I liked the scene where Robert and Ned are discussing the situation. - I liked the scene where Robb is in the hall. - I liked the scene with Robb and Cat. - I liked the scene when Robb is talking with Cat. -
