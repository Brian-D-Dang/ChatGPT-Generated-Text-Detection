First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways of thinking and feeling are not like ours. They don't have the same moral codes that we do, and they don't have the same understanding of right and wrong that we do. Dogs can be loyal and loving, but their motivations are different from ours. That said, there are certain behaviors that are universally accepted as inappropriate for dogs, whether by Disney or by most people. For example, aggression towards humans or other animals is not acceptable. Aggressive behavior such as barking, lunging, growling, or biting should never be tolerated. Similarly, destructive behaviors such as chewing furniture, digging, or jumping on people are all unacceptable. In addition, dogs need structure and boundaries in order to thrive. This means that owners must be consistent in setting limits and enforcing them. Training is also important for teaching dogs how to behave appropriately in different situations, as well as helping them understand what behaviors are expected of them. Finally, providing exercise, mental stimulation, and socialization opportunities are essential for a happy and healthy dog.
