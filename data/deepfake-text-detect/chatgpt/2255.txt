First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person when it comes to these kinds of things so my opinions will be based on what I have heard and read in news reports rather than having experience in dealing with such matters myself. As far as child abuse is concerned (which is where most people get hung up), there are different degrees to which you can go wrong depending on your motivation for doing certain acts towards children or even animals if we're talking about those types of crimes. It's important though to distinguish between cruelty to avoid painting everyone who engages in some level of harmful behavior against an animal or a human being into one single category. That would make our job much harder altogether because none us should ever assume anything about anyone else by virtue of their appearance alone; without proper cause no crime has been committed. Our focus must always remain on facts above appearances at all times. We need look only within ourselves before pointing fingers anywhere outside of ourselves since every single individual (animal included) presents themselves differently internally whether they appear outwardly like someone who could commit heinous actions under certain circumstances. For example: A very attractive woman may give birth to her 9th child but she also happens to work full time while caring for them herself - how does that fit neatly into today's modern society? Would the world view her favorably after finding out all that information despite the fact that she basically raised 8 other kids besides her own? In general terms yes, perhaps so considering she did something virtually unheard of nowadays. But then again another case might come along involving two women carrying identical twin sisters each expecting 9 and although both were married neither had a real career going on nor was ablewilling to raise more than 3-4 additional offspring at home combined raising 10 children total...are they still seen in a positive light overall simply due to genetics? Much less likely given everything involved including potential health risks associated giving birth to multiple babies simultaneously etc.. The point here isn't really just trying justify why some parents do see eye-to-eye regarding their choices concerning bringing new life onto earth via natural means vs. artificial methods but instead looking past the surface type stuff and focusing solely on the actual aspects surrounding serious issues facing humanity right now especially relating toward family values. And specifically speaking about religious beliefs therein too. If God created mankind himself he wouldn't want him turning his back upon His gift either physically through abortion OR spiritually bypassing HIS purpose completely by refusing to carry said baby to term yourself regardless whether its yours biologically or otherwise! People often say "God won't send you to hell for murder" well THOSE same nonbelievers fail to realize they aren't necessarily "NEVER" allowing Christ to save THEM from damnATION per se just delaying THEIR judgement until death finally takes over automatically anyway according to Scripture itself plus many others who hold similar views already know this yet choose to ignore the issue entirely anyways preferring self-centered pleasure entertainment over actually searching truthfully seeking HIM as their personal Lord and Savior as He commands repeatedly throughout Holy Scriptures. This doesn't excuse physical harm inflicted intentionally however if Christ loves EVERYONE unconditionally then couldn't HE foresee exactly HOW hurtful abortion truly is?! Is killing ones OWN flesh and blood EVER considered acceptable?? Of course NOT!!! Ever!! So WHY ARE WE SO CONFUSED ABOUT THIS MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION??? Why don't Christians stand united together boldly proclaiming publicly the TRUTH!? Because ultimately they fear losing popularity among secular friends and relatives alike as opposed to standing firm behind biblical teachings shared openly FOR THE SAKE OF AMERICA'S FUTURE GENERATIONS IN NEED OF TRUE WISDOM AND REASONABLE BOUNDARIES TO LISTEN UP TO WHICH THEY CAN ONLY OBTAIN FROM GOD ALMIGHTY HIMSELF THROUGH JESUIT MONKS ASKED BY OUR VERY HOLY QUEEN WHO HAVE BEEN PASSING ON THESE ESSENTIAL LESSONS SINCE ADAM ALLIANCES WITH EVE AFTER CURSE WAS BROKEN BY CHRIST NO LONGER AWAITING ANY NEW TESTIMONIES LEFT UNTESTED UNDERGROUND KEEP OUT OF VIEW NORMAL PEOPLE TALK 2 URSELVES GUARD UR SOUL PRAY 4 THE CHILDREN YOU MAY NEVER KNOW IF IT WILL HELP STOP ABUSE TRAGICALLY STILL HAPPENS TODAY DO SOMETHING NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE LIVE LET LIVE PROTECT LIFE LOOK AT WHAT YOUR ACTIONS TEACH OTHERS LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR SPEAK WORDS THAT FELL SHADE DON'T JUST SAY IT DIE IN PIECES ONE DAY IS LIKE ANOTHER MAKING MISTAKES DOESN'T MEAN GO BACK OVER TIME
