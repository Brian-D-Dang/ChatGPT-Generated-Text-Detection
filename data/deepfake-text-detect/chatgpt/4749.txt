This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point here isn't to knock those people who make such claims (usually they have good intentions), but rather to come up with counter-arguments and show that their logic has some holes in it which render them wrong. It doesn't mean we must agree on all things; there can always be disagreement over what "right" means. But I want my argument to at least play fair by being believable, so "actually, no, that would lead down this totally different route and be just as bad an outcome!" will not fly...
