Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. You are right, but I think it's a little different for air travel. It doesn't seem like it would be possible to go from NYC and LAX without refueling or flying an overnighter (what do we call those flights?).
