First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces users to see only the most upvoted comments first. This means that popular opinions get more visibility, while unpopular opinions get drowned out, leading to a bias towards the beliefs of the majority. As a first time CMVer, it's important to consider how this system can impact communication and decision making. It's important to recognize that the most popular opinion may not always be the best one or the most accurate. As a community manager, you can work to facilitate open and respectful communication where all opinions are heard and considered. This can be achieved by encouraging diverse perspectives, promoting active listening, and discouraging personal attacks or dismissive behavior towards differing opinions. Additionally, it may be helpful to create a system that promotes the sharing and highlighting of different viewpoints, such as feature threads or discussion groups focused on specific topics.
