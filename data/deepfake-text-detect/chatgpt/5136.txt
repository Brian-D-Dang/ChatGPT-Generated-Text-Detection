WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in this community are like me. The reason why I'm posting here is because it's what I need as a teacher and student at home who has never had the privilege of having someone else count my grades before teaching him or her can't help but notice how much time they waste on a good book! Well that was fast paced bitch move. You're not going anywhere until you get there friendo
