First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways obviously have nothing to do with their existence because humans aren't animals meaning everything happened in the past quarter century has been destroyed by humans over 200 years ago and there's no reason it shouldn't happen again after that time period just like dinosaurs exist today. If you think about it for 10 minutes then you'll realize how ridiculous and nonsensical your point is when humans were never quite so socialized as dogs....
