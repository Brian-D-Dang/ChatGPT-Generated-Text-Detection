After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read some fantastic history (as well as science) though! Depends on how you define "waste." If it's any less informative then sure but when there are so many works about history or culture out there why not get something from them?
