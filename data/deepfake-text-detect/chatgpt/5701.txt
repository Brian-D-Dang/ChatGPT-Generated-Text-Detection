Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll try to answer the main ones here. To clarify, it's not that I am against the ideas that people have presented here. In fact, I'm pretty sure we'll end up with a combination of these ideas - this is not a competitive thing. I just wanted to make sure I had everything in there and that the ideas weren't being silenced. To say that my idea isn't a "Civ game" is really out of line, I don't think that's fair. It's a co-op Civ game with a lot of the mechanics of a Civ game. I didn't want to give away too much of the design, but I can tell you that the main focus is on city planning and building. There will be a few mechanics like the trading post and research that will make it more of a Civ game, but the focus will be on the cities and building. I appreciate that people are offering feedback here, but I think the point is made in the comments section on the IndieDB page. I didn't want to get into the details of the game here, but if anyone is curious I can tell you that I am using the Unity engine and writing it in C. I didn't expect people to take this so seriously. I guess I should have been more explicit that it was just an idea. It's not a serious project at all, and I doubt I'll ever complete it. I'm just trying to get a bunch of different ideas on paper. We definitely don't want any bugs. We are trying to be a bit more polished than an indie game. I have one of the main playable races, and I'm working on another. I've already made the starting city, so I have a good chunk of it done. We have been working on the rules, and they are finished except for the city state rules. This is something that I'm not sure if we are going to do, but it's something we are considering. I have no idea what the "book" thing is. We were going to make the game playable without an internet connection, but we are not sure if that's going to be possible. We definitely want to have a bunch of civs. I don't know if we'll be able to do it, but I think we'd like to have a lot of different civs. We are planning on making it on Windows and Linux, but we aren't sure about Mac. What would be more interesting to you? 1) Civ-style rules and mechanics without the flavour of the game. 2) City building with Civ-style mechanics. 3) Civ with city building. 4) Something else that I haven't thought of. We are considering adding the ability to play a map as a city-state (i.e. not as a full civ). This would be another civ that is a playable civ and not a city state. I don't know if we are going to do this or not. Thanks for all the feedback. I'll try to answer some of the things here. I'm glad to hear that people like the idea, and I hope that it will come together as we go. We are still in the very early stages of planning so this is just an idea. I'm not sure if we'll be able to make it work, but it's something that we are considering. I think it's important for our game to be able to play offline, and I think it's important for us to be able to distribute the game. I'm not sure if we'll be able to get the game to work without an internet connection, but we are working on it. We have been working on the rules, and they are finished except for the city state rules. This is something that I'm not sure if we are going to do, but it's something that we are considering. I've been working on the civs, but I haven't released anything yet. I don't know how much I should reveal here. I'm working on one of the main playable civilizations, and I'm working on another. I have one of the main playable races, and I'm working on another. I've already made the starting city, so I have a good chunk of it done.
