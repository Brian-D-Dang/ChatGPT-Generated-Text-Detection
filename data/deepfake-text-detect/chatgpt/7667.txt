While it is understandable to feel concerned about the perceived over-saturation of political correctness and social justice movements, it is important to recognize the validity of these efforts. These movements are in place to promote inclusivity and equality for historically marginalized communities. By acknowledging the impact that language and cultural practices can have on individuals, these movements promote a more compassionate and equitable society. Thus, dismissing these efforts as "overboard" risks erasing the concerns and experiences of those who continue to face discrimination and negative stereotypes on a daily basis.
