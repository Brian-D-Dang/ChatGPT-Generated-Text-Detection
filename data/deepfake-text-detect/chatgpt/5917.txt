Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked, and keep the money that they earn from their cooking. Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality cooking show on the Food Network. The show airs on Saturday mornings, and has aired from October 2013 to present. It is hosted by Alton Brown, who is also the executive producer. Cutthroat Kitchen features four contestants competing to earn money from their cooking. The first round is called The Main Dish. The contestants are given a briefing on what the dish they will be cooking is supposed to taste like. They then have a set amount of time to choose and purchase ingredients from an in-show market. The contestants must also choose a "torture tool" which will be a game-changer in the following round of cooking. The second round is called The Aftermath. The contestants must cook their main dish, and use one of the torture tools to sabotage the other contestants' dishes. They are all given the same amount of time to cook, and must cook the same dish. The contestant with the best dish wins the round. The third round is called The Sweet Tooth. The contestants will be given a briefing on what kind of dessert they will be making, and what kind of ingredients they will have to use. The contestants choose an ingredient to "poison" and must incorporate it into their dessert. The fourth and final round is called The Final Cut. The contestants will be given a briefing on what kind of side dish they will be making, and what kind of ingredients they will have to use. They must cook the side dish, and use one of the torture tools from the previous round to sabotage one of their competitors' dishes. The final contestant with the best dish wins the round, and the money that they win from cooking the main dish goes towards a total prize of 25,000. The remaining contestants will have a final sabotage round to see which contestant will win the total prize of 50,000. The show has a total of 33 episodes, with a 4th season airing in 2018.
