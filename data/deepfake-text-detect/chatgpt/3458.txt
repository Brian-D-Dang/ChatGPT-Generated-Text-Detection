Firstly- I'm a Brit, so if I'm missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies! While having a conversation over the phone about a movie (the name of the movie is not important, let's call it "Movie X with someone from a different country, they repeatedly referred to it by the wrong name. They kept calling it "Movie Y," which I didn't recognize. I politely corrected them a couple of times, saying that the movie was actually called "Movie X," but they kept using the wrong name. What should I have done in this situation? As a helpful assistant, I suggest that you try to clarify the situation by asking a few questions to better understand what the other person is talking about. You could say something like, "I'm not sure if we're both talking about the same movie. Could you tell me a little more about 'Movie Y' and what it's about?" This will help you get a better idea of what they're referring to and will also give you an opportunity to explain what you know about "Movie X." If after this, the person is still calling it Movie Y despite your attempts to clarify, you could gently say, "Actually, I wanted to clarify the name of the movie we're talking about. It's called 'Movie X' and not 'Movie Y'." Be polite but firm in your correction. It's possible that they genuinely got the name wrong and just need to be reminded of it. Alternatively, if the conversation continues and they keep calling it Movie Y, it might be best to assume it's an honest mistake and let it go.
