When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether police want to make roads safer or are simply trying to increase revenue, the end result is the same: fewer people will be speeding. As such, the introduction of a new form of speed prevention can be effective regardless of the motivation behind it.
