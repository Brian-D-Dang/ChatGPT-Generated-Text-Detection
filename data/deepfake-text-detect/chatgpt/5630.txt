After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific sense. The argument usually goes something like this: If free will doesn't exist, then my choices are predetermined and thus I cannot be held responsible for my actions. In order to hold me responsible, free will must exist and thus I have free will. I don't think this argument holds water on any level. To begin with, free will in the sense that people are using it seems to be mostly a myth. It's true that there is a stimulus, but there is no action that occurs without an action. Our choices are not truly free because we are all biological and chemical creatures with wires and circuits in our brains. Every action that we take is based on stimuli and things that we have learned. So if the stimuli are predetermined, then our actions are predetermined and thus there is no such thing as free will. With all this said, I am still going to argue that we can have some sort of free will and that we are responsible for our actions. As a disclaimer, I am not a philosopher so my arguments may be a little sloppy and confusing, but I believe that I have some solid points. The argument for free will has to be based on the idea that there is no other choice. What I mean by this is that if there was some other choice, then we could only be responsible for the one that we made, but that would mean that we do not have free will because we were predetermined to make that choice. Thus, there is only one choice and we have free will. This is a weak argument, but I do think it has some merit. I think the real problem with free will is that it is an illusion. We have no free will, but we have a choice. We have the illusion that we are making our own decisions, but we are only making the decision that we will make. This is why we can't make other choices. We can't make choices we haven't made before. We can't make choices that aren't in our nature. This means that we aren't free to make choices we haven't made, but that doesn't mean that we aren't free. In fact, I think free will is very similar to when I am in a dream. I can do anything I want in the dream, but I am not really free because I can't do anything that I can't do in the real world. I am not free, but I am responsible for my actions because I made the choice to do them. The same thing goes for the "free will" in the waking world. We have a choice and we are responsible for our actions, but we don't have free will. We can't make choices we haven't made before and we can't make choices that aren't in our nature, but that doesn't mean we have no free will. Labels: decisions, free will, philosophy, religion, science I love this post. The idea of free will being a myth is actually quite interesting. I've had these conversations with my family before, and I've always been the odd one out. They are very religious, and they think that God gave us free will. It never really made much sense to me, because if free will doesn't exist, then why do we have it? Anyways, it's been fun talking about it. Keep up the good work!
