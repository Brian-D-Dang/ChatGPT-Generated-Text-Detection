Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but some opinions are better than others [edit: I am referring to them being morallyethically "better. If you submitted a topic to this sub with an interesting question that would be cool. But just like asking for advice on what color underwear should you wear and the top 20 answers on rAskWomen is not good enough, it's gonna get downvoted.] I agree with you!
