I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually the kids who are the most affluent. When I was in high school I worked at a very affluent private school in an affluent suburb of St. Louis. One of the reasons they could get away with charging so much for their tuition was that they only had about 150 students in the school. I was told by the students and faculty that the school was for "rich kids." I met with the head of the school one time and he told me that they would only take students from the upper middle class and above. That was his philosophy, and I agree with him. I think that the public schools are the best way to educate kids. I'm not saying that the public schools are the best place to get a good education, but I think it is the best way to level the playing field in our society. I know that in St. Louis, many of the students who attend public schools have less money than the students at the private schools. By not charging for tuition the schools have to be more evenly distributed. They can't just accept the students who can pay. I think this is a good thing. It creates an atmosphere where it is not necessary to be rich to get a good education. I was also told by the students and faculty at the private school I worked at that the schools were very liberal and progressive. In some ways I found that disturbing. I was also told by one of the students that the school was very racist. This school had a diverse student body, but the student told me that he and his friends never saw a black student on campus. He said the black students were kept away from the students in the school. He told me that his school was very segregated. I didn't see it, but I know that many private schools in affluent suburbs are like that. I think that private schools are a good thing in some ways. I think that they are good in communities where the public schools are poor. I think that they are good for affluent communities that want to have good schools. I think that they are a good way to create better schools, but I think that they are also a good way to make the schools even more unequal. I think that this is bad. I think that the public school system is the most democratic way to educate students. I would rather have an education in a school that I know is evenly distributed than in a school that is elitist and segregated. I think that having a private school in the community makes it less democratic and not more so. I think that we should be more concerned with equalizing education than we are about creating good schools. The good schools will come as a result of equalizing education, not the other way around. I would rather have an education in a school that I know is evenly distributed than in a school that is elitist and segregated. I agree. I also think that the cost of private school education is a barrier to entry for middle-class families. That doesn't mean that those families don't want the best for their kids, but they don't have the option of a private education, even if they wanted to make that choice. I know people who have chosen to go to public schools, because their taxes go to pay for private schools. This seems wrong to me, but they see it as a tradeoff for a good education. I'm not sure that this is a good way to make public education work. I'm not sure that this is a good way to make public education work. I agree with you that this is a bad way to make public education work. However, I don't think that it is a good way to do anything in our society. I think that in many cases, you have to compromise your values if you want to make things work. I'm not sure that that is a good thing. It is a bad thing. I just wonder if the system would work better if we didn't have to compromise our values. I'm not sure that it would. I think it would, but I don't know if we have the will to do it. I think it is easier to just go along with the status quo.
