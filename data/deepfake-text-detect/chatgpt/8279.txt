So if you haven't heard already, there was a recent [shooting in a Charleston church.] Many reports are coming out with evidence that points it as a racially motivated hate crime. There's also been an ongoing story of police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement has sparked more protests about race relations not only across this country but around world... Here we sit at home on our couches watching all these things happen through media outlets so I want to ask: what can one person do? We know some people go online every day or watch CNN for updates; others have their own social networks they follow like Facebook pages dedicated solely towards news coverage from different TV stationsnetworks (I'm guilty too). So here is my question again - What CAN WE DO?! How does someone even begin trying help change anything after seeing something tragic occur right before your eyes without feeling helpless?"
