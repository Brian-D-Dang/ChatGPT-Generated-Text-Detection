Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be "free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean that if someone says something incredibly stupid, they should get a pass." Its always been like this with discussions about freedom and has never made any sense as long as I've lived in NZ. And when this happens people who support censorship are accused by themselfs of being fascists or whatever.
