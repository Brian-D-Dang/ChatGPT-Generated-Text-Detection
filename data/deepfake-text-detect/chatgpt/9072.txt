I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. The fact remains that the United States is still not meeting this challenge and not any time soon will be. In fact it looks like Turkey won't even play another game for 20 years, and what their government has done so far could actually help them stay on the path to peace and prosperity in their own country.
