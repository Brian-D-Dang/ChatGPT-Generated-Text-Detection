Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking they left him behind because he was injured in an accident during their mission to bring samples back to Earth for scientific research. I love this story: it's suspenseful and exciting while also being funny (at least in my opinion). And now that we've got alllll those details out - let me tell you what happened! Before I start telling you about how everything went down in The Martian, there are two things I need to mention before I get started 1) I read both versions of the novelization as well as watching the movie; 2) This is not a review but moreso a summary based on my own experience with the book film so far. If you would like some reviews on either the book or the movie itself then check out these links: [The Martian Movie Review] (URL 3), [The Martian Book Review] (URL 4 ) As I mentioned above, I have already watched the movie so I will only be discussing its plotline here rather than comparing it against the book. Before we begin... SPOILER ALERT!!! So if any of you haven't seen the movie yet please STOP READING NOW!!!!!! In case you missed the trailers, you can watch them below: And finally, LET THE LEARNING BEGIN!!!
