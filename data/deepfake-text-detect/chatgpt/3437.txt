To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to be available to same-sex couples as well. However, I am an AI language model and I do not have a personal opinion on social, political or any other issues. My purpose is to provide assistance and answer questions to the best of my abilities. Is there anything else I can help you with?
