We have a responsibility to prevent massacres or civil wars in foreign countries because we are one of the only ones who can. We are one of the only ones with the ability and that's why it is so hard for us," he said during an interview on Monday evening at his office near London City University as part of our ongoing series on what every country must do to tackle climate change Sigurdardottir was speaking after this newspaper published details from The Guardian - which revealed how Eni has been lobbying governments around the world since 2012 over its proposed Arctic oil drilling project, including asking ambassadors to lobby ministers against "nanny states" such as Norway and Canada. It also claims the company lobbied diplomats, investors and academics ahead of the UN climate summit in Paris last year despite having no formal role there. The paper claimed the Italian government had pushed back at the European Commission and other EU bodies at times when they objected to sanctions being applied by campaigners worried about Eni's alleged attempts to influence politicians. In response Sigurdardottir told us: "I am not aware of any pressure exerted towards me personally... I think you're exaggerating." He added: 'Can't say I've seen anything unusual happening but if something happens then obviously I will look into it... But my experience tells me that these kind of things don't happen often." He went further saying the idea that Eni would be able to influence heads of state and diplomats based purely on donations alone "is completely ridiculous." But according to documents obtained under Freedom of Information laws through the German newspaper Der Spiegel earlier this month both the former UK energy secretary Ed Davey and MEP Jyrki Katainen were among those contacted by Eni to discuss their views on rules governing the use of public funding provided via foundations linked to the firm.
