The word 'natural' implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless we are talking about something that is entirely created by human intervention or technology, everything can be considered natural in some sense. However, the distinction between natural and human-made products or substances can be useful because there are often differences in their qualities, effects, and ecological impact. For example, natural materials like wood, cotton, and wool are biodegradable and renewable, while synthetic materials like plastic and nylon are often not. Also, natural products like herbal remedies and essential oils may have different effects on the body than synthetic drugs or chemicals. Moreover, it can be argued that the distinction between natural and human-made is not absolute, but rather a continuum. Humans have been manipulating and modifying nature for thousands of years through agriculture, animal breeding, and selection of plants for particular traits. So, even products or substances that we consider natural may have been altered or influenced by human intervention over time.
