Counter-argument: Respect and appreciation for a nation's symbols and rituals are important for building a sense of unity and belonging within society. The pledge of allegiance and other rituals remind us of the values that our nation is founded upon and promote a feeling of patriotism, which is an essential component of national identity. These symbols and rituals are not meant to hold us back but instead inspire us to strive towards the betterment of our nation. Moreover, the pledge of allegiance and other symbols and rituals are not mandatory, and people have the right to choose whether or not to take part in them. Therefore, it is not only wrong but unfair to blame these symbols for holding society back. Instead, we should focus on leveraging them to create a more united, respectful, and peaceful society.
