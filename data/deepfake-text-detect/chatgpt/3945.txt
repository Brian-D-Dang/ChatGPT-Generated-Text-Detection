So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal into the air, why would it be so hard to launch all of that energy at once? 2: If you are going to draw your sword then why not just do that after you've drawn it? If we assume their weapons were already in orbit, there's nothing stopping them from launching their weapon into space before drawing theirs out. In practice, due to massenergy limitations, they need both arms (at least one) ready for a drop-off.
