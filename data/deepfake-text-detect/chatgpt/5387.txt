I'm Korean-American and I have family in Korea. I disagree with many of those I encounter who usually tend to also be of Korean descent when I don't get all the Asian stereotypes wrong, but they're more than welcome here we want people from other countries having fun together whether it's Korean or not! What is your opinion on the Korean culture?
