I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would happen if they wanted to be a good person andor kill someone... Agreed, but there are many people who want to destroy themselves in order to survive the world.
