One potential counter-argument is that chopsticks can be more versatile than a fork and knife. With chopsticks, you can pick up small food items more easily, such as grains of rice or small pieces of vegetables. They can also be used for more delicate tasks, like separating the fibers of meat or fish, which can be difficult with a blunt instrument like a fork. Additionally, chopsticks have been used as utensils in Asian cultures for thousands of years, so a significant portion of the world's population would likely disagree that they are inferior to fork and knife. Ultimately, the preference for chopsticks versus fork and knife is a matter of personal preference, and depends on the type of food being eaten and the individual's comfort level with each utensil.
