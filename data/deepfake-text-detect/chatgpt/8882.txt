First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised. Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, but I do recall seeing twitches in my body and feeling pain from time to time after I had a circumcision. Now if only the doctor could have done something about these pains. This is really interesting, for perhaps all of us men who are circumcised today, we may be actually experiencing some sort of "pain." It seems like there might be an underlying condition that prevents blood flow between our legs or whatnot (because that's what happens when you're circumcised). So, while I know sometimes I feel pain, I'm sure more than a few times a day, even with a clean clit, I can't imagine it being one of those things that gets better over time. I tend to think this kind of thing isn't the case for most if any women, especially since obviously many men don't have a lot of hair on their faces either. My question - did they take your clit test? If so, how long did it take you until this point? The timing would get very unexpected... It took me 7 months I guess. I didn't realize there were almost no signs of infection until 2 weeks into my second constant treatment (the flu shot), which I assumed was like 1 week after my first antibiotics started taking effect. Then it went away once the flu vaccine arrived. The good news though is my only real concern is figuring out how time-limiting my fear of needles will become. I'll probably still use condoms and condoms if I've got a chance, but since my last appointment I thought I'd just focus on getting primes to work through my nerves and that's the best way to keep them slightly mindful. Besides, I'm afraid of needles. They're pretty dangerous. One little needle there won't hurt anyone anyway. There are also dangers involved with pregnancy, for example my younger brother has been told that he has an elevated risk of getting pregnant during his first trimester. As for needles, I think it is safe to say that I found blood samples of my fingers, and then made sure to put them under cold water before placing them in the freezer. Also, I wonder whether it is possible to use tissue samples to perform a procedure without sterile gloves? I never did see this method working well for me in the past.
