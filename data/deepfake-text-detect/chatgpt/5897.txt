There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, while others claim that tax hikes will stimulate growth. It's a debate that will continue as long as the economy itself is in a state of flux. It can be argued that, as of 2010, the economy is slowly improving, but no one can say for certain what the future holds. The economy, in a nutshell, is a very complex matter. Many economic factors have to be considered when making a decision about how to stimulate growth in a particular area or economy. These factors include: Money supply - Money in the economy is the lifeblood of any economy, and it needs to be kept at a certain level. In some cases, the government will attempt to increase the money supply, either by taking action to reduce the cost of money (like lowering interest rates), or by injecting more money into the economy. This can be done through either fiscal policy, or by printing more money. Interest rates - Interest rates are the price that a lender charges to borrow money. Banks and other lenders charge more to borrowers who are considered to be risky. In turn, interest rates go up for these risky borrowers. This keeps them from borrowing money and spending it, or borrowing too much and going over their means. Taxes - The government collects taxes from citizens and businesses, and uses that money to pay for various things. Many politicians claim that lowering taxes will stimulate growth, while others claim that increasing taxes will stimulate growth. Banking - Many banks and lending institutions have a lot of money on hand. If they know that the economy is growing, and that they will be able to get their money back, they will loan it out. If they are not confident that the economy will improve, or that they will be able to get their money back, they will be reluctant to make loans. Government Spending - The government can spend money on many different things. Some of these things are for infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and buildings. Others are for defense, which is the protection of the country. Still others are for various other things. The government can also cut spending, reducing the amount of money that it spends on various projects and programs. In the United States, the government can also raise money by issuing government bonds. These bonds are sold to investors and individuals, and the government pays back the money with interest at a certain date in the future. The investors are basically lending money to the government for a certain period of time, and the government pays them back with interest. This interest is called interest on the bonds. Saving money - Some people decide to save some of their money instead of spending it. Savings - If people are able to save some of their money, they can put it away for a rainy day. They can use the money when they need it. Economic Stimulus - This is a temporary increase in the money supply in an attempt to stimulate growth. Economic Growth - Increases in the economy, like employment and profits, that are hoped for by governments and businesses. Economic Recession - A period of time during which the economy is not growing. Recession - A period of time during which the economy is not growing.
