I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to make something that's 'totally' pure, even if there are very few examples of this. It would be cool to get some chemistry labs out there where we have some actual chemists who can tell us how the things work.
