Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as long as we are the world is changing a lot faster than we think it's going to change then we can't keep up our spirits like we have been doing for decades now because we don't want the harm that's being done by this new government making us feel guilty about what is happening in Hungary...just says it all quite clearly. WILL THIS BE THE YEAR OF THE DEATH?
