I've been pursuing a lot of scholarships and one of the things that irritate me is that there are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my GPA. I have an overall 3.2 GPA, but for some reason it doesn't qualify me for many scholarships including the ones offered by my school (which is awesome). Can anyone tell me why this might be happening? For example..a few months ago, they were offering 5K in scholarships for graduating seniors...but now it's only 3k because they believe everyone needs financial aid anyways due to our friggin' economy. So sad! Not all colleges are like this....their tuition increases every year as well so I think their reasoning makes sense...just want to find a way around it because we don't need more expenses once we graduate!! Any ideas?? Ewa Well most schools do give out alot of money for gradestest scores. But you should check into finding other ways besides traditional means to receive your cash dollars from them (ie: scholarship) and especially those which may seem less appealing than others. It just depends where you look at it. well if its a private highschool chances are they willnt let u get any honors or valedictorian awards unless either ur class has enough students to merit having 1,2,or 3 people getting these awards or u have been excelling academically throughout thier years. Most kids who dont end up with gpa's over 4 usually go to jr high,and then college. i heard about someone who got accepted into harvard even though he was only in 8th grade. so no matter how small your school or whatever im sure they can help u out somehow... because most of us know that going to war would be a stupid thing to do, except when everything else seems impossible. -Lance Schuler Because education today is not preparatory studying, it is primarily learning through experience; first hand knowledge.
