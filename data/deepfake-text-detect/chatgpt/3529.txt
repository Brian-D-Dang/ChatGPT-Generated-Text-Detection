Variable tax, or at least they way the US does it, is poorly done, inasmuch as it often discourages extra labour from people who may very well need the extra income, and can also hurt the economy as a whole by reducing consumer spending. A more effective approach to taxation might be a progressive tax system, which imposes higher tax rates on those with higher incomes and lower rates on those with lower incomes. This would help to ensure that the tax burden is distributed more fairly, and could also provide a boost to the economy by increasing consumer spending among lower- and middle-income households. However, any changes to the tax system need to be carefully thought through and balanced to avoid unintended consequences.
