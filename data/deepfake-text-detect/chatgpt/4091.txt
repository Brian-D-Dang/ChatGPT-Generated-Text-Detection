Firstly- I'm a Brit, so if I'm missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies! While having a conversation over the phone about a movie (the name of the film was never mentioned) my friend turned to me and said 'you know what you should do? Go out alone for a while.' What kind of movie is it?! Do people go out alone to see movies all the time in Britain? It's always just couples or families. You think this is bad. When I went on vacation with my family last year we were only allowed two tickets out at any one place. One ticket would've taken us into town but then it wouldn't have been fun enough for the whole group..
