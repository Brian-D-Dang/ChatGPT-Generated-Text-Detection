I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still think it's wrong to steal from others because you feel slighted by your oppressors. He disagreed and said he felt they were justified for taking something since no one else was willing or able to do anything about what is going on within our communities as far as police brutality against African-Americans goes at this point. This guy has been following politics longer than me so his view might be more accurate but when we look back historically those who have fought for civil rights never stole property during protests like many people today are now doing under the guise of social justice movementsprotests. MLK Jr., Angela Davis Malcolm X all opposed stealing things meant for profit especially white owned properties which has become commonplace among Black activists today: Malcolm X made very clear where these tactics led him saying "You can only rob Peter to pay Paul once. The moment you start robbing Paul to pay Paul you lose contact with reality... You stop being a revolutionary....The minute you go around starting riots and looting stores you've lost touch completely with human nature..it makes you basically outcasts from every nation. Basically you don't belong anywhere except amongst criminals and thugs. And if you continue down this path then eventually even them won't want you either! Because man will not tolerate another criminal prevailing over himself just simply because some organizations put them into power and say its alright... No man tolerates such. They may allow themselves to get pushed in front of trains; they may let themselves be lynched [but] they would rather die fighting crime instead of becoming common thieves and hoodlums" - Malcom X
