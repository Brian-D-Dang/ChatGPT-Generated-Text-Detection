But several senior Israeli defense officials told me Thursday they believe Washington will ultimately back off from demands for restraint after some initial public posturing."It does appear what these events may do," said Lt.-Col. (ret.) Jonathan Henick, professor emeritusof political scienceat BarIlan University near Tel Avivwho was among those expressing concern overAmerican saber rattling against both sidesin recent days.."They're goingto get cold feetand demandIsrael stand down when things go bad outthere... There maybe even callsfor negotiations by people like Dennis Ross [former U Speace negotiator] but eventually you won't see very much done unless something really serious happens -an American death perhaps-so I don't think anyoneshould expect anything more than words right now although opinions might change later."GurionZohar offered similar concerns: "If America gets involved here through pressure then naturally other actors including Turkey become nervous about losing their ally," he warned."What's happening today could easily lead us all toward warif everyone feels threatened enough...
