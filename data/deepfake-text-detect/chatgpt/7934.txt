While some of the actions undertaken by the United States may not align with Christian values, it is important to remember that being a true Christian means recognizing that all individuals are fallible, and seeking to understand and love them regardless. Furthermore, the United States is a diverse and complex nation, home to a wide range of people with differing opinions and beliefs, so it is not fair to make sweeping statements about the country as a whole. Finally, Christianity is about forgiveness and redemption, and therefore true Christians should participate in conversations and actions that lead to positive change and a better future for all, rather than just disengaging altogether.
