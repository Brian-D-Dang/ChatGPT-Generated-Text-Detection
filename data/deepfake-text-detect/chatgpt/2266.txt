Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for "third wave" feminists from different parts of this site (and others). I am just wondering what exactly you would do differently if someone told you they were third-wave feminist? What would be your first reaction in that situation? And how much is too little or not enough time spent on promoting egalitarianism within our own partriarchal society where women are still at an unfair disadvantage both socially spoken as well as economically speaking compared to men?
