I like Bernie, love his politics in fact. I doubt there is a politician I agree more with. I like the fact that, unlike most politicians, his rhetoric matches his actions. He has been consistent with his policies and is not a dirty politician. But I like to know who I am voting for, and I have been left with that question. I am not a Democrat. I am not a Republican. I am not a libertarian. I am not a Green. I was a member of the Liberal Democrats, but I left the party after the coalition government was formed. The Liberal Democrats are a party of compromise. They are so desperate to keep in power that they have sold out their principles at every turn. When they should have been standing up to the Conservatives, they have done the opposite. They should have been standing up for social justice, but instead they have sold it out to the highest bidder. The other reason I left the Lib Dems was because I wanted to vote for a candidate who I could actually vote for. The candidate for the Liberal Democrats in my constituency was a career politician who had been a Tory, Labour and Liberal Democrat. He stood on the platform of a "partner of power" and was not at all a socialist. My principles are socialist. My principles are what the Liberal Democrats were founded on. I am not a member of any political party now because I cannot agree with any of them. So who should I vote for? I have no idea. I have never felt more disenfranchised by politics in my life. I am not happy about any of my options. What I am hoping for is that in this upcoming election, the voters of the UK will change the political landscape and throw out all the parties. I hope people vote for the person and not for the party. I hope we vote for a political revolution. I hope we vote for a new politics. I hope we get the results of the French revolution and we vote for change, not the status quo. I hope we can change our political system for the better and vote for real change. I hope we can vote out the party of power and vote in the socialist party. I hope I live to see the day when we can vote out the system and vote in a better one. If only we could vote for a better system, a system that represents us. A system that believes in us. A system that puts us first and not money, or power or greed. I hope we get the chance to vote for real change. I hope it doesn't take a revolution to get it. Labels: election 2015, labour, liberal democrats, politics, uk, ukip
