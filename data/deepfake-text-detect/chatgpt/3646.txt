If every nation had a large nuclear arsenal, and was willing to use it if they were invaded, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction. However, this strategy cannot guarantee long-term peace as it relies on the assumption that no accidental nuclear exchange ever occurs. Additionally, a nation with a nuclear arsenal must uphold strict control and procedures to prevent nuclear materials falling into the wrong hands or accidentally detonating, which can be a significant challenge. Therefore, sustainable peace can only be achieved through cooperation and compromise rather than relying on the threat of nuclear war. Diplomatic solutions, negotiations, and international treaties can establish norms and agreements that protect states' interests and reduce the likelihood of conflicts.
