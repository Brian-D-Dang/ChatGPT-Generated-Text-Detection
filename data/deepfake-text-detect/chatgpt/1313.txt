Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data] . In the comments, a lot of people were pointing out that tech companies are hiring and growing at an insane rate... yet the median income for US workers is still lower than it was 20 or 30 years ago. In my opinion (and I may be wrong), we're seeing two things: 1) A general bubble-like situation where everyone wants to buy into some type of new technology; 2) People who have been stuck with stagnant wages realize they need something better on their resume when applying for work, so they decide to go back to schoolrelearn how to do something else - which disrupts existing businesses because these people don't know what skills will help them move up the ladder faster now as opposed to later once they've upgraded those skills. There's also a little bit of money laundering involved here due to schools offering classes aimed towards becoming "tech savvy" but really just being taught techniques that can apply anywhere including traditional jobs like accounting. All in all though, I think many of us could agree that education needs to improve both in terms of content (more knowledge without sacrificing quality) and delivery methods since students today aren't getting exposed to the same amount of information as previous generations thanks to technological advances making it much easier to learn about any subject from virtually anywhere online rather than having to pick it up via books, videos, etc...

Most likely either bots doing automated replies or someone stopped using Reddit over time, but then found themselves bored enough by reddit to switch accounts elsewhere:) Edit: Commenter below me raises another point: most people would probably use different names under different account types, assuming anonymity per se does exist across sites at least until you get banned by a site itself mods. One should keep these assumptions in mind while talking about 'anonymous users'. It doesn't matter whether it exists or not technically speaking your identity is assumed based on current rulesets applied to specific sites. This means if you used throwaways here before going somewhere else, odds are good you'll continue to use those same throwaway identities everywhere you frequent even if the other servers explicitly state otherwise. That alone wouldn't justify saying anonymous usage is negligible unless such services specifically prohibit certain behaviors (which seems unlikely given how widespread it already appears). But again, this is only speculation based upon zero evidence whatsoever. Also note that plenty of discussion of social engineering indicates that spamming fake accounts makes life very difficult for spammers. So perhaps someone operating multiple accounts on similar subreddits had decided to stop posting altogether? This happened several times during last year bitcoin bull run too[0]. Not fun shit and quite annoying to wait around 10 minutes minimum every time someone creates a new thread. [0]: That kind stuff happens in real life lots of places. Even if you never hear about it happening its pretty standard practice. It's part of living in a modern city filled with billions of humans - find yourself isolated in suburbia, rural area, middle of nowhere, whatever and you might never notice it happen ever again lol. The old adage is almost always true: The first rule of urban crime is never talk about urban crime. Likewise, on Hacker News (or anywhere for that matter!) discussing criminal activity usually leads to spoilers.
