Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better. If that is so, what is the point of reading fiction? The problem with most "spiritual" and religious texts (including many Christian texts) is that they don' t provide any valid answers to real questions about life. Instead, it's just a bunch of rules someone somewhere made up and then told you they're right because they say so. Unfortunately, these rules end up being pretty restrictive and limiting in practice. I think this happened for two reasons: 1.) The people who put them together wanted something simple enough that anyone could understand, but not too simple afterall, if no one would follow their philosophy or religion...2.) They were written by some very smart menwomen, who knew how humans worked and thought. Sadly, neither reason exists anymore. All we have now is an endless pile of old books with lots of things people didn't know about back when they wrote them. So instead of answering practical real-life problems, these books try to use logical reasoning to make more sense out of nonsense ramblings from long ago. But as John Locke said over 300 years ago: "Reason does nothing else than multiply real difficulties." And as the Catholic Church put it even longer ago: "Words do not lead to knowledge; only thoughts can bring man closer to God." That seems like common sense today, but unfortunately, nobody paid attention to those statements until well into modern times. Nowadays, thousands upon thousands of words are used to get people thinking about concepts they already have inside themselves. In fact, most philosophies are really means of manipulating ideas that everyone has deep down inside of them without necessarily knowing where they came from originally. This makes avoiding the trap of following blind authority easier. You still read good philosophical material and naturally develop your own opinions through critical thinking, which allows people to easily question where everything comes from to see if there might be another way. After all, why should anybody blindly accept anything somebody says about how everything works? What authority gave him the right to tell me he knows everything about my soul? As far as our souls go, none. Our minds create our reality no matter what. We choose whether to read stories or watch movies, play video games, eat food, listen to music etc., however, we aren't free spirits floating around in space going wherever we want -we're fleshy bodies walking on solid ground under the influence of gravity and electrical fields. People have tried to explain this away for centuries using vague terms and metaphors such as "the universe," "God," "orbits," "laws of nature," "energy," "consciousness," "human beings," "souls," "matter" etc.. None of those ideas seem meaningful enough to describe exactly what happens within each human body during everyday activities. These explanations always sound too abstract and formalistic to adequately account for all sorts of measurements taken daily at different levels throughout every single person's entire physical existence. No wonder science likes making models! Science creates its own theories to fill gaps between observed facts, predict future events, answer unasked questions, find new ways to improve products, increase production, determine causes solutions for accidents, invent devices that solve our current needs or fulfill our dreams, discover brand new uses for whatever occurs before our eyes, and generally figure out what effect certain changes will have on the world we live in and make decisions based on scientific principles rather than superstition. Why is this important? Because many of our theories are incomplete, wrong, poorly supported, contain contradictory assumptions, and usually don't apply beyond the exact conditions in which they were created. Even worse, scientists often assume that these conceptual frameworks accurately represent universal truths while ignoring evidence contradicting conventional wisdom (e.g., Einstein couldn't prove General Relativity). Without understanding basic science's trouble finding accurate explanations for phenomena, society continues to rely on spiritual leaders guiding people towards conclusions, rather than developing rational ones through careful observation and questioning.
