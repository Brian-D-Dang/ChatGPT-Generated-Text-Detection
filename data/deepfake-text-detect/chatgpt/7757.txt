While it's true that people may post things on social media to share with others, it's still important to respect their privacy and boundaries. Just because something is available to view doesn't mean it's meant for everyone. It's important to remember that we don't always know the full context or intended audience of someone's social media posts, so assuming that it's fair game for everyone to browse without permission can be a violation of their privacy. Additionally, some people may change their minds about what they want to share publicly, so what was once intended for a wide audience may later become something that they only want certain people to see.
