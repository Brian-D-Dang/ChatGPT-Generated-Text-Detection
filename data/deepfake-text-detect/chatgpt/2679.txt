First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways aren't entirely human-like. They don't have the same systems as we do to understand "right and wrong." In other words, there is no right or wrong for them. I've looked at your post history in rdogfree so you can take my answer with some salt. You seem like an entitled asshat who thinks dogs should be treated exactly how you want because it suits your personal needs. A dog has its own mind that works on different time scales than ours does - why would you think petting him will affect his behavior?
