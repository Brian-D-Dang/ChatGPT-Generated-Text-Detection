Most social progressives, love democracy, and so it is of relatively little surprise to me that as they have achieved a majority (in Reddit and the West), that they want more government. It's just another case where their sincere intentions are subverted by selfishness and greed. Wait... you want us not to pay taxes because we're supposed be following some idealized idea? I'm shocked! Shocked I say!!!
