Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, or have already set minimum wages higher than 10 per hour. In New York City, where I work frequently, the minimum wage will be raised to 15 an hour at the start of 2015. I'm not a union member myself but I should be: raise the national minimum wage! The current rate is too low for many people to make ends meet on their own. Millions of workers are stuck with jobs that pay much less than they need to support themselves. Raising the minimum wage would help alleviate this situation. And it also helps pay off student debt more quickly (since those students now earn money while still in school). Finally, we could all breathe easier knowing that our economy wouldn't collapse into a depression if everyone was making six figures.
