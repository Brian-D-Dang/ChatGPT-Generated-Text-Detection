Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: one to climateoutreach for introducing a new topic and keeping the thread going, and one to Joshua for taking an unpopular position, and doing it well. Now on to the reason why this thread exists: the recent posts on climate change denialism and pseudoscience. The reason why I've posted a new thread on this topic is because I've received a fair number of complaints about comments made by climate change deniers, and it's hard to follow a discussion about climate change while that's happening. I will try to keep this thread on-topic, but I'm likely to make it a sticky thread so that I can keep an eye on it. I am not a climate scientist, nor do I have a political opinion on the matter. I am, however, interested in the science and evidence behind the subject, and I am interested in politics. I'm also interested in how the two interact and how this all plays out in the public sphere. That's why I've found myself reading a fair bit of the literature on this subject. The reason I wanted to bring this up is because I recently became aware of an interesting divide among climate scientists, which has led to a lot of controversy and a lot of acrimony among scientists. The divide I'm talking about is the difference between the "lukewarmers" and the "alarmists." Lukewarmers are climate scientists who feel that the effects of global warming have been exaggerated. They are more likely to think that the climate sensitivity is lower than the IPCC estimate, and they often go so far as to say that climate sensitivity is low enough that the CO2 we've released so far won't lead to anything bad. They also tend to think that we're currently doing more harm to the climate by limiting fossil fuel production than by limiting CO2 emissions. They often point out that the problem of fossil fuels is one of distribution, and that rich countries should be the ones cutting emissions. Alarmists are climate scientists who think that global warming is a very serious problem, and that we need to take action. The first thing to understand is that there is a ton of scientific debate on this topic. No one is claiming that either side is definitively right. But there is a difference in the way these scientists see the evidence. Lukewarmers see that the planet has warmed over the last century or so, but they point out that the warming has stopped. They point out that it was a lot warmer during the medieval warm period than it is today, and that our warming is well within the bounds of natural variation. They point out that some places, like the Arctic, have cooled. They point out that the warming hasn't been uniform over the planet. They point out that the effects of global warming haven't been bad enough to cause any serious problems. Alarmists point out that the world has been warming and that there are a lot of problems that arise from that. They point out that the warming has been accelerating, and that it was accelerating even before we began to burn fossil fuels. They point out that we're seeing a lot of the effects that were predicted to happen. They point out that ice caps are melting, that sea level is rising, and that more extreme weather is happening. They agree that the climate has changed over the centuries. They disagree about what will happen if it continues. Lukewarmers tend to be conservative when it comes to the effects of global warming. They tend to think that it is unlikely that we'll see anything catastrophic, and that if we do see it, it will take a very long time. They also tend to think that this is the worst that it can get. Alarmists tend to be liberal when it comes to the effects of global warming. They tend to think that we'll see a lot of changes in the next century, and that some of those changes will be very catastrophic. They also think that the worst is yet to come, and that we'll see more bad things if we don't act. For example, one study by the University of Colorado at Boulder found that a recent paper published in Nature Climate Change that argued that we could be at the "tipping point" of irreversible change in the Arctic climate (the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet) was based on "no evidence
