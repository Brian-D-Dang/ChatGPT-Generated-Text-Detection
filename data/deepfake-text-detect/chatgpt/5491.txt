Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of praise for this article here. He really does seem to have an eye toward the past tense equivalent of "the most obvious" in novels, which is a pretty strong word when you think about it - where does it come from?
