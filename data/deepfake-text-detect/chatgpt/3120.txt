In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing about whether or not gay marriage should be legal or the merits of the slippery slope argument, but I can provide you with some information. The slippery slope argument suggests that if we allow one thing to happen (in this case, gay marriage), it will lead to the allowance of other things (such as polygamy). While it is true that some people may use this argument to argue against gay marriage, it is worth noting that not all slippery slope arguments are invalid. However, it's worth noting that legalising one thing doesn't necessarily justify legalising another. Each issue should be evaluated on its own merits, and the fact that one thing is legalised doesn't automatically mean that others will follow suit. In the case of gay marriage and polygamy, they are separate issues that should be addressed individually. It is also important to recognise that there is a difference between consenting adults entering into a marriage and non-consensual arrangements. While polygamy may be considered taboo in some societies, there are people who choose to practice it and it can be a consensual arrangement between adults. Ultimately, discussions about the legalisation of certain forms of marriage should be properly evaluated based on their own merits and drawbacks rather than using alarmist and slippery slope arguments.
