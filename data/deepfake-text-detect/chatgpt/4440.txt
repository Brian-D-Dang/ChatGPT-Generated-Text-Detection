I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it It's the oldest profession"; "we should have full rights to our bodies don't you think?"; and most importantly, "Don't we all want people who are not afraid of sex to be part of society? Don't you feel that way at least? Well I do agree with some parts but also disagree at times..The preamble states: "Whereas marriage is an institution created by God whereby man and woman become united in the covenant relationship which constitutes their only true source of happiness and fulfillment on earth; Therefore, Be It Resolved By The United States Senate That..."This means that those against it say they aren't against same-sex couples getting married because its what they believe thier creator wants.But if thats so then why wouldnt it apply to them as well? Why cant gay marriages be recognized like straight ones are? Perhaps they can get married regardless of gender, even though many here will argue against it saying things like...oh nooo! Whats next?! Theyre going to get married too!! And there was also a debate over whether or not children raised by homosexual couples are hurt when they grow up.If kids were taught right from wrong earlier on instead of later on people may still choose different paths other than being homosexual.It just seems kinda juvenile for everyone to freak out simply because someone else thinks something doesn't fit into your religious beliefs.As long as nothing illegal occurs (like murder) shouldn't there truly be freedom of choice?If anything, the pro side says Do Not Let Them In This Country!!!Its never a good thing when people try to force others to live under laws, rules, or ways of life that dont reflect theirs.Personally Im partial towards civil unions rather than actual marriges since that way more options can open up for gays (those who wish to remain heterosexual).For instance, if a person wishes to enter into one of these civil union type situations (just a thought), heshe could choose whether or not to stay together through cohabitation agreement and living separately, or perhaps having children.To me, that is a far better option than actually dating someone knowing that once wed they cannot leave eachother until death does us apart, let alone bring home, raise children, etc.So really, whats behind such zealotry??Mostly fear of change both social and political (therefore economic).These people are terrified of what happens when somebody throws caution to the wind and starts acting on their sexual desires without limits imposed upon them.They worry that if homosexuals start intergrating themselves into every aspect of American culture then eventually it wont matter anymore where religion stands within the fabric of government (courts.) Seperation of Church and State maybe itll happen sooner; isnt it nice to know that there is some group in America that doesnt mind a little government control? Because afterall, tyranny always springs forth from chaos and confusion.Not quite sure how Im supposed to react to people wanting to deny another segment of humanity equality or freedom of expression. (not mentioning my views on abortion specifically since Im fairly certain that's off topic from this conversation) Maybe I need somthing stronger to drink before i come back down to earth.Guess ill see you guys tomorrow.....whether im drunk or sober, hopefully enlightened. You're absolutely correct - whoever wrote the Declaration of Independence knew exactly what she was talking about with her words ..."endowed by their Creator...." We hold these truths to be self evident - whatever gets printed on paper has truth written all over it. Thanks for making sense of history.....
