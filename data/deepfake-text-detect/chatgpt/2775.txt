I believe that "Buckle up, it's the law" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority] which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they know how many mistakes have been made and what was done. If you were to look at all of their evidence (and not just one or two isolated points), would your opinion change?
