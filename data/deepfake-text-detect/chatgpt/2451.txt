As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not the way." The cost and nature of healthcare in Canada has become increasingly contentious as Canadians grapple with ever-increasing deductibles, copays and premiums - coupled with rising drug prices. Story continues below advertisement READ MORE: The high price Canadian patients pay for life saving drugs Increasingly seniors are being forced into bankruptcy because they can't afford their medications or end up needing extra care after treatment delays due to access issues; meanwhile many families struggle financially providing cancer treatments without help from employers' group benefits plans while private insurance often doesn't cover some newer therapies out of reach of most people's budgets. "Government would be much better off focusing its efforts where there's clear evidence it could make an impact," says Dr. David Naylor, chairperson at the Council of Canadian Academies' Cancer Committee who was lead author on the report released today advocating against chemotherapy for children under 18 years old diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). "It really comes down to priorities here ... spending government money effectively is going to require us all working together." Tweet This By age 15 ALL gets 90 per cent of cases but by 16 only about 10 per cent of kids get cured compared to around 80 or 85 percent for adults over 30. Therefore if you want more cures but fewer side effects and higher quality of life why treat younger? canthearyoucancer chrisglover11 pic.twitter.comqg8v6lCeHb - Chris Glover (ChrisGloverGC) February 28, 2019 Healthcare advocates say when weighing lives saved versus financial costs taxpayers need to consider other societal outcomes like increased productivity later in adulthood which saves even further costs through labour force participation and tax revenue garnered. While short term survival rates may seem high officials caution these numbers don't reflect longterm consequences of potential cognitive decline leading to lower earnings, physical health problems associated with chemo including heart disease and stroke, hearing loss, vision impairment and infertility among others. All this adds millions onto taxpayer bills according to federal estimates suggesting roughly 10 billion will go toward treating pediatric cancers alone between 2017 and 2026. While early childhood leukemias almost always respond well to initial chemotherapy doses the complication rate usually increases significantly once teens start receiving maintenance therapy typically consisting of monthly cycles lasting three weeks each during which time first responders experience severe exhaustion peppered with fevers and bone pain along with memory lapses, hair loss and depression before experiencing full remission two months prior to finishing course duration. In addition additional complications include neuropathy, peripheral nerve damage or paralysis affecting hands feet arms legs or face caused by exposure to toxic chemicals given via IV drip throughout treatment such as alkylating agents used against certain types of non-hodgkin's laryngeal carcinoma. Side effect profiles vary depending on type and stage of diagnosis however every patient experiences them regardless whether it manifests as nausea trouble breathing fatigue skin rashes weakness dizziness headache swelling vomiting diarrhea joint pains muscle spasms seizures bladder inflammation infection kidney failure liver dysfunction cardiovascular injury insomnia or seizure disorders similar symptoms in older individuals affect fertility hormones sleep patterns appetite digestion hormone levels and cranial pressure among various other systems simultaneously. According to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health approximately 25 to 50 die within five years following starting standard protocol with another 40 dying inside ten years.
