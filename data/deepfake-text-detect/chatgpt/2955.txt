I'm referring to this news story about the incident at the community pool in McKinney TX. You can reference it here, the video is down the page and is approximately six minutes long (you may need to scroll past some text): A quick Google search of "McKinney Texas" will yield a bunch more details on this case. I don't know how much they'll be able to say publicly though because of privacy laws and such. This sort of thing happens from time to time.
