If movies and video games are subject to regulation and censorship, then books should be too. In many places, especially in western cultures, the censorship of books is looked down upon, but in fact, it is very common. One example is the U.S. Department of Justice, which has a Censorship Division. Other examples are the National Book Censorship Board of Australia, the FCC of the United States, and the Censorship Board of Ireland. These agencies monitor books for content that are considered inappropriate or illegal. All of them are constantly working to keep the content of books safe and appropriate for public consumption. One of the main reasons for censorship of books is the desire to make sure that material being published does not incite violence or hatred. Another reason is to make sure that the material is not illegal, especially when it comes to topics like sex, drugs, or religion. When the content of a book is being debated, it is looked at by the censorship board and the board has the power to ban it completely, or to ban the material and allow the rest of the book to be published. While the censorship of books is generally looked down upon, there are many benefits to it, especially for the protection of the general public. If a book was to be published with negative material in it, it is likely that the public would be hurt in some way. For example, a violent book could lead to copycats, especially if the violence is glorified. In the same way, a book about illegal activities could lead to people trying to carry them out, as the author's words could be taken as a command. When these books are not censored, they can put people in danger and threaten the safety of the public. In many cases, books are banned because the authors are not trustworthy. When a book is banned because the author is not trustworthy, it is better to ban the whole book than to allow it to be published. Books, especially those that are considered banned books, have a lot of controversy surrounding them. They are often seen as pieces of literature that need to be protected, and in some cases, censored. However, book censorship is very common in many cultures. It is important that books are censored, because they have the power to influence people and the world around them. posted in Politics tagged book censorship, censorship of books, political censorship, political essay, political writing Leave a comment Internet censorship is the control of information and ideas that can be spread on the internet.
