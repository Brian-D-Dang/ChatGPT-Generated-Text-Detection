Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that I have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. It's simply so much more complex than Lol. I've found LoL to be boring personally but this post just seems weird because of how much you are willing to criticize lol when it compared with other games on their own merits
