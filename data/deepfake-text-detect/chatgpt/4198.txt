Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. It actually makes perfect sense if you accept the fact that all of America's satellites orbit in their own orbits and there will be millions upon millions of them eventually.. This means that a lot of people will never see a satellite in flight from earth until it hits someone else... they're more concerned with space kitty litter than with anything potentialy dangerous.
