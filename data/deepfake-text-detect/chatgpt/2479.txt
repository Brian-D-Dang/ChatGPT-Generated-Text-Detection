I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too stark for me between this place (a relatively clean wealthy suburb) which is otherwise very similar compared with other suburbs around Sydney or elsewhere. Where's that? Maybe they don't have anything else going on there so what you see as boring they find interesting
