As can be seen in [this image] , in most places in the U.S. (and maybe elsewhere that right-on-red is allowed?), it is legal to turn right on red from a stop light as long as you have your blinker on and you're not changing lanes or something like that. This question was posed by a poster who has recently moved to Austin, Texas: I've lived here for nearly 5 years now, where I originally came from in Missouri. While driving here, I noticed a lot of traffic lights seem to be failing to work properly. They are either blinking wrong colors, flashing very slowly when they should be glowing bright green, etc.. Was wondering if this problem is widespread? If so, how do we solve some of these issues? We pay taxes to support our cities but don't see any improvements...it's getting too crowded out there! Thanks in advance for all help!!!
