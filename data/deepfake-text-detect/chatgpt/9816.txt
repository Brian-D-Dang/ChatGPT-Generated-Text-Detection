One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? The answer to this question depends on a number of factors, including the type of degree being offered and the labor market dynamics in the specific area where free college tuition is being offered. In general, it could be argued that if everyone had a college degree, the value of that degree would decrease relative to other credentials, such as specialized certifications or industry-specific experience. However, it is important to note that the impact of free college tuition on the value of a degree would likely vary depending on the particular context. Additionally, there are many benefits to providing free college tuition, such as increased access to education and improved economic opportunities for students, which should also be taken into account when considering the issue.
