First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways are different than mine. They do "think" differently than us sometimes (though it's more so for my dog than me) and we dogs also learn from movies like Toy Story or Monsters Inc., as well as our own experiences in life to develop some sort of wisdom that humans don't have yet. And while they certainly show up at the perfect moments where I'm doing something wrongbadun-doggily-like, they never own up to it and make me feel bad about what they did. So thank god we can teach them how NOT to bite into apples when we pull their teeth out... I see what you mean with the peace signs!:) That is an awesome tip! We were just playing around yesterday because he was watching TV on his kitty side and when I walked back over there I saw him trying to eat an apple instead of getting into the crate. He'll get there though!
