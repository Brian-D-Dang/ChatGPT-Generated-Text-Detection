First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces users to give up the point of view they want to see and make a decision. True it's exactly what happened with the UPVoted posts (or whatever the new post button was called).
