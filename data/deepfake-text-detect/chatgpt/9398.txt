A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government). Losing an election does if they have not won). Having served their country in government, they may choose to serve their country in opposition (if they have not won election and if they have not won a party to government to win power). If they have not won election, they may have to serve their country via the party they are currently leading, if they have not won the biggest party to win the election to government already).
