The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. For example if someone thinks that my eyesight hurts when I come home from work because they don't have enough glasses on their face to see properly.... yeah... That isn't the case for me and should be based on my ability while working out so they shouldn't punish me because of my inability to see clearly
