In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want it has become the norm in this country and many other countries around the world (not just America). Many people like me are appalled at what seems to be growing acceptance for forced sex acts with children as young as 8 years old today; even showing support on social media sites by sharing videos or pictures of such incidents in order to "lend legitimacy" to them because if we do not stand up against these actions how can we expect others to? It makes no sense! To make matters worse there seems to be an increase in pedophiles among certain groups who appear to believe child sexual predators should be protected from punishment under existing laws concerning violent crimes. For example, some parents think that if their own daughters are sexually assaulted then those men deserve protection from prosecution while molesting children must only result in jail time, even if those children were younger than 10-years -old. There also appears to be increasing tolerance towards domestic violence since women seem to feel free to beat anyone without fear of any repercussions except possibly being charged as a felon. We need more compassion in this country but apparently we will never get true justice until things change. Until that happens I encourage everyone everywhere to maintain strict control over your thoughts and feelings toward other human beings whether you agree with them or not so that inadvertent choices about behavior do not lead us into situations where force may occur.
