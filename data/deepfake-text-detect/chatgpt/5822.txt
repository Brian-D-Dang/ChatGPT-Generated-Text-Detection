You may have seen news that BlackLivesMatter protesters interrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Seattle. I think this was wrong to do, because he has fought for civil rights, and because the goal should be to defeat Trump, not Hillary. But at the same time, I think it is fair to say that there is a problem with the way Sanders runs his campaign. As we've discussed in class, Sanders gets results by empowering the activists who participate in his campaign, but he has not empowered activists enough to get rid of the socialist fringe in his own campaign. To do that, he needs to control his organization more tightly. To make this a bit more concrete, let's look at the protest at the Seattle rally. I don't know exactly what the organization of the rally was, but it must have been very lax if someone was able to stop the event and get the candidate to talk about BlackLivesMatter. One problem might be that Sanders was not in Seattle that day. The campaign probably does not have the resources to have a surrogate candidate who could handle protests. But if Sanders were to do this kind of campaigning, he'd need to go on the road more. He'd need to be in a position to directly counter protestors and empower his volunteers to keep the protesters out. The other problem is that the campaign did not have a good system of accountability for its volunteers. Ideally, the campaign should have had someone on the ground in Seattle who could see what was happening, and who could have dealt with the protestors. The campaign does not need an organizational hierarchy, but it does need a system to deal with fringe groups and to punish and reward the people who engage in them. Of course, Sanders' volunteers were not motivated by a desire to hurt the campaign, so they might have been too reluctant to punish the people who disrupted the rally. But that's something that the campaign can change. They can have a system of accountability that is strong enough to deal with fringe elements in the campaign, but also respectful enough so that the people who engage in those fringe elements do not feel alienated. Ideally, the campaign should have had someone on the ground in Seattle who could see what was happening, and who could have dealt with the protestors. I'm not sure this is possible. I mean, you can't expect the volunteer on the ground to be a fully-fledged manager who can make rapid decisions. If they were to have such a person, it would require a lot of training and experience. I suspect that the volunteers are not trained well enough to make quick decisions. If you tell them to stop the protestors, they might be unsure what to do. They may not have any experience with how to handle such a situation. I think it is not that hard to have someone on the ground who could handle these situations. That's what campaign managers do. It is true that some of these managers are young, but they are paid for their work, and they also have experience. I don't think it's that hard to find people to do this. I don't think it's that hard to find people to do this. Of course it's not. I just don't see how it's possible, though. I mean, you can't expect the volunteer on the ground to be a fully-fledged manager who can make rapid decisions. I don't expect that, I just think that it's possible to have someone on the ground who can make a decision quickly and can take charge. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying I think that it's difficult and will require time and money, which I don't see the Sanders campaign having. In 2016, the most famous protesters are the anti-Trump movement, and the BlackLivesMatter movement. The latter, however, does not follow the rules of democratic protest. That is, they do not follow the rules of democratic protest while they are protesting. They are not willing to accept the results of a democratic election. So, to empower activists, we need to make sure that the movement follows the rules. In 2016, the most famous protesters are the anti-Trump movement, and the BlackLivesMatter movement. The anti-Trump movement doesn't really have a movement, but there are a lot of people who are against Trump. I think it is important to separate the anti-Trump movement from the
