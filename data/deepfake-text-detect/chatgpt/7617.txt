While it is true that coffee may not have significant effects on everyone or may sometimes be attributed to a placebo, it is unfair to make a blanket statement that coffee is overrated. Many scientific studies have shown that moderate coffee consumption can have positive effects on mental performance, physical performance, and reducing the risk of diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Additionally, taste preferences are subjective and personal, so it is possible for someone to genuinely enjoy the taste of coffee without lying to themselves. To say that people who enjoy the taste of coffee are lying is dismissive of their preferences and experiences. Ultimately, whether or not someone enjoys coffee or finds it beneficial is a matter of personal opinion and experience.
