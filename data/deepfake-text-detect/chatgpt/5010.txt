After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific way. Scientific reasoning is most certainly not an easy task, but if you read this blog post there are lots of people who strive for truth from its beginning with the same goal: uncovering God's truth by understanding God's nature. I don't know about you, but I'm sure you've experienced my wife's innocence - the other day at the end of the world when I said we needed justice because she wasn't doing what she should be doing; I was saying your faith requires a lot more than finding out truth. If there is no more than the world needs to discover right now; then how can you feel confident you'll arrive at Heaven? The journey of learning to discover truth starts today!

The objectivity issue aside, what does revelation reveal? What mysteries have been uncovered regardless of how far away? Where is truth located? What lies beyond the horizon?
