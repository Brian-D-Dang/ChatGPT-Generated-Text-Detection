So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to have a consensual beastial relationship, but not in an ethical way (i.e., as if you were having sex with your spouse), and by definition something has gone wrong when there's no chance for consent. I would like to know what scientific reasoning allows to distinguish between a "non-consensual" act on animals vis-a-vis those where they voluntarily submit?
