EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People who learn to handle it by themselves are often better off than those who don't get a lot of access to help with pain. This is why I think everyone needs to understand how you can improve your medicine and treat yourself. Like I said in the original post, you need to be open about what you want from your life. You just have to say "no" and don't try to talk down to someone that isn't helping them out with their pain management.
