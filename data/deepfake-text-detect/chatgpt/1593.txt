This CMV was inspired by this post: I believe that being obese is a disability. Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out. It's a disability that a lot of people don't realize or even understand because they're so used to seeing thin people in their lives and it just doesn't register as anything more than "being fat." Furthermore, a lot of disabled people think the same way about those able-bodied folks who are able bodied (i.e., Greg Giraldo). However, if we can acknowledge ourselves for our disabilities, why not do the same with all the different kinds? Then maybe we could try to create a world where everyone has someone who will advocate for them no matter what kind of handicap they have! Being overweight isn't necessarily disabled either...it's simply an unfortunate reality of life that most of us find ourselves living because it makes eating too much of a hassle sometimes; however, there are also plenty of other ways around dieting such as exercise regimens like walking or running that make getting to your goal weight easier overall without having to cut off food entirely from every meal. As far begetting another child goes, while I'm sure some women feel that losing weight would help them conceive better children rather easily, others won't get pregnant despite exercising religiously at various gyms since they were young adults. Anyway, back on topic hereI agree that obesity should definitely be considered a disability unless one chooses to claim otherwise and differ based upon personal experience. Womyn, a majority of society does see "fat" people as unacceptably unattractive - which I guess is similar to thinking poorly about a person due to hisher race gender etc
