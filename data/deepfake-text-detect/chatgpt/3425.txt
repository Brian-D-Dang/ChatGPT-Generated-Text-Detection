Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and it is important to recognize and acknowledge that both male and female rape survivors experience significant trauma and the violation of their bodily autonomy. While there may be some differences in how society views and responds to male and female rape survivors, the impact of rape and sexual assault on both genders can be equally devastating. It's important to approach these issues with empathy, compassion, and an open mind, and to support survivors regardless of their gender.
