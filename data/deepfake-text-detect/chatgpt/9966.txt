EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one of the biggest strengths for both sides is that they are engaging with each other and discussing their views. This is something we don't always see in modern society, especially when it comes to topics like religion. The ability to talk openly about one's beliefs without fear of judgment or criticism is a strength for both sides. I also think the fact that both sides can take the time to listen to each other and consider alternate points of view is a strength. It shows an openness to learning and understanding, which can often lead to greater respect and understanding between people.
