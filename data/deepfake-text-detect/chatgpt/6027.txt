There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man wearing boxers?). Most women who wear this "trend" are going to be embarrassed about it, and feel that they have to try and "out-sexy" the other women who are wearing it as well. We are undermining the standards of our society when we try and compete with other women in this way. The whole "mom jeans" thing is the same thing. A young woman was on TV here in the U.S. recently, and she was wearing what looked like sweat pants. The hostess of the show said something like, "I love these mom jeans, they are so comfortable. I wear them all the time!" What message are we sending here? Are we really saying that it is okay to wear clothing like this? Are we really saying that it is okay to go around showing other people our underwear? This is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws. If I were a woman, I would not wear something like this. Women need to take some responsibility for what they are wearing and for their behavior. This whole "sexual liberation" thing is out of hand. Women are being exploited by the media and are themselves exploiting the media. I'm not saying that women should cover up from head to toe, but I think that some common sense needs to be used here. I don't know if this is applicable in the US. Here in Australia, you can be arrested for exposing your private parts. It's illegal. I remember a young woman who was doing a street performance in an underwear. A policeman came and took her to the police station. She was in tears and apologizing to him, saying that she was "trying to be sexy." In my opinion, it's better to be sexy, but in a respectful way. I love the way you think!!! I agree...and have a problem with what is defined as "sexy." So many people are becoming desensitized to sexually explicit images and videos. We need to find the balance between showing a bit of skin without showing too much and making others uncomfortable. Wow! We have come a long way from the 1950s! I was a teenager in the 1960s and our generation thought we were wild and free and shocked the older generation! So now it is the teenagers of today who think they are wild and free and shock the older generation! Some things never change! I just don't understand why women (and men) today are wearing clothing that is designed to be sexually arousing. I read an article recently where a young woman said she liked the "mom jeans" because she liked the "little lift" they gave her...huh? The young woman who was on the TV show said that she liked the "lift" that the sweat pants gave her. So, is this what we are to wear now? Is this what we are to wear at work? At the movies? At church? I just don't get it! I do not like wearing shorts, but I can understand a woman wearing them if she was at a beach or park or other place where it is okay to wear them. I am not comfortable with wearing shorts because I am not comfortable with showing the shape of my legs. Some women like to flaunt their legs and have no problem with showing them to the world. I like to dress in a way that is more modest and respectful. I am not opposed to a woman wearing shorts as long as they are not showing her legs. I don't care if you wear shorts or not. I'm talking about what is socially acceptable. I don't want to see anyone's underwear. I don't want to see anyone's legs. I don't want to see anyone's butt. I don't want to see anyone's cleavage. If women (and men) are doing this to shock the older generation, then what will they be wearing in 50 years? I see some women in their early 30's wearing the mini-skirt trend that was popular in the 1960s. It makes me think about how desensitized we are becoming to things that should be viewed as shocking. I think that people today are trying to shock other people. They are trying to prove that they are
