Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do it justice. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this subject and hope that those who understand English can get their english back! Also kindly know that there is no way around using that phrase again (it's too long), because I've been very confused by it myself.
