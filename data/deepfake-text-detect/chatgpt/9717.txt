Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the hiker is the one to get the animal to attack them, they have no time to scream for help or find help. Unfortunately, the cops are not in a position to take the hiker back to a safe place.
