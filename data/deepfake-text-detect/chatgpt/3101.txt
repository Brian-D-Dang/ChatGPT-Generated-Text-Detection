There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is "let the people decide." I'm very confused by your post. Are you saying that it would be illegal in every state? Because I don't agree with that at all and think that states should have some flexibility on how they want to handle voting day.
