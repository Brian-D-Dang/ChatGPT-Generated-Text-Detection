Variable tax, or at least they way the US does it, is poorly done, inasmuch as it often discourages extra labour from people who may very well need the extra income. Another issue with corporate taxation that you're probably not aware of (and I'm sure someone else will point this out) relates to things like stock options and incentive payouts: these are typically taxed by your employer when paid but also hit a big chunky pile on top if there's any profit made upon exerciseexpiration double-dipping. It would be much better for everyone involved here just make them "ordinary" taxable compensation instead so its treated consistently across employers employees; anything left over either goes back into retirement savings accounts where appropriate...or gets saved away until enough has accumulated such an amount can reasonably get invested without risking going bankrupt!
