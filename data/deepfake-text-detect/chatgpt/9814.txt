Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from the rec leagues) and I feel that the overly competitive nature of the sport has taken away from the joy of the game. CMV: Playing a sport competitively can lead to disappointment and feelings of frustration, but it can also be an opportunity for personal growth and camaraderie among teammates. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide how they want to approach the game - whether that means focusing on the competition or simply enjoying the experience.
