It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be a lot better off in captivity. There are plenty of cases where this has been proven true (the San Diego Zoo's elephants immediately come to mind). And even if there aren't great examples like these on my own doorstep, maybe they're out there somewhere and just waiting for me to find them? So the question becomes whether or not it would have happened anyway. For instance... We live at an intersection with two roads coming together here; one is much more heavily traveled than the other, which means we get passed by quite often while sitting in our driveway. Recently though all three lanes had signs posted prohibiting right turns into either road during certain times of day because of construction work going on nearby. This meant drivers were forced onto the road less travelled which naturally cut down traffic volume considerably.... until some genius put up another sign stating "Emergency vehicles only" as well as fire engine lights covering part of each lane. Then suddenly those crazy people who always choose the lesser known route started driving through the neighborhood again! All kidding aside, what do you guys think about conservation efforts being used to justify keeping wild animals in cages when their natural habitats may eventually disappear forever due to human development? Or does it boil down simply to humans taking advantage of nature whenever possible rather than letting nature take care of itself?
