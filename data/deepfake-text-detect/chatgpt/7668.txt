While it is understandable that after watching a few shows with such intense and complex storylines and character arcs, one might start to feel like other shows are lacking in quality. However, it's worth noting that there are a massive variety of TV shows out there, each with their own unique style and focus. For example, if someone enjoyed the gripping drama and intricate plot of Breaking Bad, they might find similar qualities in a show like Better Call Saul, which follows the backstory of one of Breaking Bad's most enigmatic characters. Similarly, if someone loved the complex world-building and political intrigue of Game of Thrones, they might find themselves drawn to shows like The Expanse, which features a similarly rich universe of political and social conflict. It's also important to remember that simply because a show doesn't have the same level of complexity or intensity as Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones, that doesn't automatically make it bad. There are plenty of fantastic shows that might have a lighter or more straightforward tone, but are still engaging and well-crafted. Shows like The Office, Parks and Recreation, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine all have a more comedic bent, but are beloved by fans for their relatable characters and witty writing. Finally, it's worth remembering that everyone's tastes are different, and what might be unappealing or uninteresting to one person could be a newfound favorite for someone else. Rather than writing off all TV shows as lacking in quality, it might be worth exploring some different genres and styles to find something new to enjoy.
