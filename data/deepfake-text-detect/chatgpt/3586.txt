I think that all humans deserve the same amount of respect, all else being equal. In other words, if I don't know you at all, my respect for you won't be based on things like your race, gender, religion, or anything else that's beyond your control. I will try to treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of who they are. After all, we're all human beings, and we all have dreams, fears, and hopes for the future. It's important to recognize our common humanity and treat each other with dignity and kindness.
