I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to go any further. But maybe there are other elements which have not been discovered yet? In either case though, why is it so hard for an element to exist after uranium (and plutonium)? Uranium has one nuclear fissionable isotope, while americium can only be separated into two parts of its own; How does having more than 5 separate atoms affect anything? Maybe this isn't even possible because once you get 7 different kinds of nuclei interacting with eachother what would happen when you tried to combine them back together? What about if you had 10 or 100 nuclei all working at once? Or am I missing something else here? Thanks! A: The process by which a nucleus forms may be thought of as three stages - 1) Nuclear Fission 2a.) Nucleon-Nucleus Collisions - Helix Formation 2b.) Nucleon-Nuclear Particle Interactions - Deformation Energy Release via Emissions of Charged ProtonsNeutrons-Helix Breakup 3.) Equilibration Liquid Drop Modeling; Shapes Can Change (To All Kinds Of Configurations), Standard Models Found
