I believe that a private business should be able to deny service to anyone for any reason. For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, they could do so and get away with it because the government would not intervene on their behalf. However, I agree wholeheartedly that public entities such as city governments, schools (or at least those receiving federal funding), etc., should never have this power or ability since these are places where people go looking for help from others. Why is your answer different than ukikopup?
