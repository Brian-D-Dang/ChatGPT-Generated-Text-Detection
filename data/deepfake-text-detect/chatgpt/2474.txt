I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was shocked to find out that the real Alan Turing didn't actually commit suicide in 1954 like they show him doing at the end of the movie but instead lived another 30-something years working for GCHQ before retiring with his partner Ewan Greenidge and dying from cancer around 1967 or '68... Turing died on June 7th, 1954 so he wouldn't have been alive by then
