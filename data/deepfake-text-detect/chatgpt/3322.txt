I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, I can understand your concerns about bringing another life into this world, and I commend you for thinking critically about your decision. If you're considering having children, there are many different factors to consider beyond just the desire for biological offspring. You might want to think about whether you're ready to take on the responsibility of caring for children, both emotionally and financially, and whether you have the support systems in place to help you raise children. It's also important to remember that there are many children who are already in need of loving homes - through adoption or foster care - if you decide that you don't want to have biological children. Having children, whether through biological means or adoption, is not necessarily a selfish decision if you're able to provide a loving and stable home for them. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to have children is a personal one, and there's no right or wrong answer. It's important to take the time to consider all the factors that are important to you and make a decision that feels right for you and your future family.
