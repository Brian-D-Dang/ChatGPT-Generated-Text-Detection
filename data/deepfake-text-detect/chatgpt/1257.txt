First lets make a couple of things clear: I do not necessarily believe that government spying on its own citizens is ok, and thats not what this post is about. When I heard that the NSA is collecting information on the phone records of American citizens I was appalled. I want the government to stop doing this and I do not think that they will. However, it is important for us to do everything possible to safeguard our privacy and personal data. The NSA is doing a great job of this and I think that they should be applauded.
