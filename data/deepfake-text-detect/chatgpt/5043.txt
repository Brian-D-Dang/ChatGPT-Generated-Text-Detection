This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this was a long term consideration for me and it is one of the biggest reasons for me wanting to be back with his team because they got me out on a short notice without giving up too much. I'm willing to try anything, just need something more definite than this week's topic haha
