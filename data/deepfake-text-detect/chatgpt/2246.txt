I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too stark between citysuburban life vs rural life for me, personally... It's because people like different things? What you mean is that you don't find appeal there - just as they may not have any interest at all with urban life outside their own home region
