First Let me just say I am 16 and don't have much experience with how it is in the'adult world'. But I don't think a 100 platonic relationship can exist . It's either you are as close to them romantically or not at all. I totally agree, but what if there was an additional level of commitment? Like "i will be your friend through thick and thin" kind of friendship
