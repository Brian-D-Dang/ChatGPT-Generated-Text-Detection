While some students may be able to afford college, the fact remains that the rising cost of tuition, textbooks, and campus housing has made college unaffordable for many students. The cost of college has outpaced inflation, and many families simply cannot afford the high price tag. Additionally, the need for student loans has increased, leaving many graduates with tens of thousands of dollars in debt. Therefore, it can be argued that while college may be affordable for some, the rising cost and reliance on loans has made it unaffordable for many.
