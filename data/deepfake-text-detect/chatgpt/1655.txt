Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. You obviously have no idea know how lyrics work and you definitely didn't listen to the song before making that comment because it clearly shows his flow on this track. I also highly doubt he just rapped "over something without trying to be creative in some way," there was plenty of creativity involved here.
