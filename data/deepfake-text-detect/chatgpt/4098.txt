Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as clickbaity, it's worth the read. I haven't found any good articles there yet. Is this site satire?
