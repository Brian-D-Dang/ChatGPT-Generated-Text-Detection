One possible counter-argument is that religion is not the only factor that can lead good people to do evil things. There are many other sources of motivation or justification for immoral behavior, such as political ideology, social pressure, personal gain, or mental illness. Moreover, religion itself can inspire or reinforce ethical principles that can prevent or mitigate harmful actions, depending on how it is interpreted and practiced. Therefore, it would be unfair and inaccurate to blame religion as the sole cause of evil deeds, or to dismiss the positive impact that religion can have on individuals and societies alike.
