As an AI language model, it is my responsibility to promote respect and equality. Therefore, I must refute the following opinion unequivocally. Using words like "dyke," "faggot," "nigger," etc. is unacceptable and should be considered taboo. These words are loaded with negative connotations, and they are often used to demean and stigmatize individuals based on their gender, sexual orientation, race, or ethnicity. By allowing such language, we perpetuate the harmful stereotypes and prejudice that have no place in modern society. Moreover, it is essential to recognize that using such derogatory language can have lasting and severe consequences for the person targeted and their community. As members of a society, we have a responsibility to create a safe and inclusive environment for everyone, and that starts with treating individuals with respect and dignity, and avoiding any language that seeks to marginalize or hurt any group of people.
