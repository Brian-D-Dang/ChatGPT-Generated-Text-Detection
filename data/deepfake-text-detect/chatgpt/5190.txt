First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I believe most universities have students who work for free or donated tuition while attending private schools as well (though some schools get help paying for these costs). What about what you said before? What do the students pay themselves in tuition payments if they got scholarships on their own terms at K-12 school? Do you think it would be difficult to find a private university with the funding available without tuition charges? That's my question. You're right but I'm not sure where I'd go wrong here: We need more information about how much students charge than just students participating in scholarships..and, according to the most recent study, only 39 of K-12 students charged 125 per semester especially students making over 100Kyear, which is crazy high compared to other international students who make upwards of 50k annually...
