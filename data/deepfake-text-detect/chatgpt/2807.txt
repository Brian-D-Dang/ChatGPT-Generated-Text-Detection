If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will become available for humans and more will automate themselves out of existence (or increase efficiency drastically enough that they don't need human inputs). In a few decades there won't even BE a labor force because we'll all be automated. So you're seriously saying technology is making people unemployable? I'm not sure how this idea works... I think he's referring specifically to real-world applications like self driving vehicles etc
