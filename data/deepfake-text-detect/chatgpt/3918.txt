Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. I'm not exactly sure how my family came to this conclusion but it seems obvious at first glance: I remember being very suspicious about any stranger who walked into our home or even looked like they were Muslim. We had neighbours from all over the country and we lived close to a couple of big cities so there wasn't much point hiding anything. With us having no real friends outside our neighbourhood, we also didn't know anyone else with another religion. It's hard to imagine now because I grew up during the Reagan era when anti - Semitism was viewed as a fringe ideology but it still existed. Even today, when the Canadian media is full of reports of "terrorism," I can see how some Canadians would be afraid for their safety if someone walked up to them wearing an ethnic shirt or an Arab mask. As kids, I thought these things might happen as early as kindergarten. But what made me question whether we could really live comfortably here? How long until an attack on an area I knew was populated by people from other groups took place? What if it happened while I was attending school? Didn't everyone have a teacher who had been affected by the Holocaust? That's why I started feeling paranoid. The difference between the two situations isn't just the possibility of violence (which is inevitable), but the fact that one group doesn't seem capable of stopping others from killing each other. In Quebec, where I went to school, there was a national day dedicated to remembering those killed or injured in the Holocaust. One year, after the event, we got a letter from our principal telling us "there will never again be such hatred." He warned us if we ever heard of a hate crime against someone in our community that something drastic would need to be done immediately before the situation escalated further. At the time he was right! This should remind you that I am offering thoughts and prayers for those affected by the Boston bombing, but I don't want to come across as unsympathetic or prejudiced. There are many different sides to every story and it's important to learn to work together towards common goals instead of fighting each other. If the majority of North Americans weren't so religious, this kind of thing wouldn't even be a concern for them. And maybe it shouldn't be, either. For most Canadians, secularism has become synonymous with liberal values and free speech. Outside of certain circles, however, many people feel threatened by these ideals. Perhaps it's worrying that in 2012, there is a growing trend toward troubling statements coming out of the United States, such as the president of the United States warning Muslims to stay away from the US or the governor of California threatening mosques with closure due to immigration concerns. Last month, a popular American comedian joked on stage that Islam is a cancerous disease, which sparked outrage among his fellow comedians and other celebrities. These are only two examples of a larger problem: that many Americans believe that being pro - gay marriage makes you a bigot or racist, and that being against gun control means you're a supporter of terrorists. These attitudes may sound small compared to fears about attacks on minorities, but they are huge problems nonetheless. Whether they're represented by politicians, talk radio hosts, or public figures, people aren't happy - especially minorities. Some politicians have responded by promising to remove legal barriers to access to education and health care; others have suggested restricting immigration based solely on heritage or religion. Regardless of who wins the election, it won't matter unless Canadians stand united against this type of hateful rhetoric, which goes beyond politics to affect people in everyday life.
