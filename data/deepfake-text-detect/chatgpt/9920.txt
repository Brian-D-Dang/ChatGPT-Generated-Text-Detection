This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) is based on faith, obedience and belief of a higher power. This higher power could be God, Allah, Yahweh, etc. The followers of these religions are expected to have faith, obey the teachings of the religion, and believe in the higher power without question. This is different from other forms of spirituality, such as Paganism or Wicca, where the focus is more on understanding and respecting nature, and having a personal connection with a deity. In some cases, organized religion can be seen as a form of control, where people are expected to conform to certain beliefs and behaviors.
