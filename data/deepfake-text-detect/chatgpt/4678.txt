I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually rich and get preference in college admissions, so they then have a huge advantage over those that don't even bother going because their parents work at McDonalds or Wal-Mart. Then there's an elitism among these children because of this and society in general also suffers because all the other people around them are not as wealthy and successful either since they went public school too. If you want me to be "elite" I'd rather apply for a scholarship where everyone gets equal chance than apply privately since my dad can afford to pay tuition, but some kid with no money wouldn't get the same opportunity...so basically, what do you think? What type of view would you say Bernie Sanders holds on education? What about President Obama? Do they support public schooling vs private? How has your opinion changedadjusted to reflect said views after participating in such discussions here on POTC? -TMM11- My family was really poor growing up. We survived thanks to charity, churches and relatives. So my first question: how much did someone like Chauncey Gardiner (iirc) help educate black students while seated on his plantation? My second question is why should we expect white individuals to invest themselves into educating minorities when others paid teachers to learn skills that put away food, medicine etc before our very eyes? And lastly, if we're going to create a system and ask its participants to respect eachother; shouldn't we allow all of us access to better quality education regardless of race? Why exclude yourself from being educated by paying more? You're asking us to believe that having to make 55K per year isn't worth taking 6 years of classwork?Do'h! There ain't no such things as rights. Rights were given to a man 'cause he had certain needs met. Needs got him teef cut off and made him mean. Had to give him clothes cause he came naked outa his momma's womb. Needed hair taken care of and teeth capped. Couldn't stand to look at himself without helpin' his face up. Made him sick just sittin' upright. He needed legs made strong enough to carry him forever. Was born hungry most likely (hungry means Mom didn't eat). Caught cold one night in the cabin covered with frost. Soon she'll need a house built, tight and warm. She needed shoes, new ones every pair worn through, right toes torn off. Oh well, maybe next time. Life goes fast. Sometimes faster than feet ever could run... Eat big breakfast in bed. Lunch is meatloaf with mashed potato, dinner's chicken fried steak. Next month those eating bologna will wonder about gravy. On payday buy meal ticket. Let fingers meet across the counter. Slap hands together. Buy sack of flour now that's ready to bake.... Life rolls like thunder down the road unknown. Nobody knows whats coming, nobody cares. Look forward or backward long enough.... It looks ahead..... As for your questions. Your assumption that we live under Jim Crow laws is incorrect. That's simply factually wrong. As far back as 1867 blacks have been guaranteed suffrage and the ability to vote which led to many black politicians including Booker T Washington. Both Presidents Wilson and FDR pushed hard for civil liberties (Progressive era). To suggest that a person cannot receive medical attention unless he pays taxes is ludicrous. In addition, free trade ensures job opportunities for anyone willing to take the risk and compete against international competition. Black Americans understand this and support both Democrats and Republicans depending upon policies designed to benefit African American interests. Black communities are doing quite well economically. They own businesses. Some of these businesses employ thousands of employees. Many are starting families and raising productive citizens. Education reform efforts are necessary but we must remember that Blacks still lag behind whites and Asians in educational attainment and achievement. Only 3 of elementary schools serve predominately Hispanic populations. While 22 of high schools are attended by Hispanics. And despite the disparity between minority and majority population, poverty remains higher amongst Latinos than Whites. The bottom line is that although racism exists today, it certainly doesn't exist everywhere and it certainly doesn't affect every aspect of life. Racism prevails mostly in places where political power is concentrated. However, let's not confuse it with evil intent. Ignorance of history leads to misplaced anger. Unfortunately, ignorance often breeds resentment. This contributes to divisiveness within societies. Most important, economic forces determine the level of future success. An individual can neither change nor escape fate...which ultimately determines equality or inequity. Bernie Sanders believes that 'We will continue to fight for racial justice. The issue of income and wealth distribution represents the unfinished business of the Civil Rights movement. But whenever economic issues come up, everybody always brings up the stock basket or piece ofthe real world of black persons actually trying to avoidto the re-builders of the World Banners of the Great Recessionr
