The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. For example, there are people who are born with severe facial asymmetry. They are not your fault, but they are still going to be looked at as weird and they will be judged for it.
