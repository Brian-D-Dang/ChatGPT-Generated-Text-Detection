CMV: ISIS isn't about the US, it isn't about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isn't about us, and to an extent, it isn't our responsibility to fix. The rise of extremist group like ISIS is a complicated issue that stems from a variety of factors such as political unrest, economic instability, and religious radicalism within the Muslim community. While it's true that the US military intervention in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East has played a role in exacerbating the situation and providing ISIS with a rallying cry against the West, it's also important to recognize that the roots of the problem go much deeper than that. At the end of the day, the fight against ISIS and other extremist groups must be led by the Muslim community themselves. By tackling the underlying issues that have allowed groups like ISIS to take hold, such as poverty, corruption, and political oppression, we can help to create a more stable environment where terrorist organizations are less likely to thrive. That being said, the US and other Western nations can still play an important role in helping to provide support, resources, and aid to those on the front lines of the fight against extremism. Through targeted strategies like intelligence sharing, targeted airstrikes, and diplomatic pressure, we can help to prevent the spread of ISIS and other dangerous groups without getting directly involved in a prolonged military conflict.
