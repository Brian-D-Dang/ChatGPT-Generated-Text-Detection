I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost like discovering something from another world. The properties of these superheavy elements are so different from anything we encounter in our daily lives. It's fascinating to explore how they behave and how they can potentially be used in various scientific and technological applications.
