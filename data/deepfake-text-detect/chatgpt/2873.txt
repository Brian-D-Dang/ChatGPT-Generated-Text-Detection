A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was removed. I can feel your pain... I am a Spy main and whenever someone plays Sniper (or Spy for some reason) on my team, it becomes pretty apparent very quickly just how well the game is balanced to make sure people play other classes too!
