While it's true that using the box to complete a puzzle might take away some of the challenge, everyone enjoys puzzles in their own way. For some people, completing a puzzle quickly and efficiently can be just as satisfying as meticulously working through each piece one by one. Furthermore, using the box can also make the puzzle experience more accessible for individuals with visual impairments or who struggle to differentiate between certain colors or shapes. Ultimately, puzzle-solving is all about having fun and engaging your mind, so there is no "right" or "wrong" way to complete one.
