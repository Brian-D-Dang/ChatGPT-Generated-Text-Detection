While it is true that violence can sometimes be effective in suppressing ignorance, it is not a sustainable or ethical approach to creating long-term change. Violence only begets more violence and can lead to a cycle of revenge and retaliation. Furthermore, using violence to change others' perspectives creates fear and resentment, and it is unlikely that they will genuinely embrace new ideas or value systems. A better way to address ignorance is through education, dialogue, and empathy. By listening to and understanding each other's perspectives, we can create a more peaceful and compassionate world where people are willing to learn and grow together.
