First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from an objective point of view. From an economic standpoint, the answer is yes, it might be worth it. In some cases, it could save time and money in the long run. If you are able to find a close parking spot, you can get to your destination quicker and without having to pay for public transportation or taxis. This could save you time and money depending on the situation. However, if you are looking at this purely from a financial standpoint, then it is probably not worth it. The cost of finding a close parking spot (gas, parking fees, etc.) will likely outweigh any potential savings you could make by arriving at your destination quicker. Additionally, there is no guarantee that you will be able to find a close parking spot in the first place, so it may end up costing you more than you initially thought. In conclusion, it really depends on the individual situation. If you are able to find a close parking spot, then it could be worth it, but it is probably not worth it from a purely financial standpoint.
