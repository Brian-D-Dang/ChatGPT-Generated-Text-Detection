The host country thing has run its course. Organizing the Olympic games is financially ruinous, blatantly wasteful and the procedure favors corrupt regimes willing to put themselves on the map. I understand your concerns about the financial and political implications of hosting the Olympic Games. While the competition can provide significant economic benefits and boost tourism, costs often outweigh these benefits, creating a significant burden to taxpayers of the host country. Moreover, hosting the Olympics can also become a tool for corrupt regimes to enhance their image and distract the population from other issues. However, some countries with strong democracies and transparent institutions successfully hosted the games, avoiding the risks and promoting the positive aspects of this event. Overall, it's essential to thoroughly assess the potential benefits and risks associated with hosting the Olympics, carefully evaluating the economic and political factors involved in the process.
