The goods and services we consume are made possible by the abundance of cheap resources and labour that the west gets out of underdeveloped countries. The West has no reason to deal with these countries directly, as it is able to deal with them indirectly through the third world commodity trade. The core nations do not have to pay for the economic, social and ecological externalities caused by their production processes, and they do not have to pay for the costs of maintaining infrastructure that benefits them. The nature of trade is such that the more a country imports, the more it needs to export. With so much of the global economy being based on externalities, the core countries, such as the United States and Europe, are able to maintain their standard of living without having to produce much themselves. Countries that export for the core nations can maintain their prosperity by exporting raw materials and manufactured goods to the core countries, but they can only do this if they can produce these goods at a lower cost than the core countries. The cheapest and easiest way for a country to achieve this is to export their land and labour. A country with natural resources that is not able to use those resources directly for producing goods, such as a developing country in Africa, will be at a disadvantage if it tries to compete with a country such as Canada or the United States, which have large and well developed industrial infrastructure. This is the result of the development of the underdeveloped countries by the core countries. The underdeveloped countries do not have the resources to produce the goods that they export, and they do not have the industry to produce the goods that they import. This is the reason that the underdeveloped countries export their land and labour instead of the products they produce. This is not a new phenomenon. During the era of colonialism, the West used to extract resources, such as sugar, cotton, and minerals, from underdeveloped countries and sell them back to the same countries at a higher price. This is how the West was able to export luxury goods from Europe to Africa and Asia at a price that the local population could not afford. Colonialism made sure that the underdeveloped countries were unable to produce the goods they needed, and made it impossible for them to produce the goods that they wanted. It is a widely known fact that the labour force in developed countries is able to produce a much higher standard of living than the labour force in developing countries. It is also well known that the prices of goods are based on the labour that is required to produce the goods. The cheapest products in the developed countries are those that are made in factories that do not pay their workers much. The prices of the same products in developing countries are much higher, because the factories pay their workers more. The underdeveloped countries are at a great disadvantage in this. The labour force in these countries does not have the skills to compete with the highly educated and highly skilled labour force in developed countries. As a result, the underdeveloped countries cannot produce the goods that they would need to buy at a reasonable price. They cannot afford to produce goods that would be competitive in the global market, such as luxury goods, or cars or electronics. This also means that the underdeveloped countries cannot afford to compete with the developed countries for the labour force of their own people. The underdeveloped countries are often forced to become exporters of their labour force. It is very common for developing countries to lose a large number of their labour force to the developed countries. This causes a reduction in the skill level of the labour force in the underdeveloped countries. One of the main reasons for this is the low wage rates in the developed countries. The developed countries are able to pay their workers much less, because they have a high standard of living. The developed countries also have a much higher rate of population growth than the underdeveloped countries. This means that the developed countries have a much greater demand for labour than the underdeveloped countries, which means that the underdeveloped countries are forced to export a greater proportion of their labour force to the developed countries. If the underdeveloped countries were able to maintain a higher standard of living, then their labour force would have a higher skill level. The underdeveloped countries would be able to produce a higher percentage of their own goods, and would not have to import them from the developed countries. A developed country that is able to maintain a high standard of living will have to produce less of its own goods, because it can pay for them from its own economy. The reason that the developed countries are able to pay for these goods is the export of their labour force to the underdeveloped countries. One of the most important reasons for this is the exchange rate. The exchange rate determines how much a country has to pay for a certain amount of its imports.
