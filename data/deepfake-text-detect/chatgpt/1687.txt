I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be right or wrong for them (within certain lines of course). Maybe they don't know the line? But until you do understand this one little thing, all moral guidelines are useless as a guide to how we should live our lives... Because there has never been an instance in history when morals went out of style and changed with the times.
