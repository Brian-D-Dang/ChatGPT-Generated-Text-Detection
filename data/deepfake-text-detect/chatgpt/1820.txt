People seem to feel right now that Sanders is just not well-known enough to even have a chance at the presidency, and that it will stay that way. Everyone has their own opinions on who they think should be running for president in 2016 instead of him (I'm with you though). Personally I don't see how an unknown politician can win when there are so many more people giving it a shot than he'll ever get his hands on... Just because Hillary isn't known doesn't mean she's guaranteed to lose - by all accounts her campaign could come from behind and pull ahead or she might make some missteps which cause her lead to dwindle.
