I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. What Republican MP said to me really struck a chord: "I think a lot of people have come to realize the Republican Party is more extreme than they thought."
