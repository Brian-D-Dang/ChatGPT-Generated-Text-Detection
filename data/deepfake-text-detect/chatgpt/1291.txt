If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is probably more useful than the standard GermanDutch route of self-learning a foreign language and it's still within your budget for this year's holidays (though certainly not next). I'm at Uni whilst studying an A level French course so I've already learnt French over 4 years! But I wouldn't mind trying some Spanish as well because my SO has Catalan family in Spain?!
