Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions (and, in some cases, even bad ones). But the current culture war is different in a couple of major ways: First off, there's no real consensus about what the "right" things are to do on certain issues. Second, as we all know, liberalism has been discredited for years now - chiefly because it hasn't delivered anything useful since JFK was president. Thus any attempt at progressive social change without fighting against conservatism will end up being seen as just another wasted effort. Which brings us back to 1 above...as long as you don't play into our hands!
