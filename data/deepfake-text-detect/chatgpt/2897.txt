tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to football, basketball and baseball (the three most important ones), I usually know who's playing each week in advance. Now what makes the NFL so much better than other professional leagues is that there are only 16 teams making the playoffs. That means any team can win on any given Sunday. No one is ever supposed to be really good or bad. It just depends upon what happens on any specific day of the year. And I think that's why people get into watching those games.I love the fact that no one is expected to win during the course of any particular contest. A lot of folks say they like college ball because everybody plays all four quarters. But I've noticed something about the people who talk this way: They're fans of schools whose success has been mostly recent anyway. When was the last time Alabama played LSU for the National Championship again? It hasn't happened since 2008! Yet, these same fans will tell me how closely matched their two programs are now compared with 10 years ago. I call bullshit. If both sides were equally strong at the same times throughout history, the matchups wouldn't have mattered once college kids grew up. Of course they'd have liked to see them play back then too...but not necessarily against each other.
