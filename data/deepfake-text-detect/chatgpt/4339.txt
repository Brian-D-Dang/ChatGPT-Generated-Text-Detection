Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the hiker survives and is left with little to no scars on their bodies; however, what happens when this does not happen? What would you do if you were attacked by a bear? Where could you go for help? Is it possible that these bears will kill me before I get there? What should I be expecting from my attacker? How can I protect myself? Should I run away? How much damage does running around do to me in terms of injury?
