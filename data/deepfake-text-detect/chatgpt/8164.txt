From his personality to the way he handled Southern Succession there is nothing to dislike about him. He had intelligent, moderate religious views, he was compassionate and held the moral high ground in many ways - but it seemed like a well balanced prayer life for sure! Is this man who I am looking at?.................................Nope!! Well that's OK then because my prayers are more focussed on someone else anyway!!!:-
