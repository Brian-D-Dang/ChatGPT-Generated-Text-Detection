I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the right thing to do (or don't do). So why does everybody have different ideas of morals when someone tells them they're wrong? Normally, if you learn something new and find yourself wanting more than anything in life...you'd eventually want to get your hands on every single book ever written by as many authors as possible. And this is exactly how we got a lot of our knowledge from: owning books, getting into libraries and such. Its all based upon people sharing their experiences with other people which has been passed down through generations because they believe its valuable information. We may disagree about certain things but we still share much value as humans so we should respect each-others opinions even though they might differ slightly from yours for whatever reason. For example, nobody really thinks our culture or society is good today anymore and most people agree that it sucks. But there are still those who love it; maybe it makes them feel safe, comfortable, happy, loved, admired etc.? Who knows?! Ones opinion can't mean all that matters since we all live in different circumstances and backgrounds but it doesn't matter, that person has an opinion nonetheless and others will see himher as being ignorant about these issues which leads me into my next point, heres some quotes taken from Memories Of A Different Life (1995): Quote: In fact, I have developed a strong feeling now - that being black means one's entire personality becomes molded around trying to imitate white people while remaining completely oblivious to personality traits within the black community itself... As far as racism goes, I am afraid it cannot be overcome in spite of all efforts made towards changing attitudes toward blacks.[1] My girlfriend came from a very loving home with her parents and siblings of course she loves them like hell! She hates it here and feels trapped and miserable because she cant go back home without losing everything she worked hard for. Her reality simply isn't ours. It's kinda depressing. I've always felt a little guilty about this situation, i mean who wouldn't hate living somewhere they were unwanted? I know plenty of people from Europe who moved over to America only to make tons of money, travel and experience exotic destinations whereas us normal Americans barely manage to pay rent let alone save up enough money to visit places outside of NY or Florida! What did we get ourselves into? My whole family left Ireland 20 years ago when I was 6 and never looked back. They wanted better opportunities in America than working with their hands making shoes or clothes etc.... Since then nothing has changed except that now I'm stuck too! Anyway, my girlfriend obviously suffers, hesitates about going back despite knowing how horrible it is.. Those poor children that end up living in orphanages after growing up in a house full of love... Its disgusting no doubt, yet she won't listen!!! But hey, recent studies show that 70 of American kids born in poverty grow up to become millionaires[2]. At least thats good news. If that statistic holds true then why shouldn't somebody leave his country and try another place out? Lets face it, if millions of people can make it easy for themselves regardless of class, race, religion sex orientation anything else then whats keeping all these downtrodden losers like myself at home? The answer seems pretty obvious, and also im sure my girlfriend could explain herself well enough once again. It's interesting reading articles comparing multiple religions because sometimes I read stuff that pushes my beliefs further away from mine, although I'm naturally inclined to atheism, i dont mind discussing religion because like michael said above "its all relative." For example Christianity puts rules and regulations on peoples lives that Jesus himself didnt follow himself so why put so much pressure on us Christians to copy his actions? That sounds stupid to say I admit but thats what I've come across while searching for answers online. Im thinking of starting a blog soon to add my own thoughts on topics related to faith, spirituality and philosophy and perhaps contributing to discussions revolving around the same. Anyone interested? Let me know. "Me: You look cute when you're angry." Basti: "You sound insane when you question my cuteness!" There are plenty of reasons why people would leave countries like Syria or Somalia but lack of opportunity here in AMERICA is definitely one big factor for leaving IMO! Children being killed for sport and schools bombing innocent civilians is terrible! Blaming the victim instead of the perpetrator makes sense to me but I guess sometimes when bad shit happens there will always be blame. And I realize that ALL of this is based off MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION! Regardless, anybody interested please comment and tell me! Comments welcome!!:) Thanks guys and gals! God bless ya'll!
