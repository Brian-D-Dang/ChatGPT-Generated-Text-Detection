I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites for information about the company's customers (using Python). My question is: what would be some good resources that teach people how you can go from knowing nothing of these subjects into creating their own projects with them? Would this involve maths as well or just programming concepts such like array manipulation etc.? If there are any booksresources on specific topics then they'd also work too!...Or if anyone has something interesting he could share regarding his experiences being self-taught practically without doing formal schooling courses first.. Thanks very much:) It seems many real world applications require algorithms which do not exist yet - so one needs quite an understanding before finding out whether certain problems have been solved by others already
