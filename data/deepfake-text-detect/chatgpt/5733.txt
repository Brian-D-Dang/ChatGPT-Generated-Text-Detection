From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on social issues. They tend to lean left in their politics and are supportive of a wide variety of social justice and minority causes. The second faction tends to focus on the economy. They are usually more pro-business and are supportive of deregulation and market economies. The two factions are diametrically opposed on a host of issues. The first faction wants to raise taxes on the rich, push for higher minimum wages, legalize marijuana, impose stricter gun control laws, pass stricter laws to protect the environment, and make abortion more accessible. The second faction wants to lower taxes on the rich, cut the minimum wage, loosen gun control laws, and drill for more oil. If you are in the first faction and you are reading this, I don't need to tell you about how you are a complete idiot. You're probably already completely aware of that fact. I'm not going to do anything that can contribute to the feeling that you're an idiot. You're probably a minority liberal, and I'm very sympathetic to your plight. I am, however, going to explain why the second faction is a complete idiot. I want to make sure you are aware of that fact. If you are in the second faction, I'm going to need to start with a bit of background. The second faction is largely conservative, pro-business, and laissez faire. The members of the second faction are also predominantly white. Their political philosophy is a distillation of the ideals of the Founding Fathers. They want to return to the Constitution, which they believe is a blueprint for liberty and equality. They believe that government is best when it is small and the economy is best when it is left to the free market. They also believe that the United States was a beacon of liberty and equality for all people, and that the country has drifted from its founding principles over the course of the last few decades. The second faction is primarily white and male, but they are open to expanding the group. In fact, the second faction is open to all races and all genders. The second faction is open to anyone who believes in the ideals of the Founding Fathers and that the country needs to return to the Constitution. The only thing that limits membership is that the country needs to return to the Constitution. They're open to you if you're a woman, black, Latino, Asian, or gay. They're open to you if you're a libertarian, a socialist, a pacifist, a union member, or a Republican. They're open to you if you're a Democrat, a Green, an independent, or a member of the Tea Party. The only thing that the second faction is not open to is anyone who does not believe that the Constitution is a blueprint for liberty and equality. If you are in the second faction and you are reading this, you probably already know that you're an idiot. You probably already know that you have been hoodwinked by the first faction. You probably already know that you have been duped. You probably already know that you're the reason that this country is being torn apart by racial strife, that you're the reason for widening income inequality, that you're the reason for a crumbling infrastructure, and that you're the reason for a disintegrating education system. The first faction is trying to convince you that you are an idiot. They are trying to convince you that you are a fool. They are trying to convince you that you are a stooge. They are trying to convince you that you are a dupe. They are trying to convince you that you are a mark. The first faction is trying to convince you that you're a fool for thinking that the Constitution is a blueprint for liberty and equality. The first faction is not happy that you are white, or male, or straight, or conservative, or Republican. They're not happy that you are rich, or educated, or own your own home. They're not happy that you are a member of the Tea Party, or the Libertarian Party, or the Republican Party. They're not happy that you are a conservative, a Christian, or an independent. They're not happy that you are a social conservative, a fiscal conservative, or a libertarian. They're not happy that you are
