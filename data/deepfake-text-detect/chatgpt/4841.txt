Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to 15hour. While many would like to see this happen the question becomes what does it mean for people who work in restaurants? According to studies done on wages paid by fast food companies overall including McDonalds, Wendy's, Burger King etc., they have found that workers are making anywhere from 28 (in some cases) over 100 an hour! That is insane right?! So if you get your pay rate up as high as 50 per hr or so how do you keep your quality of life at those rates especially when you consider all the taxes taken out by employers? For me personally I make 80 - 90hrs but barely manage that due to bills not living within my means, housing costs everything else... Now if we were talking about someone working full time for say only 2 months can we really call them "working poor"? As far as I'm concerned there's no such thing. You don't need 3 jobs while also paying rent utilities just to be able to live comfortably. But then again, perhaps I am wrong and maybe it could work for others as well however not everyone is willing nor capable of selling their labor power for below market value. Does anyone know any good articles or anything that discusses this issue further besides the ones mentioned above? Any thoughts on other issues related to wages lower than minimum wage would be appreciated too since these also affect the lives of individuals. Thanks!! The first several questions should not read: "how low can the minimum wage go?" The reason why is because the answer will always eventually end up being zero. If you understand basic economics, you'll realize that; the more money employers give you, the less inclined you become towards doing the same job. This is called supplydemand, and usually follows a downward sloping curve. Thus, if you're asking whether the maximum amount of income you can receive is dependent upon the cost of living, you've missed one very important point completely, which is the factor of scarcity. In short, once society has enough capital goods (i.e.: houses), there won't be anybody left begging for alms. Therefore, the answer to your question is effectively answered already: two hundred bucks an hour isn't going to happen. Now let us talk about affordability which, whilst slightly difficult, is ultimately much stronger reasoning behind minimum wage debates. First off, consider the fact that nobody gets paid 100 hours a week. What usually happens instead is we divide our total compensation into smaller chunks throughout each day, or even faster, sometimes every five minutes. Take stock brokers for example: Their salaries are generally guaranteed through bonuses. However, one might argue that it probably wouldn't take a whole lot of foresight to figure out that the risk reward ratio doesn't skew exactly that way. Even without bonus clauses, the vast majority of employees still choose to stay in employment voluntarily. They must therefore appreciate the safety net provided by said employer in order to continue working. Then look at the real estate industry and ask yourself if they actually earn hundreds of dollars an hour. When the average salary for young professionals isn't in triple digits, could it really come close to matching the purchasing power afforded simply by renting a place near downtown Manhattan? And yet, the entire US economy revolves around having cheap real-estate, based purely on demand to own land verses supply of land. Yet somehow we expect low skilled laborers to be perfectly contented despite maintaining meager incomes? It seems that in the age where millions of people cannot afford college tuition, it comes down to the simple idea of rewarding meritocracy rather than political opinion. Regardless, I feel pretty confident in stating that if we were to raise the minimum wage significantly, literally nothing would change except for the possibility of forcing business owners to adjust accordingly. Let's assume that during this adjustment period, unemployment shoots upwards. Which raises another topic altogether: DISMANTLE THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM. There's a reason why China and India employ such ridiculously flexible policies regarding their workforce. Both countries recognize the importance of creating opportunities for unskilled laborers to acquire skills before starting their career path. Of course, in America we tend to view things differently; we aren't interested in giving second chances to people looking for entry level positions. We want the best talent available regardless of prior experience. Periodically, we shock ourselves though by discovering that thousands of unemployed Americans are willing to jump at taking whatever crappy job offers there may currently be spots open for. Where we find "lazy" people today, we'll soon discover hard-working entrepreneurs tomorrow. Still, until a system similar to that implemented in Asia exists, we shouldn't pretend that the current state of affairs makes sense. At least not anymore than pretending that eating a bowl of cereal everyday is healthy. Finally, let's address something else before jumping back onto the previous argument: poverty. Throughout history, organized governments almost universally created a pau n order to provide its services would retroactively true, and thus add degree of successtestb'levid' testingsystem, and 'gitt
