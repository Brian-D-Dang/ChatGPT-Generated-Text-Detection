I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. All he did is drive his vehicle onto private property and refuse to leave; that should never be a crime anywhere with freedom being one of the most fundamental rights we have as Americans (which already get trampled by some fairly ridiculous laws). If you're going to try to argue at least back up your claims...
