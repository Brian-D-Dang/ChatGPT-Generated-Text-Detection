Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data] . In the comments, a lot of people ask why we don't have greater education funding for higher education. To be clear, I am not saying it's wrong to focus on technology. Rather, what I'm asking is why aren't we doing better if these things are sustainable? Is it because we've never been taught how? Or is it because we're too concerned about the results? Perhaps we need to look at our educational system and see where we have invested money in it - how does it affect our lives? Many of us feel that it doesn't matter much when technology becomes obsolete or in some cases, replaced by a different one. This needs to change. As more graduates head out to college, most of them will start working remotely until they reach their final year. That means sooner rather than later. It also means that we now know that the future is looming over students who drop out before graduation without any idea whether they'll stay home or go elsewhere. The gap between the financial aid available (the 1,000 per student option) and the amount of cash available (1,000-2,500 per semester) comes down as soon as the amount of knowledge gained can be shared with other professionals. I think it would take far less to implement an approach so that the number of graduates who graduate after graduating is much smaller. I agree. Unfortunately for me, I had no choice but to do a bit of research into both tech and the economic impact of this shift. There were several websites which made great use of the links suggested here, including my own blog about the subject . However, none have really provided any real numbers or any "data" analysis or information about the success of technology. There are many examples of people claiming their life expectancy should be cut from 40 years to 25 years and others suggesting a reduction of 5 years. But I fear that this won't happen within the next five years unless we get real data that shows that the effect will be lasting longer than that. In short: What really mattered in these early days of social media was the quality of content. Whether you loved it or hated it, all of the content you saw online could influence your decisions about what content to share. If all that content was bad enough then everyone else would be too. A small percentage of those who went through these phases moved on either permanently or were forced to leave due to illness. Kids who left school soon after starting work wanted to come back to school; parents who worked full time for the rest of their careers wanted to keep kids going. Sadly, it isn't necessarily the internet that changed the world as such. Our history and today's reality also fundamentally changes how people view the future. Technology makes it easy to access information, but instead of having a big database of content you have to search through thousands of articles and find what you like. People usually want content that's relevant, fast, funny, interesting and objective. And, clearly, that content is irrelevant. The problem is that content isn't important anymore. There's too much politics involved. We often forget to connect now - at least that's what Twitter was used to when the election was being held. Obviously, there was strong support for the move towards the 'digital age' as a whole, but the evidence points to the fact that it didn't happen overnight. So I wouldn't say it hasn't happened yet. It's actually quite possible for technology to play a significant role in driving the way people live. Of course, we probably shouldn't expect our society to automatically adapt quickly, but the window is long to respond anyway. When I started teaching in high school, it took nearly three decades to teach all of my classes about computers before we could learn anything about how humans communicate.
