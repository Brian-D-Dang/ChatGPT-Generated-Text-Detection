I'm a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find sillytrivial. I'm currently dating a girl who is a self-described "red piller." That said i think men can be feminists too if they believe in equality between genders... (i don't really know how it works though) just like you guys could call yourselves gay or straight based on your orientation..etc etc (again sorry for using that example haha). Or maybe its more personal than political? Anyway my point here was to ask why does feminism have such an awful reputation online among males when we are both fighting against gender inequality anyway? It's bizarre because this same argument applies equally well toward homosexuality aswell except no one has any problem calling themselfs homophobic so whats up?!
