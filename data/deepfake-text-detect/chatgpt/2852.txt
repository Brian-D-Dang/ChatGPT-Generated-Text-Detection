I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually rich as fuck and don't need a scholarship, which means they're not putting themselves through college and will probably be way more biased about their financial situation than somebody going to community college or state university because there's nothing else for them in life besides money I think this would definitely change if everyone went to public school You can get loans thru private institutions too
