Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not their tips, but why are people so reluctant when tipping? (I don't work fast food) Edit: thanks for all the input! Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly It isn't ever really meant as an incentive either, it is just standard practice. If you want to reward someone or show appreciation then give them something extra afterwards.
