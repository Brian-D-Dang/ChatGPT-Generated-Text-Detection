I recently saw a video on why the Republicans [can't win] the 2016 election. If we go by raw numbers, Hillary will most likely win the next election. This got me thinking about it and I knew that the election wouldn't be in the rosy light of day but it was never going to happen because of this partisan bias," said Keating. "If we had the Democrats participating in the Democrat National Convention, Hillary would have won easily." Keating's analysis also noted that if Trump defeated Hillary Clinton they'd all voted for Trump except for Republican nominee Donald Trump who admitted during his campaign that he would not vote for the Party leader compared to Democrats who hold him accountable over his treatment of women which Keating called an insult to voters' rights. According to Keating, Trump has proven himself incapable of being trusted with these issues despite his promises to serve as President based solely on his supporters preferred policies such as allowing gambling, expanding healthcare, lowering taxes, recognizing LGBTQ people and establishing equal pay.
