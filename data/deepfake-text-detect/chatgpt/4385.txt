White girls very rarely date Asian men. Even in Asia white men are much more popular than Asian men. Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white women he will end up dating his ethnicity, which is usually his race as well since this has been the norm here on earth and probably most places like it including all of humanity. But whites do not prefer Asians so there should be no need to go out of your way or risk any kind of rejection when trying to find real love with someone who shares a similar cultural background. In Japan many of the country's citizens would rather die then date Japanese men because they believe one day their children might turn into those kinds of people. There are plenty of examples where parents rejected sonsdaughters just married too young, especially if the marriage was later annulled by a court case. In modern times both sides can see what happened but don't want to admit that their son or daughter ended up marrying some other man so they try to pass off these situations as failed marriages. They're really not failures at all even if they could help it. It's also true that parents often prefer having daughters instead of sons. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't date them either! If society doesn't accept them, maybe that means us westerners are doing something wrong. We know we aren't always right but we still keep making rules based on our own culture and history without thinking about how it affects others. Sunil Kalaichandran likes to get drunk and fucked by groupies on tour followed by going home and playing video games alone. While he enjoys being single, he finds it difficult to meet quality females back home. His last girlfriend divorced him after she found out that he had fathered a child. He isn't interested in getting back together with her. When asked why he hasn't come across as promiscuous from his previous relationships, he replies, "Because I'm gay. You guys think straight sex is better and easier than fucking another dude but I've seen my friends fail miserably at it. It just takes time and effort working around things. The best part of sleeping with me is not knowing if you'll make it through the night."
