I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that are running or even against the government... The most common attack is Iranians to vote for Ahmadinejad...this type of propaganda appeared when he was announced as president elect on november 3rd 2009. The media reported it right away with all sort of sources like BBC,Aljazeera,etc.. And now they're repeating them 5 years later. So far all these attacks were successful because people really believed what the news made us believe about Iran's popularity among the world's population. But you have to think twice before believing everything your hear from someones mouth or read on a internet website. For instance just couple days ago one guy said that he will never support any party after seeing his friend (a very good man) who was murdered by the police during election time in 2008 (he voted green). Suddenly the same day another person posted an article saying that green supporters killed their own candidate and terrorized others! So do not take anything blindly unless someone tells you "that's my personal opinion":)... Because if they say "That's true," then you should be very careful! At least we both heard what the real story is in our conversation so go figure out which side is more credible? In fact i remember there is a big debate between different political groups regarding whether the new Iranian elections laws should be allowed at all or not. Most here agree is quite ridiculous although the majority of people still prefer free life over being under control and living religiously!! The problem is too much freedom allows people to get carried away without consideration...not enough things for survival..which has its pros and cons obviously.... In order to balance everything and make sure everyone gets what they need,the state should intervene into peoples lives somehow. There's also a lot of differences in religions. Some strict ones would probably allow only old religion based charecteristics while others may also want modern values like democracy, equality etc.. Iranians can start thinking about something else besides politics since nothing seems to work anymore...... Islam: Sharia law isn't always helpful. It goes against human rights, women's rights, children's rights...whereas secularism respects those freedoms.Sharia Law - "An act of legislation dealing primarily with religious matters that prescribes religious duties such as prayer, fasting, almsgiving; the ritual purity of Muslims; Islamic marriages and divorce; Muslim burial practices; the process of conversion to Islam [and] inheritance issues."Wikipedia Islamic Republic Of Iran - A non-secular democratic country with a constitution established by God himselfThe Ayatollah Khomeini represents this movementVery peaceful and respectful towards women (females aren't subject to forced hijab and veiling rules), tolerant towards minorities, gay, atheist...very middle of road compared to fundamentalist IslamistsMost popularly known for revolutionizing education system by allowing females to attend universitiesMale smoking banned, drinking alcohol prohibitedYou'll notice the signs written in Farsi (Persian language) It's actually pretty difficult to enforce a ban on drinkingsmoking amongst students especially considering that American students are already doing it surreptitiously.Dubai - Not exactly badThis city is 'enveloped' so none outside won't bother visitingThe Dubai Mall is massive! 9.Election fraud - it happens everywhere.Be wary of 'election observers' and watch out for voter intimidationBy definition, an observer is a neutral third party. Asking independent people to monitor every voting booth sounds fine, until you realize that the United States hired international liaison officers as part of the U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq earlier this year. These guys had been trained by the CIA. They worked closely with Iraqi intelligence services. That means that two thirds of the monitoring teams included individuals whose parent organization turned thumbs down upon the Bush administration back home. This is hardly reassuring.If you suspect irregularities, tell authorities immediately. If you observe fraud, file a report. But don't wait till November 1st - file your reports yesterday. Start paying attention to what's going on around you. Check online blogs, local newspapers, television stations. Stay informed. 10.What does Democracy look like?It looks like an election where the winner is determined through universal suffrage and secret ballots. That doesn't leave room for fraud. Candidates must run unopposed. Everyone who meets legal qualifications qualifies to cast a ballot. Each registered voter gets only one ballot. Ballots cannot be endorsed. Only citizens 18 and older vote. Voters check off choices on paper ballots and deposit them in sealed boxes. Votes are counted within 24 hours by professionally trained, impartial auditors sitting behind closed doors. Winners declare victory according to official tallies. 11.Elections are expensive ...Why use private markers For public polls A mersidervernatchin an entry areaattesting that suffers great effectivenamperging in succession
