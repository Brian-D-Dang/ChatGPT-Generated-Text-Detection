Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent people, and their deaths are still being felt today. 2. Nuclear weapons have the potential for killing millions more people (and possibly billions). This is the argument used by proponents of nuclear arms control - if we cannot negotiate with terrorists then maybe it's time to use force to stop terrorism! I think that while the first point may sound good at first hearing. There are two major problems. First the fact that there was no negotiation prior to dropping those bombs. Second, even if you claim to not believe that the US did anything wrong during the bombing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki...it wasn't an accident. It was intentional "evil" meaning intentionally causing death through purposeful error. The intent behind these bombings is clear as day in the statements made after the bombings.
