Every election year this is one of the most popular complaints against candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. "So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so what?" A recent study has found that while politicians do talk a lot about their policies on paper - such as tax cuts or increased spending - they are rarely able to explain them in plain English without an interpreter in public speeches. And when it comes down to talking specifics in debates with other campaigns' party leaders, politicians often don't even bother; simply repeating their existing rhetoric again and again makes all parties look more consistent than any real difference between themselves. The same goes for TV interviews where there might be just enough time at the end before the next commercial break for someone else to ask questions. That leaves voters with lots of unanswered (and therefore unanswerable) questions after elections, which makes it easy for politicians from right across the spectrum to pick up support by claiming otherwise.
