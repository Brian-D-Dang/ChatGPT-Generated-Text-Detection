Generally speaking, you have two sides on the "Fat Debate": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, then hide behind a shield of secrecy). So who's right? I think that both are. There is no doubt that obesity has negative effects but there should also be some kind of social respect for those humans who choose to eat themselves to death or as part of their culturetradition whatever they decide to do with it..
