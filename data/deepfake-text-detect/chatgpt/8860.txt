I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot someone? The answer is simple: they don't want to be in law enforcement. Most of their time is spent trying to make a situation better for themselves. They are either mentally ill, depressed, disoriented, paranoia, etc. - so it's not like they're just they doing what they do because they're scared that they will embarrass the authorities. If you think cops are dumb enough to shoot over 50 of their victims who they believe were "assholes," then you should probably go to your local police department (or whichever one has the most open records laws regarding guns). That's where I see no reason for them to trust the rest of us people for our actions. They shouldn't allow themselves to become names of their enemies while they try to cover up their crimes. Yes, but they also need to know that some police departments take good care of their communities, and sometimes even hire people to help out with things. If these police officers would simply do what they should do in order to save lives, we wouldn't see all this outrage. It might actually be worse if there was more courage from non-police than us, as they already get paid by the officers, but they give nothing back to us. Not much else can be done other than wait until the next election cycle to come out on them.
