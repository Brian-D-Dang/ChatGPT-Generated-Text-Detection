This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... I was a major supporterpromoter (for various reasons) in GamerGate. It made me very angry when all that came out about them turned into something so bad for gamers! My whole issue is how it's been used as an attack against women geeks who are trying desperately not behind or overshadowed by men with money pushing their "brand" down our throats... while being completely blindsided themselves using methods like baiting people online calling us trolls just because we disagree? And then making up fake tweets mocking feminists!! No wonder many hardcore gaming fans have left GG forums after learning what really went wrong there..... You can't expect much from someone whose entire business model depends upon charming rich guys telling him they should get everything done quickly without doing any actual research first!!! LOL!!!!
