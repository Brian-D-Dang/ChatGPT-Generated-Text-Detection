So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training and there's funding, but still... It would be like if the city council decided to invest in fire trucks because firefighters were doing an awesome job on their own (and getting community support). Firefighters are paid well enough where one or two people can keep up with them 247
