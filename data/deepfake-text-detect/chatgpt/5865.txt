Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me, because as I see it there are no solutions..... I am interested in your opinions on this matter The object I have been following for the past few years is called WT1190F. It is currently 1000x larger than the Chelyabinsk meteorite that hit Russia in 2013. It is also more than 100x larger than the object that caused the Tunguska event in 1908. There is an old quote from a guy named G.K. Chesterton, about how "a thing has been going on for so long, that it must be a thing" - this quote has been used in relation to that quote for more than 60 years, and for good reason. Just because a thing has been going on for a long time does not mean that it must be a thing, nor does it mean that it can't be stopped. The first step is to be aware that this is a thing that is going on. As far as I am aware, there is no planetary defence department to deal with it, and I don't expect there ever will be. There are a few other people who have been writing about this problem, and one of them is Chris Koehler. I am writing about this problem because I see it as the most important issue facing humanity, and I want to highlight the risk, as well as the lack of understanding of the problem that exists. I have been following the large objects for a long time now, and I have also been following the general space debris issue for a while as well. If we look at a good picture of Earth taken from space, it is a beautiful planet. If we zoom in on a single country, it is also a very beautiful place, and if we zoom in even more, it is a beautiful landscape, and if we zoom in even more, it is a beautiful house, and if we zoom in even more, it is a beautiful flower, and if we zoom in even more, it is a beautiful bee. If we look at the universe, it is a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular part of the universe, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular planet, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular country, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular landscape, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular house, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular flower, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if we zoom in on a particular bee, it is also a very big place, and if
