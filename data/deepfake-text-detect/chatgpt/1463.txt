EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one reason why we've not seen the same level of pushback as on other issues is that this issue has been around for so long; it's a very easy topic to get people riled up over, whereas climate changeglobal warming appears new or "as if" (compared to things like gay marriage) most people are more comfortable with those issues because they're less controversial than gun control, which also can cause controversy. I'm sure there was uproar when Obama wanted to pass something about guns early in his administration though, right?
