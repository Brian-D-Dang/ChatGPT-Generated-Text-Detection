I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit card debt who wants a gun right after hearing her story run for political office. It's also completely ridiculous and unfair to assume this man will buy an AK-47 because he had 110th the money as she did. He may or may not have been buying guns illegally (or just by mail order), but good luck hunting down anyone on the internet if you are looking for them! Also, if his mother was so opposed to handguns, why would she want him to shoot any kind? The only possible explanation I can think of is that he wanted to collect all sorts of weapons - which isn't really allowed under existing law anyway unless you go through proper channels (which he didn't). There might be some other reason close enough, but I don't understand how one could conclude anything about his intentions based on her claimed fears regarding firearms being used against others. That's like assuming every woman gets raped because there were people walking around at night wearing short skirts. Actually, we'd probably need to know more than "he has issues" before making such sweeping assumptions. So far, your most compelling evidence appears to simply show that she's afraid for everyone else out there when no person has proven otherwise except herself. We do tend to take things for granted these days, especially since TV news seems to favor sensationalist stories over hard facts. It's easy to assume that everything bad happens off camera rather than on screen or for sale online. However, last year the US government released their own study showing that 99 of recorded violent crimes took place within 2 miles of home residences. Do you suppose those statistics include incidents where legal guns were reported stolen, carried away in purses, stuffed into cars along with spare change and candy bars, etc.? No matter what opinions we have here, something does seem wrong with claiming that someone wouldn't get shot if they couldn't afford one. Take note that Americans now carry an average of three or four legal concealed weapon permits per resident. For comparison, Finland today has a total population slightly larger than our country yet they have only one permit for each citizen, compared with our current ratio of one permit for 248 million residents. If carrying licensed handguns was inherently dangerous, then surely such fantastically high ratios must indicate that armed citizens pose little risk to criminals. But I'm sure many will disagree. The problem goes both ways however. An unarmed victim still has very few options available to defend themselves while gun owners feel free to brandish their weapons without fear of repercussions. A better solution would involve more sensible education programs across society. We cannot expect people to voluntarily disarm. Besides, if we make owning a firearm illegal, criminals won't stop trying to steal legally owned ones either. They'll keep their money hidden until they figure out another way to purchase guns except maybe stealing them outright. Even today, due to stringent laws which require fingerprints prior to purchasing firearms, crime victims often choose not to report the theft of their property. Perhaps we shouldn't blame the shooter for his actions; perhaps we should instead ask ourselves whether we're willing to lose our liberties to become safer. After considering my own personal safety concerns, I decide that yes, I live among reasonable risks which outweigh the gain of added safety brought about by outlawing certain types of firearms in public places for self defense purposes. So basically you've gotten yourself convinced that privacy rights aren't worth much anymore, even though police departments can already access surveillance footage from cameras placed throughout major cities without requiring a warrant. And somehow, calling yourself 'an upstanding member' makes you worthy of further protection despite having none whatsoever. Sorry, but I hope you enjoy the fine print and ten years later find yourself living in a nation founded upon principles of liberty. Otherwise, welcome to 1984. This is exactly why the NRA exists...to educate proper use and handling of arms. To help spread awareness. Not to turn children into killers. Look at the difference between video games vs reality killers....it's amazing. In real life, parents teach kids responsibility early and informally. In mass shootings, parents allow 15 year olds unrestricted possession of AR15s. You said you thought it was sad that the father gave permission, but hey, lets see, its O J Simpson involved in some murder thingy, yet I guess he wasn't doing too bad with his parenting skills. Are you going to demonize his youngest daughter as well? Yes, no doubt he should not have done this. What about his oldest son, was he a criminal growing up? Did he ever attend school where he learned about responsible gun ownership? This guy grew up shooting deer boars. His dad taught him respect for guns and made him ensure he put back ALL loaded shells inside the barrels chambers of rifles. As far as using ammo clips to separate rounds: the dad also instructed him NOT to play cops and robbers w friends during activities, thus leaving the old value grid plan produced? limit range set for primitively id?of upper end repeatable values to became?"
