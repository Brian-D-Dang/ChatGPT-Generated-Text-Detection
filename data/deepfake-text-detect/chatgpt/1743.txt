I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still think it was inappropriate to interrupt and disrupt his entire rally because they felt as though he didn't listen enough to them during the campaign season. My friend however explained how important it is for candidates to hear people out...to not just be "listening" but also talking back! While this may seem like common sense to some we are very different from normal Americans when it comes to politics or even our everyday lives. We often argue over trivial things that could easily be resolved if one person would just talk instead of yelling at each other about why someone else's way isn't better than anothers!! Yet many feel so strongly on both sides of any issue that there can never truly be compromise or understanding - only anger. It takes two to tango? No problem- let me cut you off mid sentence SO YOU CAN'T SAY YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY!!!!
