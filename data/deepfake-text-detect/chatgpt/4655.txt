Theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying doesn't do that. Economic efficiency average happiness: violating the individual rights to be unharmed and free would not increase overall economic efficiency (by definition). It's only a matter of time before some merchants notice their sales are down, so they decide to sue you. They could claim your customers were targeted by malicious software - but this is akin to saying "If God did it then I have nothing to fear." There was no logical way for them to know if that was true or not. It certainly didn't look like there had been any hacking involved. As far as I'm aware, in most countries around the world the law does require companies selling goods through online websites to screen out hacked accounts which are set up with stolen credit card information. Obviously this isn't foolproof...but it limits the damage potential to a relatively small amount of money.
