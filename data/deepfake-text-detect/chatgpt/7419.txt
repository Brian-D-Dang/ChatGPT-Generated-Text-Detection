I understand your opinion, but I would like to offer a counter-argument. While both Anti-GMOers and Anti-Vaxxers may have a shared mistrust of science and technology, the issues at hand are distinct and separate. GMOs and vaccines are fundamentally different in terms of their impact on human health and the environment. GMOs are modified crops designed to resist pests and herbicides, reducing the need for harmful pesticides and increasing crop yields. While there are concerns about the long-term effects on the environment, the scientific consensus supports the safety of GMOs for human consumption. Vaccines, on the other hand, are designed to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and have been shown to dramatically decrease rates of illness and death. The widespread adoption of vaccines has been crucial in the eradication of deadly diseases such as smallpox and the near-eradication of polio. Therefore, while some may share similar beliefs about science and technology, it is unfair and inaccurate to equate Anti-GMOers with Anti-Vaxxers. The two issues have different implications for human health and the environment, and should be considered separately.
