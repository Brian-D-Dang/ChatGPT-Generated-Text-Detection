While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems. I believe that if we as a people are able to take such action, then so can the animals and plants on this planet. I have spent most my life in this type of environment and had many experiences here. Back when I was little, the worst thing about being a deer hunter is getting shot by some idiot who thought they were supposed to be hunting in the woods. Then there's the random dogs and cats you get killed for playing or running around. There are also big dogs from other species who come into your field of vision and start mauling everything which will make you run like hell back home. In that sense, I think I might agree with you; it wouldn't surprise me at all if we did see an increase in animal abuse in this era because humans are more focused than ever before. However, I don't know how feasible it is to implement said "do not hunt" order just yet...but I do know that it certainly isn't something we should overlook.
