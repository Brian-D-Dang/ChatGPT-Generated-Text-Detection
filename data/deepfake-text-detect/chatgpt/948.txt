To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going I am a lesbian, and I am happy that same-sex marriage can now be legalized. But I do not support gay marriage, and I am not a woman.
