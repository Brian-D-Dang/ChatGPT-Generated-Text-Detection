I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends That's okay! Everyone has different tastes, and it's perfectly fine if you don't enjoy coffee as much as others. There are plenty of other beverages that you may enjoy, such as tea, hot chocolate, or even flavored water or juice. It's important to find what you enjoy and stick to it, rather than trying to force yourself to like something just because others do.
