To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting there myself (I was born in 1980), since we are doing the AP Reading and Comprehension course this year it's something to consider... If you haven't already done so give your child access on hisher smartphone or tablet - go over with them what they will be expected TO DO rather than WHAT THEY ARE EXPECTED BY THEIR TEACHERS! It sounds silly but kids expect praise for showing up at all not necessarily praising their work itself; especially if most teachers just fail miserably when asked about how much an A would mean without giving any specifics as well: "well hon' ya know..." So instead tell him exactly what he needs do correctly based upon whatever test-like situation given by whichever teacher assigned those grades tests under which these courses fall into play... THEN discuss HOW MUCH better she could have been had her instructor actually taught properly according guidelines established specifically FOR THAT PARTICULAR grade level!!! Afterall who knows YOUR kid?? Give then full credit where duebut don't forget while our children can often succeed through sheer determination alone crediting only themselves may cause more harm downtheroad because left unchecked such self esteem issues generally resultin poor behavior leading parents like me calling police after 911 calls from frustrated neighbors inexcessively angry voices raised above normal volume levels (!) hahahaha!! Anyhow good luck seeing past 21st century nonsense along successful educational tracks....smiles
