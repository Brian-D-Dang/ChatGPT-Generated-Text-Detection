Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll post a fuller explanation here. I decided that after the full patch I'm working on, I would do a "mini-patch" which would include the other things I have planned for FateZero (the inclusion of the adults and the changes to the battle system, etc) along with a few other small things. The first thing I'm going to do is take the "Infinite Text" implementation and implement it as a setting on the main dialogue screen so that we can actually see that text. This will be the first thing to go into the next patch. I also decided to release the patcher itself (I've always had it on my mind to make it so that people could make their own patches more easily), and it can be found here: (Note: I don't know if people still care, but if anyone does, I'll also be releasing the source code. A lot of the things that have been requestedsuggested have already been implemented in the current version, but for the most part I'm just going to wait for the main patch before adding anything new. I'm just posting this because people have been requesting the "Infinite Text" feature for so long that I thought I might as well implement it now. The "infinite text" feature will also be implemented in the same way as the version of FateZero that I released (which is the one that will be included in the main patch). So I guess that's why I'm getting so many deltas for the same feature. Also, for the people who have been asking about the adults (who I've already implemented), I've decided that I'm going to leave them out until the main patch because I don't really want to upload a huge patch right now, and the adults are fairly large files. Thank you for the prompt reply! This is a bit late, but I would like to thank you for your hard work. I have a question. When you said you'd release the source code, do you mean you're going to release the source code of the current version? Also, what did you mean when you said you were going to release it before the full patch? Too bad the adults will be put off till later, but I understand. As for the source code, it's going to be of the current version of the patcher.
