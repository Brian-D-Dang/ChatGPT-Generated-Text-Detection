Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good reason for demanding an end to the hegemony of government control over our lives in general - these are well known arguments against real freedom of speech. Public opinion polls show that public sentiment is changing quickly on many fronts: Only about four percent believe that governments should be punished severely if they violate freedom of religion (which means a lot less than the average Republican) while almost half say governments shouldn't be punished harshly at all when abusing their power; more people feel strongly about the rights of others rather than about using force or coercionthis means there has been a significant shift among liberals - and conservatives who don't agree! The government may not be able to arm every citizen but they certainly can influence them across culture borders. That makes for some interesting competition within the United States society as government becomes increasingly powerful relative to the rest of society, particularly since Republicans now seem more interested in protecting American freedoms than we think they do. Well, everything that happens between now and election day could easily just become another election year for Trump supporters. Either way, it wouldn't surprise me if Trump wins again or loses badly enough to make him vulnerable to a comeback campaign in 2024.
