First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" does. But on this blog we are talking about equality between men and women in society which allows us to discuss issues such as abortion rights, feminism, gaylesbian rights, etc... What you say will only apply if there's an implication that same-sex marriage would lead to women being discriminated against because they wouldn't be able to get pregnant anymore (or whatever). Now, if you were going for an argument based on something different from sexism or misogyny, then this sentence might work but we aren't here to talk about equal pay for equal work! We're talking about how both genders should receive education equally, not just males and females. By your logic though, women shouldn't be allowed to vote either since once again we're discussing equal rights; however these two are completely separate discussions with different social implications than one another.
