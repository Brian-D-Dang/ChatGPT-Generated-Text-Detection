One counter-argument could be that while it is understandable to have negative feelings towards Father's Day, it is important to recognize the value and impact that being a father can have on a child's life. By celebrating Father's Day, you are not only acknowledging your own role as a father but also setting an example for your children and future generations. Additionally, Father's Day can be an opportunity to reflect on the challenges and joys of fatherhood and to connect with other fathers who may be experiencing similar feelings. Ultimately, while Father's Day may not be everyone's favorite holiday, it can still hold meaning and importance in acknowledging the role of fathers in society.
