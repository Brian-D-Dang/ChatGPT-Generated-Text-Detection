Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself an exemption and then write it off on my tax return, but does anyone really think we'd do away with our democratic system because someone figured out they can scam the government by voting themselves free stuff?"
