Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for feminists by MRAs who have been on an information war footing regarding this subject since its inception in the 60s. It seems that they use their own ideology as a means of oppressing women (as well as other groups) while claiming to speak on behalf of men everywhere? Any thoughts? No, but I will say that I've seen some real horrible shit coming from people associated with MRA subreddits lately... ...so maybe there are decent ones out there somewhere.
