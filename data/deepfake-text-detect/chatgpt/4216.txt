Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better. If that is so, what is the point in fiction? Don't you have to be able to describe a scene or story before writing it down and getting feedback from readers then to make your stories real or useful? Why would I write a short story about my dog if there's no way for me to learn anything about him if I can't see him and interact with him?
