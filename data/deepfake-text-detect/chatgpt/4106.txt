Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, am I so bad at learning new things? I think the answer is pretty simple: We are all a little bit moron when it comes to something we don't understand and not because we can't do it well. We just keep forgetting what is already in our head! Or... maybe we simply cannot remember what we have read or heard before. It happens with me, too often. It seems as though every time I would try to find out why something went wrong for me, my mind would always forget what I had learned before. So, I started writing down the ideas of each thing I encounter (and more importantly) find myself confused on after reading it over again. Waiting until next day consumption will save your sanity from having to complete this task yourself by finding some way to make sure you will be able to remember everything before you actually begin readingwriting anything. So here is a list of ways to help improve your memory skills: 1 - memorize a good amount of information before getting into bed at night. Then, once you fall asleep, immediately wake up to find out what you forgot. This may sound stupid but if you study enough facts to get familiar with their structure and function like crazy, it should come naturally during sleep. 2 - If you need to write anything down, draw pictures beforehand instead of writing straight away. Draw them bigger than you normally would and imagine moving them around while you focus on writing down the details. This will make you concentrate better and make it easier to remember. Also, draw shapes which go along with the words they say. For example, "5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 5,78." 3 - Ask others for advice whenever possible. When in doubt, ask people you trust or even strangers if you really need clarification. These people can give you what truly matters and nothing else.
