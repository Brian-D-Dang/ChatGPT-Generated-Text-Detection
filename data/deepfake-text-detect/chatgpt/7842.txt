While movies and video games are visual and auditory mediums, books are primarily a textual medium. Unlike movies and video games, books rely on the reader's imagination to create the visual and auditory elements of the story. Furthermore, books often contain more nuanced and complex themes and ideas that are difficult to capture with censorship. Therefore, regulating and censoring books would not only be impractical but also interfere with the author's ability to express their ideas and perspectives.
