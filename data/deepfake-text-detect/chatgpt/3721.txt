In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals Yes, that's correct. The UK has strict laws and regulations when it comes to animal welfare, including the welfare of pets. The Animal Welfare Act 2006 was introduced to protect the welfare of all animals, including pets, and sets out the responsibilities of pet owners to ensure their pets are cared for properly. If pet owners fail to provide adequate care for their pets, they can be prosecuted and even banned from keeping pets in the future. This is because pets are reliant on their owners for food, shelter, and medical care, and it is the responsibility of the owner to provide these things in order to ensure the pet's welfare.
