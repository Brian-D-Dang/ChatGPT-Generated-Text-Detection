Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for feminism that many really hard-liners have towards women in particular (even though they are not feminists). Thank you so much for the answer! No problem, glad to help
