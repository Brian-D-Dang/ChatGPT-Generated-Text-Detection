I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural experience. Most Japanese people are of the opinion that it is not a good idea to eat with chopsticks for a meal. It is more of a cultural experience than an efficient way to eat. At the same time, the Japanese will have a feeling of delight when they get a chance to eat with chopsticks. There are two basic schools of thought about chopsticks. One is that it is a necessary tool for the Japanese people to eat. The other is that it is a cultural experience. Japanese are not the only ones who eat with chopsticks. People in many Asian countries eat with chopsticks. Chopsticks are also used in many other countries. For example, they are used in Nepal, Thailand and Burma.
