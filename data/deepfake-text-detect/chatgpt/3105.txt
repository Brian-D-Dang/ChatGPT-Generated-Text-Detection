Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that the type of people with poor crisis management aren't at risk for killing themselves; by "legitimacy" I'm talking about how valid or not your reasons are. I agree that its a mental health issue as well but it can be improved when you have some secure footing and feel safe in yourself again after going through this period which is one year if we're being generous
