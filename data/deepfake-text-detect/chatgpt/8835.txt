You may have seen news that BlackLivesMatter protesters interrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Seattle. I think this was wrong to do, because he has fought for civil rights and equality for all people regardless of race. I support black families being treated fairly, but calling him racist is just not fair for someone who actually believes the word "racism." People are allowed to be different races because they choose to live with their own beliefs. You can't say you're supporting racism when it isn't based on race or gender.
