Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a different solution to the problem, and I would like more input on this one before I make it the "main" one. There is an incredible amount of wrong information about Delta's out there. It's not just a simple 4-in-1 ratio. It's not just a simple 6-in-1 ratio. It is in fact a 6-in-1 ratio with 3 gears (1st, 2nd and 3rd). The first 3 gears are in the same ratio (unlike a 4-in-1 ratio where 1, 2, 3, 4 gears are all different ratios, so this is a big difference). The 4th gear ratio is a "shift" ratio (1:1), not a 6-in-1 ratio. So instead of having 4-in-1 gears, you have 3 6-in-1 gears, and a 1:1 ratio. Think of it like an automatic transmission with 3 gears (1, 2 and 3) and a shift ratio (4th). I have made a detailed post in the "Real Life" forum about how the math works (I know people here don't like it, so I am not posting it here), but I don't want to make this thread too long and hard to read (which this one is already), so please go to the Real Life forum. A solution to this problem is to make a "delta" that is not a delta at all. It is in fact a 6-in-1 gearbox that is not even a "true" delta. I have created a new gearbox for the Legacy, and it is still in the testing stage right now. This gearbox can be used for the Legacy, and also for the Slipstream. I have made this gearbox and uploaded it. Please download it and test it out. I want to see how much you can take out of this thing before it doesn't go. I will be uploading the gearbox to the YTU, but it will take a few days, so I will post here when it is uploaded to the YTU. I want to know what your best times are in the Legacy with this new gearbox. I want to know what your best times are in the Slipstream with this new gearbox. I want to know if this new gearbox is a good one. I will be testing the gearbox myself, but I want to know what you guys think. I have made a few changes to the gearbox since the previous version was posted. Please download the newest version (again, 1.10, if I remember correctly). Note: The gearbox is still in the testing stage, so please do not use it in any race yet. I have re-uploaded the gearbox again to the YTU. I have fixed the gearbox a little bit. I have changed the gearboxes from a "true" delta to a gearbox with 3 6-in-1 gears, and a 1:1 ratio. The gears are now better. I have made the gearboxes from the previous version a "true" delta. Please re-download the gearbox and use it. The gearboxes have now been re-designed to be "true" deltas again. I have made a few changes to the gearbox. Please re-download the gearbox and test it out. Test it out in the Legacy and Slipstream, and see how good it is. I have made a few more changes to the gearbox. Please re-download the gearbox, and test it out. I have made a few more changes to the gearbox. I have made a few changes to the gearbox, and I have made it so you can have one on each side. I have also made the gearboxes 100 solid, so they can't get stuck. Please re-download the gearbox and use it. Please re-download the gearbox and use it in any race you want. I have made a few changes to the gearbox. Please re-download the gearbox and use it. Note: Please do not use this gearbox in any race until I give the
