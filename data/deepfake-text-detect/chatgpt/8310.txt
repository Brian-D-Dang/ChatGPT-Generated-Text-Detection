I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a truck is going be cheaper for me than owning and maintaining 3-5 vehicles. For example: let us assume that the total cost of ownership over 5 years (this includes insurance) would only amount 15k difference between two similar trucks with identical mileage 10K miles). Since there are substantial savings on using my own vehicle rather then leasing or renting one every day (0-500 per month), as well an additional annual gas saving due having fewer trips each year (1gallon saved 800 yearly fuel used vs 831 annually if you use your personal noncommercial auto instead), assuming round numbers here we can say at some point during those first five full calendar months after purchase - they will have more money leftover from their monthly payment into which funds could go towards upgrading any equipment needed inside itself such maintenance parts etc., while still being able fund down payments toward subsequent purchases later within another few weeks time when effectively needing them again anyway; thus minimizing overall costs associated keeping track exchanging prices constantly needlessly spending much less! This also assumes no large unexpected expenses come up via accidents requiring mechanical repairs beyond normal wear tear...or other unforeseen circumstances outside its control.
