So, I saw a commercial today about a pill that helps with BED, and I did a bit of quick research on it. From what little research I did, it seems like you have to take the pills before you eat or else they won't work... which means if he's not taking his meds at all until after dinner (as mentioned in other comments), then this would be an issue for us too because we don't want him eating anything where there could potentially be carbscarbs around while he takes them!! It'll get better over time!
