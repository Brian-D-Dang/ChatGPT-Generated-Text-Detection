Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from recreation) and played in college as well. I am not a professional soccer player, but I do play as a way to stay fit and I enjoy it. I am just wondering about your opinions on why some children are considered "elite" and others are not. I read in some of the posts that some parents are paying a lot of money to play in club soccer and that is considered elite and then there are the other parents who can't afford to do this and their children are not elite (according to some people). I don't really want to get into this debate of who is better or who is not, but I am curious to hear about your opinions on this subject. Hi, anon. There are many elite soccer players out there and I am not the best person to ask about that. I am just a parent with a child with CMV and I have a blog to share what I learn about my child's condition. I wish you and your child well. I think you are correct in that there are very good soccer players out there and many of them are from families that cannot afford the fees to get to the next level. There are many different levels of soccer and all of the players should be given the chance to try to move up the levels. I think what you have here is parents trying to "buy" their children into the higher levels. I am not a soccer player. But, I have seen enough of it to know how fast it can go. I was once at a U18 game where my son was playing. His team was up 3-0 and in the last 10 minutes the other team was on a scoring frenzy and it was 3-3. If they had scored another goal they would have won the game. My son was in goal. He was saved by the defense and his team won the game. That was the worst moment of my life. I know nothing about soccer but I have to agree with the above post. If it was my son up there, I would be one scared mom. Good luck. I agree that it is not the parents buying the kids into the higher levels. It is their children and their talent. My daughter was not able to play soccer until she was in high school. By then, she was quite good and she was able to go on and play college soccer. I am glad she was able to do this. Her older brother tried out for the same team but was not as good. They had to sit the bench. They both tried hard. I think that is the point. Let them try. If they don't make it, that is okay. Let them know they tried. If they do make it, good for them. My son is a lot older than my daughter and he has always been a good athlete. He could not play soccer in high school because they did not have a team. We put a team together. We were able to do that because we had a large group of people who could play. I never once said that my son was better than his brother. They were both good athletes. I think they both had a lot of fun with soccer. Hello, I don't know much about soccer. I have not ever really had the desire to learn about soccer. But, I am reading more about CMV and I think it is very important that I learn about this subject so I can be better prepared to help my child. I have a 13 year old son and I am worried about him playing soccer. I know that CMV is a sporting event but I also know that soccer is a contact sport. I am wondering if I should keep him away from contact sports so he doesn't get hurt. I don't want to be a pushy parent but I also want to protect him. Any input would be appreciated. I am not a parent, but I am a soccer player. I played in college and I am currently playing on a semi-professional team in Europe. I don't think it is a good idea to not let your child play soccer because of CMV. Soccer is a sport and is a way to keep your child healthy and fit. They need to stay active and playing soccer will be a great way for them to do that. I know that CMV is a risk factor for getting AVMs. But, it is not a risk factor for developing hemorrhages. I am not a doctor but I read the last book I was able to find on AVMs. That book
