View changed by a combination of the comments of uceleritas365 and uQwerkss: I guess we all understand numbers differently, but ultimately I think it really is lack of empathy more than anything else. If you had been there in person instead of on Youtube maybe things would have gone better for me. I'm pretty sure that was what every single one of us meant when he said "you should try to put yourself in their shoes." It's entirely possible they were having personal problems or are just not interested enough (or passionate enough) about writing code at this time.
