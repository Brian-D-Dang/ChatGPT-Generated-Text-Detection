Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one person is still not attracted to their partner? The only thing mentioned was that he's a great guy and they agree on everything else... I'd like you to expand upon this point some more if possible. How does one sustain such an arrangement without it becoming a relationship of convenience rather than love?
