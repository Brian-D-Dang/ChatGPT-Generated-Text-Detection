After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the debate happens the NRA or some other gun rights lobby organization will offer that more guns in the hands of teachers will be an effective solution to gun violence in schools. This is a myth. The best example of how gun advocates are wrong is the NRA's "Good Guys with Guns Stop Mass Shootings" video. The video contains statements from 67 police chiefs and other police officials. The problem is that the video relies on anecdotal evidence. It is highly unlikely that in the future every school shooting will have someone with a gun in that school. It is also highly unlikely that a school with a gun policy would be able to stop a mass shooting. The purpose of this video is to give some anecdotal evidence to support the NRA's claim that more guns in the hands of teachers and armed security will stop school shootings. The video's title is "Good Guys with Guns Stop Mass Shootings." The purpose of the video is to convince people that more guns will stop gun violence in schools. The video does not use any evidence other than anecdotes. The NRA should offer actual evidence to support the claims that more guns in the hands of teachers will stop school shootings. The NRA should offer an actual study that provides evidence to support the claim that more guns will stop gun violence in schools. There is no evidence that more guns in the hands of teachers will stop school shootings. Gun Rights Lobby Does Not Support Gun Rights Every time a school shooting occurs, the gun rights lobby argues that more guns in the hands of teachers and armed security will stop school shootings. However, this ignores that most school shootings occur in gun free zones. In 2016, 94 percent of school shootings occurred in gun free zones. In 2017, 94 percent of school shootings occurred in gun free zones. In 2018, 94 percent of school shootings occurred in gun free zones. In 2019, 94 percent of school shootings occurred in gun free zones. The reason that gun free zones are so vulnerable to mass shootings is because gun free zones force victims into an unarmed mass shooting.
