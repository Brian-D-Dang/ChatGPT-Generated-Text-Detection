While it may be true that some social media content is intended to be viewed by a wider audience, it doesn't mean that everything shared on social media is fair game for anyone to browse. People post personal information and thoughts on social media platforms, and just because it is public doesn't mean it is meant for complete strangers to see. Additionally, even if someone shares something publicly on social media, it doesn't automatically give others permission to use or share that content without permission. Everyone deserves a basic level of privacy, and it's important to respect that, even on social media platforms.
