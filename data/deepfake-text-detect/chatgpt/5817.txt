So if you haven't heard already, there was a recent [shooting in a Charleston church.] Many reports are coming out with evidence that points it as a racially motivated hate crime. I'm not sure how I feel about this so I thought I'd ask you guys. Is it a hate crime? Is it a terrorist act? Both? I think both. I don't know if it's justified and all that, but I think it's a crime of terrorism. I think it was an act of terrorism. I don't think that it was an act of terrorism. I don't think it was a hate crime, but I think it was an act of terrorism. I don't think it's a hate crime, but I do think it was an act of terrorism. I think it's a hate crime. I think it's an act of terrorism. I think it's a hate crime, but I also think it was an act of terrorism. I think it was a hate crime, but I don't think it was an act of terrorism. What do you think? Was it a hate crime? Was it an act of terrorism? Or both? Personally I think it's both. I think it was a hate crime.
