I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot someone? Well, since they are supposed to be civilians as well, there's an inherent conflict between them and their superiors over who is in charge of that particular job. And for whatever reason, all these cop shootings happen with no notice given. On top of that, most cops i know (men) do not care that much. They're only interested in helping themselves when they can help others (for the good of society).
