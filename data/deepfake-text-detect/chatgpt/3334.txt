I think it is the opinion of many people on the internet, and of reddit in particular that the companies trying to fight piracy should "Deal with it" that they should focus on finding more innovative ways to distribute their content and make it more accessible to consumers. This may include offering more affordable pricing, improving the quality of their service, or providing a better user experience. Additionally, they could work on building stronger relationships with their customers, listening to their feedback and addressing their concerns. Ultimately, the key is to create an environment in which people are happy to pay for content, rather than resorting to piracy as a last resort.
