To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example in order to prevent inbreeding it is best if you marry someone with a different genetic makeup than your own (at least on average). If we allowed incestous marriages then this would not happen as people could pick their partners based purely upon physical attraction or looks rather than choosing for other reasons which remove some of these problems from society at large. What about the potential child molesters that parents can be more concerned about?
