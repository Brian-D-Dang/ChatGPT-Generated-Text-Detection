I just read this [article] stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that college admissions should be based on merit, not race or ethnicity. It's important to strive for equality and fairness in the college admissions process, and discrimination of any kind should not be accepted. However, it's important to note that the college admissions process is complex and involves many factors beyond race and ethnicity. Colleges have diverse student bodies and consider many factors, such as academic performance, extracurricular activities, essays, and interviews, when evaluating applicants. Some colleges may have affirmative action policies in place that take into account an applicant's race or ethnicity in order to promote diversity on campus. Regardless, it is imperative for admissions processes to be open and transparent, and for all applicants to be evaluated fairly based on their merits and achievements.
