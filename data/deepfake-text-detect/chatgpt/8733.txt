I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, women are responsible for their own health, but why would they be so dedicated to doing the same thing for other people? But if we're talking about "Dad-of-two," then I'd say that there must be some relatively important benefit in having a partner who turns out to be a well educated and successful child molesterspyetc.
