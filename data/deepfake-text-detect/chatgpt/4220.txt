I'm referring to this news story about the incident at the community pool in McKinney TX. You can reference it here, the video is down the page and is approximately 3 minutes long: The article says the fire was started by a coal-fired heater near the side of the pool. I tried to find the source for that claim but couldn't: According to local media reports, someone lit a small fuse attached to a portable generator on the side of the pool. The explosion caused water to flood into the pool from underneath where it had been stored; hitting two children under a slide. One child was treated for minor burns and another suffered broken ribs. Both were taken to hospital with non life threatening injuries. A second child who had been swimming nearby also escaped unhurt.
