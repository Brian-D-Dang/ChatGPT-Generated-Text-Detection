It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. But it means we need structures that allow us to do this without the use of violence or coercion. Sounds perfect for us! So how can we make these groups work? In nature societies function in a similar way to modern day environmental groups. They rely on local leaders who set policies based around their own preferences instead of following orders from above. However, many of the institutions used by such organisations require agreement between members which results in conflict. To solve this issue researchers at ETH Zurich have developed an algorithm called Karma that can help people create a group while avoiding conflicts amongst its members. In a new study they show that using Karma a community could be created even if all members disagree with each other about something (like religion) but still remain bound together by a shared interest. Karma is designed so as not to induce any kind of hierarchy within communities. Instead, users register their thoughts on subjects and then tag others' posts (the 'karma' system). As long as no two participants agree with such a person, they will simply be tagged as neutral. If you see two tags next to each other, these indicate people who share similar views. A user who sees more than one tag indicating heshe shares a certain view has been labelled as being on their side (or having a different opinion). If enough tags appear - particularly ones that highlight a disagreement between two users - a 'war' takes place resulting in someone taking control over another and stopping them from expressing their opinions further. The system works well when users are aware of what is going on. Even though there may be little chance of achieving harmony, the users are still able to participate in discussions and resolve disputes on their own terms. The research team suggests that Karma should be introduced into human-dominated society where conflicts among individuals are of less importance than problems affecting larger groups.
