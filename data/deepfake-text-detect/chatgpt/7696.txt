While it's true that the United States is a large and diverse country, these factors do not necessarily hinder its progress. In fact, the diversity of the U.S. population and the size of its economy can be seen as advantages. With a population of over 328 million people and a GDP of over 21 trillion, the U.S. has a large pool of resources, talent, and ideas to draw from. Furthermore, many other large and diverse countries, such as Canada and Australia, have been able to achieve high levels of economic and social development. It's not the size and diversity of a nation that determines its success, but rather the policies and practices of its government and institutions. Therefore, it's not accurate to attribute the perceived "lagging" of the United States solely to its size and heterogeneity.
