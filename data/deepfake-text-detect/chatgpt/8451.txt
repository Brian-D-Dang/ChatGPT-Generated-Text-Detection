How can you convince me that all the nations that I'm allowed to visit aren't all working together to hide a bigger and better and more free world. Maybe the people of France don't want us there, but we are so far from home it seems wisest not assume they're outwitted by everyone." I understand what he is saying here: If World War 1 didnit come about because Germany wanted war with Serbia (which was used as an excuse), why would WW2 be any different? Afterall when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939 did England care if anyone else had anything against them! It made sense for these countries who were scared enough already; letis just say another country attacked one further south than ours at sea or something like this could happen again...The US might have been ally 1 during both wars actually which makes our current situation even worse since Europe doesnat need help anymore!!! The only way America benefits off other European conflicts now-a daysis through oil!!!! We should leave NATO!!
