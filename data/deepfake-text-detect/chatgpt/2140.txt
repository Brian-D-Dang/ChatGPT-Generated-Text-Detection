Linux is a hard to learn OS and seems daunting for the average Windows user. Many things on Windows cannot be used on Linux (Distros I have tried were Mint , Fedora and Ubuntu). I've had success with Open Source software in linux but it still was not what i wanted out of an operating system. With computers becoming so cheap now days It just doesnt make sense buying a windows license when you can buy a laptop that has both Win7 Xp preinstalled for about 400 dollars I believe this also opens up competition between Microsoft and Apple as well since more people are choosingwill choose open source over closed source programs Open Office - everyone uses MS office at work anyway...if someone needs some specific feature they'll use google docs or whatever else there happens to be around....but if something breaks and no one understands how to fix it then most likely we're going back to using excel anyways.....and even if they don't go back into ms-office directly than its all relative who's having trouble opening spreadsheets or doing simple calculations right? GIMP - Its Free! And easy enough not to need any tutorials. If anyone does know Gimp better than me please feel free to correct my errors here:D
