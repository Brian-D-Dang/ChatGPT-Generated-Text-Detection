If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean would be a great idea if you want to increase your employment prospects. These East Asian languages are some of the most widely spoken languages in the world and are becoming increasingly important and useful to employers. They can help you get ahead in business and open up many doors that may have otherwise been shut. Learning any East Asian language will give you a competitive edge in the job market and make you stand out from other applicants. Additionally, these languages are very useful for traveling in East Asia and experiencing the culture first-hand.
