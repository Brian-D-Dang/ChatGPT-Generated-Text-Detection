In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they do not want to is considered rape. Rape is a crime in all states, and it carries serious penalties. In addition to the legal repercussions of rape, survivors often face psychological trauma and social stigma for years after the assault, which can make it difficult for them to move on with their lives. Rape is unacceptable, no matter what the circumstances are. The victim is never at fault and must be supported in any way possible. It is important for everyone in our society to be educated about consent and how to recognize when someone isn't giving it. By understanding how to respect each other's boundaries, we can create a safer environment for everyone.
