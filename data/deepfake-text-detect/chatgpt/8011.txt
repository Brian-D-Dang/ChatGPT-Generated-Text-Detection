While it is true that many countries have a rich history and culture associated with a certain ethnic group, it is also important to recognize the value and contributions that immigrants can bring to a society. Restricting immigration too severely can lead to a lack of diversity and fresh perspectives, which are essential for a healthy and innovative society. In addition, many countries with restrictive immigration policies often struggle with aging populations and a shrinking workforce, which can have negative impacts on their economies in the long term. Therefore, it is important to find a balance between preserving cultural heritage and welcoming new ideas and people to contribute to a society's growth and development.
