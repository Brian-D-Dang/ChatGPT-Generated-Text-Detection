A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was removed, but that is a subjective opinion. In any case, the decision to remove or keep any class in the game would ultimately be up to the game's developers and their vision for the game. As a player with experience in pyro, soldier and medic, you have a good understanding of the mechanics of the game and the roles different classes can play. Are there any particular strategies or tactics you tend to focus on when playing these classes?
