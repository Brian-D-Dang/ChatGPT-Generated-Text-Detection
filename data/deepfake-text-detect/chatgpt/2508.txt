In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me who have been involved with Occupy Wall Street since day one, when Zuccotti Park was still just a plot of dirt on the bankside of lower Manhattan: The police in New York City are using their brutality against protesters to keep us from connecting with each other, by instilling fear in our hearts that we will not survive if they attempt to silence us. Therein lies fascism - the merging or conflation of state power (police) and corporate power as such an entity exists only at the mercy of those aforementioned entities' own interests. And Wall St.'s interest? Their primary concern has always been whether or not the worker bees can produce enough honey for them to extract more profit. It's never about what it means to be human; the real question is when you'll do everything possible so your overlords keep extracting honey from you forevermore. With these latest tactics being meted out upon OWS we should consider ourselves lucky that we haven't yet had to play into such fascist ploys, like those planned by the CIA during the 60s-80s where torture, drugs experiments, isolation chambers etc would be used on US citizens under false pretenses. In fact it reminds me of George Orwell's 1984 novel "Big Brother" (the leader of the dystopian surveillance society), which describes how Big Brother uses propaganda and public relations techniques to manipulate the masses under his control through omnipresent television screens. We're seeing the same thing played out now...except instead of TV screens having total dominance over people's daily lives, they've got Twitter, Facebook, Google, Instagram, Tumblr etc., which feed us new information faster than ever before without even realizing the full extent to which our minds are being manipulated. So remember: When there exist forces that wish to see us divided, silenced controlled, that CAN happen here too. If we allow social media algorithms to shape our thoughts and actions, then we must also allow the police departments of cities across America to dictate both our moral compass and sense of security via brutal violence whenever they choose to act out on behalf of whatever master agenda suits their immediate needs. That doesn't mean giving up hope. Hope resides within us all; no matter how small its size may seem; and therefore cannot be taken away by any group dedicated solely towards extinguishing life itself...unless again we give into such manipulative strategies. The war between freedom and tyranny rages on every single day, but perhaps one of the most important battles being fought today is between hatred and love. Those whose livelihood depends on keeping us separated and isolated from each another thrive off hate. But it is otherwise impossible to remain silent while witnessing oppression. Let us use this time of great upheaval to rekindle the fire of unity throughout humanity. For only then can we collectively put aside differences created by the manufactured division of labor and come together to focus our collective attention on creating positive change for future generations to enjoy.
