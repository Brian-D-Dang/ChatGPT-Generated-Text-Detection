I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to actually get those two names right. Do they really exist? There are 62 known isotopes of hydrogen (H), so all you have left is 1, 2, 3 etc., including Helium-4 which has 4 protons (2 neutrons) vs helium-3 with just one proton 1 neutron). The other nuclear element beyond Hydrogen atoms is Lithium-7: 7 protons 6 neutrons Lutetium atom. So if there was an ununoctinelithium compound then yes this would be possible - however none exists.
