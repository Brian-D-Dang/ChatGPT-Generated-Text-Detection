Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not their tipping habits, but there are some people who have learned how to grab all of my tips on purpose: A waitress at Panera Bread once told me "I don't like when you check out your receipt after paying." This was before she knew why I did this. She probably assumed that I want to look over the price tag as if buying something else or checking for hidden charges because I'm too lazy to pay with cash. (her assumption is incorrect) I prefer to make sure that everything has been charged correctly and even calculate the final bill by hand occasionally before leaving the restaurant. Since then I've used her statement against her whenever we meet again. She always looks confused and apologizes profusely, which only makes things worse. When being observed from across the room, she must wonder what's up! I also get a kick out of getting into conversations with strangers about money. Some say weird stuff about saving, investing, etc... many can't seem to wrap their heads around "how could one storeinvestsave enough at 5 interest rates?" Gotta love them folks! Others just assume that everyone wants to blow it all immediately. If more people would save 10-30, they wouldn't need to go to banks to borrow funds from large corporations to buy video games and computer hardware. I'll bet those same companies will be happy knowing that unemployed young adults saved nothing for tomorrow while supporting their habit. But hey, it's good advertising for capitalism. One of my favorite lessons comes from watching TV commercials where the food gets served before the main course is ready. The customer asks questions such as "Where's my fries?," "when does dinner start" and finally "why am I eating alone?." My response? "It's called 'Waiting. Satisfaction guaranteed or order another round. Poor guy never ordered steak anyway. What have I done? It sounds harsh and mean, but most customers deserve the truth whether its' pleasant or unpleasant. Something funny happened during breakfast last week; AFAIK, there were no waitresses around. No counter space. Just me and two men eating eggs together. After finishing our breakfast and starting to leave, both guys asked each other, simultaneously "are you taking off today?" One said he left his wallet behind yesterday during lunch time hours. Another said the key didn't work right. Both admitted that they needed help and wanted someone to watch their back until they got away safely. That helped ease any guilt or worry I had about driving home without a ride. To satisfy their curiosity, I showed the whole thing to myself using these photos taken minutes ago. Now I feel bad having lied to them, especially since I just finished telling them all about the benefits of creating great content for others to read and learn from. Sure, I created my own little version of Maury Povich Show - YouPorn.com, but we're still talking about life here. Nonetheless, I wish them luck in finding free rides. Maybe next time.:)
