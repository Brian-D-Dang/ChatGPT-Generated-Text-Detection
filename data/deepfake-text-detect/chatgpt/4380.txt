To start, I'm not here to discuss wealth distribution, or income inequality. They are real issues that need to be addressed, and as much as governments like to talk about them they're still far from being solved. But it's interesting how capitalism doesn't have a problem with these things either. I don't think income inequality is an issue at all. I mean there are rich people who make more money than others but when you take into account the number of poor people in America it would seem that any group of people can afford housing if they work hard enough compared to 60 years ago when everyone was on their own for foodhousing
