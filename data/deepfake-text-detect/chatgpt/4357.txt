I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are close to that of the muslim majority countries. There's a great new app called "Islam," which you can download from App Store for free. Practically every aspect of your life will be made easier by this app imo:) "Implying Islam isn't made up entirely of stories about how a bunch of camel jockeys were commanded by God 'to rule over all peoples' and killed everyone who didn't follow them."
