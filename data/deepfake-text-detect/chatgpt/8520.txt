This one seems so obvious to me but I'll provide the basic points: It is a person's right to do whatever they want with their own body so long as it doesn't harm someone else, or infringe on another persons rights. No matter how you dress and your choices of partners are none-of anyone elses business unless those actions affect them in some way (directly like assault) then its not really anyones problem what kind clothes people wear etc... That said there should be no expectation that everyone has sex at anytime during life except for when having kids.... However if these behavioursactions where somehow illegal such would change things considerably (if individuals were stopped from doing certain sexual activities because society deems this wrong). I guess my question could also go more about whether we have become too accepting liberal regarding matters involving sexuality? Or perhaps even why homosexuality isn't treated exactly sameas heterosexuality by law; though thats an entirely different discussion!:)
