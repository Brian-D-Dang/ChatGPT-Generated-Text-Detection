I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a Ford Mustang is a bad move for the price. I totally understand you are not a car guy, but if you really want to save money, make sure to buy a used Ford Mustang on eBay.
