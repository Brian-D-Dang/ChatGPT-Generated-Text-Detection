While it is important to provide equal and fair access to education for all students, making private schooling and homeschooling illegal would infringe on the rights of parents and limit their choices in deciding how to best educate their children. Furthermore, public schools are not always equipped to meet the diverse needs of all students, and some parents may choose alternative options to provide their children with more personalized or specialized education. Rather than taking away these options, efforts should be focused on improving the quality and accessibility of public education to make it a more attractive and viable option for all families.
