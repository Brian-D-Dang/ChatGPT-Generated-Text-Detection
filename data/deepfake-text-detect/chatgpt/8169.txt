So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training , and the fire department has regular drills to practice this stuff (and maybe we need more) but still... In Chattanooga people are just so crazy about their natural environment especially in East Tennessee where all these mountains were once full blown volcanoes! They have national parks like Lookout Mountain with huge forests right next door which used be covered by lava flows from those old volcanic peaks long ago.. Also there is an area called The Smokies between Knoxville Asheboro NC on top or Mt Brice.. It's one big beautiful forest - really awesome place!! No joke you can camp out at some places up here for free.... There aren't too many roads through them though....
