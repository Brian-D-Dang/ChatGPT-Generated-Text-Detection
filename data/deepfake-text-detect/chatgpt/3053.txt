It is pretty well known that the colombine shooters believed in natural selection, a key point of evolution. Just from their [wiki] they talk about natural selection in their journals, and I believe all of them had a personal belief on this matter: I don't know how much you can infer about these monsters through your questions but just as an interesting side note for anyone who wants to read more into it: They are almost unanimously considered to be among one of the worst mass murderers ever, if not THE WORST by many because they were completely unprovoked and made no attempt at hiding or even covering up their crime. They went out with guns blazing killing any student that looked like them first before shooting randomly. Some died simply because they were walking between classes when the killers came upon them; others while eating lunch; some tried to hide under desks and lockers; some jumped from high places trying to escape... But most did die by being shot directly (and very soon after). So imagine what would have happened if they actually managed to kill every survivor instead of only killing "half" of them as was common practice!
