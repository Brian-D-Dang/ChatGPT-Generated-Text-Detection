I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is unsuitable for me to watch. The story is already a saturation point, and even if I ignored the story and just watched it for the fighting, I couldn't do it. I've tried to watch the first three episodes, and I have to say I'm glad I gave up at the point where Asuna gets the money. I cannot understand why the entire show is so well liked. I don't see how it can be so popular. Why is the story so popular? I understand the fun of watching the fight scenes, but the story and the characters are ridiculous. Why is the story so good? It's just a video game. 1) The protagonist is a nice guy. In anime, a nice guy protagonist is a rarity. Most protagonists are over-confident, self-centred or just plain horrible. 2) He gets along well with people, especially girls. Again, a rarity in anime. 3) He's rather clever. 4) He's a very strong swordfighter. 5) He's a very good shot. 6) He's extremely athletic. 7) He's also a nice, loving boyfriend. 8) He's also an awesome cook. 9) He's really good at making friends. 10) He's really good at computer games. Why are the characters so popular? 1) They're all the good type of people. 2) They're all loving to each other. 3) They're all strong. 4) They're all cute. 5) They all have a nice outlook on life. Why is the story so good? It's just a story about a virtual MMORPG. 1) The characters are all so nice. 2) The setting is a virtual MMORPG. 3) The fight scenes are awesome. 4) The monsters are scary. 5) The graphics are really good. 6) The story is pretty good. Why is the story so popular? 1) The characters are all very likeable. 2) The setting is a virtual MMORPG. 3) The fight scenes are cool. 4) The monsters are scary. 5) The graphics are impressive. 6) The story is actually quite good. I think the story is popular because of the characters. For example, Asuna is a very nice person. She's always kind, caring and thoughtful. She is a very good person. She's also very pretty, but that's not why she's liked so much. Kirito is also a very nice person. He's always kind and thoughtful, and always helps others. He's a very good person. He's also very good-looking, but that's not why he's so popular. Eri is also a very nice person. She's always kind and thoughtful, and always helps others. She's a very good person. She's also very pretty, but that's not why she's so popular. Lisbeth is also a very nice person. She's always kind and thoughtful, and always helps others. She's a very good person. She's also very pretty, but that's not why she's so popular. Suguha is also a very nice person. She's always kind and thoughtful, and always helps others. She's a very good person. She's also very pretty, but that's not why she's so popular. I think the main reason is that the characters are so likable. 1) The main characters are all likable. 2) The supporting characters are all likable. 3) The monsters are scary. 4) The graphics are really good. 5) The story is quite good. 6) The action scenes are awesome. 7) The fight scenes are awesome. 8) The outfits are cool. 9) The settings are cool. 10) The monsters are scary. 11) The fight scenes are cool. 12) The outfits are cool. 13) The settings are cool. 14) The monsters are scary. 15) The fight scenes are cool. 16) The outfits are cool. 17) The settings are cool. 18)
