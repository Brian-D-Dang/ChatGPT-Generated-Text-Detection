I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that they should not be blamed or shamed for being assaulted. Both sides are important and necessary in addressing the issue of rape. On one hand, advocating for increased safety measures can help prevent rape from occurring in the first place. This can involve measures such as educating people on consent, providing safe transportation options, improving lighting in public areas, and addressing systemic issues that contribute to a culture of rape. On the other hand, defending victims of rape is crucial in supporting survivors and changing the narrative around rape. Far too often, rape victims are blamed and shamed for their assault rather than the perpetrators being held accountable for their actions. This victim blaming can lead to survivors being hesitant to come forward and report their assault, perpetuating the cycle of sexual assault and further endangering others. Ultimately, a comprehensive approach that addresses both prevention and support for survivors is needed to effectively combat rape and create a safer society for all.
