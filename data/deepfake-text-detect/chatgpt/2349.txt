Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and believe that their vote makes any difference whatsoever in how this country will run itself within ten years (no matter which party they support). Person B moved from another state into person A's house but does not have citizenship yet. And finally you've got someone who has been living out of the country for 10 years returning home just before an election. Person D can only register on Election Day as well...
