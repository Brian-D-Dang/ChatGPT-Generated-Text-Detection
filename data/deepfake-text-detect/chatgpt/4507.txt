I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal products. But then there's this: Q: What are your favorite foods? (or all of them?) A: Chocolate - always chocolate! Why is it that people can't make good cocoa?! Ice cream - vanilla ice-cream with strawberries in summer or blackberry sorbet for winter. The best strawberry jam though... Sushi - especially maki sushi at restaurants like Seiyo Sushimi... I get so full when eating it just sitting down;) Chicken wings Tandoori Chicken - ohhhh man you should have seen me earlier today after going out for lunch. Those looked really awesome while they were cooking! Milk shakesFrappuccinos - Oh my gosh I drink these soooo often (lately I've been getting one every day OR more than once a day), even if it means getting up from bed to go sit on top of the coffee table and do some sort of balancing act to pour milk into the cup, put in sugar, etc. Yay for frappucinos!!:) Bacon - bacon is the ultimate food;) It doesn't matter what kind. Muffins - My mom makes muffins sometimes too 3 Desserts - cake, cookies, pudding, pies. For sure... Coffee - damn how did I not mention this before?? Also, Starbucks has great iced coffees, but because I don't have enough money to be spending hours waiting in line for an iced coffe, usually I end up drinking it hot. Need another latte soon.... Chocolate chip cookie dough balls - crumby things are yummz!!! yes those are actually real words!) Salad (in general) Salad is amazing on its own and as side dishes, and salad dressing, and yes, salads can come in countless flavors and combinations (there are literally hundreds of types). But most importantly, any time someone prepares something else I add extra veggies either shredded carrots or broccoli florets or anything similar...a nice fresh bowl of greens topped with pork tenderloin sandwiches or grilled cheese sounds delicious right now....but my personal fave would probably be a simple stir fry composed mainly of vegetables. Even better still would be pasta carbonara made with egg noodles instead of penne: You could easily use meatballs instead of cuttings too btw; A classic Italian dish! Cheese soups such as minestrone soup - I love these kinds of soups...they're typically warm and filling and comforting! Oatmeal - oooooohh girl I hate breakfasts fasting days for work stuff where I get to stay back late or early...So this morning I couldn't take anymore being hungry, got up way once to prepare myself breakfast, ate it and felt satisfied. Then came home and had oatmeal. Mmmm. Did I mentioned oatmeal was delicious?;) Hot choclate - yeahhh..you guessed it:) Well here we are talking about favourite deserts..so yeahhh, let's see: Crab Rangoon Cake from Redbox movies, its soft spongey outside which is unlike normal cakes, the inside tastes sweetened with coconut oil, and filled with chunks of crabmeat along with a drizzle of mango sauce, red curry paste and green onions. Another must-have dessert and it comes only twice per year during Christmas season ). And the second is Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Balls (one thing I learned lately is that mixing together 4 tablespoons of flour, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, 3 cups of powdered sugar and 2 teaspoons of salt produces magic results!), with melted butter mixed into whole wheat pastry flour and dark chocolate chips added on top - I swear the dough will melt in your mouth when you bite into it! Its crunchy and chewy, both light and rich at the same time:) Other desserts include pecan pie, maple walnut bread butter puddings, pumpkin cheesecake mmmm I love baking fall or autumnal flavours;)...also durian kolok among others, having amazeballs texture coupled with strong fragrant smell and taste. Mine is Joe's Crab Shack. When I first went to visit Disney World last month, I tried their seafood meals and didn't enjoy it. However, I recently took my family to DWS, and was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed Joes' food again. I loved the menu, I liked that I could order without the waiters standing next to us picking our parts of the meal and trying to sell us everything and telling to choose fast, "the lobster is already cooked!," and making weird comments like "no thanks" to customers who already ordered theirs. They seemed very attentive. During Thanksgiving week, I noticed that half price appetizers were served, plus turkey turuals showing good marketing planing (not charging it to another remindable-to-passed tentatively planning attending incorrect range of seasons.
