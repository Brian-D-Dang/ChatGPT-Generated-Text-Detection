In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me, so that others can learn from our mistakes too! I would like you to imagine a few things, before we get started: It's 5 years ago (let us say 2015) and your business has just turned over 100k in revenue for year 1 - great news right? You are well on track with targets... So why do many businesses fail at this stage?? Well let's look into it further.... You have already spent money running an online marketing campaign during 2014 but did not achieve anywhere near your initial objectives.. Why was that?! The answer lies within another secret weapon known as Google Analytics!! Now whilst some may view GA as "just data" or "yet more information about my website growth stats" BUT IT IS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT AND YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DATA!! Indeed here again I will repeat what I said earlier; only 12 of small businesses use analytics effectively [Source] - which means that 84 DO NOT USE OR EVEN KNOW ABOUT THEIR ANALYTICS AT ALL!!! And if they don't know then their competitors most certainly aren't using them either... This could mean disaster for any business when trying to grow revenues fast enough.... There is no excuse really anymore due to advances such as GA4 and even newer versions coming out soon. Let alone there being loads of free tools available that allow anyone to check their site statistics without needing coding skills etc..... Anyway back to main point - -so now add onto above scenario where you were unsuccessful last time round and bought yourself a fancy new Google Adwords account for next year......but wait.... something smells rotten..... Look behind those shiny numbers though see exactly who clicked through your ads! What happened after clicking!? Did these potential buyers actually make a purchase?? Even worse still you didn't receive ANY sales bounce emails???? WHERE WERE THESE PEOPLE WHO CLICKED YOUR ADS ACTUALLY GOING??? It's hardly surprising that only 20 of UK SMEs use email newsletters effectively according to the latest research by MailChimp[Source]. Given the fact 70 of consumers buy based off recommendations made via social media[Source], its clear that customers expect brandscompanies nowadays to keep up to date with market trends and communicate directly with them accordingly.[SourceSource] Not using mailchimp services does therefore seem almost negligent considering how much better results it could potentially yield than other methods e.g Facebook ads. However this seems to often miss the mark amongst decision makers despite knowing full well what benefits it could bring... In short it shows..many companies forget one important thing -to engage with existing clients and prospects consistently rather than waiting until "you've got"a sale or lead." Although this sort of behaviour appears straightforward enough in theory,[Source],[Source] in reality customer retention should also fall under Account Management Team responsibilities alongside Marketing efforts i.e promoting products offered etc etc..However far too many organisations put everything else first leaving little room left for client engagement once leads start pouring in. But hey ho, budgets ahoy!. Next stop Ticketmaster! Please tell us how you feel about advertising tickets slightly cheaper elsewhere on various websites including twitter, facebook groups, forums etc while keeping ticket prices high on official sites? Are you losing sleep worrying about fans buying fake tickets outright instead? No doubt Stubhub knew this long before AZTEC sold theirs lol!!!! Backed by massive amounts borrowed against future income looking forward perhaps? At least Aztec had a strategy! Maybe thats precisely why he took his own life.....he couldn't afford to lose his shirt...........and possibly face winding up proceedings himself later down the line....... How bad was ticketing selling done by ticketmaster [bi]25th March 2018 saw headlines go wild saying TICKETMASTER COLLAPSES ON ITSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nearly every single person involved in live music industry read this story straight away and shared across WhatsApp Groups worldwide. Up till this moment everyone thought Ticketmaster was the holy grail of event management hell bent upon taking over world domination thanks to strong backing provided by Live Nation Entertainment Inc., a publicly traded company valued at 16 billion USD making huge profits each quarter (40m profit in Q1 2017). Such hype surrounding the firm resulted in stock price increasing massively since 2012 (by nearly 700) allowing owners to sell shares easily whenever required. Tickets became expensive offering less value for money for consumers meanwhile demand grew exponentially especially among younger audiences wanting instant gratification. Buying concert tix used to involve standing outside venue doors hoping someone might leave early giving u chance to slip inside somehow otherwise spending hours queuing only to finally find seats scooped by scalpers minutes beforehand. TicketMaster revolutionised everything by combining internet technology together with smart logistics systems ensuring efficiency never seen previously. With such developments came software developers eager to develop apps geared towards improving user experience utilisingrpalingent - streets printerteutor churchRoterson, - alsoRoson also N largerlandco makesetsortpora teamruff
