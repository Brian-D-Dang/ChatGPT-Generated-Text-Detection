I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in I've noticed over the years that a lot of the highest rated movies tend to be about fantasy and science fiction (ie. Harry Potter, Star Wars etc.) and I'm just not sure why. Is it the stories themselves that people enjoy? The world building? The acting? Is it the music? Is it the message? The moral? Whatever it is I just don't get why people seem to love these movies so much. I can't begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the rankings while others like Gravity are so low. I'm all for a good story and I'm not at all averse to a good moral but I'm not sure what it is that makes some movies so much better than others. I feel like I should be able to explain this to someone who has never seen a movie and doesn't understand what I'm talking about but I can't so please help!!
