I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural reflex. That's a good point; however, the fact that the order of chopstick use has not changed makes it seem like they have more control over their taste for cutlery, which makes me think there aren't as many people out there with more interest in eating as we do for chopsticks and still have plenty of freedom about what chopsticks should be used for.
