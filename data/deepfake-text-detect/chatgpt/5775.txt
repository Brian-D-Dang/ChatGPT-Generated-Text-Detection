I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. For those that don't know, a woman in Texas ordered a cup of coffee from McDonald's drive-through and spilled it on her lap, resulting in third degree burns to her groin and inner thighs. The medical bills and subsequent lawsuit ran up to 2.7 million. The problem here is that it was 911, not McDonald's, that was at fault. 911 failed to respond to a medical emergency, and McDonald's didn't need to do anything other than pay the woman medical bills. The situation should have been cleared up with no further action on the part of McDonald's. I don't think McDonald's was at fault, but I can understand their wanting to avoid a PR nightmare. I don't think McDonald's was at fault, but I can understand the court awarding 2.7 million for the woman's suffering. I just can't understand how the amount of the award was decided by the jury. If McDonald's was 10 at fault, they were at fault for 10 of the woman's suffering. If the woman was 10 at fault, she was at fault for 10 of her suffering. If the 911 dispatcher was 10 at fault, he was at fault for 10 of the woman's suffering. But the jury decided that McDonald's was 73 at fault. McDonald's was punished for the 73 of the woman's suffering they were not responsible for. They were punished for 100 of the woman's suffering. I understand why the jury wanted to punish McDonald's, but this is just crazy. If McDonald's was 10 at fault, they should have been punished for 10 of the woman's suffering, not 100. The people who should have been punished were the 911 dispatcher and the woman herself. I feel sorry for McDonald's. They were just a convenient target for people who didn't want to blame the people who really deserved it. I just don't understand why the jury didn't blame the people who deserved the blame. This is a case in which the plaintiff is entirely to blame. She is a 79 year old woman. She ordered a cup of coffee in a McD's drive through. She should have known that in a drive through setting, the coffee is served at higher than normal temperature, to facilitate the drive through. She should have known that driving with coffee on her lap, while not at all unsafe, is unwise. She should have known that she should pull into a parking space and drink her coffee while it was still hot. Finally, she should have known that McD's was not to blame, because the McD's did nothing wrong. Their employees didn't do anything wrong. The order taker took the order correctly. McD's has a policy of not serving coffee at temperatures higher than 140 degrees. The order taker complied with that policy. The customer asked for the coffee to be served at a temperature in the range of 160 to 180 degrees. The order taker said, "sorry, our policy is to serve it at 140 degrees." The woman should have pulled into a parking space, and then she should have gone back into the store to get her coffee. At that point, she should have known that she should not have been driving with coffee on her lap, but she was so upset about the way the order was taken that she drove with the coffee on her lap. She should have known that driving with a cup of coffee on her lap was not safe. She knew it was not safe, because she had done it before and had spilled the coffee in the past. The woman knew she should not have been driving with coffee on her lap. She knew she should have pulled into a parking space. She knew she should have gone back into the store to get her coffee. She knew she should have known that the coffee was too hot to drink while driving. She knew she should have known that she should not have done these things, and still she did them. She is a 79 year old woman with no dependents, and she had plenty of time to get the coffee in the store,
