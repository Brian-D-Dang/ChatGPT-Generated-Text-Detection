I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too vast - our whole lives have become so accustomedto city life that there is no understanding when someone tries (and succeeds) at making you feel out-of place within your own surroundings! The only thing going for this situation was being able spend time with my daughter nearly every day after school while she stayed on her friend's farm house next door....but even then we had some hassles due mainly because they kept their chickens still locked up inside all night long...so instead went right back into having them "bothering" us until 9:30am each morning AND always wanting be entertained by playing cards or board games etc which didn't really happen during summer break......we just enjoyed spending as much quality familytime together without any distractions whatsoever from outside sources......the saddest part about leaving though.....was realizing...that once again, i will miss another year passing before getting those precious moments like these ever happening agin!!!
