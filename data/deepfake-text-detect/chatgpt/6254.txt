Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" Buzzfeed puts everything on a topic and makes a point of connecting to several different topics, but doesn't make it seem anchored, even in the context of the news itself.
