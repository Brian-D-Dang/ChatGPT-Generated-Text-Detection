The goods and services we consume are made possible by the abundance of cheap resources and labour that the west gets out of underdeveloped countries. The West has no reason to pay for these things, so they have been using this power over them as an excuse not only in a sense but also literally here - Saudi Arabia is one obvious example; Iran another (both oil-rich). We did it before with slavery: "Why should I bother making my own clothes when there's plenty being produced?" And now our great victory was industrialisation which allowed us increased productivity at lower costs than ever existed previously because mass production allows economies both regarding cost per item or efficiency overall due higher volumes...but what if someone can't afford such products? Well..they will be forced into low profit margin jobs then! We're pulling on those levers pretty hard already aren'ywe??? Get used tooit!! It happens all across industry really.....and don't worry - you get your poverty wages cos thats how capitalism works isntead oof socialism where everyone just got equal shares!!! sarcasmoff... If people want more money maybe make less stuff?? But hey its off brand marketing right....no need actually try something new....just enough socialised healthcare coz everything else makes me sick......hey wait.....hmmm why do i feel like im going mad again???? Ah forget about history see some modern examples instead tbf blindly follow economic theory without understanding consequences huh illiterate sheeple
