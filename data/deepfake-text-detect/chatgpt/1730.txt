My post is inspired by [this article] in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell "shares" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their educations. This would be an excellent way to make use of idle capital, and I am sure that many people have the time to devote to it (and in fact do so). Also, I agree with you regarding non-traditional work opportunities: jobs like Uber drivers are just too common these days!
