I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are quite similar to each other (the way women dressact etc) So did you find it difficult being in both cultures at once? I have found that when people don't know what they're talking about or just straight up lie it's hard hearing them out haha
