I am an American High School student who was taught 2 different versions of the Civil war throughout my schooling career. In elementary school we first learned about the civil War as a story that had ended in 1865 with Abraham Lincoln's assassination, and Reconstruction being "lost." I remember learning this when i started 4th grade around 2010 or so (maybe 2011). We studied The Battle at Gettysburg which really goes along well to explain why people were fighting for white supremacy; however it didn't go too far into explaining slavery itself because they only focused on how many died during those events rather than what racism is all about from afar."
