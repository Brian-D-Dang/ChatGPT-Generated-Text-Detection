Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to listen to any person's arguments on these issues, as long as they're not based on race, sex, gender, or class (but those seem to be the most popular ones to use in modern discussions). I've spent a great deal of time trying to think of how to phrase this in the most succinct way. The problem is, there's no easy way to word it. I'll explain my thoughts in short bursts, punctuated by a photo or two. I hope this isn't too long. Let's start with a very basic question. It's a question I've asked myself over the last few years. Should I consider myself a man or a woman? I've heard all kinds of arguments, from both sides of the issue. "You're a man because you have a penis, and you have a penis because you're a man." "You're a man because you have a penis, but you're a woman because you're a woman." "You're a man because you have a penis and you're a woman because you have a vagina. You're a man because your chromosomes say you're a man, and you're a woman because your chromosomes say you're a woman." "You're a man because you have a penis, but you're a woman because that's what you're supposed to be." "You're a woman because that's what you are, and that's what you're supposed to be." "You're a man because that's what you're supposed to be." "You're a woman because that's what you are, and that's what you're supposed to be." "You're a man because that's what you're supposed to be, and you're a woman because that's what you are." "You're a man because you have a penis and you're a woman because you have a vagina." "You're a man because you have a penis, and you're a woman because you have a vagina." I've got to ask. What? Is it a vagina because you have it? Or is it a vagina because you have a vagina? How is it a vagina if it's not attached to a vagina? The reason I'm asking this is because it seems to me that some people think that if you have a penis, you're a man, and if you have a vagina, you're a woman. I'm not a woman because I have a vagina, but I'm a woman because I'm a woman. I'm not a woman because I have a vagina, but I'm a woman because that's what I am. I'm not a woman because I have a vagina, but I'm a woman because that's what I'm supposed to be. I'm not a woman because I have a vagina, but I'm a woman because I'm a man. I'm not a woman because I have a vagina, but I'm a woman because that's what I'm supposed to be, and I'm a man because that's what I am. I'm a woman because I have a vagina, and I'm a woman because that's what I am, and I'm a man because that's what I am. I'm a woman because I have a vagina, and I'm a woman because that's what I'm supposed to be, and I'm a man because that's what I am. I'm a woman because I have a vagina, and I'm a woman because I'm a woman, and I'm a man because I'm a man. I'm a woman because I have a vagina, and I'm a woman because that's what I am, and I'm a man because I'm a man. I'm a woman because I have a vagina, and I'm a woman because that's what I'm supposed to be, and I'm a man because I'm a man. I'm a woman because I have a vagina, and I'm a woman because I'm a woman
