While humans have developed advanced technology and space capabilities, it is not guaranteed that we could stop a killer asteroid headed towards Earth. Asteroids are unpredictable and difficult to track, and detecting them early enough to mount an effective defense is an enormous challenge. Even if we were able to detect an asteroid in time, current technologies may not be advanced enough to fully stop or deflect it, and it would require significant resources and international collaboration to coordinate a response. Additionally, there is always the possibility that a catastrophic asteroid impact may occur despite our best efforts to prevent it. Therefore, it would be unwise to assume that humans would be able to stop a killer asteroid and we must continue to invest in asteroid detection and deflection technologies to better protect our planet.
