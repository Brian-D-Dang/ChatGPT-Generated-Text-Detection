Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of men who win elections, I know that it's not so much that we need to make matters more difficult for those girls to be successful - but that the problem is that there are too many women who have never had a chance at the top in life and who don't want to give up... So I guess what I'm saying is: if we've got a lot of problems in our society going forward - we ought to do something about them. And if we can't say 'yes' to them now, we should take responsibility for them. I think all this stuff just goes to show how little we get to learn from our friends. "If you live here - be rich."
