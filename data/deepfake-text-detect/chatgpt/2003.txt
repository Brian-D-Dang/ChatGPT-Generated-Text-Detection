Let me start off by stating what I believe the reddit basic income theory is. From what I have read from rbasicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society humans will no longer need to work for their survival as all resources available would be free and distributed equally (which also means through automation). So people who still choose not to pursue leisure activities or those with skills they can contribute towards advancing humanity wouldn't be seen as useless but rather spending more time living life on your own terms instead of working. I'm very much pro UBI because it's an easy way to improve quality of life. However this dream utopia where everyone has money and time isn't how we arrive there. We would probably end up going down our current path before arriving at such point so why bother? If you want something go get it even if it doesn't play out perfectly!
