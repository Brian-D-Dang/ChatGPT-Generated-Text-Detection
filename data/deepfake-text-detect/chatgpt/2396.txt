How can you convince me that all the nations that I'm allowed to visit aren't all working together to hide a bigger and better and more free world. Maybe the people in that country are not as ignorant of their surroundings etc... how do i tell my mom who is terrified when she hears about ISIS or any other "terrorist" activity going on around her, that there's really no reason for it? She gets an anxiety attack every time we hear news like this because.... well..... terrorists.. right?!??!?
