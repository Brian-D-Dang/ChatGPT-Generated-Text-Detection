One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? For example, lets say there were 12 million students in California and each earned 30kyear from Cal-State tuition (the average for freshmen) over 4 years. The total cost to pay out those student loans would be: 6 billion x 12 million 72 Billion How much money will they make working at McDonalds or WalMart once their education is paid off? Well since we're using averages here, let's assume these are all high school graduates making minimum wage (7 an hour). So now the total amount lost by having free tuition is 300m per year. If you have half the population earning nothing after graduating then it works out to about 150 million per year or 0.0005 of GDP unless your magical fairy godmother can start up some new company that pays people just like me to work as fast food workers every day for 5 hours so that I too can afford my own McDonalds meal. That magic fairy godmother might not exist but she sure doesn't sound real. What sounds more realistic if for 10 years wages for high school grads double while working full time jobs. This means the number drops to around 24M instead of 36M which comes out to total loss of less than 70 milon dollars with no tax increases on us! How does that sound to you? The only thing we should do with our economy right now is spend money into it until things pick back up again. It makes sense to try something similar to economic stimulus before trying anything else because the results of what ever policy change we decide to implement soon won't matter anyway due to how hard it will be then to get any kind of recovery started. We need to keep spending into our economy right now until we truly know where things stand economically. Waiting till next week to act when we still don't even know exactly the direction things are heading in probably wouldn't accomplish much better than waiting til later today. It is my understanding that different states offer varying degrees of financial aid depending upon situation, family income etc., and many families may qualify for federal assistance through various programs such as FAFSA (Free Application For Federal Student Aid), Pell grants, state grant funds, etc... I am aware that the article says ..."tuition rates..." but I think this was referring to tuition costs within specific institutionsnot necessarily a single institution across multiple locations. Perhaps, though, one could argue that tuition is relative to the available resources available, and thus a university that charges significantly lower tuitions rates may actually provide higher quality instruction than another that offers far greater levels of funding. However, this seems somewhat counterintuitive; if the latter, why charge the former? Simply put, perhaps the business model employed by certain schools (e.g., public universities and colleges) is geared toward providing adequate educational opportunities yet doing so without requiring additional funding from outside sources. Such businesses may choose to employ various models in order to survive financially. One option is to rely solely on private donations. Another is to seek generous government subsidies. Still others decide to operate efficiently enough to generate sufficient profits to cover operating expenses yet maintain relatively low tuitions. In other words, offering quality service requires more overhead given the restrictions placed on expenditures by governmental regulations, etc.. We must remember however, that all businesses rely on economies of scale for profitability. Thus, charging the same rate regardless of volume yields fewer profits overall. Further complicating matters is the fact that many private schools cannot expect additional funding from governments beyond the already offered level of support. Therefore, whether private donors respond appropriately or allow tuitions to remain stagnant remains uncertain. Certainly, the data presented above demonstrates the lack of consistency among institutions regarding tuition amounts chargedanywhere between USD 45K and USD 60K annually....a wide range indeed! Remember folks, prices always rise under capitalism, especially during times of recession. As long as the market exists, supply and demand will create equal forcesunless screwing consumers away from purchasing goods becomes the norm. Otherwise, John Keynesian economics crashes and burns. Today, most Americans find themselves living paycheck to paycheckas opposed to being able to absorb 30 extra weeks worth of spending at current inflationary rates. Yet somehow, lawmakers continue to push forward with mandates and incentives intended to ensure continuous growth. Politics never runs short of solutions aimed to eliminate debtors rather than reason behind said debts' origins. Forced socialization always leads to societal decay (think USSR vs USA). To paraphrase Winston Churchillif you want Socialism bad enough, call it Communism......it's got the exact same results! Oh wait.....that's NOT what happened either. Smile In conclusion, when responding to such topics concerning college tuition, one must take account of several factors including, but certainly not limited to, excessive government intervention, declining birthrates, shifting demographics and immigration patterns, competition amongst centers for increased college tuition increase long-patent stone road improves in comparison to equilibrium evaluated world view course below fair first improvement mow forever dreaming mean difference faster water stream
