GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job or anything like that so the money is really tight right now for me to do things on time, but apparently it's not enough of an excuse because people just always expect you to be perfect at everything? 2. My parents are in no way shape or form trying to control what i wear, they're both pretty laid back about styleclothes etc... 3. Why should I suck up all this pressure from others when there are going to be millions more kids out there who will fall under these ridiculous rules anyway???4. Other than wearing underwear how else can I ensure I'm doing something safe and appropriate?5. Also if someone wants to show off their undies, why should everyone stare at them because they were obviously lying, especially if we know the person we're looking at isn't extremely sexually experienced yet?6. If you want to take your clothes off then great, go ahead!7. This isn't meant as a blanket statement against anyone, even those who DO follow these rules. It's simply saying - "hey guys, cmon, dudes gotta budge." And as long as we keep our standards high, keep our minds clear, stay healthy use protection things will work much better!8. That said, any advicecomments would be welcomed!!
