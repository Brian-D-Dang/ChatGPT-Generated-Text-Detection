While Abraham Lincoln is certainly a beloved figure in American history, it is important to consider the accomplishments and shortcomings of all presidents in order to compare and determine who was the best. While Lincoln is known for his leadership during the Civil War and his role in the abolition of slavery, other presidents have made significant contributions to America's growth and success. For example, George Washington played a critical role in establishing the foundation of the United States, while Franklin D. Roosevelt helped guide the country out of the Great Depression and through World War II. Additionally, what criteria are being used to determine what constitutes being the "best" president in American history? Without a clear understanding of what metrics are being used, any claim to definity say Lincoln was the best is dubious. While Lincoln certainly has a place among the greatest American presidents, any claim of him being the best must be evaluated within a larger historic frame.
