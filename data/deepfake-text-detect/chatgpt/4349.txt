Though my personal political views match those of Bernie Sanders much more than Hillary Clinton, I believe nominating Bernie could ultimately be very damaging for the progressive cause. My main concern is that his campaign will alienate as many supporters as possible from the Democratic Party. While certain groups in the party support him, I do not know if they are majority members or not. If this happens we may see an even larger divide between progressives and the Democrat establishment on the issues. He has already alienated several powerful organizations like the AFL-CIO, SEIU, ACORN and Planned Parenthood by saying he would prefer to lead a left wing revolution rather than work within the current system. My second major concern with Bernie's nomination is that he seems to lack the experience to run one. The closest thing America has ever had to running a government was our 10 year war against Iraq where Bernard has never served in any capacity since childhood outside of visiting his grandmother in the hospital. His only experience working at all came during his time as a member of Vermont Senator Joseph Lieberman's staff while he ran unsuccessfully for President in 2004. In fact, many people who have worked closely with Bernie fail to mention that history taught them it was Bernie who initially made Joe Lieberman even more popular among democrats. His first stint working for Biden also involved little else but meeting with senators every day until eventually Biden said "he just doesn't get it" and Biden felt pressured into endorsing Biden instead of Bernie because Bernie did so well. This is what led to Biden deciding to run again after having been defeated in 2008 due to the fact that he believed his popularity came from being able to speak as a man who knows how to run a business and not a politician. By making himself look like a real American candidate he became very valuable to Obama and now has become a leading figure in the democratic Party. We need someone with real executive experience, something that Bernie does not seem capable of providing us. His biggest failure thus far comes in regards to foreign policy. Many believe that he is naive enough to think that ISIS can essentially be wiped out with large amounts of U.S air power alone without the involvement of ground troops. It must be noted though that there have always been military interventions around the world which were successful in wiping out extremist movements before they became too strong and created too dangerous. When Barack Obama took office he stated that he wanted nothing less than to defeat ISIS and that campaigning for president required standing up against extremism wherever it exists and fighting back when necessary. That strategy failed miserably, especially in Libya where we lost hundreds of lives while trying to remove Gadhafi. Instead we sent in thousands of troops into the country and began bombing their cities hoping that the Libyan people would rise up against the extremists inside. Unfortunately the Arab Spring and various terrorist attacks throughout the Middle East followed shortly there after and terrorist attacks occurred almost daily. As far as most Syrians see it this was an attempt by American forces to overthrow a president elected democratically by the Syrian people. It should be noted however that the Arab Spring movement against Gadhafi was supported by many Arabs hence why it succeeded over another despot like Mubarak who was backed by Western powers. Sadly Assad continued to rule Syria regardless of what the United States thought with the help of NATO and other countries. It turns out that the policy we pursued for the most part was the wrong one. However what everyone needs to remember about these instances is that it happened years ago. No one believes now that Isis is invincible simply because air strikes haven't stopped them yet. Additionally no one thinks the intervention is still necessary today. What was evident earlier is that the U.S. policy in Syria didn't really make sense and there hasn't been any progress on a solution to the conflict except for the fact that Bashar al Assad remains in power. Even if we assume that Assad wouldn't have survived under a new regime, I don't believe that Assad would have changed his policies anyway due to America's past actions supporting dictatorships across the world. Egypt isn't exactly free either despite a few reforms since Mubarak fell. Iran isn't particularly innocent either due to its nuclear weapons program and activities dating back to the 1980s. With the exception of Iraq, America has handpicked extreme dictators through its own efforts and then used western intelligence services to terrify nation states into doing whatever we want. It would have been better if we chose otherwise and tried to oppose such regimes instead. From Afghanistan to Pakistan, Iraq, Somalia, Liberia, Sierra Leone and countless others we have helped create mass murderers and terrorists who continue to spread themselves throughout the region. Our methods weren't always right and although some good has come out of the results it's hard to say that the results outweigh the negative consequences. Creating militant groups like Al Qaeda wasn't necessarily bad, but ironically it actually brought terrorism to a smaller scale as opposed to the sorts of groups that previously carried out bombings and atrocities in Europe.
