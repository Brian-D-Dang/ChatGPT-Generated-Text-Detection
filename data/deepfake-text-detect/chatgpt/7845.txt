While it's understandable to feel uncomfortable by your hypothetical girlfriend wearing revealing clothing outdoors, it's important to remember that she has the right to dress in the way that makes her feel confident and comfortable in her own skin. By telling her what she can or cannot wear, you are imposing your own standards and beliefs on her and taking away her agency. It's important to trust and respect each other's choices, and remember that clothing choices do not reflect or determine one's moral character or values. Additionally, it's important to consider the root of your discomfort and address any underlying insecurities or trust issues you may be experiencing in the relationship.
