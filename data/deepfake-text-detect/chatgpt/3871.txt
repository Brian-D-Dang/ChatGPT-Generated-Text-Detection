The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here] . Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things. But for good people to do nothing is the essence of evil. It is not enough to say that a person has done something when all he did was talk; one must also show him what he did, so that his shame may be in the sight of God." - Thomas Paine, Common Sense Christianity sets out the basic beliefs of Christendom: the purpose of life is to live as a holy life, loving our neighbors as ourselves (Galatians 5:22), "There is no condemnation whatsoever for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 2:8), and "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual wickedness in high places" (Ephesians 6:12). The Bible expressly states that there are two kinds of people in heaven: those whose lives are indwelt by the Holy Spirit and those whose lives are impeded by sin. This means that even though some Christians interpret these verses literally, they are actually describing both sides of the same coin - those on earth and those in heaven who struggle with their sinful nature. Christianity provides a framework through which to approach issues such as gay marriage. To begin with, it teaches us that homosexuality should never be called an actual sin because it does not harm anyone. "Be not deceived: neither lust after them nor serve them" (1 Corinthians 4:5) does not mean what many think it means. As Paul says, sex outside of wedlock is wrong because it constitutes adultery. Sinning against someone with whom you may want to share your life violates the law of chastity. Homosexual acts violate this law. Since homosexual acts are unnatural and contrary to natural laws, they cannot possibly be considered moral. They are immoral because they are intended to offend God. As Christians, we know that we will face temptation at every turn. We recognize that our souls depend on faithfulness to God's Word. Our hearts need constant attention to ensure that we keep our commitment to Him. When we fall short of our promise to Him, He forgives us. Christian prayer involves asking forgiveness for our sins while recognizing how much we still have left to conquer. Because then we feel like our prayers were heard. We long for greater intimacy with God and lessened self-discipline, resulting in increased promiscuity among Christians. This is why church attendance appears to decrease among Christians. In conclusion, I believe that Christianity is ultimately responsible for our actions regarding sexual matters. It prohibits premarital sex, saying, "Do not lie with another man as one lies with a woman," and it forbids gay marriage. If we don't follow this Scripture, if we refuse to accept the fact that sex between consenting adults is morally acceptable, we could easily become tempted toward promiscuity.
