Reddit is a website, a business, it is the "front page of the internet." This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these communities would be like if Facebook removed all user content that wasn't about cats: ridiculous and useless in terms creating value for users outside its own ecosystem." "Removing comments from rnews will not change what Reddit does; they'll just move their community somewhere else," he says."In fact this has already happened with rIAmA which was moved into subreddits dedicated explicitly towards AMAs (Ask Me Anything)." He adds "The real question here should probably center around why some parts are so violent but you can see there's no easy answer aside religious beliefs being more acceptable than others might help explain things at least partially."
