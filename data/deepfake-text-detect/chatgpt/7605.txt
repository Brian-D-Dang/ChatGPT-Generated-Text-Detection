A counter-argument to refute the opinion that black and white are colors could be that black and white are not considered true colors in the scientific world because they do not contain any specific wavelength of light. In physics, colors are defined by a specific range of wavelengths that correspond to specific colors in the visible spectrum. Black is the absence of all colors, and white is the presence of all colors, so they are not technically colors in the scientific sense.
