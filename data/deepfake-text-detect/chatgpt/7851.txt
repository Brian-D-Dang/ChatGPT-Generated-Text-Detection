While it may seem that life has no pre-determined meaning, each individual has the power to create their own meaning and purpose. Life itself is a gift, and we should make the most of it by enjoying the experiences and connections that we make. By committing suicide, one would be giving up the opportunity to explore and discover new aspects of life, to make meaningful connections with people, and to create something valuable in the world. It is important to seek help and support if one is feeling overwhelmed, rather than giving up on the gift of life.
