I am an American High School student who was taught 2 different versions of the Civil war throughout my schooling career. In elementary school we first learned about the civil war through the eyes of people like Lee and Lincoln, however in middle school I learned more about it from a perspective which presents the conflict as something else entirely. Yeah, you gotta do that to make things understandable for people. You're not going to get any better by just telling them "this happened" over and over again.
