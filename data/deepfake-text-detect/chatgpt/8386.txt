I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are very different from each other with their own expectations: For example here it's common to see a man holding hands or even kissing his wife while they're walking down street; but if he were seen doing this somewhere else (say Europe) there will be an awkward situation that nobody can explain why something like dating couple isn't socially accepted particularly between strangers who have no ties at all!!)
