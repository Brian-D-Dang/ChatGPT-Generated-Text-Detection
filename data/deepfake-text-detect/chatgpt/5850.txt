I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot a child? I have been thinking of why they would shoot an innocent person or family, and this is what I came up with. I believe that police officers are pissed off at the world and think that they can take it out on someone else, or they are looking for an easy way out. They could be mad at their parents for being abusive to them and have a little revenge. They could be looking to get a big payday. They could be looking for a big scare. They could be looking for money. They could be looking for a thrill. They could be looking for a fight. They could be looking to live the cop lifestyle. They could be looking for a way to get back at society. They could be looking to take out their anger on someone else. They could be looking for someone to look up to. They could be looking for someone to blame for their problems. They could be looking for someone to go to jail. They could be looking for someone to feel they have power over. They could be looking to be the big bad hero. They could be looking to be the "top dog" in their life. I have never had a police officer shoot at me, but I do know people who have been shot at by police officers, and I have known people who have shot at police officers. I have also known people who have been killed by police officers. I think that police officers should be held to a higher standard then other people, and I think that if they are not held to that standard, then they should be fired or put in jail. I also think that the police officers that are doing these things should be arrested and prosecuted, and not just let go. I also think that the police officers that have been shot at by these people should be paid for their injuries, and be given counceling. I also think that the police officers that have killed people should be arrested and prosecuted. I also think that the police officers that have killed people should be put in jail. I think that if a police officer is not doing his job right, then he should be fired, and if he does not get his job right then he should be arrested. I think that if a police officer is arrested, then he should be arrested for a very long time. I think that if a police officer shoots a child, then the child's family should be paid for their injury, and the officer should be arrested and put in jail. I think that if a police officer shoots someone then they should be arrested and put in jail. I think that if a police officer shoots a cop then the shooter should be arrested and put in jail. I have been doing this project to help the people who have been shot at by police officers and to help the families that have had to go through this. I also think that the police officers should be held to a higher standard then the average person. This project has given me a better understanding of the world. I think that this project has made me more understanding of the police officers, and I am sorry for the things that they have had to go through. I think that the police officers should be given more help then the average person in the world, and I think that they should be held to a higher standard then the average person. My goal is that the police officers will start to follow the rules better, and that the police officers will start to think of other people before they think of themselves, and that the police officers will start to be more understanding of the world. I have a lot of future goals in my life, and I think that my future goals will help me to achieve a lot of things. I think that my future goals will help me get a better job, and I think that my future goals will help me become a better person. I think that my future goals will help me become a better person because I think that my future goals will help me be more understanding of the world. I hope that this project has helped the world, and I hope that this project has helped the police officers to do better things in their life. I hope that this project has helped the police officers to be more understanding of the world, and I hope that this project has helped me to be more understanding of the world. I hope that the police officers do better things in their life, and I hope that the police officers get a better job. I hope that the police officers will start to do a better job, and I hope that the police officers will become more understanding of the world. I hope that the police officers do better things in their life, and I hope that the police officers get a better job. I hope that the
