Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data] . In the comments, a lot of people were saying things like: Tumblr and other social media sites are killing journalism. It's not that they killed "journalism" as much is just replaced with something else...like re-blogging or status updates from your friends on Facebook (which I think we could call curation). Maybe even blogging itself will get displaced by some new technology? We don't know what's next but right now less traditional outlets have to compete for attention when you can go up against many others doing essentially same thing at once instead only having one staff writer who must produce content every dayweek vs 100 writers competing simultaneously over twitter feeds..and then all those tweets getting collated into nytimes etc...If someone said "we've got 2 hours per week" everyone would understand because time constraints aren'r an excuse anymore! But if say 1000 bloggers write each different version 1 sentence about whatever topic everyday their ideas might be outnumbering any given journalist today so maybe tomorrow no journalists exist except youtube personalities creating tons jokes infographics ad nauseam??
