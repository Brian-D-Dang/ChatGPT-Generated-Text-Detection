Hello everyone, with all the media coverage lately regrading transgender individuals I find myself uneducated on the particular subject and would love to be enlightened on the topic. I support LGBT rights as a whole but do not know much about transgenders specifically so if you can help me understand your reasoning for supporting this then that will go along way in my opinion of understanding. It's more than just "transgender" people though: it basically comes down to making sure any person who wants surgery gets an opportunity at getting their gender reassigned (though there are some limitations). Other aspects include ensuring they have access to chosen namespronouns etc., which is fairly important during transitions; however we also need to keep them safe from discrimination when out interacting w others.
