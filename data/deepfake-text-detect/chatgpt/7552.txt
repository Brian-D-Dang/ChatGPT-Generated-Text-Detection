A counter-argument to refute the opinion that abortion is largely unjustifiable is that every woman should have the right to make her own decisions about her own body and her own future. The decision to have an abortion can be a difficult one, but it is ultimately the woman's choice. It is important to recognize that the reasons for having an abortion can be complex and may include factors such as financial instability, health concerns, and the ability to provide for a child. Additionally, limiting access to abortion can lead to unsafe and illegal abortions, which pose a risk to women's health and lives. It is important to support women's reproductive rights and ensure access to safe and legal abortion care.
