Counter-argument: While it may seem logical to require individuals to pass the citizenship test in order to vote in the United States, this requirement could potentially create barriers to the fundamental right to vote for many eligible citizens. The citizenship test involves a series of questions that test an individual's knowledge of the US government, history, and culture, and while some questions may seem straightforward, others may require a deeper understanding of complex concepts. Individuals who have not had access to quality education or those who are not native English speakers may struggle with the citizenship test, and therefore could be disenfranchised if this was a requirement to vote. This could disproportionately affect marginalized communities, such as low-income neighborhoods and immigrant populations, who already face systemic barriers to vote. Instead of using a citizenship test as a barrier, efforts should be made to remove existing barriers and make voting more accessible for all eligible citizens. This could include implementing early voting, implementing automatic voter registration, providing language assistance, and expanding voting opportunities beyond traditional working hours. By making it easier for eligible citizens to vote, we can ensure that our election system is more inclusive, equitable, and democratic.
