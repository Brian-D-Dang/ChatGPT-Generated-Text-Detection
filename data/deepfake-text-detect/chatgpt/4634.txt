I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends . It's almost as if drinking a cup of it makes me feel trapped in an academic study group, or something... As though I am not really present when doing so. Drinking another one right now feels even worse and leaves me with a sense that I've lost all contact with my better half; who is still thinking about his day while I just do mine. That other person does wonderful little things for me and fills up this empty space inside and yet never knows because he has no idea what I'm doing and why because all I want to do is drink coffee... Damn you coffee! You're making me hate you!! So here comes the question: how do people go on enjoying their bean when they don't have anybody else around? If everybody goes through this at some point then surely there must be an answer to suffering from 'contemplative' coffee addiction - if only we could get past the initial hump?!?! Here are two possibilities... 1) We can work towards being socially well adjusted and stop feeling guilty about our caffeine desires - in which case we'll maybe start taking more notice of each others needs and wants, creating a stronger bond between us over the time honored beverage. 2) Or, 3) we can take steps to resolve these issues by learning how to deal with them. The latter option seems much easier than the former, doesn't it? Some days it takes me longer to learn humility, others faster. Every morning starts out great most mornings, but sometimes...just sometimes...it gets tough..and boring-ness sets in pretty damned quickly. It's okay, I know exactly where I am today. There seem to be three distinct stages after waking up: Stage 1 coffee, schedule adjustment; stage 2 coffee, reason vs emotions; and finally, Stage 3 Coffee AirplanesCoffee Alone. Today happens to fall into stage number 3. My fellow air travelers across North America will wonder why someone would choose to sit alone in a Starbucks sipping with satisfaction. Well, mostly, everyone else is too busy jetting off to 11:00 AM meetings or having lunch dates. What kind of lunatic chooses to stay home instead? Actually, minding the calendar isn't always the best way to avoid those "hassles." Sometimes, staying put gives me a chance to reflect on the events of yesterday, look ahead at tomorrow and realize...that was last year. A new decade beckons, bringing fresh challenges and opportunities before me and although I may feel happy about that, it doesn't necessitate getting excited about anything. Why the hell am I excited? Am I excited because I think the world should focus its energy toward helping children? No. Because I feel like going back to bed. Do I wish I were somebody else? Nah, I already got away once. And did it leave any lasting effects? Yes. Did the long sleepless night lead directly to the discovery that the universe was created eight billion years ago and that it might benefit from investing more effort into teaching me geometry rather than trying to rouse me from slumber? Yeah, maybe. But when we spend more time dreaming about making changes in the future versus dealing with the realities of the moment, chances are good that we will either miss most of what occurs along the journey or unable to enjoy experiencing those precious moments. So, yeah, I'd say today qualifies as a "lovesick" day. I hope not every day is a lovesick day, especially since I genuinely enjoy living in New York City. However, it sure helps to remain grounded during such bouts of isolation. Strangely enough, meditation can help greatly. Here's what I wrote down several weeks ago: Positive Emotion Meditation PracticeIn a situation of anxiety, sadness, anger, fear, guilt etc., I intend to create a state of peace within myself first and foremost. Then I ask myself the following questions: How beautiful does this experience make me feel? Can I continue pursuing my passions despite the reality of this circumstance? Does this event serve as a lesson in patience? Is there meaning in this passing incident? When I carry on in spite of these feelings, I remind myself that this emotional pain is fleeting compared to the joys awaiting me should I follow through with that dream. In addition, because I reside upon this planet without constant guidance, I invite the Universe to intercede whenever possible. To my knowledge, when I practice positive emotion meditation daily, I witness improved health and vitality over time. Additionally, this meditative exercise allows me to reevaluate how I perceive negative situations relative to my overall happiness quotient. With continued practice, perhaps my perception of bad days will diminish and become less frequent thus affording me greater peace of mind and balance. Perhaps, greater sensitivity to environment may result also.
