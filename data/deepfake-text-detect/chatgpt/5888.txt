Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one or both partners are eager for sex? I am a strong believer in waiting a couple of weeks before having sex so that the couple can get to know each other, but what happens if both of you are eager to have sex but one or both of you isn't sure they are ready to have sex yet? Or is it even a problem if one or both of you isn't ready to have sex yet?
