To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For instance, if a person's child dies in infancy or childhood because of lack of medical care, then they could argue that their parent should be allowed to marry one of hisher children - even though it is unnatural - so as to avoid all legal proceedings. If they cannot prove this, however, then I will reject them from my argument entirely; no further discussion can occur until statements such as these become valid. And there you go! There goes your entire point of view on the issue of consenting adults marrying each other. Now let me simply state why heterosexuality becomes invalid when homosexual couples enter into relationships. The very definition of marriage requires two persons give legal consent for sexual intercourse beyond what is required by nature (which includes sex with animals). In essence, anyone who claims otherwise is either lying or does not understand how the institution works and thus has nothing more than an opinion rather than real knowledge to offer about the matter at hand. It seems like most people do not know which option applies to whom...
