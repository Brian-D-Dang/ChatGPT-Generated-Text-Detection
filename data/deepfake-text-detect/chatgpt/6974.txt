Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking Mark Watney is a waterman. Seeing him in a picture, I thought he was about to catch up with him. So I thought he just made the movie, and he cut it off. It is not too bad, but it is a very nice movie.
