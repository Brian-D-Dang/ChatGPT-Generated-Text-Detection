Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than others and therefore by extension spreading the "us versus THEM" mindset. Yup, but what if you are a national? Like... I am Italian, I have a brother who is Mexican, how would it affect me anyway?
