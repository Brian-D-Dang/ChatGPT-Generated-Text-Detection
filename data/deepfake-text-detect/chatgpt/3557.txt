View changed by a combination of the comments of uceleritas365 and uQwerkss: I guess we all understand numbers differently, but ultimately I think it really is lack of empathy more than anything else that causes certain people to disregard the seriousness of the pandemic. It's important for us to continue to educate ourselves and others on the facts about COVID-19 and the impact it has on individuals and communities. We can also work on improving our empathy and understanding towards those who may have different perspectives or reactions to the pandemic. Together, we can strive towards a more compassionate and informed society.
