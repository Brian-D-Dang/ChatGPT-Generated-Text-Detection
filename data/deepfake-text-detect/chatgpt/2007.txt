It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. It also has negative results such as competition, tribalism (the tendency for people within the group to defend it from outside influence), aggression towards outsiders etc... As we've said before in our previous posts on this subject: "Thinking about these issues requires you to go beyond simple rules." If someone doesn't accept some rule or is offended by them then there isn't much point in arguing with him because he'll just dismiss everything else too - no matter how valid your points might be! The best way not to get caught up in stupid arguments over who was right when trying to educate others would simply be to let time do its work; maybe one day they will come around. However if the only response you hear all the time is 'I don't care' or similar things at least try to understand why they feel so strongly against something that seems harmless enough?
