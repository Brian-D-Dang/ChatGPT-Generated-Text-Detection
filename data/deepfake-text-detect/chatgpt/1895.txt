In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing about whether polygamy is or isn't a good idea; instead let me focus on this slippery-ness of arguments from both sides here and why they're slippery enough for us all to end up falling down together into a bottomless abyss where no one wins any points at all whatsoever... It seems obvious that if we are going to allow two consenting adults to enter into a relationship (which includes many things besides sex) then surely what matters most is how well those relationships work out? It doesn't matter who you have as your boyfriendgirlfriend because there will be some breakups along with other conflicts which can only arise between human beings anyway so long as such humans exist. The point being: why should society sanction various forms of cohabitation yet reject others even when their outcomes bear little -by way of comparison- resemblance to each other? Does allowing divorce imply that monogamy is bad, for example? If polyamory works reasonably well under certain circumstances but homosexuality fails every time without exception, does supporting either really mean endorsing the same thing? Allowing incestuous unions could hardly fail to harm children themselves unless made conditional upon undergoing appropriate evaluations first - quite possibly requiring invasive procedures too! And none of these examples covers sexual minorities like paedophiles whose personal orientations may make them ill suited to normal lifestyle choices until proven otherwise by psychiatrists, anthropologists etc... So while restricting peoples freedom through banning non consensual intimate arrangements must necessarily result in harming someone somewhere somehow, choosing an arbitrary set of rules over another just won't do anything useful except cause needless conflict.
