I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites for some information that would be useful (boutique hotels near the clientmeeting location). Since then there have been several occasions when someone has asked me "how do you make sense of this?" There are tons more examples on SO: How can one learn Data Science? What should every aspiring statistician know how about AI Machine Learning today?. They ask questions like - what's ML? (my answer) - why is X not working.. My reply: because your model doesn't fit well enough...blah blah...etc etc..you get tired fast....or they just give up.....which makes them feel stupid....and bad person after all he wants only good things from others without any problems or annoyances!!! which leads us back into our real world with annoying humans who complain non stop!! UNTIL THE MACHINE LEARNING LEVELS UP AND IS TRULY POWERFULL WE ARE NOT READ TO GET REALLY DEEP FOR REAL PRACTICE OR GOOD WORK WITH IT! This may sound harsh but its true, once we start feeling dumb around these kind people. Then nothing else matters anymore including having fun doing something interesting:) All due respect if anyone feels offended by anything said here please let go as life goes much faster than wasting time getting upset over such issues instead take comfort knowing tht many still practice mathematics daily till their bones ache while dealing wth so called smarts everyday;)
