I've been pursuing a lot of scholarships and one of the things that irritate me is that there are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my state, or because I'm older (although technically 16th graders can enter as well). For instance what happens if you're in 10 th grade but younger than 15? You have no way into this scholarship. How about someone who has done community service hours for their towncity government program at 13 years old by assisting traffic control with crossing guards outside elementary school when they were only 14?? Or volunteering 30 hrs per semester 7-8 yrs while being home tutored during those same semesters.. Do these people get denied even though qualified applicants may be left out just bcz some date was missed somewhere along life's path??? It seems so unfair especially since many other organizations offer similar awards without age restrictions....but it appears like most do...so how will we ever know unless our application gets accepted...or rejected......and suddenly your heart sinks bcuz ya didn't make an AP class last year cus u had diabetes instead!!!! Yikes! That did happen!! So please don t think im saying all should go thru college.....i am making smart choices trying hard too learn more everyday....just frustrated over lack offunds, requirements etc towards higher education funding sources availability!!
