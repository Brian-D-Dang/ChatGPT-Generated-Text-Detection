After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read plenty of good fictional books, but I've read more good nonfictional books than fictional ones. The reason is that it's easy to get lost in a fictional book. You can't get lost in a nonfictional book. You know what's coming because it's already happened. You don't have to guess what's coming because you know it. I have a hard time trying to remember fictional books. I can remember the story and the characters, but not the name of the book. I have a much easier time remembering nonfictional books. And I've read so many nonfictional books that my memory is better than most people's memory for fictional books. I've also read more nonfictional books than fictional books. My recent read of "Pedigree" is a good example. I remember the story but not the name of the book. But I remember the names of many of the nonfictional books that I've read. I can also recommend "The Necessary Angel" by George Steiner. It's a nonfictional book about literature. I don't remember the name of the book, but I remember the story and the main characters.
