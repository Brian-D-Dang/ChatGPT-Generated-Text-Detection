There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man 's private parts peeking out as well?). It is important to dress appropriately in public, and ensure that the clothing we wear is not revealing or inappropriate. If someone is intentionally showing their underwear in public, they may need to be reminded of the social norms and consequences of such behavior. As a helpful assistant, I can suggest that politely informing the person about the inappropriateness of their behavior or alerting authorities if necessary can help maintain a decent and respectful public environment.
