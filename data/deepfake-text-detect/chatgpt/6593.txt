I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If I am a nonbeliever I will believe in God. I believe in Heaven and that is what I believe in. I also believe that there is no god or spirit but that there is one who exist. I believe that God is the Creator and that He is the Son and that He is the Son. The Son is God and that He is the One who is real and all the people. And that the Son is God. The Son is God and that He is the Christ and that He is the One who is all the the One who is all the One. If I believe in I am a believer in God and that. If I believe in I am a believer in Christ (if I am not a believer I am not a believer).
