I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that they (the victim) had to have done something wrong. Both groups seem equally guilty for the fact there is so much stigma associated with being a survivor. The goal becomes less about helping others and more about making sure no one will ever be able to hurt you again. This seems like an incredibly big problem, but since I rarely hear anyone talking this way it must not happen very often. As a female college student at Yale University, where she also played on the women's soccer team, Zawacki was repeatedly sexually harassed and assaulted after meeting someone who lived off campus via Tinder, her lawsuit says. She eventually reported his behavior which included asking if he could come over late at night when she wasn't expecting guests, touching her under her shirt as she slept, slapping her butt without consent while wearing only underwear outside her room, putting on loud rap music when he knew she'd be home alone and masturbating in front of her bedroom door but school officials did nothing. Instead, according to documents filed Monday in Connecticut Superior Court, they told Zawacki "she needed to change her behavior" because men were enjoying her company." After months of harassment, Zawacki decided to end things, ending what happened to be their first date," the suit reads.The man then used Snapchat to send nude photos of himself to her friends before posting them online, telling her to "watch out for these guys. They're dangerous," the filing alleges. As she tried to move forward from the abuse, the suit claims New Haven police officers twice questioned her directly regarding whether or not the assault had occurred; both times, they stopped short of taking action against him."Despite everything... we've been trying to work through this privately," Ryan said Wednesday afternoon. Still, Tuesday morning, with help from the university counsel office, Zwacki filed a complaint with police accusing the man whom she has not identified by name, though she described him in court documents as male, white, 5-foot-8 years old weighing 160 pounds, blue eyes and dark hair of sexual assault and public indecency. At most universities, courts require alleged perpetrators accused of sex crimes to be given notice within 48 hours before criminal charges are pressed, limiting when students can file complaints. A Allard Law School spokeswoman declined comment beyond stating the case remains open. Zawacki said she feels she made a mistake pursuing justice in private, but emphasized that doing otherwise would make other survivors feel unsafe and unable to speak up."It makes me sad knowing how many girls have gone through similar situations that don't know how they should react," Zawacki wrote on Facebook. "I want my story to bring awareness."A few days later, however, Zawacki posted another message expressing frustration with having become yet another face in the MeToo movement. In that post, she accused the media of focusing too narrowly on instances involving celebrities and powerful figures such as Harvey Weinstein because it reinforces existing stereotypes around gender violence."What gets lost here is the reality that women across industries experience the same thing every day, just maybe aren't as strong and courageous enough to stand up for themselves," the Oct. 20 Facebook post reads."Shaming and blaming won't fix anything. But speaking your truth does give hope to those struggling behind closed doors."
