Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting down other people's points for being wrong or uncivil. So let us start from the beginning. Let's take it as granted that we can't talk about whether atoms are real until after quantum mechanics is developed (which requires new physics). Even if they were available in ancient times, we wouldn't use them because of our uncertainty principle - so even though we may have seen something happen (small changes) over time, there was no way of knowing exactly what happened at any specific point in space-time and therefore Greek atomismEpicurean atomizedm etc could not be tested by using our brain today. So the only viable "evidence" we'd have for these physical theories comes through observation of things happening at various scales, which leads directly into our modern understanding of how Nature works on many different levels... The questions then arise: What sort of evidence do we have? Well the answer might seem obvious but in fact most scientists don't give proper credit to the scientific method. It doesn't matter where your observations come from, what matters is HOW you observe them. The very first step when observing anything is know WHY you're looking. If you didn't understand why you wanted to measure X quantity, then chances of getting an accurate reading of Y outcome will be significantly poorer than measuring Z quality instead. You need to reason make assumptions based upon knowledge before taking measurements in order to ensure repeatable results. This means that you cannot assume ANYTHING about nature unless you've actually measured it yourself! Such reasoning has been shown to work extremely reliably in terms of predicting outcomes of experiments (the law of conservation of energy amongst some others), yet we still see many accusations accusing science as fraudulently deducing nonsense just because someone makes an assumption about reality. And guess who does this all day every day?! Yep, religious leaders claiming that God made everything each morning: Now back to the question; What kind of evidence do we have? We have masses of data collected throughout history, combined with our experiences such as seeing the sky move during storms, hearing thunder, feeling earthquakes, watching clouds change shape etc etc. All of this forms part of the generalised concept known as common sense. Common Sense tells us that objects fall towards Earth due to gravity, that fire causes heat, water cools off, stuff moves around under force and more importantly that if one object hits another an equal amount of kinetic energy gets transferred between them. A small stone dropped onto my head transfers enough pressure through my body to raise the temperature of my blood 2 degrees centigrade while bouncing a few inches up and away releases sufficient energy to spin two fans 1cm per second. When we look outside we notice the planet rotating on its axis as well as surrounding stars moving across the night skies, lightning flashes etc. Water running downhill flows faster than usual, wind blows harder than normal resulting in strong gusts, dust particles floating upwards experience greater drag than usual, raindrops grow larger, honey becomes sticky...these are all phenomena explained by generalised concepts such as momentum transfer whereby forces existing along edges of surfaces create friction-like effects which result in movement. In physics dimensions such as length, width, height, mass, velocity etc become defined as ratios of basic units called SI Units. Length refers to distance covered divided by time taken whilst Velocity measures motion relative to Time (aka speed). Mass is measured in kilograms rather than pounds or ounces. These units get converted into the metric system within minutes of measurement - except sometimes the conversions occur automatically thanks to dimensional analysis. For example, the conversion factor from Newtonian gravitational acceleration g 9.8 metres s2 to CGS (centimetre-gram-second) constant G 6281 m3 kg1 s2 relates mass to volume and vice versa. No matter how odd this seems to anyone not working in Physics, he or she needs to remember that it applies everywhere - including within biology where biological cells reproduce via mitosis simply converting their DNA content to half the size and dividing themselves in half! Once we apply Dimensional Analysis to Nature we end up with characteristics that form relationships such as: Force equals Mass multiplied by Acceleration, Work done on an Object is related to Momentum Transfer Per Second, Energy dissipated increases with increasing Viscosity, Frequency Resonance increases for vibrating Systems,...etc We also find that systems behave according to certain laws similar to rules governing natural phenomena. Most Laws begin with stating an observable effect caused by a particular cause although they often also contain suggestions for future discoveries. Examples include: Ideal Gas Law states that Pressure P relating to Specific Volume v depends upon Temperature T as follows: pv nRT kT Where k 8.31446 J mol1 K1 and R is gas constant and n is Avogadro's Number i.e number of atoms in a mole.
