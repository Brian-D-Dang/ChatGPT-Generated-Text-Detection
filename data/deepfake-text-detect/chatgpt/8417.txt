I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think conservation laws work in physics and their relation with symmetry principles (eigenstates). For example consider an equilibrium system over time such thermodynamics can tell us what happens at any instant t by knowing just its state ho (0) but not on other times or lengths scales: so if we have some kind assumption about symmetries; like translational invariance ensures momentumenergy equipartition etc then these properties will be conserved when changing from one point-like region defined around each particle into another which translates nearby points along same trajectories similarily - otherwise there would need different assumptions made regarding invariant quantities within systems..........so does all stuff become symmetric? why don't physicists assume "everything" has equal probabilities under unknown conditions? i suppose they do instead because everything isn' t well understood yet...
