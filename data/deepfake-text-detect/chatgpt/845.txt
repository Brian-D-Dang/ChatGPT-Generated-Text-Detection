I'd like to preface this by saying that parts of my post may sound like they're bragging, but they're not trying to come across that way. Also, I'm using a negative word here, which I think is an understatement. I'm a proud parent of a beautiful little girl, who happens to have Down syndrome. I'm also a proud person of my accomplishments. I've been able to read all of the books on my shelf and some of those books were actually really good books. The only thing I wish I could do right now is get her a dog.
