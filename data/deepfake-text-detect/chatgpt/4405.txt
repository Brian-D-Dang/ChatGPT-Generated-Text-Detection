To my knowledge there are no peer reviewed sources that link GMOs to any negative health effects. There is as much reason to believe genes manipulated in a lab are safe than those found naturally. We humans have been altering our DNA for thousands of years, but without suffering the side effects we now face with GM crops. The US has around 80 million acres planted each year (half biological and half chemical). In fact if you look back at 1960s, 70 or more biotech was mostly soybeans and corn, both which are not genetically modified organisms. The overall acreage grew from 9 million acres in 1995 to 34 million currently.
