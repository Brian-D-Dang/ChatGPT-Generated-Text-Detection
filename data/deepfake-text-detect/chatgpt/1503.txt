As long as I've been alive, I've always poured milk before cereal. I've done this because I am a textural eater and I hate soggy cereal. I believe that pouring the liquid first helps absorb more of it into my bowl while there's still some air in between the table spoonfuls. I'm the same with cream cheese!
