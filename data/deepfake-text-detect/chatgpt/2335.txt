Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, or considering it an option to raise wages on their own initiative without any federal support; that is what happened several years ago when Alberta raised its minimum hourly wage from 6.95 to 7.50 by September 2015 - a 25 increase over two years! The U.S., which also raises its Federal Minimum Wage annually based upon inflationary pressures, this year hiked up US0.25 per hour bringing the rate for tipped workers like waiterswaitresses up to US2.13 per hour. In Ontario where we have just elected Doug Ford as Premier with majority government status after 15 years of Liberal rule, he campaigned heavily against increasing our Provincial Minium Wages saying businesses were already struggling due to higher labour costs elsewhere across North America making us uncompetitive. Of course here in St Catharines there was no reference made about how much corporations saved each time our local Walmart store closed one of its 4 entrances at a loss while they "invested" millions into renovating stores south of the border to bring them inline with Canadian standards because many Americans still think Canadians get paid more than American counterparts doing similar jobs!!! The fact remains however that some employers prefer paying lower salaries knowing full well employees will rely on public assistance programs such as Food Banks other social services funded through taxes levied from those who do earn decent livings. That practice only harms everyone involved including taxpayers! Here locally people not employed directly in retail fields seem to be having problems finding employment so perhaps Mr Fords statement may prove true once his Bill becomes law but if you dig deeper beneath all the rhetoric most business owners know better now how valuable skilled labour really is. By investing into improving working conditions instead of looking overseas maybe small-to mid sized companies would see improved productivity gains resulting in increased profits? So why does anyone need a living wage anyway??? Well research shows: A worker earning less than poverty level income can qualify for welfare benefits...so clearly a person cannot make ends meet on 11.40 an hour Living below your means essentially means spending less money overall rather then relying solely on low cost loans to keep afloat. Decreases future health care expenses - It reduces stress associated with financial burden. Stress linked to poor nutrition and lack of sleep both contribute toward obesity related diseases such diabetes heart disease. Increases ability to save funds during good times bad allowing individuals greater control of monetary assets allowing easier access to credit should unexpected events arise requiring short term borrowing power. Allows for savings towards retirement saving plans thereby reducing reliance on Government Pension Plans assisting seniors transition smoothly out of workforce. Increases chances of being approved for home mortgage financing enabling families to build equity faster thus helping reduce debt loads. This last point highlights another issue entirely concerning rising housing prices within Niagara region especially along Lakeshore Road West between Thorold East Highway 406 particularly along main thoroughfare Goodyear Avenue in Port Dalhousie where new multi million dollar homes continue springing forth thanks largely to foreign ownership. Why are these properties selling for upwards of 1.5Million Dollars yet some renters struggle to find affordable accommodation renting for under 600 dollars per month?! This situation speaks volumes to me regarding attitudes found among too many upper middle class residents unwilling to step outside their comfort zone to help ease the plight faced by others within society ranging anywhere from providing shelter to food to transportation options etc....until someone literally knocks on my door asking for something.....then suddenly helps magically appear!! So tell me again why am I required to pay child tax credits even though I never had kids? Do governments understand that basic survival needs equate to NOtHING until proven otherwise??
