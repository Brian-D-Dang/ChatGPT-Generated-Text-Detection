WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in this show are truly amazing and inspirational! Now onto other things! Let's talk about a recent episode where I was talking with Lauren Angell (Lauren is one of my favorite guests ever) when we discussed how social media has changed her life forever!! I remember saying back then that social networking had been such an important part of my personal growth as well. Then along comes Facebook right after college...and boom goes my life literally overnight! This whole digital world really makes me realize - I am not only HONORED to be able to share my journey and knowledge but it HAS CHANGED ME FOREVER because now there is no going back even if you want too!! What does this mean? It means that YOU can make changes or change your mindset by doing something like taking daily affirmations. That's why I wanted to highlight some of these beautiful quotes on Instagram so everyone could see them and use them; they work out great at helping our mood and self-talk habits over time: We don't need to wait until tomorrow or next week. We just need to take action today toward achieving what feels good RIGHT NOW. -Anonymous You're unique. You have value worth sharing. And those around you will benefit from knowing who you are.-Benjamin Franklin There's power in telling someone exactly the truth. If you never tell anyone anything they'll never know their best option.-Anne Lamott Stay true to yourself let others do the same.-Unknown It may seem impossible to achieve all day long, BUT IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE IN THE END. Achieving goals doesn't happen every single second...it happens everyday. (The Secret)
