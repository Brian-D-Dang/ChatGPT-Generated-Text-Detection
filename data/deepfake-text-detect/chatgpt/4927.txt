If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is still a good choice if your goal is to improve Chinese and learn Russian at the same time as learning Korean (or speaking Russian). Does anyone know where I can find more information about Chinese? Do they teach it well enough for beginners?
