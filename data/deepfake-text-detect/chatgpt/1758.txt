I have recently been told that my pro-life position is "forcing my ideas on others." I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary. At the heart of this discussion, however, rests a question: Do we truly want to separate ourselves from our beliefs in order to take positions? And what do those beliefs really mean for us as individuals and communities alike? We cannot deny how important these issues are nor can we ignore them because they don't fit neatly into a political agenda. Yet history has shown beyond doubt that politics alone will fail to solve any pressing problems. For example, racism and sexism persist despite decades of anti-racism practices at home and international policy efforts abroad - so much so that many people feel like race relations could be better than ever but still deeply divided amongst themselves (and the rest). The fact remains that when fundamental human rights are violated through violence against marginalized groups such as women, girls, indigenous peoples, immigrants, poor folks, etc., most justifiably demand action from their government; otherwise there would either be no one left to complain about injustices or our society would collapse soon after. However, all too often, governments remain silent while crimes occur which violate basic human rights without consequence due to the pitfalls inherent within democracy itself. For example, Roe v Wade was later overturned by the Supreme Court during the Reagan administration yet again failed to create lasting change around abortion even though it had become increasingly popular among American women who felt forced to travel long distances to access safe abortions elsewhere across the country. Despite public support for abortion rights having increased nearly 15 since 1973, only 42 states now allow unrestricted abortion with very few exceptions. Most other countries whose laws mirror ours either fully ban or severely restrict abortion except where necessary for health reasons, e.g. rape, incest or medical emergencies such as when an embryo becomes malformed before birth which causes it to die shortly thereafter. The remaining 38 states (most notably Louisiana) continue to require doctors to perform ultrasounds prior to performing an abortion which can delay treatment significantly furthering pregnancy complications caused by poverty, bad housing conditions, lack of child care options, trauma experienced in childhood, abuse and neglect, mental illness, racial discrimination, sexual assaultabuse, substance use disorders. In this way, you can see why fewer than half of Americans live in states where abortion is 100. Because more restrictive laws are passed, less women seek out safer, legal alternatives such as traveling to nearby cities outside of state borders. Our own lived experiences tell stories similar to those outlined above. We must move away from narrow ideology towards meaningful difference if we hope to achieve real change together capable of making systemic changes rather than small incremental improvements that never seem to make enough of a dent. This means casting aside simplistic binary thinking toward recognizing multiple perspectives. This also includes refusing to sugarcoat experiences simply bc someone doesn't share your singular perspective, regardless of its validity. It may come off as manipulation to some, but the truth lies somewhere between being honest and manipulative. If we refuse to accept new information which contradicts existing narratives, then we run the risk of becoming blind to reality merely bcus we've grown accustomed to viewing things that way. My life story proves that you can know something isn't true and still pursue it anyway... until you realize its complete nonsense. Whether that's reading up on alternative medicine therapies or taking matters into your own hands, you'll likely find yourself on completely opposite ends of the spectrum. At least twice, I found myself actually doing harm instead of good based solely upon false knowledge and assumptions made years ago... despite knowing full well both negative effects were obvious and positive benefits existed. As I mentioned previously, I am not perfectly comfortable talking openly about my views publicly anymore since sharing my thoughts has led to the same type of backlash I once received over articles published under my previous blogs. But speaking of which, please note that these statements are taken verbatim from emails sent to me personally regarding various social justice movements. These comments represent actual responses shared anonymously online. They do not reflect the opinions held directly by anyone involved including me. Perhaps a better description would be 'unpopular' viewpoints rather than unpopular ones. Nowadays whenever someone expresses differing opinion, whether it be politically or culturally affiliated, everyone jumps down his throat immediately, particularly if he shows signs of lacking a strong understanding of the topic at hand. He'll be accused of ignorance while simultaneously having plenty of time to educate himself and learn how society works after starting college last fall! Although I understand that sometimes coming forward with controversial opinions makes certain positions harder to justify, always remember that neither extreme side deserves respect. Of course, we should strive for peace and unity in every sphere of existence wherein possible. However, to achieve that goal requires honesty first. When arguing back or forth about politics with friends or family members, try to avoid saying anything that would hurt their feelings unless absolutely necessary. Accept that nothing you say will satisfy another person and instead focus on respecting each individual's right to hold different perceptions.
