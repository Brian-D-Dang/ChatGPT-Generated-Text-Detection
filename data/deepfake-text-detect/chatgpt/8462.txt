For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to the debate over sexual assault on UofM's campus and also because my roommate just had his first child (a girl). I've noticed that while it is expected for boys' rooms usually have posters or some other decoration showcasing sports teamshobbies; girls are not presented with anything similar from what i can see (this excludes things like flowers made by themselves etc...). Also guys tend get more gifts through birthdays Christmas as compared women probably since they're likely out doing something fun at these times whereas most young ladies would still remain home during those time periods unless their parents were taking them along shopping which isn't always feasible either when you want your kids around but don't necessarily care about going yourself too much anyway). Is there any reason why? Doesn't men being sexually assaulted make people think twice before leaving someone alone even if he doesn ' ' te she might break into her dormitory later? Why does everyone seem so concerned abotu female safety yet nothing happens almost everytime we leave our dorms late night after class ends?? What do u all say??? It seems unfair!! The females shouldnE2 should worry less than us! We took extra precautionary measures back then!!! Shouldnt WE take precautions now?! Please tell me how ridiculous hearing such thing sounds....to whoever reads thi story!!!! As far am aware no one was ever forced against thier wishes, lastly anyone here thinks its okay letting males walk across paths btwn two buildings unsupervised! Thats insane..i dont understand where wd come up wtih stuffs likethat..it could lead upto rape case...no joke plz help...wht else r ppl gonna complain bout nd blame 4th gender ...ignore everything above!! And please feel free yo reply ASAP........... Peace Out Love You All 3
