Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I don't really want there.- It's a very big wedding for two girls... So many things can go wrong and when they do will make the ceremony all lopsided!-...And then after we started planning everything out everyone is like "You should have bigger parties!Yeah but why?" Well if you had your own venue or something." No one seems too concerned with this except me which makes sense because who wants their friends around drinking (or worse) in public? But some of these same groups try hard not meet up at our actual house party where most guests stay over instead opting into an impromptu street outside mansion just down from us on Sage Rd dressed as soldiers smoking pot etc..I guess what its going through mind right now: So either way i've narrowed nothing smaller gets invited.... (except maybe family). Anyone know any good venuesplaces within 30 minutes driving distance anyone might recommend?? My parents are open minded enough though even tho im sure thayd rather see them somewhere close by mine anyway lol
