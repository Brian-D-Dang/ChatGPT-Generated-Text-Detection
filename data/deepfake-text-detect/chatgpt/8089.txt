I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying it was "insane" to expect our president not only know what he is talking about when making decisions that affect us but also be willing or able (or even desirous) of getting up every single day at 7am in order watch a farmer's almanac for weather reports from some halfway house before taking off on Air Force One somewhere else! Just because Obama doesn't have an interest does NOT mean we should take away his power...we don' need someone who thinks like George W Bush bc they're all alike anyway...are you telling me if there wasn; t any oil companies left then Dubya wouldn 'trever go golfing? If America had no greedy rich people businessmen running around buying more land than necessary so their kids could become multimillionaires while pretending its just good old fashioned hard work perhaps GWB -er Snake Oil salesin'll son might actually get outta bed early enough one mornen'. Just want everyone knows where God came fr'm: The Ronald Reagan School Of Management MBA program....and yes i am being serious hereSnakes are smarter dan most humans - including JFK.....
