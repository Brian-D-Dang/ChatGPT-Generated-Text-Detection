My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in news media, but rarely used outside: Pronoun (pronounced "shin-youji or simply TAIJUANREN " new gender person) literally means New Gender Person [sic]. As a proper noun it's read as shinjinshinren " . It could also mean neue Geschlechtsperson - nengeschuchtrige Personlichkeit Neutschauchruliche. This Japanese coinage was coined by Yasuoka Etsushi to describe transgender people who were born with one sex chromosome set different from their body organs; this includes intersexed femalesmales too if they identify themselves female male etc.. The term has been adopted into English where possible due its simplicity compared other recent terms such 'non binary', non gendered persons. " I wrote an article about NEOGAY which may help them understand why using these newly invented words isn't helping anyone including LGBTQI community because there seems no end on how many ways we have created labels until every single individual feels recognized under each category!
