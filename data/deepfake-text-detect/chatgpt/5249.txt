First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a desire to be able to talk about what we're doing with the hobby and even more importantly enjoy it all along! I mean, everyone should have their own subreddit or something where they post stuff like these things but in other words, why not let fans give us some credit?
