For those who don't know, the trolley problem is this: You and another person are on a bridge which is over a trolley track. 5 people are tied to the tracks, but you can only save one of them by pushing that other person off, killing himher instead. OK? I think they meant more like if it was for example someone's house being on fire vs saving their dog
