First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from a purely intellectual standpoint. I would suggest you make a rule to reserve one of the close spots for the person with the disability, but it's up to the discretion of the owner of the property to enforce this rule. I think the property owner should decide, but it should be a rule that the disability parked first gets the spot, but the owner of the property has the right to enforce the rule. My guess is that if the owner of the property wants to make money from the parking spot, they will have the rules and the enforcement procedure that they want. If the owner of the property doesn't want to make money from the parking spot, then they won't bother to enforce the rule. That is my take on the situation. How does this differ from the standard where you say, "The person in the most need should be first" but leave it to the discretion of whoever is going to control the system to make the determination of who is in the most need? Theoretically, this is a similar system. But if you were to put a sign up saying, "These parking spots are reserved for people with disabilities," the person who is disabled who is in the most need would have no problem parking in the spot. But the person who is not disabled would have a problem with it. If you make a rule to enforce the "people with disabilities" rule, then people will be upset about the rule and the enforcement of the rule. If you don't make a rule to enforce the "people with disabilities" rule, then people will be upset about the rule and the enforcement of the rule. You can't win. Why bother with it? So, let's say you make a rule and you don't enforce the rule. What happens? If the rule is enforced, then some people won't be happy about it. If the rule is not enforced, then some people won't be happy about it. What are we getting out of this? Who is happy? Who is not happy? A lot of people who are not disabled get upset with the idea of people with disabilities taking advantage of people. A lot of people who have disabilities get upset with the idea of people with disabilities taking advantage of people. I think the owner of the property should be allowed to do whatever they want. If they want to reserve the spot for people with disabilities, they can do it. If they don't want to reserve the spot for people with disabilities, they can do it. I'm not a big fan of the idea of making rules and making it harder for people to park. I think we should make it easier for people to park. I agree. I just don't understand why this would be any different than the rule "People with disabilities should be first" if that rule isn't enforced. I agree, but I would enforce the rule. But why make the rule if it's not going to be enforced? I can't think of a reason for making a rule and not enforcing it.
