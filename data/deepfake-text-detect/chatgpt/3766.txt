To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting to the end of the education system in which preparing for it is part of what I do and will surely be something I look back upon with fondness when all this has passed me by, I appreciate your article and think that you have done an amazing job of explaining how the new educational framework works. I've never heard about Common Core until very recently. It was brought up somewhere on Facebook as being introduced during the State of the Union address (can anyone track down her source? Was she lying?) The idea sounds good - it would require our educators to teach students things like statistics and how to use computers properly instead of just memorizing and regurgitating facts from some texts. Maybe we could eventually get rid of standardized tests altogether, though there were so many other issues (when did people stop complaining about those?) that I really don't know too much about its implementation or potential effects. I also agree with the comment made above: I am sure most schools don't even learn these skills because they are taught at home every day! But if teachers can focus on more practical tasks while teaching math if it's common core aligned; then maybe it might help alleviate some of the stress that comes with trying to keep up with certain subjects. If implemented well, perhaps it could become more of an asset than a burden moving forward.
