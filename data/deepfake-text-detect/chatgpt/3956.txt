So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor gender? So why can't they have an opinion on things like race relations in America where there's a massive racial divide that is being ignored by the media? It occurs to me that since we're talking about immutable traits (lacks the ability to feel emotion, for example), then maybe it would be possible to include emotions as part of "racialism." But I don't know enough about biology or psychology to give you solid advice beyond that.
