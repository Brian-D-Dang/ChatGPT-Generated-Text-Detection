While the idea of students sharing a percentage of their future earnings may seem like a fairer system compared to the current student loan system, it also raises several concerns. Firstly, it may put unnecessary pressure on students to pursue high-paying careers in order to pay back their investors. This could discourage students from pursuing fields that are important to society but not necessarily high-paying, such as education or social work. Secondly, it would create a complex financial system that might be difficult for students to understand and navigate. The process of valuing these shares and determining the percentage of future earnings to be shared could be complicated and invite legal battles. Finally, it would be difficult to determine how much investors should expect to receive from students with respect to their investments. Additionally, it may impact the students' ability to afford their basic needs, such as healthcare or emergency expenses. Given all these complexities, a system that requires students to share their future earnings may not be feasible or desirable compared to the current student loan system.
