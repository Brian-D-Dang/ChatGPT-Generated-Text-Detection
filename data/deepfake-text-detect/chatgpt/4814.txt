So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern societies are mixed economies and it is my view that capitalism can work as well or even better than socialism if we know how to do it properly, given enough time (and less power corrupts). The first thing one needs to establish in any society is that there's a basic level of social safety net - minimum standard of livinghealth etc.. Ideally then both parties should invest, either directly-like Labour invests into public healthcare through NHS hospitals or private companies investing into research and development; or indirectly through tax breaks for certain sectors (capitalism). The latter would create more jobs overall so you could lower taxes further while still ensuring everyone has at least some chance of not being plunged back below the poverty line because they've been working all day feverishly developing their next big hit TV series only to get laid off when the bubble bursts.
