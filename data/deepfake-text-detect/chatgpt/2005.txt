So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But also in terms of women's equality, we should be looking at this as an opportunity to reset expectations about how you balance work with family life." The study found a clear link between parental leaves offered and gender-based wage gaps; among working fathers who didn't take advantage of company policies for taking time off during their child's early years, men earned 532 less per month than those whose companies had put formal supports into place. For mothers without paid sick days or other benefits on offer from employers, the earnings gap was even greater - nearly 1,000 less. And while half of all parents polled said they would like more flexibility around when they could take caregiving breaks (and many actually did so), just 4 percent were able to do exactly what they wanted to. Even if there aren't official policy changes being discussed specifically related to parenting time, "I don't see why private sector organizations wouldn't want employees back after six months," DiPietro says: absent some sort of extenuating circumstance, she thinks most workers will return right away because people look forward to seeing colleagues again and getting projects up and running once things start reopening post coronavirus shutdowns. New York City parent Jen Huertas agrees. She takes partial custody during her daughter Eliza's school year, which means going in every week day but staying home weekends. When schools closed down earlier this spring due to COVID-19 concerns, she took two weeks off unpaid and has been using vacation days since then. Now that summer break has started though, she'll likely have plenty of free time over the next few months before heading back fulltime come fall. She'd love to save them for future use later in 2020 or 2021 - but knows that may never happen given the uncertainty of everything else happening now. So instead, she plans to clock out soon and check in remotely until September rolls around well enough.
