I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by telling them they stink. It depends what you mean "stink." If someone smells bad enough that everyone can smell it when he walks into the room then there is no reason not to say something.
