A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that region of the world as a whole, not just within an individual country. The reason for this is because it's really hard to make conclusions about languages based on their use and popularity when no information whatsoever exists regarding how these languages are used at all in any other countriesregions. By regional dialects, I mean those whose speakers have traditionally been geographically isolated from eachother, e.g. Inuit regions such as Nunavut; Chinese provinces like Hebei province; American states like Missouri versus Texas; etc., due to historical reasons starting around the 19th century onwards. Note also that there are some exceptions made here since some groups may be culturally closer than expected or even shared the same linguistic heritage with another. For example, Korean does indeed share history with Japanese, but they aren't considered part of one single dialect group anymore since Korea became independent nation-state sometime after Japan lost WW2. Similarly, Finnish has existed alongside Swedish before, but today both are considered separate "dialect" families nonetheless.
