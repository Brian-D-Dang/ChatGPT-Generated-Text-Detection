I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural challenge and at worst a catastrophe. Just think about eating something with two pieces of chopsticks. If I want to grab a piece of food and put it in my mouth I need to figure out which piece to use and which to hold. In the case of a rice bowl I would need to use the spoon like part of the chopsticks to get rice and put it in my mouth with the other side. That works out fine, but what if there was a meatball in my mouth, should I hold the chopsticks with the wooden part pointing up or down? I often have to consult someone at the table for help. If they tell me to hold the chopsticks with the wood pointing up, I ask them to show me how to put the meatball in my mouth. It usually turns out to be difficult, but when I finally manage to figure out how to put the meatball in my mouth I have to check if the chopsticks are still pointing up or down. Then there are the bowls with two compartments where you eat. I usually have to put a piece of food in my mouth and then ask someone to tell me which compartment to put it in. If it is a good dish I will always get a "go here" or "no no, it goes there" reply. When I finally get the piece of food into the right compartment I usually have to check again if the chopsticks are still pointing up or down. Eating Chinese food is like a sport. It takes time and practice to get better. I usually end up getting some of the food and then having to toss it in the trash.
