Cigarettes are the leading cause of preventable death, responsible for roughly 480,000 deaths per year in the US. 41,000 of those deaths aren't even those of users they are the result of secondhand smoke (i know that most smokers don't think about it like this but you get my point). I understand why some people want to ban smoking indoors as a habit; I'm not trying to equate whether or not something should be banned with personal decisions on how one chooses to live their life...but there is no way tobacco companies would ever consider banning cigarettes and other products related to them from being sold at gas stations. Not only do they generate billions off of selling cigarette brands alone, but when you're driving down the road after filling up your car what's more important: making sure all drivers have fresh air while on the go OR putting another 10 into your pocket? What makes you pick the former over the latter? It wouldn't matter if someone else was buying cigs for me either because guess which product will sell out first?? Cigars! And yet we still can't buy cold beer in grocery stores unless we stop by an actual liquor store....even though both contain alcohol. This whole argument comes down to money.....and unfortunately folks tend to forget who benefits financially when things such as this are decided upon. You hear politicians talk about "doing the right thing" so often these days..how many times must we hear about our children dying before they start listening??? One metaphor used frequently during campaigns is having a penny dropped from a great height onto your head....the idea behind it is that the drop isn't dangerous but that drop could kill you. How many kids need to die before lawmakers finally take action?? There are far too many examples around us where we see laws passed based solely on emotion and not reason.....but again, I digress. The fact remains that our government spends billions every year doing nothing significant except passing legislation designed to make stupid rich people richer than they already are. When we were talking about politics earlier today I mentioned how hard it is sometimes to remember WHY you voted for said person......well here goes another example of why voting matters; it doesn't just affect yourself personally it affects EVERYONE you come across along your journey through LIFE. So next time your readinghearing any politician speak about "taking care of business," ask yourself...is this really taking care of business? Or does it look bad due to public opinion but ultimately benefit the very same group of individuals who put candidates in office? These are questions we shouldn't blindly accept without questioning....they may seem silly but I assure you they are much more important than simply saying yes or no. Ask yourselves questions instead of accepting answers without understanding what exactly is going on behind closed doors. If I could edit a headline to sum everything up....it might read something like this - "Politicians would rather spend millions of dollars allegedly fighting terrorism then actually fight terrorists."
