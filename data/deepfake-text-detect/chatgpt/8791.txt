In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals . We see the abuse of animals, not just in the UK but also everywhere. Just last week I saw a dog park at my local park being abused by a friend after she had her dog on rent for 10 months as part of an animal welfare scheme. It's outrageous that someone would care more about animals and people if they could buy them food than it does for us animals.
