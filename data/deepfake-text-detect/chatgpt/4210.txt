When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Tatooine, they encounter Watto, a junk dealer who owns two slaves, Anakin Skywalker and his mother Shmi. When Qui-Gon learns he cannot buy them off with money alone, he offers to trade them for what he needs: any of the Sith's titles or weapons. In exchange, Watto gives him the title "Master of The Force" (a power that is equal to that of a Jedi Master in Star Wars). In Return of the Jedi, when the Jedi Council departs from Padawan training, Obi-Wan uses this as an excuse to leave Dooku behind, as well as to free Jango Fett from slavery in Kashyyyk. Obi-Wan also substituted "the Force" for "The Lightsaber," which became canonized in A New Hope.
