Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll try to reply back with more details once in the morning. Thanks for your help! There's no harm in being kind, though. It can be hard enough just not understanding how to start or stop something at the same moment. Also, it's terrifying, I'm sure there are lots of people who will comment and maybe say they're sorry that they felt this way. But if you do see someone struggling to find joy or something else positive with their life, they should be uplifted by what you've done - in my opinion.
