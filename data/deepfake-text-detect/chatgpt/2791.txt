Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions but is badly led and has made some poor decisions lately. I think the recent revival of social justice as a political issue in America originated from both the 2008 crash and Occupy Wall Street. The Democratic Party had hoped to win back white working class voters who were flocking towards Donald Trump's populism so they decided to put forward their own populist candidate in Hillary Clinton (although she was further right on economic issues than Obama). This strategy failed miserably for two reasons: firstly although there was no doubt that rich people were getting richer while middle income families were struggling economically; secondly because nobody really cares about gender pay equality or transgender bathroom rights when they're worried about whether or not their jobs are going to be replaced by robots any day now. The smart thing would've been to keep quiet about "social issues" until after 2020, but instead Democrats gave lip service to all sorts of fringe leftist causes like abortion which only makes sense if you ignore everything else happening.
