I don't even know where to start. I am generally a happy and healthy person. I was raised Catholic. I am not a strict Catholic. I enjoy the community of my home church, but it isn't our mission here in Germany anymore." The judge said that the prosecution had asked for a prison sentence of two years after the prosecution failed to establish the jury theory of innocence based on the evidence presented against Leutnant von Namestrom in the case even though there were statements from witnesses who testified about Leutnant von Namestrom's behavior during dating events at the time. Leutnant von Namestrom is being prosecuted because he admits having sex with Leutnant von Namestrom while he was under 21 months pregnant when they divorced. Von Namestrom admitted to having sex with Leutnant von Namestrom before Leutnant von Namestrom gave birth. Von Namestrom also confessed to having sex with Leutnant von Namestrom without Leutnant von Namestrome consent despite being convicted by the court of violating Leutelin's civil rights. On Thursday, Leutnant von Namestrom pleaded guilty to that charge as part of his plea bargain agreement with prosecutors. Von Namestrom has been ordered sentenced to three years' probation after pleading guilty earlier this month. He will be released after serving half of his sentence.
