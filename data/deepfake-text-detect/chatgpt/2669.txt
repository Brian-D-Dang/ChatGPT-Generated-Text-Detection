People who have no interest in politics, and are not interested in learning about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it its their civic right. If you don't like something then change it but stop trying to get other people involved because I guarantee they won't care or will actually wind up making things worse It's my civic duty as an American citizen to vote for whomever I choose regardless of how much research I've done on them since there is only one candidate per office available at any given time.
