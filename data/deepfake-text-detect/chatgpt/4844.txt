When I see debate about'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about'evidence'. If they shift on these questions - at all - it's very often because a new'study' has been released that convinces them differently. This attitude is evident in the way most people dismiss reason and logic when they want to claim that their preferred answer actually represents fact. Climate science denialism is an excellent example of this phenomenon: Scientists are dismissed as paid liars by those who know nothing else, while conspiracy theorists find out there was no massive cover-up (or even any big research programs). Those who disagree with your worldview have an obvious agenda; to you, they're just wrong. Facts be damned! And so you ignore anyone calling into question the narrative you prefer. As long as the right-wing position seems true to you, then not only are facts irrelevant but also truth itself. The idea that one can ever learn anything from another person's point of view never occurs to anyone. Shouldn't we try harder? Don't we owe something to ourselves? Why should we defer to someone else if they've got some other perspective for us to consider?! There really doesn't need to be any credibility gap between our opponents and ourselves; why on earth would listening to what they say lead anywhere? It'd be unthinkable not to pay attention to how their views differ; afterall, they wouldn't bother talking otherwise, would they? Why even listen to them? What could possibly come from such a waste of time? They obviously couldn't provide anything useful, which means they must surely lie about everything. So let's just shut up, won't we? Let's treat everyone equally, regardless of how much we might dislike them ideologically. After all, isn't every group equal - starting with identity politics? We'll judge everybody according to their motives, their level of interest in us, their place within society, etc., without being biased toward certain groups over others - who clearly aren't good enough! This 'not judging people' approach to discourse works great for two reasons. One, overshooting the mark leads to accusations of bigotry. Two, making assumptions based on biasprejudice allows everyone to start off with a different set of biases, so that almost nobody ends up having to confront the things they refuse to believe exist. This "it's okay to assume" thing feels perfect. And yet...and yet... If you've followed the tea party movement since its inception, chances are good that you already knew this. But this revelation offers priceless insight. In case it hasn't occurred to you before now, here's what the evolution myopia meme reveals about conservatives and liberals alike. Consider this rhetorical device used by numerous conservative pundits during President Obama's first term: "In terms of priorities, Republicans became more liberal than Democrats..." By juxtaposing Democratic positions against Republican ones, the implication was clear - Democratic beliefs were too extreme for mainstream America. Liberals had gone nuts. Liberal progressivism was costing Americans jobs. The economy had tanked under Barack Obama; the president's policies were killing capitalism. The same technique was deployed frequently regarding Obamacare - that it represented exactly what Republicans warned would happen back in 2009. Now, however, we have a little deeper understanding of where their fears came from. According to Gallup polling data analyzed by Michael Tesler, political orientation predicts whether voters support particular pieces of legislation, as well as the likelihood that each piece will pass Congress. Simply put: People listen carefully to what politicians tell them and filter whatever information flows through their ears accordingly. It turns out that people listen closely not simply to what candidates promise, but to what pundits make available to them. On key voting matters, ideological ambivalence was reduced significantly among undecided voters once pundits endorsed specific pieces of legislation - particularly tax cuts - rather than offered vague criticism of Obama administration proposals. For instance, partisanship affected attitudes towards repealing health reform far less when media personalities expressed opinion on the issue rather than waiting until polls closed. The implications go beyond health reform: Public support for Obama went down considerably following the release of his State of the Union address. His overall popularity cratered due to pervasive coverage of the speech. What does it mean to be intellectually lazy? Well, doing precisely what the title says implies: Lazy thinking begins with assuming things happened before someone gets around to proving it. Some folks may enjoy the delicious irony of arguing x vs y based purely upon preconceived notions of x and y, but I suspect few humans take delight in looking foolish. That said, though, intellectual laziness works best if applied exclusively to your own side (as Thomas Kuhn observed): Most scientists are lazy thinkers. Not, of course, absolutely lazy thinkers [but] still...lazy thinkers. Whatever bad effects arise from universal laziness are offset by virtue of programmatic stupidity, i.e. for this great, if needed certainly effective sage-now becomes dominant volume 15 market value opinionative enterprise.
