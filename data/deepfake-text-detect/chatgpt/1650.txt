Countries need children in order to sustain themselves, without a younger generation the country will not advance and will not be able to sustain itself. Elderly will not be able to provide for their families or work as well (in most cases) so they rely on the next generation of young people who would continue doing what their parents could do if only there were some. This is why I believe that we should invest more into education myself included; because it's simply cheaper than any other possible investment you can make! But before we do this let us look at what has been done with funds already allocated towards quality health services across Africa: nothing! A lot of money was spent but no tangible improvements have happened since. We are currently out here discussing how these same countries must increase healthcare spending which then leads off onto yet another topic! Education needs to go beyond just books learning sets. It also includes mental literacy, social skills, societal awareness etc and yes even civic duty. The media plays an important role especially when trying to bring attention to issues such as gender inequality and parental neglectabuse amongst many others. As schools develop programmes addressing these areas, we may see less problems within schools but worse among our society. However creating new programs requires educating ourselves first about them thus taking up time required from students' studies
