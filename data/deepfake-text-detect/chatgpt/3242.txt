As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They can prevent head injury in the event of an accident or collision, reduce the likelihood and severity of concussions, protect the brain from trauma, and improve overall safety while cycling. Furthermore, many countries have laws mandating helmet use for cyclists, and failure to wear one can result in fines and legal repercussions. Ultimately, wearing a helmet is a simple and effective way to protect oneself while enjoying cycling.
