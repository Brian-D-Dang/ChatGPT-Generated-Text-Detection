Not trying to start a flame war, I'm looking for a new tablet and I would consider an ipad, but I just don't see the appeal just yet. What on earth is up with Apple products? I had one of their laptops before my desktop (which was built by me) died last year when it got water in the harddrive. It broke down within two years. And they wouldn't let me fixreplace my laptop because they didn't want me doing that myself which kinda pissed me off since the thing was at least 5-6 years old at that point...
