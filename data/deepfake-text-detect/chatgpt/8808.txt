The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here] . Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things . Religion stands for the belief that God is always right and even when we believe in him, he takes care of his own." Along with reading this article (and others) I discovered that the "freedom" they offer to atheists they are not even willing to share their beliefs with Christians without justification. That's more than writing a letter someone else wrote. It just makes me feel like they are discriminating against me because of my religion. That's really embarrassing! Have faith. You could be Christian, atheist, atheist... you're either not religious at all or you've never been raised Catholic. If your religious then yeah go ahead, but come on now. What do you want people to think about you? Do you believe in god? Would you back up religions if they did and why?
