America has accomplished nothing in its history that makes it worth of such widespread pride and love by its people (particularly this time of the year). Every event that Americans are proud to brag about is a contributing factor towards their national debt which now exceeds USD 14 trillion. I wonder how many patriots shouted "USA" when they were cheering on America's rise as world leader? I think what most people fail to realize, or even care for, is who benefits from all these events...especially sporting ones. All those athletes making millions upon millions off the sweat and blood of American taxpayers. Big Sports Leagues have become the new aristocracy. Who else would you expect to pay for multi-million dollar stadiums for billionaires team owners if not US taxpayers?? And then there comes the inevitable public subsidy: tax dollars spent on corporate welfare and stadium bailouts. It just never ends.... What exactly does John Stewart do anyway? He uses comedy and satire to make fun of anyone he disagrees with politically and is constantly bashing conservatives while praising Democrats. Such an ignorant tool!
