During the first week alone [32 million people] downloaded a copy of a Game of Thrones episode. Even if only 1 of those people keep the file they downloaded after one month, that's still over half-a-million downloads per day! The number seems even more staggering when you consider it was just ONE DAY during which HBO saw this massive spike in traffic - and only from torrent sites (not including direct download or on-demand services). HBO is currently offering customers an opportunity to watch HBO GO for free for seven days with no cable subscription required as part of its "Summer of Free TV" campaign; however, we doubt anyone would get much use out of these episodes before the free trial runs up since most pirated files are removed by major BitTorrent trackers within hours of their release online.
