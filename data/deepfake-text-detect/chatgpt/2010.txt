Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be a basic human right for everyone in America: liberty and freedom from arbitrary search by police officers who are using every means at their disposal (the Patriot Act) - which includes violating your privacy on a massive scale with no oversight whatsoever - just because they want too. 4. "If we don't have rights" Yes you do...but where does it say that these kinds of searches have to occur? They're invasive wasteful. Mobile phones can record video without GPS. Nowadays many cellphones include cameras as well. The fact remains that police departments still use helicopters to spy on citizens when there's NO REASON TO DO SO! That's wrong. 5. Police brutality is an issue; however, being against all types government intrusion into our lives doesn't mean one isn't also concerned about innocent bystanders getting hurt during lawful arrestsstings etc. (see Rodney King). Does anyone really think criminals would stop committing crimes simply because cops got better training? Someone has already pointed out how professional athletes train today compared to 30-40 years ago (video recording drills, time elapsed between each drill recorded graphed so coaches could analyze progress, smart nutritionist, sleep studies)...and let me tell ya....it ain't stopping them!! It might slow down crime rates over 10 but won't eliminate them altogether like some pretend will happen. Do drugs kill more Americans than guns?? No..not even close. In other words while police reform initiatives may help decrease excessive force incidents occurring nationwide among police agencies, overall violent crime levels in major cities across Canada and Europe haven't gone up since 911 either (so go ahead pull your head in before you turn blue), nor did gun violence skyrocket after any new legislation was passed anywhere else in those countries, despite us having stricter laws here then most places overseas. Besides statistical evidence proves otherwise anyway...people aren't stupid. Criminals don't follow rules anyways, why would they start now given the chance??? If anything politicians trying to crack down only causes more harm bc fear facts (NRA VS Reality check .c omnra-vs-reality-check-2011-9) So keeping things illegal hasn't helped curbing drug smuggling or gang activity, yet its somehow magically going to stop terrorists??? Yeah ok buddy. And lets talk 1st amendment matters next...I'll wait...... This pseudo war on terror crap gets old real quick especially considering none of it makes sense realistically speaking." 6. "Preparing for disasters is important" Illegal surveillance state tactics used domestically helps to ensure public safety disaster preparedness........what part of that sentence confuses some folks.....?"prepare" as with the US military industrial complex prepares itself financially via tax dollars spent yearly. Obviously DHS needs money flowing through various facets within Homeland Security due to budget cuts elsewhere such as education, healthcare, welfare ect..trying justifying billions upon bilions wasted on useless weapons programs or defense budgets expenditures abroad instead of investing back home repairing infrastructure defects n repairs needed throughout the country, while simultaneously cuttingback domestic jobs creating less revenue generated locally which further strains deficit spending issues. Hows that workin' guys???? You know whats actually helping deter terrorism though? Not invading sovereign nations destroying entire societies killing thousands of civilians causing millions displaced refugees moving around destabilizing regions providing vacuums for business opportunities for terrorist organizations recruiting members worldwide along side local populations hating American troops occupying foreign soil resulting in anti american sentiment leading towards extremism both sides recruits fresh blood pouring thru refugee camps mosques everywhere fueling hatred toward western civilization equating to extreme views held by extremists contributing directly to recruitment pools of future potential homegrown radicalized jihadists!!!
