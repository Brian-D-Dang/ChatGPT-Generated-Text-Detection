So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because of a subpar performance.com article that stated he had been flagged for a few things including toxicity over Twitter and his tweets being suspiciously sarcastic towards players who have said they didn't receive messages from strangers on twitter. Last week several players were fined or suspended with zero suspensions issued by FIFA following the suspension of players via twitter posts expressing their anger at the ruling as well as an investigation into the online trolls. This is an interesting point to consider.. A reward of up to 10 million will be handed out if appropriate fines are required against anyone involved in these incidents; however no punishment has been commented yet regarding the amount given due to FIFA having no formal punishments pending after a lengthy investigation by the FIFA Ethics Committee which concluded there was nothing wrong between the parties (which does mean that it would actually make sense for FIFA to reimburse players), so far none have received any punishment thus far. Furthermore, it seems like this type of behaviour isn't tolerated anywhere else except those involving FIFA rules violationsabuse; the more egregious examples include a tweet that said "When we do something wrong, our message should never be misinterpreted!." However, FIFA Club World Cup organisers often put forward opinions about where things stand when discussing possible sanctions ahead of tournaments such as the World Cup finals just before each tournament meaning decisions made earlier than anticipated can cause problems down the line although FIFA haven't officially announced anything since the meetings took place last year. Lastly, FIFA are also dealing with allegations of bias concerning positive comments made during matches practices prior to matches - cross dressing which focuses attention away from others brings scrutiny onto everyone involved.
