I'd like to preface this by saying that parts of my post may sound like they're bragging, but they're not trying to come across that way. Also, I'm using a lot of personal experience and "anecdotal" evidence so please don't take it too seriously if something sounds familiar or goes beyond what you've heard before (or even thought about). The Fastest Growing Tech Company in the World? Fastly is one of those companies where there's lots of buzz around them right now - especially since the company went public on May 2nd. Now with their IPO under their belt, many people are looking for some stats to back up all their hype. Not only have we got their financials, but also how fast they grew from 2012-2016. So let me tell you the tale. Quick Overview [Source: Fastly] To start off, let's talk about revenue growth. According to data provided by Business Insider, they saw 3x year over year revenue growth. This means they were growing at 1200 during that time period! That doesn't even include 2016's crazy surge because of GDPR rules. They say 28 million customers use their services each month. WOWzers! There was no end of money coming into the company last year as well! But wait, it can get better... How did this happen? Well, according to CEO Stacey Spence, "we built the world's fastest cloud platform." She says that almost every service provider has tried building a faster version of their system, but most just weren't successful. But then she talks about how her team worked hard to make sure their technology always kept pace with increasing demand. And that definitely paid off! Her words: "With our unique architecture, our data centers are geographically distributed, serving millions of customers around the globe," adding that "the speed of response and customer satisfaction made us number 1." Wowza. She mentions that over 90 of Fortune 1000 companies use Fastly as their main load balancer. She says over 76 billion requests per day are sent through their network, which works out to be 200 requests per second. Wowza again! What percentage of total traffic comes from users connecting directly via an IP address versus using Cloudflare or Akamai or somewhere else? Well, that figure isn't available yet, but I would imagine it's pretty high given the amount of traffic they handle. So how much does Fastly charge per request? It depends on the size of your site. For example, Fastly charges 0.07 per request, while CloudFlare charges 0.069 per request - not bad considering that it takes them 9-10 seconds to serve a single page. The cost split between Google and Amazon ranges anywhere from 11-25, so that leaves quite a bit left over for other providers. Compared to most other web hosting providers, you should see Fastly as being cheap compared to others. In terms of server space, we talked about a ton of storage options and bandwidth, but here's another interesting thing to consider once you think of how many servers Fastly handles. In addition to handling all that traffic, the company runs multiple datacenters to help reduce latency issues. Each datacenter averages 15k VPS machines running 247. When talking about processing power that's a whole different story. Having so many processors ensures that every customer gets great performance without any lag or lags. While Fastly claims that 98 of responses arrive within 0.5 milliseconds when doing a simple query, that's still pretty impressive. When everything is working properly, that's basically the norm these days. There you go - Fastly is undoubtedly the top web host available today. Their model definitely requires a little more work than typical web hosts though, which makes it harder to recommend. If you need less dedicated or specialized support than Fastly offers, there are plenty of other solid offerings out there. However, if you want to build a scalable website and don't mind paying extra for it, there really isn't anything better out there.
