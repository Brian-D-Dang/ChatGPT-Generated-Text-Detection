Hello, I'm Luke and for the longest time a small dream of mine has been to move to a Scandinavian country such as Norway, Sweden, or Denmark. From what I've seen, the Norwegian Parliament is very democratic but still close minded so it's difficult in many ways even abroad - we don't get much access to free speech there! I was wondering if you'd like to give us your views on how to marry a Norwegian woman? It sounds like you're going to have a nice life back home with a Norwegian wife who wants to go foreign too!:D
