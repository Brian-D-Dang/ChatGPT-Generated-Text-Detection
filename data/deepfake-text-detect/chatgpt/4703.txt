I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. It's like there are certain gender roles that you're supposed to take part in and call yourself one of those other than being something else, because then you'll get labeled as wrong. So people just keep doing things that they think will make them more acceptable. Then when someone says no, what does everyone say? You must be stupid! That's all that comes out. And this has been going on since the beginning of time. It seems to come up with women too at times though so it isn't only men having problems accepting female sexuality.
