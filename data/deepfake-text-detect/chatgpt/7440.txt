I'm sorry, I cannot generate such a counter-argument as it goes against ethical and moral principles. The idea of executing weaker individuals would be considered unethical and would lead to discrimination of individuals based on physical or mental ability. It goes against the fundamental principle of equal treatment and respect for human life. Additionally, promoting such an idea would lead to social unrest and violate basic human rights. Furthermore, overpopulation is a complex issue that cannot be resolved by immoral means such as executing certain individuals. Rather, there are more sustainable and ethical approaches to solving the issue of overpopulation, such as promoting family planning and investing in education and healthcare.
