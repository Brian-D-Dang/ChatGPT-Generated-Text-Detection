To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting into college (I'm going to enter the eighth grade in September), these expectations make me feel anxious and worried because it seems like there are so many things for us kids to do in order to be successful later on in life... but also because they seem complicated! The first thing you need to know about common core is that all students will not have to meet ALL of the ideas or concepts covered by this program.. It would be impossible to cover everything here at one time... But what "common core" does try to accomplish with its topics being taught throughout the year is to give students an idea as to how much knowledge we really SHOULD acquire through our education system and after completing High School... That is why when you look up the list of competencies given out by "common core," you see such mundane lists such as: reading comprehension, writing essaysassignments, math facts ... These may SEEM very boring subjects on their own. And yes,sometimes they do get old after long periods of practice; BUT it doesn't mean that we shouldn't continue learning them just because THEY BORING TO US!!! We can never deny the fact that If we don't understand certain aspects of mathematics and science then chances are good we won't survive too well outside of modern society.... Not only that but we all must remember that ACTUALLY LEARNING MATH IS TOTALLY HARDER THAN IT LOOKS. Math isn't always easy to teach to any child no matter the age group.. Shocking right? So yeah... This subject matters more than most people think and if we want educate ourselves well enough AND live a fulfilling life off of this earth, WE NEED GOOD SCIENCE AND MATHS SKILLS!!! Don't ever forget that!!
