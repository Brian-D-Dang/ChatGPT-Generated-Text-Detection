In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me in our community, as well at least one person who was transformed by it into a huntergatherer for Christ! A lot more than you would think actually but that's another thing altogether... Not only did Jesus transform not just His immediate followers (the Twelve) from being willing food collectors with Him during their time together on earth BUT He also changed ordinary tax farmers like Judas when he joined them after his betrayal so they were able become intimate friends indeed WITH GOD HIMSELF AND BE HIS FRIENDS IN THIS PRESENT LIFE TOO WHILE ON EARTH even though each had previously been enemies or rivals before God saved him - Jeremiah 17:14-16; Zecharia 9 10). It makes sense doesn't much try? The blood sacrifice system which angered Jehovah caused men such hatred against Himself why else create human beings if there wasn't something special about us other then animals too??? But here we see what unique relationship HE HAD CREATED between himselfand mankind through Abraham back thousands upon thousand years ago using animal sacrifices until THEY FAILED TO ATTRACT THEIR HUMAN BROTHERS' ATTACHMENT THUS CAUSEING THEM SEPARATION FROM TRUTH FOREVER INTO DARKNESS!!! And yet within hours OR DAYS AFTER JESU CHANGER EVERY MAN OF THAT COMMUNITY AS WE SEE HERE BY JOHN WAS NOW ABLE ONE ANOTHER EVEN DEATH IT IS TRUE OVER AGAIN NOT JUST FEET WALK ACCORDIGLY CLOUD STRIKETH SILENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 AMONG US ALL..... Yep under grace alone no strife whatsoever.... now get over yourself luv ya friend xxoooxoxo 3
