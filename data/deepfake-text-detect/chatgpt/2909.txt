Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word mariage, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to days belleza (beauty) and other old Latin words for marriage like matrimonium or bachelorum it's all connected I think Even though Marriage is an institution of religion but its also been used by politics in many countries even when there are no religions involved at all so why can't you have civil unions? Like isn't that what they're really called...you know, not marriages, just civil unions because legally thats all we want anyway
