This CMV was inspired by this post: I believe that being obese is a disability. Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out. It's a disability that a person has no control over. It is not their fault that they are overweight. It's not something that they can fix on their own. It's not a choice. It's not something that the person can control. They can control what they eat, and how much they eat. But they can't control if they are born with a faster metabolism, or a slower metabolism. They can't control the amount of weight that they put on during their pregnancy. They can't control their family history. They can't control what they eat during puberty. They can't control their genetics. I know that not everyone who is obese is disabled, but the majority are. It's a disability that is not a choice. You're born with it. It's not something that you can control. And, for those who have it, they are not responsible for it. When I was growing up, my grandmother was obese. She had a slow metabolism. She also had to take diabetes medication to control her blood sugar. My mother was obese when she was pregnant with me, so I was born with a higher-than-normal BMI, which was most likely genetic. I had high blood sugar when I was a child, and was told by doctors that I needed to lose weight to control it. I tried, but was unable to. I was born with it, and could not control it. My obesity is a disability. My aunt is obese, and has had to have gastric bypass surgery to help control her weight. She was unable to keep her weight off, even though she did everything she could to lose weight. She didn't eat much, she exercised, and did everything she could. She's not obese because she doesn't care, or because she doesn't try. She's obese because of genetics. She is disabled by her obesity. Someone who chooses to be obese is not disabled by their obesity. They are not disabled by their inability to control their weight. They can choose to eat healthy foods, and exercise. They can choose to avoid eating foods that will make them gain weight. They are disabled because they chose to be obese. And, they are disabled because they are morally and ethically wrong for choosing to be obese. I hope that people will understand that being obese is a disability that not everyone has control over. It is not a choice. It's not a person's fault. They didn't do anything wrong. It's not a matter of self-control. Some people can control their weight, and some people cannot. And, being obese is not something that anyone should be judged for. This is a CMV post. I would like to hear your thoughts on this topic. This is a CMV post.
