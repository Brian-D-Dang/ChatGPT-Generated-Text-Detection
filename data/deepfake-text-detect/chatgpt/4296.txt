I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is a great example of a fine line between advocacy and activism, and I'm glad he's being careful here. Sanders has been outspoken on racial issues since before I was born. He's not some idiot who doesn't care about black lives or anything like that. But you're right there's no need to make him out to be some kind of racist because he supports affirmative action. There really isn't any reason to associate this kind of stuff with Bernie.
