I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other media that is part of their lives, and then go on to buy them a bunch of stickers. It's usually full size, if you're looking for something a little more formal, maybe an ID card, or some kind of dorm ticket stub. I doubt that there are any thousands of tattoos at a school and you can't tell through pictures.
