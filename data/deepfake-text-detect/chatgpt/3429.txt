I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends That's completely okay! Not everyone enjoys the taste of coffee, and that's perfectly normal. Just like with any food or drink, our taste preferences vary greatly from person to person. There is no need to force yourself to like something just because others enjoy it. You can still enjoy socializing with friends who like coffee without feeling obligated to drink it. It's important to listen to your body and find what works best for you.
