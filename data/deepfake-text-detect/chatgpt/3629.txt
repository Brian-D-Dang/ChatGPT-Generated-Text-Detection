With the advent of self-driving vehicles, the unavoidable will become clear: people are terrible drivers, and operating your own car is unacceptably reckless if a better alternative exists. I see your point. Self-driving vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce accidents and fatalities caused by human error. Additionally, they could improve traffic flow and reduce congestion on roadways. However, it is important to ensure that proper regulations and safety measures are put in place to prevent any unforeseen issues with these vehicles. As technology advances, it is crucial that we adapt and integrate these advancements into our daily lives in a safe and responsible manner.
