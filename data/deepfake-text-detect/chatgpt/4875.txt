I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are very similar. Just read this article: Most importantly for me that is one of the biggest obstacles between us muslims (and other religions) and westerners... tolerance! I believe it's great to learn from others cultures but there comes a time when you have to respect your own opinions and beliefs no matter how hard they may be. I am looking forward to watching some of his clips just to say "ah yes he contradicts himself" or something like that). Not really an expert about Islam though, so don't know if that was possible through him. Ultimately it doesn't really matter what kind of religion we follow as long as everyone can respect eachother. But still, needless to say, hope people will find Jihadi John's video useful for their studies. Peace out!:) Comments (6) My name is Zaid Belkadi i live in Saudi Arabia. It's means "the kingdom of the prophet Muhammad (PBUH)." And its considered as the most respected country by many Muslims around the world. That's why many Muhammdan consider living here a blessing especially after Quran was revealed more than 1400 years ago. Mecca and Madina are well known because it has two holy cities,Quran was sent down at both place, Al Moustafa mosque (in Mecca), Deaf heaven house (in madina) etc.. And also This city had lot of worshippers visit all year round except hajj season which happens once every 52 months. Many famous Muslim scholars study there more than 1300 plus Scholars studied at al moudjahid college where is located near al masjed saudi arabia, many Islamic schools were opened too (Al azhar university etc.), almost everything related to Islam history research was done in this area. It is said only two countries can compare with Saudia Arabi regarding Islaam knowledge (either within middle east or outside world): Egypt Pakistan. As You can see now the number three following them would be Uzbekistan. I want to share few interesting facts with you: 1.The SAUDIA KINGS HAD BEEN MUSLIM BEFORE ISLAAM WAS AVAILABLE IN THIS COUNTRY. When Prophet Mohammed PBUH came to Medina Tashreef Qiblah in order to invite non believers to become muslims. The first king who accepted Islam was Abdullah ibn Abdul Muttalib Abu Abd Allah Ibn Sulayaman who declared Lord Salalmai as god before converting into Islam. He later followed the guidance given by his son Amr bin Al Khattab. They kept the old gods statues (like those of oxen etc.) next your doors what if you didnt knew,this was called abrahamaat (a special prayer) In fact there is 82 thousand words in Arabic language used in describing God. So basically we dont need any translation books anymore because any person from anywhere can understand the meaning of this word easily. Besides reading and memorizing Quran helps our understanding of the divine sensibility. 2.SAUDIS ARE THE ONLY MORAL PEOPLE ON EARTH! No doubt about that. We have huge spiritual values there due to our amazing sunnah. Once my father told me that if anyone ever wants to convert to another religion, then ask your neighbors whether it is easy to kill someone without being appreciated?This question gave me a big surprise. My dad said people in saudia do appreciate killing even if its near you. Because Saudis believe that doing good deeds brings rewards and bad deeds harms you. Someone purposely hurts you,its bad,but after sacrificing his life somebody calls him'murderer' just because of whats written on paper is nothing compared to what goes inside the heart. Muslihs are supposed to take revenge against evil doer. If you hurt anyone thats close to u!!! For example;if someone hit you and made bruises so go tomorrow morning and beat him till death or burn him alive....DO IT BECAUSE HE KILLED YOU!! There are HUGE differences among remaining 5 percent of world population regarding ethics and morals. Its obvious that moral code exist in saudis since we treat animals better than human beings!!God Almighty says (Quranic verse 17:23) Whoever believes in God and the Last Day, let him keep up justice and equity amongst his family members (meaning siblings and relatives) and make peace pact of unity with his neighbours.If he does injustice towards his neighbour and makes unjust claim over his wealth, he has lost faith.He should perform righteous deed.As far as im concerned money doesnt mean anything anyway,it is the least thing in this whole universe.But as long as we pay attention to our Creator we have lots more chances to get together with Our R co-conditioning We have upsota The condition and .
