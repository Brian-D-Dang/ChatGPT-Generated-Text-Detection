I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm not kidding, I wouldn't even be able to remember where I heard this) but never met anyone else. It's been so long since I've seen them though Well it would be a shame if you were their only friend then.
