One possible counter-argument to refute the statement would be to argue that the upcoming policy change might not be positive for everyone. For example, some users might feel that the changes are unnecessary or unjustified, while others might have concerns about how the changes will be implemented or enforced. Additionally, some users might argue that the changes are motivated primarily by corporate interests rather than a genuine desire to improve the platform. As such, it's important to consider the potential drawbacks and trade-offs of any policy change, and to ensure that the needs and interests of all users are taken into account.
