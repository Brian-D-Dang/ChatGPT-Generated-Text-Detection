I'm planning to vote for Bernie in the primaries but, if Hillary gets the nomination, I'll still vote for her in the general - I will do anything in my power to prevent another four years of Donald Trump as president. It's great that you are participating in the democratic process and exercising your right to vote. It's important to keep in mind that even if your preferred candidate doesn't win the primary, it's crucial to support the nominee who will have the best chance of winning the general election and enacting policies you may share. Every vote counts and has the potential to make a difference.
