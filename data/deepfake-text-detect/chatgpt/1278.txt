A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that area; not all languages are equal and some areas may contain more than one of each type). By raceethnic origin, I'm talking about only those who have a racial background other than white-European European. That doesn't include any nonwhite people for whom their ethnic group is an option on this question but they don't fit into another category (such as Hispanic or Asian etc.) so it's impossible to give them two answers here. I also count anyone with both parents being born outside North America, even if they were born somewhere else before moving to Canada. This includes immigrants from Mexico, Africa, etc. In addition, by religion, I'm including Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Jews and others whose form of faith can be separated like Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains...etc.. As well as atheists, agnostics, pagans etc... As for native speakers at age four years old - this would exclude children born between 1995 and 2000 because we're trying to get approximate ages here. Older kids can still answer the survey however! The cross sectional data was obtained through Google Adwords ads and collected over 4 months in 2014. The sample of respondents has been weighted according to census data to ensure representative demographics among adults 18.
