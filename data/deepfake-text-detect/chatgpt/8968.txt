While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to be the first ever American to go back to school. And I am no longer an American. I am a consumerist and I do not like spending money on unnecessary things. But there is no reason for me to support other people in this country who are used to using money and power to get by. If we could just save some of those wasted dollars, then perhaps we should work together to reduce our dependence on federal government so that everyone can have equal opportunity.
