From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on social issues and leans towards progressivism because they feel that those with different skin color or sexual orientation should be treated equally under the law. These people support civil rights movements such as Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ advocacy groups like PFLAG (Parents Friends of Lesbians Gays). They also believe that government regulation can help prevent corporations from abusing their customers and will fight against things like the TPPNAFTA trade deals since it would allow multinational companies to exploit low-wage workers in developing countries. The second group tends not care about any kind of identity politics at all. Its members favor more libertarian policies, usually centering around personal freedom, gun control, lower taxes and opposition to interventionist foreign policy measures. While these beliefs might appear similar on face value, libertarians actually diverge a fair bit when it comes to supporting civil rights for minorities versus opposing them entirely based upon race and who they sleep with. For example, some prominent figures within the Libertarian Party include white nationalists like Richard Spencer while others like Ron Paul were fierce advocates for racial equality during his time in Congress. Additionally, there are conservative pundits who find themselves regularly called out by Democrats for being racist yet vote consistently Republican anyway like Ben Shapiro. There is even an ongoing debate among self identified "libertarians" whether diversity should matter when choosing political candidates. So while the belief systems here may seem identical, they really aren't at all. Now, this brings me back to my original point; why do progressives continue to align themselves so strongly with these types of folks? Well, part of the reason boils down to the fact that most of us don't know very much about how our own brains work thanks to an education system that has been dominated by neoliberal ideology for nearly four decades now but we are starting to learn just how dangerous this "social justice" movement was. However the main issue surrounds something known as cognitive bias, where viewing information through a particular lens causes people to make mistakes rather than recognizing certain patterns between seemingly disparate events. This mental glitch is a major factor behind gender stereotypes and prejudice, making many liberals susceptible to assuming everything bad happening must have a racist component involved unless proven otherwise. In short, liberals tend to jump to conclusions without considering possible alternative explanations despite the evidence suggesting otherwise, hence the constant calls for black women to stop talking about racism online before realizing that everyone else isn't obligated to do the same if they want to avoid sounding ridiculous in public discourse.
