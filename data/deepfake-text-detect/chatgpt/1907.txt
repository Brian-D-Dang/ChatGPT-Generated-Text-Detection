I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; fought against racism in all its forms - the KKK included; have voted consistently Democratic at every level from local to national since before this nation was even created. There are few people who know me personally that would not consider themselves among those things just mentioned. So imagine how uncomfortable it is for someone like me when an open homosexual says something so monumentally stupid as "gay marriage" or calls himself a racist by his own admission during an interview with a publication nobody reads unless they happen to be reading one issue while waiting on their tax return refund check? This has happened more than once recently but two instances stand out: A video surfaced last week showing the openly gay performer Chaz Bono talking about being racially insensitive because he thought blackface was okay back then; and now Jussie Smollett claims he has written off performing on stage again after receiving death threats over what most reasonable individuals see as completely fabricated charges - yet another example of liberals threatening violence if anyone dares disagree with them politically!
