From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have much incentive to be controversial he just really liked the idea of beating Britain in his home nation. The decline of the coinage of the United States requires an entirely new approach that's not only more competitive than any other coinage ever developed for coin minting but also doesn't require keeping the coin number down over time or ignoring how many people own it; this hasn't been done before and won't happen until it happens again with the next iteration of the coinage proposed by Congress after the Second Amendment expropriation Act. As such, the New Deal coins will likely lack the interest of the pioneers who put their lives at risk to make them possible through this innovation as they were unlikely recipients of any pardon packages provided that their predecessors hadn't yet become extinct. As the exchange rate was established under the auspices of the trade system, it should offer an opportunity for coins from the era of the Union rather than the era of the military-civilian exchange systems built up during the 18th century. The coin carryover value would bring some private ownership back into operation if Congress can find a way to encourage this change, but this isn't going to happen anytime soon due primarily to the influence of gold and silver coins adopting the modern UFA designation which has already proven difficult enough without Congress taking steps toward shifting away from gold coins altogether.
