I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be right or wrong to do and we all know which are the best things for our own well being. Even a child can see that certain actions tend to make them better off than other people If you want proof of this look back on your childhood (or even now) when ever there were situations where doing "right" will get kids in trouble but they still did the good thing, then ask yourself why? Because deep down all of us, even children understand that if something doesn't benefit ourselves directly then it probably won't work out for others either unless its selfless acts This is an assertion without evidence. There has been no study done to show how much human beings change from birth to adulthood, so theories about infants should always be taken with a grain of salt. If anything, studies have shown that humans are highly capable of adapting in terms of morals. This is important because most arguments involving objectivity and subjectivity lack solid ground. Most often, these discussions fall into the realm of philosophy, which does not really deal with empirical fact. It deals more with speculation based upon lots of data gathered by philosophical methods. We call such discussion "hypothesis." The problem here lies within the assumptions assumed by modern scientific methodologies: one assumes that relativism is true and therefore science cannot reach truth; another assumption is that social Darwinism holds sway over humanity. Both of those assumptions are philosophical ones and as far as I'm concerned aren't valid until proven otherwise empirically. Being able to adapt in reality is different than changing fundamentally after infancy. A lot of theories about human behavior don't exist outside of academic papers due to their questionable methodology and general irrelevance to practical applications, among other reasons. Asking "why" is irrelevant also since nobody chooses hisher way of thinking entirely freely during development. In addition, parents play huge role in influencing moral values in young folk. Children who grow up away from their families usually have difficulty figuring out their new societal norms and thus come up with conflicting beliefs regarding morality. So, again, asking "Why?' isn't really possible. All of this only goes to reinforce my point that emotions do determine behavior rather than reason alone. However, both emotions and rationality allow one to evaluate potential outcomes before taking action. You need emotion to tell you whether loving someone is worth the effort while you need rational thought to prevent you from killing him - both emotions and logic contribute equally to determining behaviors under normal circumstances.
