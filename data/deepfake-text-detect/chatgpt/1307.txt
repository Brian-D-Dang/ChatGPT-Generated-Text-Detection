Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move along. A few weeks ago a friend sent me an article regarding a poll indicating that most Americans believe in capital punishment and think we need more laws against murder (I can't even do this right). The problem with reading articles like those are they don't really give you what you want or expect from them; you get twisted up inside your head trying to figure out if anyone else feels as strongly as you - does everyone share my feelings?... and all you end up doing by the time you finish reading is making yourself feel more alone than ever before. It's almost as though after hearing someone say something horrible enough times, it just becomes true for some reason. Before the recent execution of Troy Davis, I had already spent plenty of time talking with friends who felt exactly the same way but were afraid to speak openly because no one understood their position. Listening to other people express themselves in such sharp terms made me realize two things: 1) There was still hope for change; 2) I needed to step up and help make sure voices were heard so others didn't suffer like I did. So here goes! You may be wondering why any of us would care whether another person gets executed or not. Well, let me ask you this question first: Why aren't you worried every day about being kidnapped, raped, robbed or murdered? Why isn't killing innocent people like murdering someone you know personally? And now you tell me there are people out there living without fear everyday?! Are they? That's when it dawned on me.... maybe we're the ones scared. Maybe our world has become so perfectly comfortable that people simply live their lives without thinking too much about anything anymore except perhaps how well dressed they look today... which means something only to other superficial creatures like ourselves. So please consider this: When life inevitably ends, will your body be allowed to lay at rest amongst your loved ones or buried under cement in an unmarked grave miles away where nobody knows or cares about you..... or placed over stone into a tomb next to countless other human beings whom history shall never remember...? Now imagine being strapped down alive in front of dozens of strangers while strapped into a chair blindfolded so authorities could decide whether or not you should stand trial for the crime of having been born. Now picture 10 minutes of your last moments..... sitting helplessly waiting for death to arrive. Then, finally, suddenly realizing what you've done, knowing you'll spend eternity sitting in anticipation watching your family members and friends slowly die around you. What kind of hellish existence must that be??!! What happened to freedom? Where is God? And if He doesn't exist, what makes us so special anyway??? Don't you deserve a better fate then mere survival forever in a lifeless void filled with nothingness!? How pathetic...... Posted by
