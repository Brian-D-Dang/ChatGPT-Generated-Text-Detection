With our constant fast technological advancement people seem to think that we will lead our selves to destruction because we do not use technology with care, but recently all new technologies have been created by humans and in order for us to advance further it is essential that the endangered species are protected. The reason why animals should be saved from extinction when they had their own life before us is so other generations can experience this same joy as well if these animal might one day become extinct then once again humanity could lose its connection to nature which would cause a shortage of food supply due to deforestation etc.. And also no matter how much harm modern human beings inflict on earth habitat some mother nature places like Rainforest still remain unharmed today just imagine what may happen without them... It's better safe than sorry!
