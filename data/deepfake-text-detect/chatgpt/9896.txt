Not trying to start a flame war, I'm looking for a new tablet and I would consider an ipad, but I just don't see the appeal just yet. What on an ipad makes it stand out from the competition? One of the biggest advantages of the iPad is its design. The iPad features an intuitive user interface that makes it easy to navigate and use. It also has a large, beautiful display with vibrant colors and good viewing angles. In addition, the iPad has a long battery life, giving you plenty of time to watch movies, play games, or browse the web on the go. Finally, the iPad also offers access to a huge selection of apps, many of which are designed specifically for the iPad.
