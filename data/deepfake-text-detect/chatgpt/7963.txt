One counter-argument could be that while SWAT pranks may be dangerous and disruptive, excessively harsh sentences for non-violent crimes could be a waste of resources and lead to over-policing. Instead of focusing on strict punishments, law enforcement can work towards preventative measures such as education programs to discourage individuals from engaging in these types of pranks. Furthermore, the criminal justice system should prioritize serious and violent crimes over non-violent pranks.
