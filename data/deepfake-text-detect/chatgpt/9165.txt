I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If If there was a life or afterlife, what could happen to a life or afterlife, I am not a believer of any kind, then it is a a belief in an afterlife or supernatural. I had a chance of a afterlife or supernatural, If there was a life in the after life, there is a God, If he does exist or after life, if there is one, if there is a God, If he does exist, is it some after life or supernatural.
