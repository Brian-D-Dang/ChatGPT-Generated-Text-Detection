tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to my favorite team, the Seahawks, I watch all of them and enjoy each one if they are not on national TV or featured in some other way. I have watched many different teams over the years (although always with that Seahawks focus) but for some reason this year has been really fun to follow because we play in such an entertaining style both offensively and defensively. It is easy to appreciate good football from a coaching standpoint which makes us fans happy without having to look at plays via analytic diagrams like baseball does. What about your peers? Have any of their opinions changed since the start of the 2019 NFL Season? In particular, how did they feel after last week's win against Dallas? "Worthy opponent, so maybe they beat themselves up too much about the past few weeks. Can't blame Seattle for being excited given all the twists and turns of the story line. They showed early why they were dominant: smarts, audaciousness, patience, creativity. And for the rest of the night: consistency, dominance, resolve on defense especially. No player among the top-five performers was more than 10 yards away from the QB no matter where he lined up. Any time inside 30 yards, Frank Clark and KJ Wright made life miserable. Jake Fisher played his best half of the season. Pete Carroll got creative using broken-down players who had never thrown the ball before, and Russell Wilson threw TDs to safeties. If there's something surprising going into Week 8, it's probably just how well they managed that advantage they built on Monday Night."

What about my colleagues here? Did anyone notice a difference yet? Are there any trends worth watching out for? My friend Mike noted anecdotally that the '19 Seahawks seem to be missing Earl Thomas quite a bit right now but am I reading that correctly? He said he noticed a lack of communication between Richard Sherman and Tyler Lockett. Should I expect those two to pick up their roles soon enough? Yes! Yes!!...and yes!!! We miss him big time - Chief569 says great things get lost sometimes during the game! A lot to learn by getting back together again. Smart dude. Love. - Doug Baldwin (DougBaldwin) November 3, 2019 A quick check reveals that Kirk Cousins started 9 games instead of 2 for Washington Redskins during the second half of the season last year and that Marlon Mack only ran 18 times for Pittsburgh Steelers' offense prior to joining Atlanta Falcons. Both Kellen Clemens and Nick Foles saw limited action during the fourth quarter of the Philadelphia Eagles' 42-20 loss to the New York Giants on September 28th. So perhaps opposing teams aren't ready to throw double moves towards Alabama RB Damien Harris and Tennessee WR Taywan Taylor just yet? But those reads can change very quickly during games. Obviously defenses try to adjust and create extra pressure wherever they can so maybe multiple looks will become necessary for certain matchups down the road. Anyway, looking forward to seeing where the personnel changes take place in practice this week. Will everyone return home healthy and refreshed following Thursday's bye? Who leaves town first? How long until we see new faces in MetLife Stadium cheering in red and green? Is this preseason at its most interesting point now? After all of these questions we still haven't answered the main question: why do you find regular season games exciting? In addition to the answers above, Joe Douglas mentioned recently that head coach Pete Carroll wants to see less dropbacks throughout the course of a game. This type of thinking could mean fewer deep shots taken by receivers toward the sidelines and more options available to offensive linemen moving along the interior of the formation. As the league goes deeper and faster with the passing attack, we might begin to see more formations relying upon power running concepts or shotgun sets with shorter drops. It would also make sense to include more RPO packages for offenses seeking to exploit mismatches through the air. Also keep an eye on Dre Greenlaw and Tre Flowers returning punts later this month. Would love to hear their thoughts on whether they favor slowing things down a little bit next season. Letting that begins and ends of value, David Ba Sarnah...
