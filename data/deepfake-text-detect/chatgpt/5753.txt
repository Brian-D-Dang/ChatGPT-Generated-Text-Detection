This is a view I've read about from various pop psychology sources, and it has become conventional wisdom. I believe it contains some truth. Can you convince me it merely contains some truth, or does it contain the whole truth? My answer is not going to be very well reasoned out, I'm afraid. I'm just going to talk about how I have come to understand this statement. To start with, I've read that "fake it til you make it" is not very good advice for young people, that they should be encouraged to develop their natural interests and talents. I agree with this. I have a hunch that it's not good advice for young people because it implies to me that people are not able to change themselves and that there is only one "right way" to be, and that they should try to be that. I'm not going to go into my thoughts about the "right way" to be - suffice to say, I think it is different for different people, and I believe we are all equal. I believe the reason for this is that I have come to understand how self-limiting beliefs have a powerful effect on one's self-image and personality. I have come to understand that it is very difficult to change yourself, and that we all have a natural tendency to resist change. The reason I think it is difficult to change yourself is that you are changing your self-image, which is part of who you are. When you change something about yourself, you are going to have to decide how much of yourself you want to be. If you decide that you want to be less of yourself, you will be accepting less of yourself. If you accept less of yourself, you are going to become less of yourself. It is like a constant teeter-totter. When you accept more of yourself, you accept less of yourself, and when you accept less of yourself, you accept more of yourself. The reason I think we have a natural tendency to resist change is that we are trying to survive in the world we have, and it is a powerful and important part of ourselves. It is our identity. When you try to change yourself, you are changing who you are, and it is important to keep an important part of ourselves. It is hard to let go of part of ourselves. I think the reason people believe "fake it til you make it" is not very good advice is that it implies that it is something you do, and that you are pretending to be someone you aren't. The "fake" part is very important, because when you are doing something you are pretending to be someone else. You are actually saying "I am this other person, I am not myself." And you are doing something that feels unnatural to you. If you are not yourself, you are not being honest with yourself. And you are not being honest with yourself, you are not being yourself. This is why I believe that "fake it til you make it" is not very good advice for young people. Because if you have to "fake it til you make it," you are not being yourself. You are being someone else, and that is not good. Instead, I believe that the way to change yourself is by accepting yourself. "Fake it til you make it" implies that you are changing yourself by not being yourself, and that is the opposite of what you should do. The first thing you should do is be yourself. Then, if you want to change something about yourself, accept that it is your self. Accept yourself. Accept all of yourself. Accept that you are you. The second thing you should do is tell yourself the truth. You are who you are, and that is what you have to work with. You cannot change who you are. You can change your self-image, and your self-image can change who you are. But it is not possible to change who you are, because who you are is who you are. The third thing you should do is find something you like about yourself. Find one thing that you like about yourself. Find one thing you like about yourself that you like, and tell yourself you like it. Tell yourself you like it as much as you can. Tell yourself you like it as much as you can, until you do. I am not saying you should lie to yourself. I am saying that you should accept yourself. I am saying that if you like yourself, you should tell yourself you like yourself. If you do not like yourself, you should tell yourself you like yourself. If you do not like yourself, you should tell yourself you are you. I think this is true because it works. But, if you do not believe me, what should you do? If you don't believe me, then you should do something that works.
