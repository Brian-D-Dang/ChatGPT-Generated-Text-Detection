While it is true that some zoos aim to uphold certain ethical standards and care for the well-being of their animals, the act of confining wild creatures in captivity for human entertainment perpetuates a harmful mentality that it is acceptable to use animals for our own purposes. Despite good intentions, such facilities too often fall short of adequately meeting animals' complex and diverse needs, leading to boredom, depression, and even physical harm. Their enclosures are pale imitations of their natural habitats and life in captivity presents many stresses that simply do not exist in the wild. It is not ethical to take away an animal's freedom, and the existence of zoos only serves to perpetuate the idea that humans are entitled to exert control over the natural world. Ultimately, there are better alternatives for educating humans about wildlife that do not involve captive animals, such as ecotourism, documentaries and educational programming.
