First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I understand that you may have a concern or question related to the education system in the US. Please feel free to ask me and I will try my best to provide useful information or guidance for you.
