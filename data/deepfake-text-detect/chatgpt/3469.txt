So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want to learn about a candidate's policies and qualifications, it's better to do your own research and read their platforms and past actions. Debates tend to focus on sound bites and theatrics rather than substantive discussions. That being said, the column you mentioned lays out an interesting idea for an alternative format for debates. By having candidates answer questions in writing and publishing their responses, voters can get a more detailed look at their positions and thought processes. This format could also potentially level the playing field for candidates who are not as skilled in public speaking or who may not have as much media attention. Overall, the important thing is to do your own research and not rely solely on debates or media coverage to inform your political decisions.
