I believe that we are at the point where we potentially could avoid bringing about catastrophic climate change, but to do that we would need to drop absolutely everything, to put a stop on all human activity and energy use immediately. That is not going to happen." For now, many observers think it's unlikely that the United States will be able to slash emissions enough in the next decade or so for there to be any meaningful chance of avoiding runaway climate change - particularly considering President Donald Trump has already pulled out of the Paris agreement, which he called "the worst deal ever," and rolled back Obama-era regulations meant to reduce carbon emissions from power plants and other sources. In fact, the U.S.-China fight over trade may have more impact than anything else on curbing greenhouse gas emissions: The world's two largest emitters account for almost half of global CO2 pollution now, according to World Resources Institute data compiled by the Rhodium Group. And while China recently pledged to make its economy 100 powered by renewable energy (by 2060), a recent analysis found that even with such an ambitious goal, the country wouldn't cut CO2 emissions nearly as much as needed to keep warming below 1C regardless what happens elsewhere around the globe.
