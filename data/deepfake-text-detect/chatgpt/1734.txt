So, I saw a commercial today about a pill that helps with BED, and I did a bit of quick research on it. From what little research I did, it looks like this is the thing prescribed to people who have been diagnosed as having binge eating disorder (BED). And then they take 2-3 pills each day for 6 months so their brain can fully "reboot" after stopping eatingbingeing forever due to anorexia or bulimia. But there's one problem: these days most people don't do anything right away when they get sick - especially if you're not in pain! So my conclusion was that those commercials are partly wrong because someone taking medication would likely go into withdrawal symptoms instead of instantly getting better from just taking two pills three times per day every single day even though their doctor said these pills will counteract any binging or overeating urges all by themselves without further therapy. I'm trying really hard to stay positive here but man... The fact remains that no matter how much we think something might work, our body still needs time for things to change internally before we see real progress. This means that some form of treatment could be key over just making sure your diet doesn't give your stomach ulcers anymore; which is probably why the first option seems more promising since it has lower side effects than other options such as antidepressants etc.. In practice, however ... It feels like it must vary based on person? Because sometimes people feel exactly fine while others keep feeling ill even six months later?! And also inflammation isn't always caused by food and stress levels aren't even regulated correctly through the hormones system anyway (which makes sense given that sufferers often need surgery)! And yet despite everything else being imperfect meaningfully, I am optimistic about myself helping me deal with my anxiety, depression AND my ED too simply for self love alone. That in itself is both huge and deeply rewarding!
