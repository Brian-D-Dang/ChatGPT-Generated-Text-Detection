Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that I have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. It has been this way since the beta, but it became even more apparent after 5.0 when I came back from my break and realized how fun play-testing was again. The fact that they are adding new content aside from patching makes me love this game so much more than any other MOBA out there now. The maps are great, and each one brings its own unique experience. From up close fights on Firelink Shrine or Diretide Battlefield you can feel like things truly matter at times while playing higher ground battles such as Lijiang Tower where you will be able to see your enemies coming long before they actually get anywhere near you. Similar to LoL's sight line system which keeps track of what kind of buff an enemy needs to survive certain situations; Dota 2 also takes into account who is closest to whom when calculating passive dodge chance through their vision lines every time someone moves. This means if you were last hit by X camped hero then Y would die first unless he had some sort of buffitem that made him immune to being killed second (for example: Morphling) or because they saw you move closer to them. All these different factors make for games within games within games, making sure everyone plays their part right and knowing exactly why and how something happens. For example in Diretide Battlefront the red bar wraps around the map checking over all corners of the map to spot opponents moving somewhere else and someone not nearby with items they should pick up. These features add so much depth to gameplay especially towards top tier matches between full teams. Without getting too technical about it, it adds another layer on top of layers that already exist in pretty much every rule set there is in terms of teamfights. There are still advantages and disadvantages of various heroes, just like others have said as well. To me personally though the balance seems perfect overall. Every character appears viable throughout multiple matchups, although maybe faster lanes limit certain builds? Even without any specific information looking at winrates on Dotabuff shows us that most characters aren't always picked 80 of the time either. Between the diverse variety of gameplay styles with tons of strategic options available to players no matter what role they want to take up it feels almost impossible to screw yourself over completely. What really drives home the point that Dota is so good and welcoming however comes from Valve themselves. By keeping everything fresh with regular updates and never being afraid of change Valve keep pushing forward with goals and ideas for the future instead of simply living off their success and stagnating with only minor changes to matchmaking and cosmetic models. They've added mechanics of late to increase or decrease player skill levels rather than having the exact same ruleset ever year for years and giving players nothing to strive against. Instead of relying on past events or historical champions to decide rank ordering we're given ranking numbers that reflect our average MMRs across all regions and competitive scenes. Players don't need to worry about missing out on anything pretty much anymore if they started early enough and put effort into improving over the year. With all these improvements happening and chances of receiving patches increasing based on feedback received Valve seem finally poised to break away from the typical yearly release cycle and become the innovator in gaming once again. With all these reasons listed above, I think anyone could agree whether they are fans of Dota previously or started brewing soloqueue recently that Dota 2 will probably remain the best MOBAS dominant forever. But do you know WHY Dota 2 is the best? Or at least one reason why? Maybe because of the huge amount data provided by SteamDB.com here's a short list of some of the stats and facts about Dota 2.
