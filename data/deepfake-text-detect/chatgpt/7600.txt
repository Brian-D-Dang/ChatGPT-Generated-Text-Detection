While America certainly has some aspects of a police state, it is an overstatement to claim that it is already a police state. A police state is a totalitarian regime where the government has complete control over all aspects of society, including the police force. While there are instances of police brutality and abuses of power in America, the country still has a functioning democracy with a system of checks and balances that prevent the government and the police from having total control. Additionally, the fact that citizens are free to express their opinions and criticize the government, as well as participate in free and fair elections, are proofs that America is not already a police state.
