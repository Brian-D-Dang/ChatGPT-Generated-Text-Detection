It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing I do notice is that there are few voices in this discussion who speak out against China's growing military power. Corporate America has decided it should stop expanding into new markets - except maybe Canada. The US economy will soon be looking at familiar challenges like finding jobs for its young workers - thanks largely to Chinese students taking up tens of thousands more slots than expected each year.http:www.guardian.co.ukworld2013...
