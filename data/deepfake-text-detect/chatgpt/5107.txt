I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say "entertainment," but I think it's more than just that. Most works of fiction are entertainment; fiction has a certain kind of meaning too which makes them appealing because there needs to be something to make people feel good or angry at times when out in the outdoors." The other thing about fiction being entertaining though it seems like it would just help us get back into the forest for good. And especially since we've seen from the movies as well as books how fiction can bring stability whilst making us feel positive emotions such as happiness even if they aren't emotional states themselves - an important point because without fiction these things wouldn't exist anyhow!
