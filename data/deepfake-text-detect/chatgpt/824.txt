Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as we can never be fully prepared for something like the onset of the Winter Festival of lights, I believe we should embrace the idea that darkness is part of the light.
