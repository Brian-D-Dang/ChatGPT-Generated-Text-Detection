There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: I'm sorry to hear that you had a disruptive experience during the movie. It can be challenging to deal with disruptions in a public setting. In this case, since the child was deaf, it's possible that they didn't realize the noise they were making was bothersome to others. It's important to be understanding and patient with individuals who have different needs and abilities. If you find yourself in a similar situation in the future, it may be helpful to speak with the theater staff or a manager about your concerns. They may be able to offer alternative seating options or provide assistance in addressing the disruption. It's important to remember to approach the situation with empathy and understanding for all parties involved.
