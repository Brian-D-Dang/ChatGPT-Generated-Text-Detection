So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training and would be prepared for the situation, but they're hardly ever called upon to do so in any real emergency. Yup - I'm from SoCal too, and I still remember when we had our local fire department come out and clear an area about a block long. Volunteers?
