I was only able to find one other thread about this topic, and it was kind of a train wreck. Common arguments: "It's not Jraphics Interchange Format" by that logic, there should be no reason an application would need support for more than 4 colors at once (JPG), or why using the default SVG color palette is so terrible There are no good solutions out there That sounds like a really bad argument... I think we can agree then that light value pixels don't work well in JavaScript? You're losing lots of information with that approach while for example an image doesn't have any trouble supporting multiple channels but you still don't want them all active (in JS).
