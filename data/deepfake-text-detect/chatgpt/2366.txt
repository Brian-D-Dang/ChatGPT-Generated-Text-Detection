Sorry, this is mostly applicable to folks from the US, but feel free to weigh in no matter what. I'll bullet-point for my reasoning: More good folks are killed via guns than bad ones each year; there was a time when "gun control" meant something more along these lines (i.e., banning certain types of weapons and ammo); fewer people have access now that it's harder to buy themit takes longer, they're registered with serial numbers, etc.and thus will be less likely racked by impulsive or mental health-related violence due to having easy access to firearms I don't know if any other country has gun registration as part of its regulations on purchasing...but we definitely do here - at least back then before all private sales were outlawed..every purchase requires background checks including check into name (s) associated with an individual firearm purchased...so even though you may not know who your next door neighbor bought their rifle off of or where he got his handgun......they still effectively track exactly how many rifleshandguns get sold every month....
