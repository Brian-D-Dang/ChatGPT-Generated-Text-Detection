I'm referring to this news story about the incident at the community pool in McKinney TX. You can reference it here, the video is down the page and is approximately 2 minutes long: The police report states that officers were called after a man climbed over the fence of the pool into another area where he was swimming with children. I am pretty sure my kids have been accused enough times by adults of "climbing" across fences or sitting on porches when there are no cars around but while walking home from school (or even riding their bikes) during daylight hours....this seems like an extreme reaction for such an accusation against your child...especially since we know nothing other than what's in the text above. The article below also has further information suggesting the woman may not be telling full truth so maybe she did climb up onto the property! My question remains though; why does the fatherguardian choose to ignore his daughter as she walks away? Why didn't he go walk back towards her to check if anything had happened to her instead of letting everyone else think they witnessed something more sinister going on out there?? And then, later once people realize how innocent his innocent toddler seemed, do you suppose some parent will come forward claiming he struck one of them with a golf club because, guess what?, kids don't always listen to parents all the time!! That doesn't sound like Halloween night at all!!! Here is a link for anyone interested....and here is another blog post that goes through all aspects: then to top it off......if having his child charged with potentially breaking the law makes him feel stupid.....what would happen upon finding himself under arrest for a similar offense???
