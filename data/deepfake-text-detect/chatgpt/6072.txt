I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. I know a lot of people disagree, and I know that people can be fairly subjective about the matter. However, there's an argument that can be made based on hard facts that, when you take into account the history of the war, the actual events and the outcome of the war, and the post-war settlement, it's hard to argue that the Allies were the victors. The Allies lost the war because they were a collection of different countries with different interests and aims. They had to work together to fight against Germany, and that put them at odds with each other. The Allies were never a real team, and the bitterness and feelings of betrayal and inferiority that persisted between the former Allies continued to undermine international relations and hamper the war effort. The Axis powers lost the war because of their common ideology and the strong political leadership of their leaders. The war effort was aided by a far more unified approach. The war was not won on the battlefield. The Allies won on the battlefield, but they lost the war. In the early stages of the war, the Axis powers had a real advantage. They were more organised, more co-ordinated, and they had a clear purpose and focus. They were fighting for a particular philosophy and they were fighting for a particular cause, and they were fighting a war of a particular kind. The Allies were fighting for a very different philosophy and they were fighting a very different kind of war. The conflict between the two sides was political, and the political element was far more important than the military. That should come as no surprise, since the military was simply an instrument of the political ideology. As the war progressed, the Allies began to get the upper hand on the military front, but they never really got the upper hand on the political front. The Axis powers continued to maintain a strong political focus and a unified political approach that the Allies never really achieved. The Allies tried hard to maintain a unified political approach, but the war ended when the leaders of the allies were not really a team, and when they were at odds with each other. Churchill and Roosevelt were very much at odds with each other during the war, and once the war ended, they couldn't find a way to put that aside and work together. There was no trust between them. When the time came to agree the terms of the settlement, they couldn't agree on a common approach. In contrast, the Axis powers always worked together. They always maintained a common approach, and they always worked closely together, and they always took the same stance. The Allies lost the war because they didn't have the same ideology, the same philosophy, the same approach. They didn't have the same goals, and they didn't have the same approach. The war was fought on many different battlefields, and at different times, the Allies were better prepared to fight on some of those battlefields, and the Axis powers were better prepared on others. The Allies also had to fight a different war. The war was political, and that meant the Allies had to fight a political war. The Axis powers, on the other hand, were able to fight a war of a different kind. They fought a war that was less political and less ideological, and that meant they could focus on fighting the war on the battlefield. That political war was a major contributing factor to the failure of the Allies. They lost the war because they didn't work together, and they lost the war because they were fighting a war of a different kind. The Axis powers won the war because they had a clear focus and a common purpose. They fought a war that was more political, and that was more ideological, and they were better prepared to fight that kind of war. They had a common philosophy, and they had a common ideology, and they were also able to fight a different kind of war. The Allies lost the war because they had a different philosophy and a different ideology. They also had different goals, and they were fighting a different kind of war. The political war was a major contributing factor to the failure of the Allies. They lost the war because they didn't work together, and they lost the war because they were fighting a different war.
