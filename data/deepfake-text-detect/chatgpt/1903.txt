A multitude of films have twists in the plot, for example Gone Girl, Memento, a lot of films of M. Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well you get my point? It is not something new and I don't even know if that's what happened here but it really has nothing to do with either one or two characters being sexually attracted too each other because they are siblings... It wasn't revealed until R1 though
