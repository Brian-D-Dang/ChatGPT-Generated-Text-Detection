Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as someone who's traveled from US states all the way through Asia, Europe and even South America, I think that culture should be developed first on its own merits by a 'neutral' government or society which embraces diversity instead of fighting against it in every possible situation - including the one we are facing right now concerning Western values... I'm not sure if you're talking about Hungary? But why do people care so much what happens there culturally speaking anyway? It is only an insignificant part of our politics. If anything should "bring down western civilization," then it would probably be your political parties and leaders because if you truly cared about western civilisation then surely you wouldn't want any sort of dictatorship like yours or another countries. The problem lies at home, but don't let me get off topic here. Also, just keep in mind that having diversity doesn't mean accepting everyone into the same society without standards nor being tolerant towards anyone else. If you choose to live somewhere where there are Muslims living next door to ChristiansJews etc., than fine. Just don't expect others to accept ANYONE. We can argue whether democracy works well or bad for some societies within these borders; however, please understand that most of the cultures around us have been formed already hundreds of years ago without bothering too much about freedom of speech. We may disagree sometimes regarding whether certain things are right or wrong, true or false but those differences were settled before we called ourselves Europeans and Americans. So please, stop pushing such ideals onto other regions just based solely upon what YOU believe is right when it has nothing whatsoever to do with the majority opinion surrounding themselves. Thats how dictatorships and voiding freedoms begin. Why should your opinions matter to us unless we agree with them anyways? In fact, it makes no sense since England, France, Germany etc didn't start out looking exactly alike yet their governments had common core principles and still managed to work together. The idea of a multiculturalism has never made sense to me. To put aside everything else for just a minute: 1-Forcing people to adapt to your beliefs is simply un-American. No matter what country you come from, you shouldn't force anybody to adopt your views merely because you feel obligated to do it morally. As John Adams said several decades back: "What would become of your universal liberty, when the whole mass of mankind was brought under the sway of one set of laws?" John Adams
