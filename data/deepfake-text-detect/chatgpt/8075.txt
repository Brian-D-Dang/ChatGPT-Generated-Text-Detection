Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for the automatic transmission though - even if you're going to do a lot of off-roading or track driving (which is not something that happens very often). The only benefit from an auto would be around town where slower speeds are more common than on most roads anyway so better economy should come into play as well; but then again there's 'Eco' buttons which just reversecancel all shifts automatically when coasting down hills etc..
