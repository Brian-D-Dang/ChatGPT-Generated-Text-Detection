I am a fan of many sports, and all of them seem to take a lot of skill. But golf has always been the one I hated. It's always been boring as hell. You just stand there watching some stupid person hit balls into holes that don't even look like they have any rules on them. Good thing for me because it was my only sport in high school! Golf is actually rather interesting when you are learning how to play at first. If you can learn to swing without hitting yourself or anyone else than its pretty cool. Being able to do small stuff with your hands helps also. Its a really good sport if you know about it. Its not that bad though, especially if you go out on a course alone so you dont get distracted by the other players around, who will try to show off their groupies (who probably aren't very attractive anyway). And since most courses have strict dress codes "no track suits" etc., this keeps people from looking too sluttyunattractive. A teacher once told me: 'You're never going to be anything unless you love what you're doing.' Frank Zappa Well...I've played golf before. The basic fun part? Picking up someone elses clubs when no one is looking. Seriously, think about it....it'd be great if young kids could pick up an Epiphone Les Paul guitar when no one saw, or grab a microphone for rock band practice, but we can't let little girls run up and down stairs wearing tight clothes or guys wear shorts while playing tennis. Golf would be a perfect choice to allow younger kids to play without having those big parents "watching." And honestly, lots of dads I know play golf anyways. They wouldn't mind letting their daughters borrow a set of clubs. We already see it happen today in the NBA. There were plenty of mid-range deals where basketball players used each others' equipment. Basketball isn't exactly famous for being family friendly either. One time I had a friend name Brent give me his second hand sneakers to use during games he wasn't using. He said he didn't want to lose them and they looked better then mine, which I doubt since both of us wore size 10s back then. So sure, the vast majority of lifeguards are women, but then again football player body parts are considered sacred too. When I took gymnastics class in elementary school, our gym teacher was a guy named Mr. Ostrander...he was awesome!!! Never had a problem with him touching me, guys asked if they could watch practice [and yes, sometimes I did encourage it] and none of us ever got kicked off of team for talking dirty among ourselves. Gymnasts performed FULL NUDITY for years. Nowadays if a female does full nudity, she gets fired for cultural reasons. Male teachers still touch students all over the place. Not saying it's right, but if you say something naughty of a girl it's okay, if a boy says something about another boy's junk, well that's enough to cause problems in schools now days. My point being, Golf seems fairly tame compared to these activities. The main reason why I hate golf...? Well actually, i'm more bored seeing grown men hitting plastic rocks away into mostly obscured landfills.. But seriously...men hitting large, heavy things away into largely obstructed areas...That makes it different from every sport involving direct contact with other human bodies? I'll tell ya lads, Basketball, Football, Boxing, Rugby, Soccer (the American version), Tennis, Baseball...are far MORE dangerous activities than golf! This notion doesn't apply to Hockey due to its lack of contact inherent goalie blocking style, Swimming, Surfing and Polo are fine pursuits for adults even requiring club membership..but such activity cannot hold a candle to the dangers involved in American Football, Ice hockey, Rollerblading, BMXing, Motorcycling, Snooker, Chess, Dance, Martial Arts, Wrestling, Jumping Jacks, Skateboarding, Cricket, Judo, Karate, Rock Crawling, and so forth...Some of those activities require accessorizing with helmets, gloves, padding, knee pads, elbow sleeves, wrist guards, headgear, neck braces, shin plates, protective cups or groin protectors, mouthpieces, leg guards, shoulder pads, chest protector, face masks, arm gauntlets, elbow sleeves, fingerless mitts, a glove designed specifically made for wrestling matches, eye goggles, boots, a long sleeve jersey worn underneath compression gear, thigh pads, hand wraps, trunks, wrestling shoes, elbow and ankle straps, shoulder pads, foot protection, knee socks, spike marks and scars, dental implants, broken lips and jaws, busted noses, teeth knocked loose and shattered, concussions, bone bruises, sprains, torn ligaments, dislocated joints, fibrositis and arthritis, black eyes, pink eyes, swollen faces - and all of that comes in or trots should refer to the list of individuals running upstream cleanly coes should consider that disconsidiousness or worse provincial players supposed to avoid aquatic
