Oat blenders. Mini spooners. Coco roos. Honey Scooters. You know them. You see them in the cereal section of any grocery store. They are in giant bags in a metal bin or on clearance tables for pennies a box. The lonely, forgotten cousin to Cheerios and Corn Pops, oats have been around since ancient times. Nowadays everyone is making healthy eating habits part of their daily routine but some still don't quite get it right when it comes to oatmeal. In fact, many people haven't even heard that there was such thing as steel-cut oatmeal until reading this article! Steel cut oats are so different from instant rolled oats that they should be considered two separate foods entirely. The idea behind steel cut oats is to remove all the extra stuff added during production which allows you to eat the actual food you would naturally find growing out of an oat plant instead of processed grains. After soaking overnight (don't forget!) your breakfast bowl will look like this: Steel cut oats come with so much more fiber than regular old rolled oats because every grain has its own natural hulls. What exactly does that mean? It means that each single oat kernel has its own little protective shell coating which protects against insect attacks and helps prevent the nutrients in the inside from being destroyed while traveling through the digestive tract. This results in a larger portion of digestible nutrition getting absorbed into our bodies and less waste leaving the body. That's just one reason why steel cut oats are better at keeping us full throughout the morning. Another important difference between rolled and steel cut oats relates to how long those little "hulled" pieces last before turning rancid. Rolled oats lose theirs after about 2 weeks whereas steel cut oats retain theirs indefinitely if stored properly. If kept cool dry then rinsed regularly, their shelf life can easily stretch several months. As far as flavor goes, both types are delicious. But my personal favorite is definitely steel cut. There is something magical about watching your hot water turn cold and watch your milk froth up...It takes me back to childhood memories of waking up early in the morning when everything smelled fresh and new. When I used to make porridge, sometimes when it started boiling over onto the stove top, I'd throw handfuls of leftover kale into the pot to give it a smoky taste and crunchy texture. It wasn't gross either; rather it made the whole dish more exciting and flavorful - especially paired with cinnamon. Oh man..I need to go downstairs and start making some of that now....
