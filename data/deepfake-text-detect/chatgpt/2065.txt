First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from an external point-of view since it's a big topic in my current city (Toronto) and someone else mentioned that they were thinking about doing something similar to OP here as well:)
