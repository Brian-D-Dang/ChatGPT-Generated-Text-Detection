While it may seem like a good safety measure to have headlights automatically shut off when a car turns off, it actually presents several problems. First, it could be potentially dangerous for a driver who parks their car in a dimly lit area and then has to fumble in the dark to find the switch to turn on their headlights. Second, emergency responders and law enforcement could be hindered by this feature in situations where they need to quickly locate a parked vehicle in a dark area. Finally, many drivers use their headlights to guide them to and from their vehicle in a crowded parking lot, and having them automatically switch off could lead to confusion and possible car accidents. Therefore, it is more practical for auto manufacturers to leave the decision to turn off headlights up to the driver.
