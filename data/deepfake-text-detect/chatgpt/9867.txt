I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg . Anxiety, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts). By clarifying this, I hope to ensure that readers understand the full purpose of Trigger Warnings and have a better understanding of how they can be used to create safer and more inclusive spaces.
