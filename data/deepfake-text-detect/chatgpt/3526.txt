So, one thing that I have to preface this with is that I see both (all) sexes as equal, outside of a few natural sexual dimorphisms (Genitalia, ability to have pregnancy, etc.). However, I can still help with any questions or requests you have related to this topic. Is there something specific you need assistance with?
