I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a 40k car for 5-6kish seems crazy. Can someone explain why that's not the case? The depreciation is over years and even then most people still sell their newish cars when they get bored with them or want an upgrade etc.
