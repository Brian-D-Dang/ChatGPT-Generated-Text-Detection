First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a bias. The bias is this: "I am a person who likes to socialize, and enjoy the process of mingling with others, talking, and getting to know them, and I've noticed that some of the greatest experiences I've had in my life have come from that." Reddit makes it very easy to judge others. I think a lot of the posts here could be improved with a simple: "this is how I feel and how I perceive it" rather than "this is how it is." If you want to prove this, the simplest thing to do is change the wording. If you're an introvert and you feel socializing is hard, then say so. If you feel that extroverts are better suited for life than introverts, then say so. And if you feel that someone who says they are an introvert is just a fake extrovert, then say so. This subreddit's strengths are in the community. It's not in it's philosophy. It's in it's ability to create a community and foster good discourse. You can have a good discourse about whether extroverts are better than introverts. But if you're coming here to call people liars or fakes, then you're missing the point of this subreddit. I also want to point out that I am a male and I'm 22, so I know I don't have experience in this area. I'm sure there's a lot of life experiences that I haven't had that I don't realize could have a lot of value. I just want to bring a different perspective to this conversation. ParkerEH I'm a female and I'm 22 and I totally agree with your post. I'm also a total introvert, and I'm just really not a fan of this subreddit. It seems to really be geared towards people who just want to argue with introverts and say things like "you're just an extrovert who doesn't know it," and it gets tiring. I've even had people tell me that they were introverts before, but now that they've gotten older, they're extroverts. It's just really annoying and biased. And yeah, I hate how extroverts are portrayed as these social butterflies who are able to talk to anyone and make friends with ease, and introverts are portrayed as these shy people who are completely different from their extroverted counterparts. Like that's not even fair. It's like the "if you're not a certain way, you're automatically wrong" mentality. Yeah, and I've had people tell me that "you're not really an introvert, you're just like a weird extrovert" or "you're like a fake extrovert." Like wtf? I'm just being myself, that's all. TheKingofAmerica I agree. I'm a very extroverted person. I'm sure I have some introverted tendencies, but I am generally very outgoing and outspoken. I enjoy being around people, and have a lot of friends. I enjoy doing things with them, and just being social. I tend to be a very talkative person, and if I'm not talking, I'm listening. I'm sure there are aspects of being an extrovert that are a little more difficult, but in general, I don't think I'm missing out on anything. However, I have had a few introverted friends say things like "I have to put on an act just to get through the day." They make it seem like they can't be themselves. I'm like, you're allowed to be yourself, that's not a bad thing. Like, I don't know, maybe people will think I'm a little odd or a little weird, but who cares? I'm being myself, and I'm not ashamed of it. It's OKAY to not be the "norm." And you know what? I have had many introverted friends say things like "I have to put on an act just to get through the day," and I'm like, "That's really sad, I feel like I'm missing out on something by not being an introvert." Like, I just want to be myself
