In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around I felt. So I was going to say what I felt when I got my heart rate down. I felt ready to step up and take a step forward and take my self-esteem down. I began walking down the street and I felt a lot of pressure. I felt like you sitting on the sidewalk and walking down the street. You felt like someone pushed you in. You felt like a giant chick in my hand. I felt like you were watching me. You were just being yourself. I feel like you were trying to make a difference.
