My post is inspired by [this article] in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell "shares" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their education. The rationale is that tuition costs are so high that students will be paying off their student loans for the rest of their lives. They deserve a way out. The author of the article, however, is quick to point out that this should not be an invitation for students to run up credit card debt or miss out on a higher education. The student should carefully weigh the potential returns versus the costs. What the article does not mention is that this proposal also encourages students to rush through their college education. The student is now responsible for paying back his loans, even though he may not have completed his education yet. If he spends his time getting his degree in four years instead of five, he will be able to repay his loans faster. That's right, if the student takes a fifth year to complete his degree and take a few more classes, his "shares" will be worth less. That's because he will have to pay back his loans for longer. Of course, the opposite is also true. A student who attends part time will have to pay back his loans for longer than the typical student who attends full time. In addition, the investor should not expect the student to work at the same job and earn the same amount throughout his life. The investor should not expect him to work at the same company or in the same industry. The investor should not expect him to move to the same city or even the same state. Investors must have a way out as well. They need to be able to walk away from the deal if the student moves to Alaska, joins the Peace Corps, or runs for Congress. Investors need to be able to sell their shares to someone else, just like students need to sell their shares to someone else. I don't know how an investment company would even be able to track all this stuff, but I suppose there must be a way. If a student changes his major, investors must be able to get out. What if the student wants to study music or art and then later decides to study engineering? What if the student decides to take a couple years off? What if he decides to switch to a smaller school? What if he decides to switch to a bigger school? What if he decides to work full time for a few years? Investors should be able to sell their shares to someone else who might prefer the "second" student. Investors should be able to sell their shares to someone else who wants to take a few years off and then return to school. Investors should be able to sell their shares to someone else who decides to attend a smaller school. Investors should be able to sell their shares to someone else who decides to work full time. Of course, a student has to be able to walk away from his shares. What if he decides to take a year off to travel the world or to take care of his family? What if he decides to go back to school but then decides to go to a different school? What if he decides to go back to school but decides to take a different major? I don't know how an investment company would even be able to track all this stuff, but I suppose there must be a way. They can track every piece of information about their investment, so why not track every piece of information about their investment? Students should be able to sell their shares to someone else, just like investors should be able to sell their shares to someone else. It's just a matter of time before a politician comes up with this idea. I just hope that the investment company can work it all out and that they don't go bankrupt. [This post is written in satire.
