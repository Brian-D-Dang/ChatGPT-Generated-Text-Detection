Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions and wants to help the community, but it also seems to have little regard for the human condition. I've read a few of the SJW manuals that have been floating around the internet, and I can't really say I disagree with any of them. I do, however, have a problem with how they're implemented. I can't tell you how many times I've been berated by someone on the internet for thinking that the way they expressed themselves was offensive or wrong, without them even being aware of how they said it. In most cases, it's because of the tone they used, rather than the words they used. It's always been this way, but the internet and the mainstreaming of the SJW movement has amplified it. In some cases, people are losing their jobs for saying the wrong thing, which I believe is unreasonable. If I want to say "haha, I'm a big man with a big penis," I should be able to say that, without anyone getting offended. At the same time, I think there are aspects of the SJW movement that are good. I'm all for raising awareness about racism and sexism, and I believe it's an important thing to do. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think anyone should really be labeled "SJW" or "anti-SJW," because those are groups that are constantly changing and evolving. I also don't think anyone should be criticized for being SJW or anti-SJW, as long as it's done in a reasonable way. Now that I've made a reasonable post, let me clarify why I think the SJW movement is being criticized: The internet is a very toxic place, and SJWs are trying to make it a less toxic place. People should be more careful with their words, because if you say something that is likely to offend someone, you are more likely to hurt them. Unfortunately, most of the people who are criticizing the SJW movement are people who are immature, or incapable of regulating their tone. It's because of these people that I would hesitate to tell someone that their words are offensive. I would only do that if I was 100 sure that they were being purposefully offensive. The only reason I say "100" is because I know how often people get it wrong. I know how many times people misunderstand what someone means, and I know how many times people misunderstand the intentions of others. That's why I always try to be as sensitive as possible. It's not something that comes naturally to me, but I want to be a good person. I also think the SJW movement is criticized because of political reasons. Some people don't want to see any progress made in society, and they don't want anyone to have any feelings of entitlement. They want to turn back the clock and make things like racism and sexism legal again, so that they can exploit others. Most of the people who are anti-SJW are conservatives, and they are almost always Republican. They don't want anyone to have any sympathy for other races or genders. They're "those people" who want to keep blacks and women in their place, and they believe that the only way to "fix" the world is to bring back racism and sexism. They want to turn back the clock, so they can have power over others again. Those of you who believe that SJWs are causing society to "go too far" should be ashamed of yourselves. You don't want equality, you want power over others. I feel the same way about conservatives who are anti-SJW. I'm a liberal who believes in equality. I don't care if a woman is offended, or if a black man is offended. If you're offended, I'm going to make it a point to not offend you. If you're offended, I'm going to fight for you. If you don't believe in equality, then you shouldn't be an American.
