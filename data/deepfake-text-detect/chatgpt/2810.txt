This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding. For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force us into bundles of channels we want nothing to do with, all because the powers at be don't want to change things up in a way that benefits consumers but instead rewards those who own these businesses for their efforts. I think it's great that they understand customers better than customers ever will, but maybe the people who run SatelliteCable companies should consider making changes that benefit them as well. I could go on about this topic for pages so if anyone would like any more info please let me know!
