This CMV was inspired by this post: I believe that being obese is a disability. Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out. It's a disability that a lot of people are unaware of because it requires massive amounts of work and dedication on the part of society! If you look at my post history you can see I'm overweight too!! Not saying I don't like my weight but why do we need to be encouraged to suddenly stop growing?
