So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to make a compelling argument that engaging in sexual acts with animals is wrong because it involves taking advantage of creatures who cannot understand human language, and so cannot give consent. Furthermore, such actions are exploitative and disrespectful to the animal, who has no choice but to comply with whatever is asked of them. Animals have their own needs and rights, and any sexual contact should be considered a violation of those rights.
