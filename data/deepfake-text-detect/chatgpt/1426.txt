Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. The Holocaust is something we repeat every decade or so with people pretending to be Jews for political reasons or as a way to extort money from those who believe themselves targeted simply because they're Jews," wrote Prof. Eric Zuesse on his blog page at last year (Jan 26th). "In other words: It's not only an inconvenient truth: it's also 'a lie'... And it has been since time immemorial." Zuesse then said to stop giving support to Zionist policies which have led directly to Israel being "an apartheid state": When you don't use your right-wing neocon friends in America, what is left? When you can no longer count on neoconservatives to fight against the likes of Mahmoud Abbas, Benjamin Netanyahu and their pet Zionists worldwide, where do you go?" he asked rhetorically. He went further to say that such human rights violations should never happen again anywhere but acknowledged this had NOT happened in modern times. He thus denied that there ever was a holocaust, but merely cited "the mass murder perpetrated during Nazi Germany over six years [from 1933] when 6 million Jews were killed!" But he later admitted to having exaggerated the numbers beyond all reason; hence, lied... The problem here lies within Zionism itself, according to Zuesse, which continues to deny Judaism its original religious roots based upon the Talmud, the authoritative collection of rabbinic literature handed down through generations both before and after the foundation of Israel thousands of years ago. What needs to change is not just the Internet, but even the global economy whose monetary system depends heavily on credit and debt rather than gold and precious metals like silver and copper, he added. He recommended buying local currency instead of American dollars, especially physical coins, and going back to using precious metals other than silver and gold in everyday transactions.
