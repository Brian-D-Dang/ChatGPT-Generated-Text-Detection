I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites for information that had been posted by users over the years (e.g., "copy all of this text onto your website. It's not always about scraping though: sometimes you need to get people to give up control of their own data - maybe through cookies or something else - so when they visit another siteapp on the same network, there will be some info from them already stored somewhere about what other sites they're visiting. These things are usually just saved as logs without any real thought put into analysis; however, if you want to analyze someone's behavior across multiple platforms then collecting these log files is essential. In fact, even with modern javascript frameworks like React Redux nowadays, front-end code has many more critical bugs than back-end code! So having backend services means one can focus on design and algorithms rather than worrying about how well our business logic interacts with the browser DOM. It also lets us build tools which make browsing easier rather than harder (it's much nicer using features built into your web browser rather than writing custom software). I feel that we have a lot more opportunities available now thanks to recent advancements in machine learning technologies... but only time'll tell whether or not those changes actually lead anywhere, since ML is still pretty new:)
