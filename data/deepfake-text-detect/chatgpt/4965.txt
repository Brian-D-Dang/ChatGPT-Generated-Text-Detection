Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself out if they decide against me." The new House Democratic Caucus Chairman Democrat Caucus Chairwoman Debbie Dingell said he has no intention to force a vote on legislation that would require the committee members to adhere to the terms of the tax bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law last month and used as his personal budget measure after being elected president. "They're not going to be able to do their job," Dingell told Politico while promoting the bill during an interview with Politico Magazine earlier this week. "You need more than rhetoric or slogans because there's nothing else we can talk about here - if you want to really have a focus group discussion like we did last Friday" she added. Dingell also noted that Democrats were happy with the tax reform package passed by lawmakers but hoping to curb red tape and speed up approvals through legislative process rather than wait until next year when voters will determine whether Washington needs to hold hearings on its own version of the bill. Congress must pass new laws at least five years from now before any votes may occur again under current rules that require 60 days' notice prior to voting day. Democrats are trying to give Republicans full control over spending cuts and tax proposals ahead of next year's elections
