EDIT: a portion of replies I'm getting are focused on the defination of'libertarian' and the rainbow of american groups that claim it for their particular beliefs. If in doubt, replace'libertarian' with'liberal'. I'm noticing that the older I get, the more I find myself to be in agreement with people on the right. I'm an economist, and I'm left wing, so I'm fairly sceptical about most things economic. My opinions are based on science, but my views on what to do about it are often conservative. For example, I think that 'The Market' can solve most of the economic ills that plague us - but, because I'm left wing, I want government to be the agency that implements the solutions. Now, I'm not sure if this is an example of 'convergence' or not, but I have a sneaking suspicion that the people on the right, and I, are much closer than the left and I. Do you find yourself to be more in agreement with people on the right as you get older? If so, why do you think this is? Or are you of the opinion that all people get more conservative as they get older? If you are the former, what do you think the underlying reasons are? If you are the latter, what do you think the reasons are? I agree with this sentiment. I have been lurking for a long time but I'm really feeling the need to comment here. Most people on the left seem to take for granted the mantra "It's not capitalism, it's crony capitalism." I'm not sure what this really means. Is crony capitalism really different from capitalism, or is it just that we are seeing the worst aspects of capitalism right now? In any case, this seems to be the mindset of many leftists: we have a problem, and it is a bad thing. I think this is the wrong way to deal with things. Let's say you have a car with a problem. Your car is acting up. Now, let's say you have a mechanic you really trust. He's not the most skilled mechanic in the world, but you know he's not trying to scam you, he's not incompetent, and he's not going to steal your money. Now, let's say the mechanic tells you that it will take 1000 to fix your car. Now, let's say you don't have 1000. What would you do? I don't think that most people on the left are willing to let the mechanic do the work for nothing, or for 100. I don't think that most people on the left are willing to say, "Let's all try to fix this together, so that we can fix our car without paying the mechanic." The left wants to call the mechanic's shop "crony capitalism" because the mechanic is charging 1000, even though it's only 100 for him. But what they don't realize is that the other 900 is going to the taxman, who is going to distribute it to some of the poorest people in the country. This is the difference between capitalism and crony capitalism. In capitalism, the money goes to the people who created it. In crony capitalism, the money goes to people who are too lazy to create it. I'm all for punishing greed. But I think the left is doing it wrong. Punishing greed is good, but it should be punishing greed in the private sector. If you want to punish greed in the public sector, you are actually punishing people who aren't greedy. The left is blaming "capitalism" for the wrong problems. I can only speak for myself, but I'm a fiscal conservative who believes in "the free market" and also a social liberal who cares about the environment, LGBTQ issues, and minorities. I think the two go hand in hand. I know many like me, I think the idea that people have to be "eitheror" is nonsense. What I'm getting at is that I think it's a shame that we don't have a political party to represent these views, as that would, I believe, be much more popular with the American public. I think there are many people who are like me. If you look at the recent history of third parties, they generally don'
