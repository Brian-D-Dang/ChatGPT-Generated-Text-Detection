The idea is not to infringe on anyone's right to express themselves. If someone wants to have and film adult consenting adults having sex then they are free to do so as long as it does not involve children or animals... Okay, that makes sense - I just feel like the people who make decisions about what can be shown in porn should at least be close to being actual pornography experts (and obviously they're far from all of them). But yeah sure this seems fine for now:)
