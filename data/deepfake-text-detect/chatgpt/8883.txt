Hello everyone, with all the media coverage lately regrading transgender individuals I find myself uneducated on the particular subject and would love to be enlightened on the topic. I support research which examines claims of health benefits or physiological reasons for sexual orientation as they are claimed by medical professionals (but not based upon evidence in a court of law). However, I've never been informed on why certain medications work and other drugs do not. This is also where I'll focus my attention because I'm currently hearing about sexual orientation issues from different angles (and so far there's no one to speak up over this stuff) but I want to get as much information out there as possible. I have two questions: firstly, what is a "proper" way of doing it? Secondly, how does an LGBT person react when being referred to a therapist? What I'd like to know is if the treatment should take place at least temporarily, but that won't happen overnight. As always thanks for reading and feedback! If you'd like to hear more thoughts on the topic (which you can share), here's a link to the book "Socially Straight Women" and here's the FAQ page (it has some great info too!) Thank you so much for taking the time to read this article. The topics discussed in this article are definitely important enough to me that I think I need to take a closer look at them. I agree though, that we need to start working on integrating these issues into our daily lives. Let me know what you make of these articles and your thoughts!
