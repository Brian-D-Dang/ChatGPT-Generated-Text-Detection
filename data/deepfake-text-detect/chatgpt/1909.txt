The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line but I can't help feeling like people are just trying to cover their tracks for some reason I don't think either side wants this conversation right now because everyone knows what will happen next if we continue on with our current politics...
