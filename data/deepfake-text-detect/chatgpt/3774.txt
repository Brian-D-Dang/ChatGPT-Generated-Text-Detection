I have had friendships with various males, and only one of them has not tried to at one point in time, make it sexual. This was not a big deal for me as I don't find anything wrong with that (besides the fact that my friends were very sexist against men doing this), but the other two have done that. They've been married to each other now for 20 years! What happened after you spoke up? Were they ever threatened or did something happen afterwards?
