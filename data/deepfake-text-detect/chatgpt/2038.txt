This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) seem to be based on blind faith and in return for your unquestioning loyalty you are promised eternal life by the Gods. If this were true then why do people need so much convincing? Why don't they just see it with their own two eyes rather than take someone's word that there is actually something out there called GodAllahYawehSatan etc.. I am personally agnostic but find myself being fascinated about religion...i believe we will never truly know what happens after death because no one has ever died before! So until anyone comes forward from beyond that veil let us all live our lives fearlessly without any restraints both physical AND spiritual! With love xxx
