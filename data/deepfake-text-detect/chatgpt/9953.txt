Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just say this: Thank you to everyone who has shared their thoughts and made suggestions. I appreciate the feedback and constructive criticism, and I'm already working on implementing some of the ideas.
