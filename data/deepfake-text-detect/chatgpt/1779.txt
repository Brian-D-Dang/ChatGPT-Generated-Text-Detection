Written hastily, but hopefully I can clarify any mistakes in comments, here we go: The Confederacy was racist according to the cornerstone speech and secession papers (tx): [Cornerstone Speech] excerpt from texas state archive website: It is not our purpose or mission to wage war against the government of this State. But if compelled by necessity, we will do so with entire celerity... and secede; the reason being that it would be better for us all than to place ourselves at the mercy of a foreign power hostile to us... We must safeguard and maintain the rights reserved to us... as well agree upon a plan of action which shall secure these rights.... If we cannot obtain what we consider reasonable terms on favorable conditions, we should be resolved to exclude such formality.... That it is desirable that the people who have been invested with authority over them should fulfill their duties faithfully has always been understood without difficulty among men whose opinion tends toward mutual good feeling between neighbors...... And in reference to the proposed federal constitution of 1850, many good causes are urged why they should adopt its provisions....... Such objections may easily be met and dealt with upon just principles, if other States were willing to submit themselves voluntarily to thereby acquire union under one government. This course of voluntary submission might then be speedily followed by other Southern states until every objection could be eliminated. The extensive territory embraced within those limits gives scope to a large population and extensive commerce. The declaration of independence says "all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." (Texas Declaration of Independence) In Texas there wasn't much popular will since there was no representation of the interests of the average Texan excepting Juan Antonio de Santa Anna, who wanted to bring slavery into Texas permanently through annexation! There's plenty enough reasons to deny him his wish. Which if you think about it makes perfect sense. He sowed division amongst Texans during the war when he brought up slaves after the civil war had ended. So let's be clear - Southerners controlled southern politics because they didn't want non-slaveholding Texans to vote too highly while Southerners held political sway throughout the nation due largely to their slaveholding status quo. Your argument does not hold water either way. Thank goodness for the Constitution making sure all citizens got equal representation whether they lived near the ocean edge or deep snow covered mountains. Also thanks Al Gore for protecting your right to free speech even though corporations can buy elections now days using funds made possible via legislation passed by Republicans including George Bush Sr..
