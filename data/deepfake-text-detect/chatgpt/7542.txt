There are many arguments against a rigid binary understanding of gender beyond biological sex. For one, the idea of "gender norms" is not necessarily tied to biological sex. While certain characteristics may be more commonly associated with one sex or the other, there is no inherent reason why someone with male genitalia cannot enjoy traditionally feminine activities or traits, for example. Additionally, many people experience dysphoria, or a profound sense of discomfort or alienation, due to their sexgender identity not feeling congruent with their biological sex. This suggests that gender is in fact an important aspect of individuals' lived experiences beyond biology. Finally, limiting our understanding of gender to biology also erases the experiences of intersex people, who may not fit neatly into our preconceived ideas about what makes someone "male" or "female." In short, reducing gender to nothing more than biology ignores the complex and multifaceted ways in which people experience gender.
