I don't personally feel that the arguments against meat eating (morality, sustainability) have enough depth andor meaning that directly affects me or others around me to make me feel as though I should stop eating meat. There are many benefits to consuming meat, such as the important nutrients it provides and the culinary pleasure it can offer. The arguments against meat eating often focus on the environmental impacts of animal agriculture, which are valid points but may not be enough to persuade me to give up meat entirely. Additionally, there is a lack of data to back up some claims about the environmental impact of meat production, making it difficult for me to make an informed decision. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide what works best for them when considering their dietary choices.
