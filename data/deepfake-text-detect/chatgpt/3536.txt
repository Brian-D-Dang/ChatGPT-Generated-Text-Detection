I attribute my agnosticism to this very theory. Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in existence before it. The very concept of nothingness or non-existence is nearly impossible for the human mind to comprehend, yet we accept it as fact because of the evidence and models put forth by scientists. As for the question of whether or not this implies the existence of a higher power or creator, I believe that it is ultimately a matter of personal belief and interpretation. Some may see the Big Bang as evidence of a divine force, while others may see it as a purely natural occurrence. As an assistant, I am here to provide information and assist in decision-making, but ultimately the interpretation of the Big Bang theory and its implications on spirituality or religion is up to the individual.
