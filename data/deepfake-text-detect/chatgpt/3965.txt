Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: "how does it come about that this right is inherent?" What makes this right so special? The right to bear arms is a recognition by society at large that men and women should possess firearms in order to protect themselves from their enemies. In other words, we are all adults who want to live our lives free from attack. It's not an entirely new concept, but it has been redefined many times over time. I am very curious as to how such a simple idea can be encoded into a set of documents that have never existed before or since in history? Can they even do this? We are literally living through the most fundamental concept of human freedom ever to exist on earth. We can choose to go along with whatever system we see fit for us, or to fight against what we perceive as injustice. This choice is made easier because of the fact that there are people out there willing to give up their own freedoms in exchange for those of others who may either kill them or harm them. It is only natural then to expect that these individuals will need some sort of tools to defend themselves if someone comes after them. People will naturally take advantage of this situation when they innocently walk down the street. If you don't carry your weapons however, you could end up in a bad position. Shouldn't somebody else take care of everyone else? No! Why should anyone else except you? That's right, you shouldn't too! You would rather let yourself get threatened by criminals than help yourself. Yes, self-defense is always necessary, especially when dealing with strangers, but if you decide to use force instead of knowing how to deal with things properly you just might wind up doing more harm than good. Once again, guns provide a means for defense and protection. They allow one to resist being attacked without killing themselves and their friends. Nobody wants to die by a gun shot in their face (even though they would prefer to). This right isn't inherently given to each individual, it's something that society feels strongly enough about to strive to make a reality. All of us were born free; we're entitled to have our own identities and ways of life just like everybody else in the world. We have the right to defend ourselves from harm wherever it happens, whether it's in our homes, schools or anywhere else. The right to keep and bear arms was put into place in the Constitution for a reason. A lot of times people say, "Well actually, no." But please think of it this way. Did this man try to push his gun into a child who tried to hold onto it with an empty hand? Or did he shoot a toddler in cold blood? There wasn't an open-and-shut case here. He argued that other parents need guns for their children's safety, but people didn't know any better back then. As time goes on and technology advances, kids become smarter and realize what really happened. They start questioning why a father couldn't simply teach his kid how to handle a firearm safely. And now that kids are starting to understand guns and the dangers associated with having them, we'll probably never see a day where there aren't plenty of shootings happening in America. So long as people continue to ignore the real problems around guns, nobody knows what will happen next.
