Disclaimer: this talk of secession may not be present everywhere in the United States, but it is more than prevalent where I live, so I'm going off that. To me, there's nothing wrong with a region wanting to separate from its parent state; Brexit might have been an oversimplification (though perhaps only by 30 or less), and maybe since most US states are formed either through annexationconquest as opposed topurchase) they'd all fit into one category for my purposes here.-The arguments put forth against these breakup votes include things like "what about justice? What if we don't get fair representation?" etc., which seem reasonable enough at first glance when applied generally across history-but how does anyone know what will happen specifically under any given arrangement being proposed without having some kind provable mechanism behind their claim the legislature who represents us would never allow such unfairness!?To take another example - let alone why should you accept those claims uncritically?: Taxes go up 50, education funding goes down 90. You're still paying your taxes...does everyone else suddenly become free riders then because no longer do people agree on basic facts anymore??And while antitax" sentiment always seems popular among voters right now understandable considering our current tax code has gotten ridiculous latelythat aspect won out after World War 2 primarily due t o extreme levels spanning decades before fighting ended followed directly following Pearl Harbor, making many citizens nervous whether military spending was necessary until victory could finally brought home. And even today practically nobody wants much higher income taxation except during times immediately postwar: Even though Trump ran his campaign claiming he' d bring back manufacturing jobs again comparable numbers were employed pre 2008 financial crisis unemployment rate continues low; interest rates remain near record highs demand remains strong despite supposed fear mongering headlines suggesting otherwiseWe can question politics running amuck anywhere anytime especially within areas experiencing drastic changes rapidly overnight - unfortunately blacks aren't exactly seeing unqualified support similar attitudes towards minorities facing overt discrimination prior 1950 s Funny thing happens every time someone starts talking treasonous thoughts publicly however:- Either somebody comes along saying just wait til tomorrow newscasts start reporting bad news soon!! aka quote mining! Or alternatively "we got too far ahead...backing away isn 'tn gonna help" style argument:-D
