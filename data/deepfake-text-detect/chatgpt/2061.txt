Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as possible and similar. His comment blew up for some reason so he did an AMA on rpersonalfinance about it but also answered questions from this sub too. You should go check that out if you're interested:) I just saw his ama over there actually lol
