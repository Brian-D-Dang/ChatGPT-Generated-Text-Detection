I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If the universe is static and there is nothing beyond earth, what purpose does our existence on planet earth serve? It would seem as if we should just be grateful for where we are living at given time. But why bother living in the first place? If I had my way you wouldn't live long enough to ask such questions...you'd end up dead and billions more like yourself will too! Of course they do..they tell me every day about their lives on Earth so that's all i can understand..i dont know how good my English really is though..so one song might say something different from another here an there and believe me its very clear to see which ones speak english "properly" lol..and since im only getting older by the minute right now i guess i get angrier with age haha!! So true. This video shows some Cajun folk dancing around someone dressed like Gollum singing "love hurts," referencing a quote made famous by Gandalf: "Do not go gentle into that good night Rage, rage against the dying of the light." Haha yeah she gets angry sometimes because people think her songs are children oriented, cuz they sorta are, and then other times people try t translate them (not meaning anything bad) and they don't quite get it. Then those same translations come back and confuse everyone even worse ; So yea...she has no problem ranting. Especially over things she feels strongly about.lol And "Lonely Boy" was inspired by Tolkien stories. She actually wrote it before The Fellowship Of The Ring came out. And yes, that scene happens later in the story. Lol She also said somewhere that Bilbo Baggins may influence her writing style because he doesn't talk about himself much unlike Frodo who talks a lot about his journey through life-long love. I dunno exactly where she said it either. XD There wasn't just 1 reason why they were doing it, Kacey sang a little bit about what each member did with himherself while nursing Sam in the hospital with her, iirc, 'cause according to Kacie F IS gone...but coms to mind....Jaq videos of these 2: (the nurse part)...that recording's quality isn't great but still... That's a big question mark to me. Our existence is ultimately meaningless without God. Not many atheists believe in God. Most simply deny Him. To embrace atheism seems idiotic since death awaits us anyway. Why waste your energy looking down upon Christians as being foolish? We're better off living in peace than worrying about stupid stuff. Good luck trying to prove God exists. He won't let Himself be proven. You could run around the world fifty million times hoping to find God who will show Himself to you. No matter what else you agree on he disagrees with you regarding belief in His Christhood. In fact, he makes fun of Jesus saying that Jesus was nuts. Jesus' self-sacrifice is irrelevant unless it provokes us to sacrifice ourselves. For most people self-righteousness trumps humility. Atheists make sense to most nonbelievers, agnostics, etc., because they have secular goals in life. They want money, prestige, recognition, pleasure, comfort, safety, etc. Believing in God is psychologically incompatible with pursuing earthly happiness. People who pursue godliness cannot experience worldly happiness. That's called the Law of Compensation if everything works fine except for one thing, then something must be missing hence the need for spiritual fulfillment. What happened to eternal damnation before the Fall? The Bible says that Adam and Eve lived eternally under the curse of God until the coming of Jesus. Until then man existed outside of time as a soul alone with God. There was supposed to be no suffering in heaven as well as hell? Nowadays Jehovah's Witnesses claim that all men died immediately after the Fall, so there was never ever sin within humanity; however, as Scripture states elsewhere, mankind began repenting from the moment of creation itself, and therefore evil entered human nature. Human beings have corrupted themselves the entire history throughout eternity, yet they still expect God to forgive them once they die. There is no justification for faith apart from repentance and forgiveness. However, there has always been wickedness - indeed, depravity - in fallen flesh. At least thirty thousand years ago, according to Genesis 6, Noah awoke to his drunken sons killing animals by drinking poisonous wine and eating meat cooked in blood. By verse nine the Lord opened his eyes and told him, Surely I have seen affliction of humankind,' declares the LORD.'Take for yourselves seven pairs ersay Thoughts [noscore ferrin6 V 9 should party held strong8 could 9 would 10 dutte 10 are
