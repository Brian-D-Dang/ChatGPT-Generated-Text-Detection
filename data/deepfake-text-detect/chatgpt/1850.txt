First thing, let's assume the biblical Jesus is completely true. Now, I have a fair knowledge of the biblical tale, but if I say something wrong, feel welcome to correct me: Does that mean he was ordained by God? If so then it means he wasn't human and maybe not even divine (like Satan). I don't think you need to worry about "doing it right." The whole point isn't getting things right - it's highlighting just how much there is in common with one another given our shared heritage.
