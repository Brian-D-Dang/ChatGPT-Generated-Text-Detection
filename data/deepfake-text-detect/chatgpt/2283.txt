Variable tax, or at least they way the US does it, is poorly done, inasmuch as it often discourages extra labour from people who may very well need the extra money. Yes, but a flat rate system would be even more so because we'd have to pay that amount on whatever income level you start out with and whether your labor force participation increasesdecreases over time has nothing to do with this anymore than how much of an impact any other factor (e.g., bad luck) might have had - which makes it pretty arbitrary what sort of person gets taxed one percentage versus another and why should our government get involved where market forces are already doing their job far less imperfectly? It's just not necessary nor helpful for anyone except those who make up policy: politicians bureaucrats who can use taxes to bribe voters into voting for them... while demanding ever-increasing amounts once elected! Heckuva scam going here....
