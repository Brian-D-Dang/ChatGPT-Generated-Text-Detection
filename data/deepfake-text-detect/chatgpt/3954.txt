EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one of the biggest issues for any game developer is how they handle their customer data. In the end, the public data can just as easily be misused by third parties or stolen. This doesn't happen that often with games because developers have full control over the code, but it does happen with other types of data like credit card numbers. The issue isn't that folks aren't careful about what games they buy quite the opposite! When you give people money, your intention is usually to give them something tangible (something physical) to use as a currency. You don't want someone hacking into someones account and buying thousands of dollars worth of stuff on their behalf. If Daniel was really interested in PSN profits from his purchases, he would have set up a PayPal account so they could all deposit directly into his bank account without having to go through Sony's servers. Another problem comes when companies keep track of sensitive private information, as this article explains [here]. As another example, there are many Kickstarter projects where backers get rewards based on their level rather than the actual amount pledged. Here again there tends to be a blurring of business and personal life, which leads us to our next point...
