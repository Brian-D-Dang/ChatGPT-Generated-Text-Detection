By "practical reason," I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election. I admit this is true for a few reasons, but at least one is clear: it seems the more practical reason why every single Democrat who voted for Trump in 2016 had more fun than Trump did with his endless promises about how he'd do something good if elected president - no matter what happened next year! So Trump was right not only because he couldn't spell the difference between 'Trump' and 'Hillary Clinton.' The difference is that Clinton's campaign said so, as opposed to Trump's campaign saying the opposite. Trump ignored all of Clinton's speeches on the issues, making nothing any easier for voters to understand or dislike. Neither candidate believes much about immigration policy either; regardless of how they disagree, they seem determined to make immigration worse rather than better when they are running against each other. Clinton's campaign saw it differently too, as many sent emails suggesting her presidential candidacy wasn't seriously worth it even though Trump doesn't agree with Sanders. Clinton worked hard to undermine Sanders during her primary debates after Sanders dropped out over unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud (which she denied). However, Clinton's campaign didn't keep Trump quiet while Trump promised to deal with widespread voter suppression through crackdowns targeting illegal immigrants despite knowing their crimes would kill Americans' votes. Trump knows his supporters hate him now. Of course, this isn't just an issue of political correctness versus critical thinking. It also applies to practically everything else Trump does. In his first six months in office, Trump has made it impossible for anyone not to believe in his policies unless they're explicitly stated otherwise. But one thing is certain: When Clinton runs again, he'll be seen as a weak leader willing to destroy America once again.
