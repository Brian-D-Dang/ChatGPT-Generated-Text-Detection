Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. Yet almost every day we do something that harms cows in ways you'd never imagine: We use them as food and as milk producers - even though there's no scientific evidence supporting vegetarianism for human beings or animals consuming dairy products. Dr Jan Nolthenius is an expert on animal welfare at Utrecht University in The Netherlands (and also knows everything about vegan diets). In this interview she shares her views of our relationship with cattle. She explains why it makes sense from an ethical point of view not to eat beef - but still considers eating veal acceptable because harming young calves isn't easy to detect compared to killing adult cows who can fight back. With more than 30 years' experience working with farm animals, Dr Noltthenius says people need to realise just how much damage is being done when we consume these "food" items. What have your experiences been like researching the impact of agriculture on cows? Can I ask what type of questions did you start out answering before moving onto other areas? Does buying meat from supermarkets pose any particular problems? What sort of research has gone into solving those issues? I started my career investigating pig production systems, which resulted in me publishing several papers describing the negative effects of farrowing crates [a system where pregnant sows live alone in small cages], sow stalls [cages in which pigs spend most of their lives] and gestation crates [improperly designed pens]. Since then, I've continued to focus mainly on reducing animal suffering in intensive farming operations, including low-stress slaughter practicesslaughter plants and improving standards of care in intensive farms (e.g., barn hygiene). My interests currently encompass three main themes: 1) reducing the adverse impacts of industrialised livestock production via improvements in husbandry and environmental conditions; 2) providing consumers with accurate information about factory poultry production; 3) conducting qualitative studies exploring consumer attitudes towards different types of foods (including meat consumption) and discussing potential motivations for changing behaviour. One example of a project regarding public perceptions was published earlier this year. While trying fruitlessly to find data showing a link between meat intake and health outcomes, I discovered a large body of literature documenting various hazards associated with antibiotic usage in livestock. Given these risks, antibiotic resistance poses one of the major threats to modern medicine, especially in developing countries where superbugs such as MRSA are highly prevalent. This led us to investigate whether patients become better educated after learning about antimicrobial stewardship policies within hospitals. My team conducted interviews with hospital staff, residents doctors, students in medical school and general practitioners practicing in rural clinics. Most participants stated that knowledge gained during university training influenced professional practice significantly. Many agreed that increased awareness could improve patient care and contribute to reduced medication costs. However, only half reported having had any direct contact with colleagues practising antimicrobial stewardship, while another third said that institutional support would be important for implementation. Outreach efforts were considered feasible if standardised educational materials were provided online. Additional topics discussed included: best options for nutrition education; long term storage techniques for antibiotics; and microbiology teaching methods. An abstract summarizing findings will soon appear in JBMR (2011 Mar 31), available online here: ). Our next challenge was to examine perceived barriers preventing veterinary students from adopting humane living arrangements (i.e. free roaming). Amongst respondents, practical constraints such as lack of space and equipment capable of assessing pain made impractical alternatives seem the least attractive option, although they received higher scores for ease of adoption. Welfare concerns ranked highest, followed by costs. Lack of time was mentioned surprisingly infrequently as a reason not to change housing practices, suggesting that some veterinarians may already value good welfare over financial considerations. Our final survey involved members of animal protection groups that work closely with farmers. These organisations typically receive complaints about poor treatment of housed animals from concerned citizens, helping them devise realistic solutions to implement changes without incurring additional costs or upsetting management. Survey responses revealed similar patterns amongst all interviewed individuals. For instance, corrective feedback to farmers caused considerable distress, leading many employers to ban communication of such events through email or phone calls. Furthermore, it became apparent that very few employees intended to take up positions on agricultural advisory boards, unless companies introduced mandatory programmes requiring candidates to hold specific qualifications. Without appropriate qualifications, becoming a member of such bodies seemed unlikely to reduce farm stress levels. Another issue pertained to the allocation of responsibilities among individual stakeholders. Some volunteers experienced difficulties accepting accountability due to conflicting roles assigned by employer and industry representatives. Finally, responding groups emphasised a pressing need to collaborate across related disciplines and agencies, and develop partnerships targeting common goals. They expressed confidence that these strategies might yield sustainable results aimed ultimately at improved animal wellbeing.
