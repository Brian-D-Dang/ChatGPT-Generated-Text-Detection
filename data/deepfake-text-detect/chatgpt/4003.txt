Ok, view changed. I guess I meant that there was an arbitrary double standard between alcohol and pot in the workplace, as opposed to saying employers don't have a basis for discriminating against veterans (which is what I am getting at). I think you are confusing "stoners" with "alcoholics." Please read the guide again before posting next time.
