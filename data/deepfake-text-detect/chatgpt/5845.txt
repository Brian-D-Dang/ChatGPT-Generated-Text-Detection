I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. I have tried it about 3 times (I am not a big coffee drinker), and I cannot seem to get past the bitter, acidic aftertaste that I hate so much. Does anyone have any tips for me to start liking it? I've never been a fan of coffee, but I was a big fan of iced tea. I'm not sure if you know the difference between the two, but I know that's what I was told.
