Would you go to Enterprise and rent a car for 24 months? That's very similar to what a lease is. 1. Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to rent a car or provide financial advice. However, I can tell you that a car lease is a contractual agreement between a buyer (lessee) and a dealer (lessor) where the lessee pays a monthly fee for the use of a vehicle for a set period of time. The lease agreement typically includes limits on the number of miles that can be driven and requires the lessee to return the vehicle in good condition at the end of the lease term. It's important for individuals to carefully consider their financial situation and transportation needs before entering into a lease agreement.
