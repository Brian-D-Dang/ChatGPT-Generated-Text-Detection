I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. That's because that's a very broad statement. Most people who say they're not attracted to slutty types aren't actually not attracted to them - they just say it in an attempt to avoid conflict andor embarrassment by saying something less offensive than what you've said.
