To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting to this stage, it seems like the Education Department has been working to make sure that all children are learning these things when they graduate from elementary and middle schools in order for them to be ready for post-secondary schooling. Since I will not have any recourse into what happens at home (I do know how bad our situation can get), I would love something just as thorough on the public education system. My husband was told by his teachers and principal that he had no talent nor potentials for anything else but being an accountant or lawyer; and so far, none of them have seen him improve upon that skill as much as six months ago. And somehow we need to convince the rest of the teachers here too since there's only one teacher who does see improvement in her students' grades every week. My husband keeps telling me "maybe its because you're helping us with homework," well last time I checked homework wasn't even assigned unless if he failed to meet the requirements of the subject during class. So now I'm left wondering: Is it possible for a person to achieve good score in several subjects without having to study? This might sound funny coming from someone whose two older siblings both passed their High School graduation with much higher than outstanding scores despite never studying hard on their own behalf. But then again, it could be just because they were lucky enough to have parents who provided them everything needed to succeed academically. Also, please feel free to correct me where necessary since English isn't my first language to begin with - I hope to become fluent someday!:D Thank you! EDIT: Please note, I don't mean standardized tests such as SATACT etc., just test results from random classes and activities. Also, The situation that I wrote above happened five years ago and I did ask about why he didn't change before hand. You cannot tell me it was impossible for our teachers to realize they were wrong until after the fact. It wasn't that long a period of time between asking questions and answers. We tried practically speaking out loud that maybe he should take another path instead of becoming an accountant which neither of us agreed with. He also asked earlier on a different occasion if there is any way to get a college scholarship outside of taking AP courses, which seems almost laughable given that he doesn't really want to go to college. Yet, he said nothing to anyone for over half year after finding those answers. Why? Because he thought it'd be pointless anyway and feel stupid doing stuff that won't help him in life? That's certainly possible...but I doubt it. Perhaps he did not think we'll actually move away anytime soon? I wish I knew exactly what went through his mind back then. A: While cheating may work sometimes when you have more freedom than other people have, generally academic success depends on your ability to focus and persevere. If your son already knows most material covered in math, science, history and english, why bother going to work harder on these topics? After a while, you need to pick up new ideas and integrate old ones together. So, if he figures out what works best, he will likely continue using what worked previously.
