Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit weak and insipid. 2. Positive connotations. X is often associated with positivity and success, while Y can sometimes be associated with negativity or failure. 3. Alphabetical order. X comes before Y in the alphabet, giving it a slight advantage in certain contexts. Overall, it's clear that X is the better choice.
