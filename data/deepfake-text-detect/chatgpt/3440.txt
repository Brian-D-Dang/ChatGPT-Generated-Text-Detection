I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by which bills become laws should be simplified to ensure that the voice of the people is heard without undue influence from special interests or partisan politics. While it's understandable to want a more streamlined legislative process, the two-chamber system in the United States has been in place for over two centuries and has proven to be effective in balancing competing interests and preventing the tyranny of the majority. The House of Representatives, with its proportional representation, allows for greater representation of the population, while the Senate, with its fixed representation, gives each state an equal voice in the legislative process. Rather than eliminating one chamber or simplifying the legislative process, it may be more effective to work towards reducing the influence of big money in politics and encouraging politicians to prioritize the needs and desires of their constituents over party politics. This can be done through campaign finance reform, transparency in government, and greater public participation in the political process.
