Scientists widely accept that climate change is real. Consequently, they say that it will lead to extreme weather, a raise in the sea level, increased acidity of the ocean, reduced biodiversity and land conversion - all of which may cause widespread economic damage. But what if these claims were made by people who wanted their policies changed because those changes would benefit them? How much credence should we give the words of scientists who are financially motivated by profit, rather than their work? An analysis of the evidence suggests that this is not unreasonable. An analysis of more than 80 million peer-reviewed articles published over 35 years shows that there has been little improvement in the ability of science to predict how human activities affect the environment. Recent studies such as Global Climate Risk: Science or Policy?, by James Hansen (a former NASA employee) have demonstrated that at least 20 of the warming recorded since 1970 can be accounted for by natural variability alone; yet even so, this figure is still far from certain. The extent to which human activity contributes to global warming remains unknown to any significant degree. However, when internal policy debate becomes driven by financial gain, it tends to focus on matters where scientific uncertainty is low, such as the temperature rise caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. There have now emerged few alternative sources of information about the consequences of climate change other than those in whose hands it lies. It seems clear then, that policymakers make decisions based upon "data" provided by companies with an interest in doing business. This is why so many environmental measures have become dependent on regulation issued under the guise of protecting consumers. The question then arises whether the financial rewards of pursuing policies consistent with scientific consensus actually outweigh the potential costs of adopting policies which could cost millions of lives. A study run by Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University reported that they found no correlation between the amount said to be spent on 'climate justice' programs and researchers getting grants to conduct research into climate change. In fact, the authors estimate that funding such projects makes 10 of researchers less willing to publish in peer-review journals and thus slows down the pace of climate change research overall. Overall, the findings suggest that most researchers find it difficult to justify spending money on issues which exert only small influence on decision makers in society. And although some might argue that environmental causes should be considered much higher stakes than monetary ones, that raises another question: given the serious risks associated with climate change, shouldn't scientists also do everything in their power to promote solutions which reduce risk instead of seeking out lucrative opportunities to enhance their own status quo?
