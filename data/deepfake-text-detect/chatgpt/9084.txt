It is pretty well known that the colombine shooters believed in natural selection, a key point of evolution. Just from their [wiki] they talk about natural selection in their journals, which is actually quite interesting; but of course it depends on who you ask... If I were to guess what my theory would be, given the choice between a male and female, wouldn't I then think there's more chance for me to have sex with both females?
