This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding. For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force you to pay for channels that you don't even watch. However, with the rise of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, you now have the ability to only pay for what you want to watch. These streaming services offer a wide range of content for a fraction of the cost of traditional cable and satellite subscriptions. Additionally, they offer the convenience of being able to watch your favorite shows and movies on demand, often without commercials. With a strong internet connection, you can even stream these services on multiple devices, making it easy to watch your favorite content wherever you are.
