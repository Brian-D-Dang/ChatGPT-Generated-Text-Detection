So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor ethnicity because they have historically been marginalized and oppressed in society, while white people have been the dominant and privileged group. Therefore, attempts by ethnic minorities to reclaim or assert their cultural identity cannot be classified as harmful or discriminatory towards white people. It's important to note that the concept of "reverse racism" is not recognized by most scholars and experts in the field of race and ethnicity studies. Racism is typically defined as a systemic and institutionalized oppression of a particular racial group, and therefore, cannot be applied to an oppressed group attempting to reclaim their cultural practices or traditions. That being said, it's important for all individuals to be mindful of the cultural context and history of the practices they are engaging in and strive to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or cultural misappropriation. Ultimately, treating all individuals with respect and understanding of their cultural practices can promote mutual understanding and create a more inclusive and equitable society.
