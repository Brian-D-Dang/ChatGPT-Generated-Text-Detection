So, I saw a commercial today about a pill that helps with BED, and I did a bit of quick research on it. From what little research I did, it seems that it is just another pill that you take and it increases your appetite, so you gain weight and eat more. Sounds like a great way to gain weight! Does anyone have any more information about this pill and how it works?
