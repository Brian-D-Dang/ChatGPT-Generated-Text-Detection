Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me!?!? Why would you want a massive space rock there if the giant chunk of space rocks can come crashing down and collide with your ship!? They're floating around in it somewhere!!!??!!
