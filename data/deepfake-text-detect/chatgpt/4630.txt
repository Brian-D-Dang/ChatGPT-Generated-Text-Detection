This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use was or who actually paid for it, as long as someone pays for it and owns it. Do away with any special tax exemptions that exist now. When they go up in price, so does your assessment; when they drop in price (which seems to happen more often than people realize), you get a break. Secondly, reduce income taxes to something reasonable, such as 15, but stick with a flat rate system. There are many countries out there where employees pay very little in income taxes while corporations almost never have their profits taxed at anything close to 100. Why do we want our own rich folks to enjoy this kind of treatment? Spread the wealth around. The problem isn't just that some companies can afford to give us huge dividends every year, which is pretty much how our present government treats them. We also need to make sure everyone has access to health care - particularly those lacking adequate insurance coverage through an employer. But why would anyone oppose this? The theory behind these changes sounds good, but practically speaking, it will create problems. Right now lots of owners of commercial properties don't pay enough attention to these issues because they know that if things start getting too bad, Congress may come back into session and fix the mess. You wouldn't like it if someone decided to raise your taxes without giving you advance warning, right? However, once the first round of big company layoffs occur, we might find ourselves living under martial law. At least until the restoration period ends. Then the State Police will probably take over again...just saying... I've been placing small bets during my lifetime that something along the lines described above will happen eventually, though certainly nothing near as dramatic. Here's hoping that I'm wrong! By:Troy Kinsman on 12052009 at 2:50 PM As far as I understand, non-corporate income taxes only apply to individuals, whereas corporate income taxes could theoretically affect both individuals AND corporations equally. So maybe the solution here lies in addressing larger taxation policies that favor one entity over another instead of directly targeting individual households. Wouldn't that sort of approach help solve other economic woes as well? Dennis Furlong By:John Van Steenwyk on 09252010 at 8:06 AM From Wikipedia: "Nonresident aliens" refers to persons residing outside the United States. Taxation laws typically allow residents of foreign nations to exclude amounts received from abroad by means of certain exclusions rules.[7] For example, U.S. citizens may deduct personal expenses related to caring for family members overseas,[89....laliens" In order to avoid paying double taxes in two different states on the same item, e.g., a car purchased in North Carolina and operated exclusively in New York state, the purchaser must declare his intention to return home after purchase and pay sales tax in NC before leaving the state, rather than pay it upon delivery. This amounts to reducing the cost of purchasing and owning the vehicle. This approach is especially helpful to US expats who buy homes in Latin America, Asia, Europe, and Africa, etc., as most local governments rely on the customs duty to subsidize social programs and infrastructure. These deductions lessen the amount of money being sent to Washington DC, thus saving the taxpayer even more money. All part of kabuki theater called "free trade" economics. Taxes are designed to discourage harmful behavior, yet you seem to imply that more government regulation and higher taxes are better solutions to rising unemployment numbers. Taxes provide incentives for productive behavior, i.e., encouraging labor intensive production facilities in the service sector to employ more workers, thereby increasing output. According to Adam Smith, private firms naturally gravitate toward maximizing profit regardless of environmental conditions. Governments encourage efficiency by providing subsidies to business ventures, promoting increased worker productivity and capital investment (recall Mr. Obama speaks about the auto industry bailout). If businesses were able to operate freely, assume the free markets would produce greater results lower prices, fewer jobs lost due to downsizing and automation, reduced outsourcing costs, less severe competition between employers, etc. Even President Eisenhower recognized this fact, stating in 1955 that Americans prosper best in competitive capitalism. Your argument against high levels of taxation makes sense only if you ignore reality and believe high unemployment figures reflect poor management decisions within the American economy, or at worst, rampant speculation among Wall Street gamblers desperate to obtain easy credit loans. Such logic leads logically to anarchy and dictatorship. As Napoleon said, "Anarchy is the natural condition of mankind." Further proof that today's politicians aren't thinking clearly is found in recent budgetary proposals calling for deep cuts in education spending and slashing funding for Head Start Programs and preschool programs. In 2003, Bill Clinton proposed cutting 1. By 2007, if votes are percentages of failure to fail: 'u'. Today's departure and 'u' What goes astick
