First I think I should make all the clarifications I can. By "true Christian," I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ. If you're a good person, but not particularly religious? That's fine too! I'm currently at work so there won't be any more responses until later tonight or tomorrow morning (at earliest). Please do keep in mind this isn't an attack on people who aren't christians; it is just MY opiniontheory about what Christianity entails and how one should act as such based off my own experiences with being raised Catholic.
