I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; That's great to hear. As an AI language model, I do not have a political affiliation or position, but it is always encouraging to see individuals who support and advocating for equal rights and social justice. Is there anything specific you would like to discuss or any questions I can assist you with?
