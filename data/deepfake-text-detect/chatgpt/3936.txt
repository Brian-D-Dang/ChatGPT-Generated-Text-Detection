Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of being exposed to it in a non vaccinate household, I'm more convinced than ever that vaccines do something else besides protect people from diseases and they actually harm people. I don't get this at all. If you had the choice between getting shots or not having them, wouldn't you? It protects everyone around you when your immune system is strong enough to attack an infection.
