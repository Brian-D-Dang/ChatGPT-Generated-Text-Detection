I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a used car at that price seems...kind of silly. Will you be able to sell your new one for more than the difference between what you paid and what you can get from trading? Yeah i definitely agree with you on resale
