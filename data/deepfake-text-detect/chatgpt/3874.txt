So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But there seems to be a real enthusiasm for such benefits in our society and among the younger generation (I am one of them). The same cannot be said about parental leave. The US has some form of parental leave policy but most companies still do not offer similar paid time off to their parents as they do to their employees. And this despite the fact that there appears to be considerable demand from workers themselves who want to take advantage of these conditions. There seems to be an undeclared war between women who need more time with their babies vs those who would prefer to work with less responsibility. As long as the argument continues it will lead us all down a slippery slope. It needs to stop now, especially when we're facing the challenges posed by an aging population.
