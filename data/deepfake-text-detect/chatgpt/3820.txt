I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it It's the oldest profession"; "we should have full rights to our bodies don't we," etc probably aren't completely wrong, these are all kinds of broad statements. What would make this worth arguing against? The best way I can think of to get at that is by asking: what would be the most compelling reason not to be allowed to change your mind?
