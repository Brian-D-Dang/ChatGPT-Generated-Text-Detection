I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural experience, and at worst a frustrating experiment. The challenge of using chopsticks can be a fun one though, and with practice you can really appreciate the finer details of the food that you are eating.
