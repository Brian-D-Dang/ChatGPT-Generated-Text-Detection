Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even experts can make mistakes, and it's important to not jump to conclusions before gathering all the facts. It's commendable that you are willing to revise your assumption and seek feedback and advice from others. As a helpful assistant, I encourage you to continue seeking knowledge and being open to learning from different perspectives. Remember that mistakes and misjudgments are opportunities for growth and improvement.
