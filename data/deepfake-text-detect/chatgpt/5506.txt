Hi Reddit. With all the news over the past couple weeks regarding Caitlyn Jenner's transition and coming out, I feel now is a good time to discuss gender's role in the world of media commentary on transgender identity as well - especially due to Caitlyn Jenner's presence between her appearance with her father and the reality show. In this interview Caitlyn Jenner opened up about her transition journey during an exclusive interview for Harper's Bazaar UK Magazine. Jenner explains: "Ten years ago when I was younger ... all these stories began circulating around that people were saying I became transgender because I'm female... When people started noticing my masculine side... There wasn't any room left in society where transgender awareness wouldn't happen." Jenner added that she feels like there isn't enough attention given trans women who want equality but it doesn't mean trans issues are ignored by cisgender individuals: "The thing that makes me sad is that most trans people don't have pronouns other than what they identify themselves with - they're just unattainable." Jenner said: "I think everyone wants more information from cisgender people so we should help them understand how other gender lifestyles work together." Jenner explained that if trans women aren't considered equal then "it may result in us not having any rights at all," adding that she has been told she can't wear dresses or skirts under male fashion. Jenner also talked about her decision to transition before jumping into the mainstream after realizing that there shouldn't be cisgender actors portraying male characters. Jenner added that she believes "there needs to be something more" being portrayed gendersqueer men instead of cisgender women: Transgender] men need progressive representation too; there's really no difference between male and female superhero comics!" Jenner continued: "There seems to be some confusion among trans folks - several years ago I thought of transitioning only as another way to say that you look feminine - but now there are things happening here [as well]. You could say things have changed since then which means there haven't really been changes done yet!." Jenner pointed out that trans Vox cartoonist Linus Paul once ranprinted a cartoon depicting a trans man as a woman and it sparked controversy online: "Linus Paul couldn't handle Twitter rage! It showed people crucified..." Jenner explained that Vox contributor Aaron Laskowski did the same thing recently while discussing trans representation within the comic book industry: "He died like an idiot..." Jenner shared screenshots of tweets about trans character Penelope Ann that resulted from her retweeting a tweet from Taylor Swift commenting: "Is this the reason why I've been tweeting about trans guys? Because they exist?" Jenner mentioned that the comic book characters' names change each year based off of how many people see themselves depicted: "We get inspired every single day by new creators everywhere. People write their own content - unless it comes straight down to it-and it shows itself constantly..." Jenner joked that writers aren't allowed to use pronouns such as 'they','she', etc whilst they make comics: "They learn words differently depending on whether it's entertaining or uncomfortable," Jenner elaborated: "It took me five episodes to realise that trans people don't define themselves through branding [...] What they do matter to people even though they kinda appear normal human beings until they actually become murderers." Jenner concluded by saying: "Change happened fast." Jenner stated that the changing of genders would allow trans people to explore identities outside of the established binary systems: "It allows people to relate completely differently regardless of sex appealstatustype." Jenner added that she hasn't experienced discrimination herself but also regrets graduating from high school knowing there weren't people willing to support her: "You wish people knew really close relatives existed - everybody knows my parents are loyal friends but nobody else asked for anything." Jenner ended her interview in disappointment stating: "Someone asked me three times last week asking if I ever wanted to be transgender again.. but on top of that they didn't believe me either!!!"
