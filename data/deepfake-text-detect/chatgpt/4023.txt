Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. Let's cut the cynicism for a second and realize that he has only been campaigning for 8 years, there are still plenty of people out there who aren't complacent about other candidates so why should we be either? No apologies necessary for having a different opinion than you do. There will likely always be people like me, hell some morons have already found themselves at odds with him over issues. But to just sit here and tell yourself that without any real reason or argument isn't going to help anybody but yourself.
