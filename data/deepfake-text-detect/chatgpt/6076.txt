People seem to feel right now that Sanders is just not well-known enough to even have a chance at the presidency, and that it will stay that way. Everyone has been saying this for months now, and it's starting to become a concern for me. I mean, I can understand why people feel this way, but I can't agree with it. I can understand that people who have been voting for Hillary Clinton feel like Bernie Sanders has a low chance of winning the presidency because of his age and name recognition. However, that's not the case. Bernie Sanders has had a lot of time to gain name recognition. He has been in politics for decades. He's been in the Senate for years now. He's been on all the major television networks. He's been in the news nonstop for the last two months. People know who he is, and if they don't, they know who he is now. People seem to be under the impression that younger voters will not vote for Bernie Sanders because they don't know him. But younger people do know him, and they know his policies. He has gained the support of the younger generation, which is a huge group of voters. I don't know how else to convince people that Bernie Sanders has a good chance at the presidency. He's a very popular politician, and people need to start taking him seriously. The next time someone says they don't think Bernie Sanders has a chance at the presidency, I'm going to laugh in their face.
