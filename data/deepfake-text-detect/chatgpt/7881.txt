A counter-argument to refute the opinion that race should have no effect on university admissions is that acknowledging race in the admissions process allows universities to create diverse and inclusive student bodies. Without factoring race into admissions decisions, universities run the risk of unintentionally perpetuating existing racial inequalities that stem from historical and systemic disadvantages faced by certain racial groups. By considering race as one factor among many in the admissions process, universities can ensure that a wider range of perspectives and experiences are represented within their student body, which is essential for promoting a vibrant learning environment and preparing students to thrive in an increasingly diverse global society. Additionally, research has shown that diversity within universities leads to better academic outcomes and prepares students for success in their future professional and personal lives.
