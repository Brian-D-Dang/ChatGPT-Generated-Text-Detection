While basic income may seem like a questionable idea at first, there are actually several sound economic arguments in favor of it. Firstly, basic income can actually stimulate economic growth by providing a stable foundation for people to build their lives, including starting businesses or investing in education. Secondly, basic income can actually reduce overall government spending in the long term by simplifying the social welfare system and reducing the costs associated with administering it. Finally, basic income can help reduce income inequality, which has been shown to have negative economic impacts such as reduced social mobility and decreased consumer demand. So, while it may appear counterintuitive at first, basic income is actually a well-founded economic policy that deserves serious consideration.
