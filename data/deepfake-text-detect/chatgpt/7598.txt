While it is true that the U.S. government has made mistakes and has had issues with transparency, it is important to note that not all government officials are untrustworthy. There are many individuals within the government who work tirelessly to serve the American people and uphold the values of democracy. It is also worth considering that without some level of government oversight and regulations, the country would lose its stability and potentially veer off into anarchy. Therefore, giving more power to the government can be necessary at times to ensure the safety and well-being of all citizens. Additionally, there are mechanisms in place such as checks and balances and the democratic process that allow for accountability and the ability to address any abuses of power.
