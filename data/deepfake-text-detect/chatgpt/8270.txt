NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but the right to remove a unit from regulation is granted by its owner after ten years (say) if he or she can find new tenants willingable in at least some acceptable part on Manhattan's market prices; otherwise it remains under protection forevermore (in fact these rules are already vaguely like this). And similarly with stabilized buildings - until they reach their first-year expiration date then each building becomes eligible again as usual when an apartment goes vacant." [This gives existing renters time enough not only "to get out" before lease renewal dates so we don't have evictions during landlord searching season.]
