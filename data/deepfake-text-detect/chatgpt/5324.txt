I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying I was joking around about it at first because I hadn't seen any evidence of his views being called out yet by the press on the topic; they soon got tired of hearing that. It's hard not to be annoyed when you see people calling out Huckabee after he said something untrue every time we've ever been listening to him talk in public before, is it? Ahaha! My wife watches Trump Listsons videos now too so I'm sure she knows what's up
