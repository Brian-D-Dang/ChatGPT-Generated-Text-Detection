I have recently been told that my pro-life position is "forcing my ideas on others." I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary. When someone says this to me, I ask them why they think so. They always claim that by presenting the evidence for life one forces a set of views upon people who do not want those views. The same thing applies in reverse: I am somehow forced into being anti-choice and against women's rights when I present these things (or any other facts). The argument has confused many because there seems to be an unintended double standard at work here. It appears as though we are saying that you must agree with us about abortion but disagree with our positions on taxes; or, we cannot force him out into the cold even after he questions our right to use his property without paying rent for its use. Yet you state that we should allow anyone whose views are acceptable to us to live in our neighborhoods whether they agree with our political leanings or not. Why does your logic apply only some times? First off, please understand what 'pro-life' means - it does NOT mean anti-abortion... nor does it mean anti anything else! We're FOR LIFE. That's all. In fact, since we're FOR LIFE, we just don't care how much money they make (the rich), what kind of carhouseetc they drive, where they go to school, their race, etc., etc. And, in addition to why most folks aren't pro-life unless you put a gun to their head, most people know that abortion isn't (shouldn't) be used as birth control anyway, which also goes along with the above points. But let's get back to YOUR premises: You've got the idea that supporting life involves coercing another person, due to their beliefs, to act differently than they would otherwise under ordinary circumstances. Interesting concept, eh? See how that works? You're conflating two completely different issues... without addressing the first. Let's start over again... You say that we can't expect everyone around us to comply with whatever laws we deem appropriate. This may very well be true... so maybe it'd be helpful for you to explain WHY YOU THINK THAT IS A PROBLEM. Again, this doesn't require any coercionit simply requires deference to law until such time as an individual chooses to ignore said law. So sure, sue somebody into oblivion and suffer with the consequences of breaking the law, let's see if THAT turns out to actually BE THE CASE. Then, once it becomes obvious that the majority will follow your lead, THEN THERE WILL BE CAUSALITY AND YOU CAN MOVE ON TO OTHER PEOPLE AND THEIR BELIEFS. Until then, however, it's nothing more than wishful thinking. Which leads us to the next point... If something happens to you, like getting seriously injured during surgery, dying from cancer treatment, having a child die before birth, etc., we'll take care of you. No matter what you personally choose (and no matter how much you might feel inclined to stay away from certain medical procedures, etc.) IF ANOTHER PERSON USES HIS OR HER RIGHT OF REFUSE IN SUCH CASES WE WON'T CARE. Who cares HOW much extra pain you experience? Who cares WHETHER you attempt suicide through medications instead of trying to survive while in extraordinary amounts of physicalemotional agony? That's MY choice and THIS is mine: I'm going to refuse to give up ownership of myself to prevent ME from suffering unnecessary harmeven if it costs YOU economic prosperity. After all, I chose that end result. Whether YOU agreed with me or not (in terms of risking yourself and your family to try to save me) was none of my business. If you reject that stance, and insist on controlling the rest of humanity BY USE OF FORCE, then yes, you ARE forcing peoples' opinions onto them. But you received yours first... btw... We clearly haven't discussed income tax yet: Do you really think ANYONE has to pay an ever increasing amount of money each year merely BECAUSE THEY HAVE A POSITION IN GOVERNMENT? Or, in order to prove that we're making business decisions based on profit rather than ideology alone, do you REALLY think that government jobs DENY the self-interest of individuals? Of course notgovernment is full of corruption, favoritism, cronyism, fraud, theft, murder, sexism, racism, misogyny, homophobia, corporatism, fascism, socialism, communism, Nazism, anarchy, totalitarianism, etc., etc., ad nauseum. Government officials are chosen by special interest groups. Their pay is derived directly from confiscated wealth via taxation. Rates vary wildly depending upon personal connections abilities within the system. Nobody pays income tax because we WANT to. Most high ranking government employees send MILLIONS back home per YEAR in bribes and kickbacks designed to keep them pointed toward recovery from our civilization maintaining "important. No less.
