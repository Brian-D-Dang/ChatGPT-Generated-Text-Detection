I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police accidentally shoot innocent people, and killing innocent by mistake, purposely shooting civilians by mistake or mistakenly misfired, these are very hard to believe, and the above officers being a lot of innocent people, the news about police officers shooting innocent people cause death or serious injuries to innocent people mistakenly, and causing death or serious injuries to a lot, and mistakenly shooting children or innocent people mistakenly, and causing death or serious injuries to a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot innocent people by mistake, and causing death or serious injuries to a lot.
