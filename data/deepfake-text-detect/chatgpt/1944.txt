Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I 'm not talking about nonbinary gender (that's a whole other can of worms), but rather the multitude of different sexual orientations available in their "Sexual Orientation" dropdown menu: Pansexual, Demisexual, Aromantic etc. The only thing that makes any sense is pansexuality...but even then it seems like there could be more distinctions between people who fall under that label than just straight up liking everybody? Either way, those three labels should've been enough for everyone! So why did they keep adding on so much nonsense? Well now we know how Tumblr users feel every time Twitter adds an extra option because they're proud as punch when they finally reach 100 options
