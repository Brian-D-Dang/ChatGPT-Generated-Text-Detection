So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor ethnicity because that is "racism." They must instead discriminate by other means (i.e. age, sexuality, gender, etc.) On the other hand, people of white ethnicity cannot discriminate because of their white skin color andor ethnicity because that is "reverse racism." But, they can instead discriminate by other means (i.e. age, sexuality, gender, etc.) Basically, is it not true that people of all ethnicities and colors (including white) are equal in the eyes of the law? I find it hard to believe that my white ass can discriminate against people of other colors, but people of other colors cannot discriminate against me because of my skin color. If you don't believe me, ask a black woman.

I'm not entirely sure how accurate that is, because I'm not the best researcher in the world, but I think that's why they're saying that. I don't believe that there's any race in this world that can discriminate against other races because of their race. You can discriminate against someone for any number of reasons, but the only reasons that are actually discrimination are those that are specifically based on race. That's all I got for ya. I think that what they're saying is that "reverse racism" doesn't exist, because there is no such thing as racism, and even if there was, the racism that exists against white people would not be called racism, and even if it was, it's not "reverse" anything. The problem is that if people of white ethnicity cannot discriminate because of their skin color, then why is it that they can discriminate because of their sex, age, etc? To be honest, the fact that people can say, "I'm just discriminating because you are a girl" instead of, "I'm just discriminating because you are white" is pretty damn hilarious, in my opinion. Originally Posted by Muffy I'm not the best researcher in the world, but I think that's why they're saying that. I agree with that. I'm not sure I agree with the second part though. And, I think that's a load of bullshit too. Not all ethnicities have equal rights. No matter where you are in the world, there are ethnic groups that are disadvantaged. Let's start with the African-American community in the US. They have been disadvantaged for so long that they don't even realize they are being disadvantaged anymore. They don't know any other life. Then you have Native Americans who were mistreated for centuries. They still get the short end of the stick in many places. And then you have the Aboriginals in Australia who get mistreated. I think you get the idea. There are all sorts of disadvantages out there. Ethnic discrimination exists and will probably always exist because humans are human and will always look for ways to stick it to other humans. I think you're trying to compare apples to oranges. Just because someone discriminates against you because of your age, gender or sexual preference doesn't mean it's not racism. There's discrimination and then there's racism. I've never heard of a "reverse racist" but I've heard of people being racist against others based on the colour of their skin. That's racism. If you say the reverse of something is its opposite then saying reverse racism is saying racism is its opposite. Originally Posted by ArrowNX It's a term used to describe when someone discriminates against people of a different race because they are of that race. Which is an oxymoron, by definition. This. They also have no way of proving it, so it's easier to just say it's not true. That's not what the term means. The term "reverse racism" refers to situations in which white people are discriminated against because of their race. The
