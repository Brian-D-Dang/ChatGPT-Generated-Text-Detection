While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept them. I don't think we need to be paranoid about them either- but it is important as a precautionary principle- like antibiotics which shouldn't be used unless proven necessary. The majority of GMO crops have been shown to cause significant damage (in terms of contamination) to human health by disturbing gut flora. This can lead to allergies or even cancer in some cases.- We should only use products with no traces of GM foodscontamination. If you want more information on this, please do your research online!
