Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of research, I'm still anti-vax. I understand that many people have strong opinions about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, but for me, this is a personal choice based on a combination of my own research, my family's history, and my own ethical and moral beliefs. Vaccines are an incredibly important part of public health, but it is ultimately up to each individual to decide whether or not they want to get vaccinated.
