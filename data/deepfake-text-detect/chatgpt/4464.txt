I always have to hold my eyes to keep them rolling out of my sockets when I hear (australian) people talking about their trips to europe and canada and america. in fact, the only time i ever talk about aus is if it has something to do with our national sport or culture and then its usually "they don't even know what real football's like" kind of stuff. Australia isn't very well represented on these boards due to living overseas or not having much interest... but im very interested in that! Do you guys go over there often? i dont think so. aussies are too busy trying to make up for past failure rather than becoming a better team now. Australia doesnt really bring anything special into your life as an American because they're just another country.... we didn't get a whole lot from Australia at all really, other than being able to buy some good things without getting mugged, which is nice sometimes. If i were stranded alone somewhere with no way home, i'd be happy to live next door to austrailia though. lol And btw: PSL - best show man!!! Hope u can continue doing this forever!!

Aussies love it so much that we invented winter rugby (or summerbmrugby) union, instead of playing in either season we play in hothouse conditions. Even more unique than that, during certain weeks of the year we wear shorts around campfires outside whilst drinking tea while eating sauerkraut Then comes Footysports, ive never seen anyone run onto the field screaming as hard as Australian Footballers do after scoring, nor heard anyone booing (even during pokie machines 'NHL' nights) at such extremes as AFL Fans. We also used to beat the world record for longest outdoor game 4 hours straight until someone went mad and started flicking his handkerchief across the pitch. This lead to the 'whiteout', where teams dress in white uniforms to obscure vision and create zero atmosphere. And then we learnt to the tune of CBA that the public, media, coaches,...etc all hate this principle so we stopped it. Then came T20 cricket, sound familiar? oh boy does the media give AFL players crap for watching 10 minutes of it while theyre sitting down waiting for test matches to start. i cant remember the last time i saw adelaide united win an FFA cup final, i guess if you count all minor cups Melbourne Victory FC simply dominate them and Adelaide United hasn't got close yet. The premiership itself i believe is based off our fairest and best awards system. It works quite well, players automatically enter their name into the voting polls if they earn 25 votes from your clubmates. In return they receive points depending on whether they come second, third or forth and again i believe top 5 rankings are determined. Not sure about the exact details tho We have the biggest crowd following and support amongst males 18. Which means that we've currently had the largest player numbers in sport per capita for the past 6 years. For comparison sake, 7 million watched Wimbledon, 30 mil watched the Superbowl, 5m watched the Olympics, 100m men swimmed faster than 1400m swum faster than 1500m ran faster than 2000m walked faster than 1200m ran fasted than 1800m threw a shot putt longer than 50 metre hurdled stronger than 200kg lifted heavier weights faster than 600lb picked up objects heavier than 500kg Jump higher than 900cm jumped further than 300m sprinted faster than 180kmh crunched harder than 800kg punched harder than 450JUMPED HARDER THAN JAMES HOLMES Yeah, Australians aren't as bad as reported by non-Australians.
