When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Tatooine, they encounter Watto, a junk dealer who owns two slaves, Anakin Skywalker and his mother Shmi. When Qui-Gon learns he cannot buy them from him but must free them by turning in the part of their podracer that is worth more than its weight in credits to Padme Amidala's office, he attempts to bargain with him for them as well as money so he can return home; however, Watto refuses.[7] After deciding to leave without freeing the slave children following an argument between himself and Kenobi over whether or not it would be possible to do both at once,[89] Qui-Gon returns to Mos Espa with the parts and sets off toward Naboo aboard a small vessel piloted by R2-D2 while Kenobi goes back to find Luke Skywalker alone whom he finds practicing lightsaber combat against a wooden dummy. Despite being reluctant about leaving Shmi behind, she gives permission when told her son will come out of hiding if he knows where to look for help.[10] After arriving at Naberrie Port on Naboo, Arrival displays the same lackadaisical attitudes towards protocol exhibited by many other people (such as Senator Palpatine) during this time period[11], resulting in him almost getting into trouble several times until Queen Amidala arrives to assist him.[12] Meanwhile, after setting up camp nearby, Kenobi becomes aware of someone watching him although no one comes forward because Shmi has asked all those present there prevent reprisal attacks due to fear of retaliation since Tusken Raiders are known to attack random settlements even though none of these villages had ever harmed any Jawas before. However, some less cautious individuals such as Droopy McCool choose to go looking anyway despite having been warned otherwise and end up encountering Tuskens which resulted in their deaths along with those of Desin Hooks and Ponda Baba - two others accompanying McCloud whose bodies were found three days later just outside Bantha Flats - making the early morning desert trek much longer than planned[13] Shmi takes care of herself in Tatoonie prison cell. As night falls, Jabba The Hutt informs Vissefso Melog that Bib Fortuna was killed sometime earlier while trying to escape from his palace, giving him command of Hutts to take control of Tatooine instead. Although thankful for the promotion, Viss wants revenge upon Sebulba for killing his captain Stoor Sultrybloom and threatens to kill everyone in sight unless he gets what he wants within 48 hours. Catching wind of the news via Emilia Vanila, Jinn sends Kenobi to smuggle Shmi Skywalker onto Tattoine using a Trade Federation freighter called the Havoc and instructing him to hide her under false names and identities: "Rey" for Han Solo and Chewbacca and Lars for Leia Organa. Aboard the freighter, Kenobi hides Rey inside a cargo hold full of sandtroopers' armor and then meets Lando Calrissian (who does not like him very much), Lumpy Skrulllco Bandersnatch, and Boss Nassur in order to board the ship illegally. In doing so, he causes enough chaos onboard causing malfunctions throughout the system breaking Imperial defenses long enough for Sabe to arrive followed shortly thereafter by Vader, Princess Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, and Bail Antilles. Forging ahead through space, Jedi Master Yoda appears suddenly alongside Kenobi who reveals the truth of his mission to protect the future princesses and their children, explaining how the chosen ones need a teacher to learn the ancient ways of the Force from[14]. With the help of Leia and Yoda, Kenobi manages to trick Darth Sidious into believing that Princess Leia is his daughter Mara Jade and imprisons him deep beneath the Death Star II using carbonite freezing. He also uses another illusion created around Chewbecca and Rey disguised as Bob Dylan singing "The Times They Are A Changin to distract Vader long enough for Lando to destroy his fighter. Simultaneously, Vader kills Hondo Ohnaka who tried to steal plans for the Empire's superweapon and escapes from Cloud City successfully taking prisoner his former apprentice Soontir Fel.[15] As storm troopers search for Poe Dameron, Threepio loses contact with Artoo thanks to a malfunction caused by Finn who hit one of the droids accidentally sending meekly programmed following instructions crashing down near Jakku harbor revealing Poe's location to the First Order leading Ren to capture him prepping himself mentally preparing to finally have his father figure training completed. Due to this setback, Admiral Ackbar decides to evacuate his forces to Scarif base rather than fight with little hope of victory, severely weakening the Rebel Alliance's position compared to previous battles thus marking the beginning of the Battle of Scarif - Part 1. Shortly afterwards, Ben Kenobi dies peacefully sleeping beside Gamorrean guard Jorgom CO..A, -......
