Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just say that the ones who wanted more of my explanation other than what is in the thread probably should have looked at it themselves rather than googling "Aurora Borealis" or something How do you explain how we got here? Seriously though, if we're going for a scientific hypothesis, why not take an evolutionary approach with simple life forms first?
