A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a .22 pistol that was too big for her. It is very sad and I'm sure a traumatic experience for everyone involved. But, a second case is equally tragic. The father of the 9 year old girl was 50 year old James Boatwright. He was teaching the girl how to shoot with the gun he got her for Christmas. During the first shooting of the gun, the gun jammed. James was cleaning the gun and it fired and shot him in the chest. He died the next day. James was a good man who was loved by all who knew him. It is tragic that he was taken from his wife and two children in such a way. James was a strong, fun loving man with a heart of gold. He was a great father and role model for his children. He was a devoted husband to his wife, Shelley, of 23 years. He was a loving and caring brother to his siblings, a devoted son to his parents and a loyal friend to all who knew him. This was a very tragic accident and to have a father die in such a manner is something that no parent should ever have to experience. Please keep James and his family in your thoughts and prayers. I will be starting the James Boatwright Memorial Fund to honor James and help his family during this terrible time. It is my hope that we can raise enough money to give the family some help and support them during this time of need. To make a donation to the James Boatwright Memorial Fund, please click here.
