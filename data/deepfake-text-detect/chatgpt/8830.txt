This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use of that property for the purpose of collection is, or what it's worth to the owner - a tax will apply if you're paying less than 500 per unit and have 20 square feet in your home instead of five. The most common way for people to come up with monthly income estimates for their homes is by asking "how much do my bills cost? How long does this take?" They usually say they get some answer that wins them over, or at least gets them thinking about how much money they need to make. This same philosophy applies to whatever kind of investment plans you've put into buying your house. For example, when calculating the average monthly rent (or mortgage) for a two-bedroom apartment in Chicago, for example, you'd probably look for properties where you can afford to live out of state. But there are other places where you might want to pay above-average prices: expensive condos near major cities, or affordable housing near busy areas like neighborhoods with lots of downtown shopping; most suburban communities. For us, those apartments would only last a couple of years before we couldn't afford to move. If you were to buy an apartment near Chicago for a significant amount of money each month, and purchase it outright without any consideration of its value, then you could expect to spend a lot more money over ten years as opposed to making several hundred dollars a month. There's another way to calculate your monthly income estimates: Next time you see a starting salary sheets for a typical high-end apartment in Chicago, ask yourself whether you've been able to make that many payments on it from your home and outside of the city for the past year. Do you have enough cash left? Are you renting it to cover your expenses while you're away? Can a friend keep it going? If you answered yes, you likely know where you stand in terms of income. One key factor to consider when choosing a community on a low income is affordability. You'll find people who own properties well off in the suburbs, especially those who work in tourism or hospitality jobs. So even though your income may not be related to the number of trips you take every day, it still doesn't mean that your money isn't being generated directly from those experiences. Also note that you don't necessarily need to build a home simply because you don't earn any commission on the sale of the property. If you bought it from someone who made a profit off it, you can sell it for a similar price online for the same value. However, unlike "a home" that ultimately ends up in our home, an actual home shouldn't end up costing so much as shopping around frantically for financing. Instead, you need to choose wisely. And remember, these types of retail development are good reasons to go back to school to learn about the landtechnology industry.
