Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: "how does it come about that this right is inherent?" What makes this right a natural right? How do you know that it is a natural right? And why does this right exist? There are innumerable reasons for the existence of gun rights, but the most important reason for the right is that it is a natural right. "Natural rights" is a term that goes back to John Locke, who wrote a treatise about the origins of the state and of government. Locke's treatise is the epitome of classical liberalism. Locke's argument for the existence of natural rights is that the state comes into being when a group of people agree to give up some of their natural rights in exchange for protection of life, liberty and property. The state has a very specific purpose and only provides a limited number of services. The state is never a moral agent and is never to be trusted. The core of the natural rights Locke mentions are the right of self-defense and the right of self-preservation. In other words, the right to defend yourself and the right to protect yourself from threats to your life, your liberty and your property. The state exists to protect these rights. If the state fails in this responsibility, the people have the right to dissolve the state and create a new one to provide the service that was once provided by the old state. If the state fails to protect the people's right to defend themselves and to protect their property, the people have the right to dissolve the state and to form a new one. The reason that the right to self-defense is inherent is that self-defense is necessary to protect life, liberty and property. Self-defense is necessary for the preservation of one's life, liberty and property. And preserving life, liberty and property is a natural right. The fact that many people think it is normal for people to be killed by violent criminals is the result of the state's failure to protect the people from violent criminals. And the fact that the state takes away your right to defend yourself is the result of the state's failure to protect the people from violent criminals. This right, like the right to self-defense, is a natural right. Natural rights are those rights that are necessary for the preservation of life, liberty and property. The right to bear arms is a natural right. Self-defense is a natural right. The right to defend yourself is a natural right. Why does this right exist? The right to self-defense and the right to defend yourself and your family exists because it is necessary for the preservation of life, liberty and property. Some people will say that the right to bear arms is unnatural. People will say that the right to bear arms is unnatural because the right to bear arms was not created by God or by Nature. But this is nonsense. The right to bear arms was created by nature. It is a natural right. The right to bear arms is part of the right to defend yourself and your family. People will say that the right to bear arms is unnatural because man is the only creature on the planet that has the power to kill other people. But this is also nonsense. The only thing that makes man different from any other creature is that man has the ability to reason. Man has the ability to plan, to create, to build and to make tools and to invent. Man has a larger brain than other animals. Man has the ability to make tools and to create better tools and more advanced tools. Man has the ability to build and to create. Man has the ability to create better weapons and more advanced weapons. Man is also the only animal on the planet that has the ability to reason. Man is also the only animal on the planet that has the ability to build weapons and tools and to create weapons and tools. Man is also the only animal on the planet that has the ability to create weapons that can kill other creatures. Man has the ability to kill other creatures with weapons that he invents. And yet, there are those who want to ban the right of man to kill other creatures with weapons. Why is it that some people want to ban the right to defend yourself and your family? Why do some people want to ban the right to bear arms? Why do some people want to ban the right to defend yourself and your family? The right to defend yourself and your family is a natural right. The right to defend yourself and your family is a necessary right. The right to defend yourself and your family is a human right. The right to defend yourself and your family is
