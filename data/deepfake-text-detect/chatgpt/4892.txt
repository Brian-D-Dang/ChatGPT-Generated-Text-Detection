I feel like they're acting and it often feels very campy. I don't like how they say "well my brain is more feminine," like excuse me that's something that women do not talk about, okay? When we look at cancer, or breast cancer in particular - and this is a personal opinion of mine so please keep your own opinions to yourselves - but when people think of Breast Cancer Awareness Month think the pink ribbon for example - just think about all the men who have passed away from this disease since then! And thinking about before there was even any awareness campaign. Think of the fact that not only does Breast Cancer affect women - it affects men too. How many lives could be saved if everyone knew what signs were and got checked out properly on their health?! Yes it's important to raise money as well... But so is public education around mental illness such as depression and suicide... There are a lot of things going wrong in America right now. So yes I am totally willing to put forth effort into making sure we change our actions and try harder to help other humans. It's just hard to know who to trust (because quite frankly some organizations seem shady). My main point being: We owe each other better than this. The world needs hope and compassion to survive. -Rae
