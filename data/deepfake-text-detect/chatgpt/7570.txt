A counter-argument to refute the opinion may be that there are cases where police officers may use deadly force to protect themselves or others in a life-threatening situation. In such cases, placing the officer who used deadly force under arrest for murder may be inappropriate and unreasonable. Additionally, police officers are authorized to use force to the extent necessary to carry out their duties, and "reasonable use of force" may vary depending on the circumstances. Arresting an officer for using deadly force in justifiable situations could deter police officers from properly protecting themselves and the public, potentially leading to increased danger for all involved. Instead, an independent investigation should be conducted to determine if the use of force was necessary and justifiable.
