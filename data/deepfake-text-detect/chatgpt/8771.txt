Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who should be killed by a bat. I think it goes without saying that I am disappointed with what we've heard about Gotham police brutality in general and the lack of progress on this case such as some other cases where there was an active investigation into whether or not Batman had anything to do with it. And, yes, when that investigation became public, they were still looking for him. The job isn't complete unless you are innocent until proven guilty. You want to kill a kid? What does that have to do with anything?
