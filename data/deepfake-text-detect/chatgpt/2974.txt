By "practical reason," I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election. I admit this is vague, but it's not too hard for me to give examples from history or politics where practical reasons have been used successfully in voter mobilization efforts. I'm not sure why we should believe that these other theories are necessarily incorrect when they all describe phenomena which occur on some level with the role of money as well: There exists lots of evidence that shows correlations and even causation when it comes to campaign contributions. It may be difficult to prove causality when dealing with something like crime reduction (the theory under consideration here), since one can't easily measure what would happen without such an effort being made. Even if the conclusion were true however, there seems to be little harm in discussing alternative explanations along side the more commonly accepted ones - just look at how many conspiracy theories exist about 911 alone! But once again, my main point was not so much the merits of any particular explanation over another; rather, it was whether or not functionalism provides any significant advantage over them. To my mind, other approaches don't provide us anything that can't also be achieved using functionalist concerns; while this doesn't preclude their utility, then, it does seem unlikely that functionalism offers anything that cannot also be found through different means.
