I should caveat that I'm talking about these terms as applied to humans not plants, nonhuman animals, or electronic devices. And by "socially-sanctioned," I mean a definition broadly acceptable to the majority of people in an area and accepted as such (e.g., it's socially sanctioned for men to wear suits). This has its problems too, obviously. If you're wearing pants that are around your knees then some women will think they look more like shorts than trousers because legs aren't meant to be naked. Even if there was no social stigma behind them being called short skirtsdresses vs long dresses etc...the fact is, men often have trouble finding jeans with pockets big enough to hold everything they need so wearing anything longer than 29 inches would likely make carrying things cumbersome for most men unless they had specially designed tailor made attire.
