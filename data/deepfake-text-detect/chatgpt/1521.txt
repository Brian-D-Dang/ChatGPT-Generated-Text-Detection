I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. This lawsuit (and others like it) are pure class-action lawsuits. They're essentially a combination of civil court and US Federal Court shenanigans. The judge said he will rule on counter claims against the company by McDonalds but not for the count itself..
