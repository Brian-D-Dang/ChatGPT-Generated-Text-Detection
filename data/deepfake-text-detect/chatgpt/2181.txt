So if you haven't heard already, there was a recent [shooting in a Charleston church.] Many reports are coming out with evidence that points it as a racially motivated hate crime. It is absolutely heartbreaking and saddening to know this happened yet again!I'm sure many people were angered by the shooting of Trayvon Martin several years ago because he was an innocent child who simply wanted Skittles from 7-11 while walking home for his afterschool program at 6:00pm. Unfortunately, many well-intentioned individuals have been fooled into thinking Black lives matter more than White lives ever will or can be worth...and I've had one too many conversations where they tell me otherwise."

And guess what? There's no magic trick to solving any problem other than acknowledging its existence!"
