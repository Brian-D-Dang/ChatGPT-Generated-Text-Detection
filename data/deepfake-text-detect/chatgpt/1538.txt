First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. She's blind and can no longer see anyone approaching her seat. You could conceivably dismiss this as someone being unkind or rude by letting them sit down next to you even if she was coming from a very long way off; it may not seem like much but imagine how many folks would have been disturbed by that behavior and possibly injured had they been standing at their window watching her get on the bus earlier than usual? Were we supposed to ignore that fact that she'd be arriving late because "it wouldn't affect us" (see: Uncompromising Truths)? What about children who are autistic? What does your child do when he has tantrums and is having difficulty communicating with people around him? Do you tell others - including other parents whom might happen upon his situation while waiting for school buses - to mind their own business so that yours doesn't inconvenience everyone else? If you're a parent whose son has autism what will you say to those momsdads assuming that they don't know what their kids are dealing with? Or better yet what if WE'RE the ones who DONT KNOW! Autism spectrum disorder affects every aspect of our lives. We need acceptance, understanding, support, and love. This is why I am speaking out against homophobia here today...because ALL forms of discrimination ARE homophobic. I want my daughter's classmates to feel comfortable enough to come up to me after class to talk to me instead of avoiding eye contact. That's not going to happen until we stop allowing homophobia to become part of our society. And regardless of whether or not one thinks homosexuality is right or wrong there needs to be something done to eliminate this type of fear-based bigotry that still exists everywhere sadly. The time has come for change....and that includes changing what language we use to describe each other. The words "gay," "lesbian," and "homosexual" all carry negative connotations within our culture which makes talking openly about LGBTQ issues extremely difficult. While some may claim these terms are offensive because they refer to individuals using sex-change surgeries, hormones, substances, etc., I think most people agree the term gay simply refers to who you fall in love with. As far as terminology goes, we certainly shouldn't call straight men homosexuals either since heterosexuality happens naturally and without surgery so the only logical conclusion to draw is that the same should apply to sexual orientation as well. It must also be pointed out however that bisexuality exists too and is perfectly normal and healthy. To label yourself AFTER falling in love sexually seems completely absurd. So let's address the issue head on once for all...the term homosexual cannot remain so widely used due to its damaging impact on the LGBT community itself. Homophobia causes particularly young, impressionable minds to take action towards intolerance based solely on prejudice rather than on rational thought processes. When discussing transgenderism among youth especially amongst teens, Transphobia causes further harm to mentally ill transgenders because of the limited information available regarding different types of gender dysphoria. Again...these hateful actions result in more suicides. Homophobes are quick to point fingers accusing other people of homophobia when really they are guilty themselves of harboring prejudiced attitudes toward certain groups such as gays, lesbians, and athletes and artists from various ethnic backgrounds although these examples are obviously extreme and deservedly harmful. However, even though superficial differences between groups tend to highlight patterns of commonality ranging from prosocial behaviors to political stances through stereotypes according research (Helgen et al 2013), how can one group really be held responsible for another if both parties believe neither holds similar prejudices to begin with? Sometimes ignorance is bliss. Perhaps a few thoughts expressed above won't help anyone listen closer, understand, or respect one another, but maybe it'll open eyes and lead to progress nonetheless. Maybe then the only thing holding back human beings from progressing together as a species is their inability to accept new ideas and embrace diversity wherever possible.
