I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that it's "not the same as being a victim" or some such bullshit. Is there anything else I can do to help? At this point in time, my friends don't really feel safe enough for me to show up at their door with cookies (though if you want to send over brownies...) but they're still going through the motions of trying to move on from what happened; doing things like having counseling sessions, which is good because something positive has come out of their situation even though none of them would describe themselves as better off than before. It seems kind of pointless to just say "You'll be fine." without actually helping someone deal with the problem when no one I know knows how exactly to get past those feelings... And I don't think that anyone should have to move forward alone anyway. Is there anything I could possibly do while not physically present? I'm sorry for all the questions but every little bit helps.
