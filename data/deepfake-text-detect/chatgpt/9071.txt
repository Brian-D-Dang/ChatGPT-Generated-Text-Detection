GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a girlfriend, 2. I can't drink because of school, 3. If we get married in the US, it's going to be on some college campus... So why are you finishing school? How do you expect me not to go to college right now if I'm already living by this rule? Are you really that desperate for attention you're getting from being dead-on about your ex having sex with someone else or something? Edit: I just realized that this is actually my primary reason for posting here so I'd like to know what they're thinking!
