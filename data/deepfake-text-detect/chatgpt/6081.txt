Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to 15hour. While many would agree that it is a good idea, it would also cause many bad effects. This includes, but is not limited to, increasing the costs of goods, decreasing the number of jobs, and lowering the value of the dollar. This new idea for the minimum wage is very compelling to many people. According to an article written by Matt O'Brien, a writer for the "Washington Post," "Whenever the minimum wage rises, it seems like a lot of people like the idea, while most economists think it will make things worse." O'Brien goes on to say that "The problem is, the economists are right. They're always right about these things, while the people are always wrong." To support his argument, he uses many statistics and data, showing the actual effects of the minimum wage. Another article, by William H. Andrews, talks about the same subject. In his article, he talks about the effects of the minimum wage on workers. His article, published in the Wall Street Journal, states "In 1968, President Johnson called for a minimum wage of 1.60 an hour. The Congressional Budget Office reports that under his proposal, the hourly earnings of an unskilled worker, adjusted for inflation, would have been 15.27 in 2014." While this is a good example of how much the minimum wage has risen, it does not show the actual effects of the minimum wage. In the article, it is mentioned that "the number of hours worked by a 16-year-old fell by 25 in the 32 months after the minimum wage rose from 4.25 to 5.15 in 1996." This is the exact opposite of what it should be. It is supposed to be raising the number of jobs and hours worked, not decreasing them. The third article, written by Michael Tanner, also explains the bad effects of the minimum wage. Tanner is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonprofit public policy research organization, which shows that he is not biased. In his article, titled "The Minimum Wage and the End of the "Living Wage," he states "Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who is the sponsor of the current legislation, has said that the bill would "put the value of the minimum wage back where it was in the 1960s." In the 1960's, the United States had a high standard of living, while now, it has decreased. The raising of the minimum wage would decrease the value of the dollar, which would then decrease the standard of living, which would then decrease the economy. Overall, the argument for the raising of the minimum wage is not a strong one. The effects would be many negative ones, and the economy would be greatly harmed.

One thought on "Raising the Minimum Wage" Jason Brubaker May 29, 2015 at 9:35 am Even though you did a good job of arguing against the increase of the minimum wage, I think you need to be more specific about the effects. For example, you said it would cause prices to rise, but what exactly would the effects be and how much would prices rise?
