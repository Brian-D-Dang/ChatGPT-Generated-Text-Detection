I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I don't think this is an issue for men who are in relationships with other women (and if it was then I wouldn't be single). But there seems to be some sort of disconnect between these two realities and I feel like, as a man, you can't just "ignore it" or pretend nothing has happened. When I look at the way men seem more comfortable discussing issues related to their sex life than women and when I see so many male friends in porno sites boinking each other on cam without any real intimacy, I find myself feeling a little conflicted about whether I should even try to open up to them, not because they might leave me but because the entire experience would make me uncomfortable.
