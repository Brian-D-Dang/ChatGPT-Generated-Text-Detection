Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one 's own sexuality becomes an issue? So, I'm definitely not advocating andor expecting you to take whatever is necessary to get you back on track with your desires. I hope it goes well for you!
