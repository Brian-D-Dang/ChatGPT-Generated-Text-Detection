I spend my summer as a representative of the college I attend and interact regularly with kids between the ages of 10 and 18. In these interactions, I have noticed I have noticed that young kids are very curious about kids between the ages of 10 and 15 and I have found that I am not alone in my interest in kids between these ages.
