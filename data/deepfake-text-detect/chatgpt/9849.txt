I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that are running in an election. This is usually done by the party or candidate who is running for office and it is meant to sway people's opinion of the other candidates or parties. It can be seen as a form of negative campaigning, and it can be very damaging to the reputation of the other candidates and parties. Negative campaigning can also create a negative atmosphere during an election, which can lead to a decrease in voter turnout.
