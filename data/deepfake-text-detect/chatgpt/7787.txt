Actually, triggers are a well-researched phenomenon and they are definitely real. Triggers are specific stimuli or events that activate memories, thoughts, or behaviors associated with past traumas or negative experiences. It is not a matter of projection, but an involuntary physiological response to certain stimuli that can cause real emotional distress and even relapse in individuals struggling with mental health issues such as PTSD. It is important to acknowledge and respect triggers, as they are a reminder of the need for empathy and understanding towards those who are vulnerable to them. It is not a matter of enabling or coddling, but rather creating a safe and supportive environment for those who need it.
