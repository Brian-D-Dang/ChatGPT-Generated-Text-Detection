I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our deficit grows like a snowball - you can never get rid of it if you don't start cutting back up front). But I wasn't really prepared for what my kids would be taught in school about how money works. It seems every math class has one or two lessons on supply demand: The price goes down when too many people want something at once; there are not enough resources so prices go UP! They also learnas did we all as children!that "supply" means making more stuff outta thin air with no thought whatsoever given toward whether anyone actually wants any extra crap made...and then they discover American companies spend billions buying their own stocks from each other just because some billionaire decided he should have them!!!!!! SO DUMB!!! This impressionable age group will probably think this kind economic thinking applies everywhere else around world except America where free market capitalism rules supreme....Ughhhh......
