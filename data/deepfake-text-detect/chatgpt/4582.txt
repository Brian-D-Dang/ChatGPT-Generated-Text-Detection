Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can bring down Scarecrow and his army. Plus he seems like a pretty decent dude. If they had just used Azzarello's prequel on Wayne Manor then it might have made more sense story wise (though not necessarily financially). But that would spoil alllll these amazing secrets!:P Also, Bane as The Joker? C'mon man....it was already done before in Tim Burton's brilliant movie "The Dark Knight" with Heath Ledger...and how could anyone expect someone else to be able to create such an iconic character from scratch??? That guy or girl will never live up to him...not even close! And if you disagree with me about that statement, what do you think Bruce Waynes' origin should've been?! It'd have taken 25 years for another actor to grow into the role;) I also find myself thinking about the fact that there are other superheroes out there besides SupermanWonder Woman etc...Maybe we'll see some day...? Hmmm.....but probably not anytime soon:) Now THATS my kinda continuity!!! Here's hoping we get ANOTHER JUSTICE LEAGUE episode next week sometime!! These days DC Comics is doing great things while Marvel hasn't updated its Vertigo line since 1997. This year, though, may be different, especially as recent rumors state that Joss Whedon may direct Green Lantern Corps: Uprising 1 by Jeff Lemire Andrea Sorrentino, which features fan favorite characters Hal Jordan and Sinestro facing off against each other after their battle during Secret Origin began to affect others around them and force them to confront their personal demons. Also appearing in the book is Kyle Rayner from the upcoming Justice League vs. Teen Titans film set to hit theaters July 16th 2012. So far the new direction looks promising. Let us know your thoughts here too! As always thanks for reading. Please let me know what comic books you're looking forward to seeing come back with one thing I ask every timeonly because I want to make sure everyone gets something good!:) Have a great weekend!

If so please share with us below E-mail gives us the best free entertainment IMO!;) Thank You!Greetings Fellow Fans!Hope ya don't mind me using the term "fellow fans" instead of the term 'reader' as always...just feels natural when discussing the world of comics:) Anyway, I wanted to give credit where credit is due towards fellow fans over the last few months and weeks. Although I am still getting caught up via social media (Facebook page), Twitter handle comicsreviewer and Tumblr account I have enjoyed checking out blogs that feature reviews of various types and cover many genres including horror, science fiction, crime thrillers, fantasy, action adventure (adventure!), super herosuper villain stories and many more. In addition recently I found Alan Moore Comic Reviews blog with awesome artwork and lots of info to look through. His site contains links to all major sites with older content, along with agent pages, Wikipedia entries, book covers art galleries and retailers that carry his work. He has worked with Brian Aldiss, Sarah Waters, Neil Gaiman and many more writers and artists across several mediums. Anyway, I hope you enjoy finding out some cool stuff, maybe learn something and keep spreading the word about what's happening in comics today! Take care and safe travels!Cheers,Rachel Jones2001 Fantasy Fanatic Sincerely yours, Huge update coming later tonight though with much better coverage of movies, tv shows, music and video games!
