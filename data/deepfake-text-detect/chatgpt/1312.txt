Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from 8-18) and started competing in mixed leagues at 18 years old with nothing close to what you described above for me or any other teammatecoach that was female while only being male players allowed on the men's team. I have been injured before because of sports related injuries (more specifically knee), however many times it has also happened due to people just shutting down when they see someone who might be different than them.
