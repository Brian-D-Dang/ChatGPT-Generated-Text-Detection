I'm a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find sillytrivial. I'm currently dating a girl who is a "feminist" (or whatever you want to call her) so we talk about this stuff all the time... Feminism as it stands at present seems like a term that could be tossed around loosely without too much consequence or harm in popularity wise
