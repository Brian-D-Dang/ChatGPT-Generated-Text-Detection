I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a new car every two years seems like an incredibly expensive way to get around. What does this question have to do with finance? There are a couple of different areas that are relevant. The first is the potential purchase itself. If you have a loan for a new car, your monthly payment will be higher than it would be for a used car, because you're paying off the value of the car in addition to the loan. The second is that, when you buy a car, you're paying the full value, and you're paying for it over 5-6 years, while a new car loses a huge amount of value after just a year. If you were to buy a car and sell it in a year, you would still be losing money. So what's the answer? If you're not a car guy, you'll probably want to check out KBB or Edmunds.com to see what a car is actually worth. You'll probably get the best price by going to a private seller, as opposed to a dealer. Assuming you know what you're looking for, and you're not particularly interested in buying a brand new car, you'll probably want to check out a couple of used car websites. CarMax and AutoTrader.com have a great reputation, and both allow you to search by price, so you can find the used car that matches your budget. You can also check out Edmunds.com to see how much the car you're interested in depreciates in value in the first year. I'm not sure how much you'll be able to save by buying used, but it's probably worth a try. You may even want to sell your car yourself, and save the commission. I'm not sure what your preference is, but you may be able to save some money by purchasing the car and the insurance from the same place. Just make sure you're still getting a good rate. I'm not sure what sort of monthly budget you're working with, but assuming you're not making much money, buying a used car is probably your best option. The best way to get around, assuming you need to get around, is with a bus pass or a bicycle. Not the answer you're looking for?
