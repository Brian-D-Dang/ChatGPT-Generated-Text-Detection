A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but the balloons are nothing compared to the fireworks they explode into scattered flames in the air! But fireworks don't last forever; there will be plenty more showtime tomorrow evening at the Fort Lauderdale Fireworks Showground, where fireworks celebrate Independence Day weekend! Downtown Fort Lauderdale has more fireworks than any other city in the country (the mayor said), and some of them come with a couple of catch phrases: "Franchise it" and "Thank you Florida!" On Saturday, fireworks celebrated their 15th anniversary by lighting up downtown Fort Lauderdale. The fireworks display lasted longer than expected just days before the Fourth of July festivities began - which makes sense for a town that's solely populated by retirees - but visitors should prepare themselves for a greater number.

Shanghai China Glass outlets closed down amid concerns about the coronavirus' potential impact upon local tourism. Instead, they reopened last week following an inspection conducted under state quarantine orders. Shanghai Glass had planned to reopen its doors Thursday morning, but the store decided to temporarily close again Monday afternoon because the city was still dealing with the aftermath of Irma. China Glass announced recently that several stores across the world were shuttered or laid off over unpaid wages due to the Covid-19 pandemic while its employees were forced to stay home so many didn't see work available these coming months ago when China Glass sent out notices telling customers not to visit. In recent years, Shanghai Glass abandoned its plans to reopen and began selling merchandise online instead opting for delivery companies such as FedEx or UPS. President Trump tweeted his condolences Sunday night regarding the death toll from Hurricane Irma including the death of Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello who died Friday aboard a navy airplane after falling overboard during a hurricane. Rossello is survived by his wife and three children, including his daughter. Rossello is survived by his three sons, brother, two daughters-in-law and four grandchildren. President Trump also released a proclamation declaring Florida a disaster zone - meaning residents should evacuate immediately regardless if they're elderly or uninsured. A Republican congressman declared Florida a disaster haven overnight and urged residents to heed calls to stay home until FEMA officials get help.
