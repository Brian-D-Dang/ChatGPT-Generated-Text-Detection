While it is true that graduation ceremonies for infant and primary schools may not have the same level of significance as high school or college graduations, they still hold value and importance for the children and families involved. Graduation ceremonies allow young children to celebrate their achievements and feel proud of their hard work throughout the school year. Additionally, these ceremonies often serve as a transition into a new phase of their education, such as moving from elementary to middle school, which can be a significant and emotional moment for both children and their families. Overall, graduation ceremonies for infant and primary schools offer a positive and meaningful experience for children and their families, and should not be dismissed as "ridiculous" or "cheapening" the meaning of graduation.
