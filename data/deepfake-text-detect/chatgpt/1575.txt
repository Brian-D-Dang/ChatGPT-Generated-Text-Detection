One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one, and it has been suggested that diversity in education can create better learning environments for students (Greenwood et al., 1997). Diversity may also help with maintaining social solidarity among different groups within an institution. However, there are many issues surrounding minority representation which make it difficult to accurately judge whether these benefits outweigh potential disadvantages. The problem with making decisions about the number or type of groups included under "diversity" criteria like gender balance, ethnic group composition, political leanings, etcetera is not only the difficulty involved in identifying what we mean by such characteristics but also the fact that institutions try very hard to control all aspects of their student body from admissions policies through class sizes to extracurricular activities. The resulting strain on student participation in higher education makes any efforts at detecting patterns much harder than they would otherwise need to be: A recent survey found that more than half of colleges use selection procedures based solely upon race, ethnicity, religion, national origin or sexual orientation [among other categories]. This underinvestment undermines expectations for reaching racialethnic parity in college enrollment. There are three reasons why this methodology does so little good: firstly, it takes away power over who gets admitted; secondly, once students have access to college opportunities it becomes impossible to exclude them due to arbitrary regulations; thirdly, without adequate segregation from standards of college admission - such as grades, test scores, sports records and extracurricular involvement - it will become increasingly difficult to maintain a high level of social cohesion when mixed together across classes. Writing assignments often play a key role in fostering friendship between professors and graduate students alike. For example, graduate departments occasionally assign a writing assignment that requires students to write something about themselves and then share it with their peers. Writing assignments do two important things: provide feedback for teaching purposes, and encourage cooperation and collaboration among students. Unfortunately, research consistently shows that after-the-fact evaluations of written work tend to be less positive than baseline assessments before the activity even happens, particularly when evaluating peer reviews.[4] In short, people just don't think highly of others' writings, either because they didn't enjoy doing the corresponding piece of homework or because they felt ineffective during its completion process. This lack of post-activity evaluation might contribute to academic overall performance later down the line if perceptions bias towards negative attitudes persist into future studies. Fortunately, some academics suggest another way around this - using pre-writing prompts instead!
