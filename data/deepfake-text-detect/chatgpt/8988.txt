My post is inspired by [this article] in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell "shares" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their own schools, and yet the result results in 'allowing' these same students to buy shares themselves. I can see this as a positive outcome for those who believe science has proven to be more accurate than popular belief (and that's something) This does not mean it needs to be limited or that all people should be allowed to invest in speculative stocks. This is just about how we operate. That doesn't change our morals or our worldviews about what "investing" means in the long term; it simply changes our cultural perceptions of investing and investment as a movement towards wealth. If you think that all people are entitled to equal access to equity in their financial futures, then maybe we shouldn't have created an economic system that encourages personal investment regardless of whether or not they choose to make investments in speculative stock markets. As we all know, the fear is that technology will replace banking, finance, health care, and education. The lack of consumer confidence in digital investments is causing us to turn away from risky investments like stocks because they require no physical asset ownership (not even a bank account). As such, if money is being held at home it will be used quickly, cheaply, and in time. But there are no houses on the market today with enough cash to spare to purchase everything. There probably won't be any new homes that don't have electricity. And if money isn't being invested into this generation through online platforms or other electronic devices, it will likely never be produced. We live in a world where technology has made life so complicated for so many people that there's no point in having kids now. We need to create a culture where luxury items and things aren't shared freely among everyone equally. Then we could build the foundations for equality between everybody and whoever wants them - but instead we find ourselves in a situation where everyone's rich or poor, too. Today's society requires that everyone gets an equal share of publicly owned property in order to play a role in building their future assets. It doesn't sound like much fun to me right now. With good reason: we spend a lot of time thinking about who we are supposed to be helping around the world. Every person deserves an opportunity to contribute to making sure that everyone else around them is treated fairly. The next step here is to get back to the real goal of preserving global public ownership in the name of fairness in the 21st century - to ensure that every citizen has access to a tradeable asset without restriction. Today's current commercialization of these products poses one serious problem - it hasn't solved the problems posed by traditional controlled forms of commerce. Similarly, the Chinese government must create a transparent exchange of value - the most important way for China to transfer its value to others. "Hong Kong-wide" or "China-wide" credit ratings would suffice as well. Many companies already use Hong Kong terms like "bank," "credit card," or "features." Now we're talking about "market value" based on risk. When people ask me why we haven't started using derivatives in the currency market, the answer is simple! Because the state works legally - by creating regulations and imposing laws - state officials can act like private citizens, a legal entity, and not subject to foreign jurisdiction under international law. A financial system of this scale wouldn't work well and certainly wouldn't be sustainable. However, there are still plenty of challenges ahead. For starters, people have been protesting against the devaluation of yuan over the past few years. Furthermore, prices for commodities have gone up and prices for staples have increased. According to the International Monetary Fund, some 1 million tonnes of wheat in 2017 was picked up for 1.00 per pack. In contrast, price growth for rice has slowed down. While this may be a big issue, considering the level of uncertainty surrounding the potential outcomes of the U.S.-China relationship, there are also concerns about the promise of "global commodity markets" - a concept that borders entirely on confusing. Unlike the alternative economies of Europe and South America, the United States isn't looking for a stable environment in order to profit from this escalating crisis. Instead, it seeks investment opportunities in profitable countries, primarily developing nations. These opportunities include oil, metals, coal, and agribusinesses. While both industries seem like attractive destinations, many of my biggest fears are not globalized competition but rather the profitability of these businesses. Doing so would only embolden the Chinese government to further increase immigration despite its opponents' reluctance to do so. By increasing concentration in one area or another, Chinese consumers are likely to pay higher fees for basic services such as food, water, and electricity. It will therefore be the middleman and importer that controls the flow of immigrants across borders and thereby undercut their competitiveness. They'll also weigh in on profits margins higher than international rivals.
