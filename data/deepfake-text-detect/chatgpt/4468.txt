EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People who experience triggers need help and support; it's like saying that "people with cystic fibrosis have an illness" because someone on Facebook said something insensitive about their parent having CF. It's important, especially for those of us working more closely with people affected by trauma, to recognize when we might be making assumptions based off our own experiences, which is clearly far from universal! Being able to identify what you believe your personal experience to be vs. knowing how a person experienced life can make all the difference - thank you so much Lindsey for prompting this thought process! I love lambasted by beautiful women!! 3
