I'll allow that, in most cases, the misbehaving kid is just throwing a temper tantrum, but what do you do in cases where the kid has thrown himself on the floor? I'd say there are at least two scenarios - 1. The child is hurt and can't get up 2. There's something important about the situation (will be discussed later) In both of these instances, it may not be immediately clear whether this behaviour constitutes "self-harm." That said, when one considers alternative behaviours which would produce similar consequences for themselves or others: Self Harm: Irrespective of how serious the injury might seem to us, we know that self harm only causes short term pain and generally won't kill someone else outright; however, it does put them at risk of physical impairment for life because they have damaged their own bodysensible organs. In addition, if someone harms themselves in order to stop feeling sad then that is self harming regardless of why they feel guilty afterwards (as long as it isn't trying to end their lives). Also someone who disfigures themselves usually feels very uncomfortable with their appearance so it should make sense that they try to cover up their facebody parts. It also doesn't take much to injure yourself accidentally. The Hurt Others: Even though accidents happen all the time, people rarely cause injuries by accident unless they're doing weird stuff like driving drunkon drugs. This means that your friend had an ulterior motive to inflict harm (whether intentional or accidental doesn't really matter here), even though the results could have been worse than whatever he chose to do. However, consider the case where my son was playing outside during a thunderstorm and got his hair caught between some barbed wire fencing thingy that was sitting upright near our carport. He ran away from me screaming bloody murder thinking that I intended to hit him! What happened next wasn't pretty; after running around frantically flipping out and crying "my head hurts," he ended up smashing into a lamp post putting it on the ground. Fortunately no bones were broken but the incident left him scarred for life. Had I been the type to deliberately harm children, this wouldn't have made any difference to me. If I did intentionally hurt my kids, even though no bones broke or anything significant happened, getting injured meant that I cost myself money in medical bills and lost productivity while recovering. My actions, therefore, constituted'self-harming' since they caused damage to myself and potentially other people (wasn't enough to prove intent though). Additionally at the same time as suffering injury, my MYSELF became more upset due to being afraid of possible future injury... an emotion which obviously isn't trivial.
