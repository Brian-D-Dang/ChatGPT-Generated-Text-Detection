People who have no interest in politics, and are not interested in learning about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it its political agenda is covered by the media. The electoral college's decision to select someone else as president makes sense only if they can't handle their own party affiliation - a position they cannot afford to do so without being mentioned or discussed at all: Republicans don't need a candidate of another party because their nominee will simply be irrelevant; Democrats need one more person from their side for an election. Instead, independents should know that the U.S.-based news outlets that cover the parties' respective campaigns have been doing just fine since the election was won by Biden last week with the former vice president finishing fourth overall, according to The Washington Post. That's why it behooves all Americans to focus on making sure voters get involved before they decide whether or not to support anyone other than Biden this fall. Many observers agree that Democrats must win back control of Congress over Republican Party challenger Joe Biden next year - and many believe that Democrats appear poised to succeed in keeping Trump out of office until 2024 - as needed work begins to organize behind Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris' first term ending next month (if there even exists such time). A recent poll found that 92 percent of Democrats favor Harris leading the race against Trump within six months when President Donald Trump leaves office; 78 percent want her to lead them into 2022which would make Harris a clear frontrunner despite her ties to the Trump administration. And some polls show polls showing Harris trailing Biden among undecided Democrats suggesting that Trump has missed opportunities to move Democratic votes away from Republicans during Harris' tenure. But while Harris may be eager to establish herself as a force to be reckoned with after Trump picked a rival during November 2020, she appears unwilling to challenge Biden himself unless he loses badly enough to lose again next January. Harris told The Daily Wire earlier this month that Biden isn't his preferred choice yet but rather a "friend" of hers. Harris also said Tuesday that "the process hasn't started," adding that Trump wouldn't intervene to stop her reelection bid unless she wins reelection outright. Harris arrived at this conclusion knowing full well what to expect going forward although she acknowledged concerns about missteps by her rivals. "I'm looking forward to seeing how everybody works together," Harris said Wednesday morning ahead of a speech where she outlined plans to fight corruption allegations against Biden. But not everyone views this as occurring naturally based on her past experience pursuing justice independent of any preconceived notions about the former vice president leaving office. Trump supporters and Republicans alike express concern about potential racism motivated campaign spending following Biden's election victory. Though Trump repeatedly praised Biden during his campaign rallies and later spoke publicly against vilifying immigrants, there haven't been any reports suggesting that Trump personally endorsed Harris'. A midterm survey released Monday suggested that the intelligence community thought about that possibility too much. Joe Biden wasn't exactly free of criticism immediately following his defeat. He apologized after saying racial slurs were uttered toward him last August; there weren't many signs that his remarks played any role in the incident nor did he have any qualms mentioning it prior to Election Day. Nonetheless, a poll showed Trump GOP allies approving of Harris' performance significantly better than Biden took advantage of his status as a centrist Democrat seeking reelection. While Biden had hoped voters would turn out in droves for Harris', the polls suggest otherwise. The Washington Examiner reported Tuesday afternoon that Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg had climbed 11 points nationally and 14 percentage points statewide between now and Election Day compared to Trump's 19 points nationally and 15 points nationwide and Trump's 18 points statewide. Buttiglaff named Harris' chances of winning the nomination as "very good."
