One counter-argument could be that while not all Christians believe that homosexuality is a sin, it is part of the traditional Christian beliefs and teachings. The Bible consistently portrays homosexual behavior as sinful and unacceptable, with various passages condemning it. While some may interpret these passages more liberally, the majority of Christian denominations still consider homosexual behavior as sinful. Therefore, while individual beliefs may differ, it can be a challenge to completely separate the idea of Christianity and the belief that homosexuality is a sin.
