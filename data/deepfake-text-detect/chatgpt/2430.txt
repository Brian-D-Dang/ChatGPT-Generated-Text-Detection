People seem to feel right now that Sanders is just not well-known enough to even have a chance at the presidency, and that it will stay that way. Everyone has been saying he's too liberal for America so if you were in his campaign with this information would you be doing anything differently? I think I'd say fuck all those people who are telling us we're running out of time because they aren't getting what they want from our message... And then work harder than ever on trying to get them involved!
