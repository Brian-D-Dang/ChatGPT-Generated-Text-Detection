What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy they challenge or endorse but the truth of an idea is independent of its political implications. It's important to analyze and critique ideas based on their factual accuracy, logical consistency and evidence-based arguments rather than simply dismissing or accepting them based on political biases or prejudices. It's important to maintain intellectual honesty and rigor by objectively evaluating ideas, even if they challenge our preconceptions or our sense of identity. Ultimately, truth should be the guiding principle in any intellectual pursuit.
