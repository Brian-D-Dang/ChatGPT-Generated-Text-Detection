Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just leave it at that. The person who commented is correct in hisher assessment of my post. I don't think any one man should be able to decide how many times you can discuss something before its ready for the main stream media. That was exactly what they did with the Sandy Hook shootings. Those were heavily discussed on Reddit prior to them being released by the MSM
