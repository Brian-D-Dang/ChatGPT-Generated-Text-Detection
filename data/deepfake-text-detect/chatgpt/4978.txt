As a german, especially in the city I live, there's honestly too many turks and muslims here. My old school was 80 turksmuslimsguys from eastern europe, which seriously lead to problems by forcing me to travel out of town for classes or work (at least that's what I've found). I'm lucky enough not having anyone asking questions about my religion as an american right now: (Edit: words Ahh im sorry isnt it annoying how intolerant this country seems?? Im glad you were able to find someone who understands your situation! Hope things turn around:)
