While it is true that China may not have the same level of cultural influence as Western countries, this does not preclude China from being a serious challenger to Western dominance. China's economic and military power are significant, and it has been investing heavily in soft power initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Confucius Institutes to expand its cultural influence. Additionally, the growing number of Chinese students studying abroad and the popularity of Chinese language and culture courses suggest that China's cultural influence is on the rise. Ultimately, Western dominance cannot be solely based on cultural influence, and China's rise as a global power cannot be ignored.
