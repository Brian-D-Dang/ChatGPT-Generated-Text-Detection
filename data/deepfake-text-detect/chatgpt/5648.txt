I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community, and in no way am I trying to say that my view is the right one. This is simply a question I have that I feel should be asked. I have never been in a same-sex relationship, but I have been very close to friends who have been in a relationship together. I have always felt that it is not right for two people of the same sex to be together in a romantic relationship. I feel as though if someone is a man, he should be with a woman, and if someone is a woman, she should be with a man. I have never really questioned this until now. I am not homophobic, nor am I ignorant about same-sex relationships, but I don't think it is right. I have heard that the LGBT community is an extremely loving and accepting one, and I am not opposed to this. I am just very curious about how a homosexual person would feel if they were in a relationship with the opposite sex. Would they feel as though they are lying? Would they feel as though they were lying to their own gender? Would they feel as though they were betraying their own gender? I am not opposed to homosexuality. In fact, I would consider myself an ally of the LGBT community, and I would never be the one to attack or insult a homosexual person. I just have a question that I am curious about. I am open to opinions, as long as they are respectful.

I am a male and I do not prefer women. I prefer men. February 16, 2016 Courtney M. Reply I believe that it's a combination of both love and lust that attracts two people to one another. If you love someone, you want to be with them, whether they are the same gender or not. I feel that my love for my husband is different from my love for my friends or family. I don't feel like I am betraying anyone in any way by being with my husband. I truly do love him and he makes me happy. I feel that it is a personal choice, and you should do what makes you happy. February 16, 2016 Anne Reply I think this is a very ignorant post, and I am disappointed to see it on a website I used to respect. February 16, 2016 Sally Reply I'm not homophobic and I don't want to judge your friend's relationship, but I do not think it's the right thing to do to be in a relationship with the opposite gender. Maybe your friend has been in a relationship for a long time and is not being hurt by it, but the feelings of your friend are not the same as your feelings towards them. I think that if you truly love someone, it doesn't matter what gender they are. February 16, 2016 A.B Reply I love this blog. It's not something I talk about often, but I'm a gay guy and I'm not gay, if that makes any sense. I'm attracted to men, and I've fallen in love with men before, but I've never wanted to be with them, or kissed them or anything. I'm actually pretty sure I have never even had a crush on a guy. The difference for me, I guess, is that I know what I am attracted to. I know what it is about another guy that makes me want to be with them. I know that if I'm with a guy, I'm not going to fall in love with them, because I don't love guys. I don't want to be with guys, I want to be with a girl. But I love being around them, and I can be happy in a relationship with a girl. I've had relationships with girls before, and I've never been attracted to them. It's not a problem for me. I can be happy with a girl, and I feel like it's as normal for me to be with a girl
