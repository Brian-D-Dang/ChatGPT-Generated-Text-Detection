It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing that does seem like it could be happening there... there was a lot more power in China than anyone can see due to the fact that, well, China has been the world's biggest economy since Japan did something that no American president ever dreamed up - taking money from foreigners who don't have jobs. And this isn't just about China being the most powerful country on earth. The US relies heavily upon Chinese investment for its growth hopes which means that someone must be pulling strings somewhere else although we've always had an incentive to do so given their wealth gap with us even though both countries share similar demographics (China is based around higher taxation). It makes sense because China is so large compared to the US where many Americans work outside of big cities while ours pays far less taxes but still doesn't make much profit whereas Japan receives tons of foreign aid each year. This equals modestly low tax revenues yet huge amount of exports generated by Chinese companies during the pandemic. I think the issue here might have been a result of China wanting to maintain some semblance of security rather than want both sides to become equally dependent on each other financially or politically depending on whether a trade war starts brewing between them again a bit later. The only way China will gain momentum over these next few months are what we learn that their leaders have been working hard at making deals with our generics industry's which would allow them to continue getting debt relief without losing control of their currency back home as well. It's possible that China simply wants to keep their exports competitive enough so that everyone benefits via cheap imports despite the coronavirus outbreak which leads them into trying to import goods from elsewhere such as Mexico, Korea etc instead of selling domestically made products overseas in order to survive through tariffs imposed globally after a trade dispute developed last August against China led by President Trump. If the crisis continues over time then Xi Jinping may consider adopting Asia Asian style sanctions against US firms doing business internationally if things aren't improving quickly because China won't take immediate steps towards reforms now the virus spreads across the globe. Anyway, we'll wait until later we get more information on how this serves multiple purposes including lowering prices among Asian producers unable to afford export restrictions put out by our economic adversaries as well as stabilizing surrounding economies under pressure from rising tensions especially amid differences regarding North Korea's missile program. We're also likely to hear more specifics before too long once China releases any data on domestic consumption plans held up by Chinese consumers whose incomes have fallen dramatically due to lockdowns caused by the outbreak resulting in very high inflation rates. China could take action soon considering millions of people were forced out of homes fearing new lockdowns despite shortages of essentials released subsequent to China releasing instate sales into USA markets earlier this month covering 4 of households' income expenditures within five days of the lockdown announcement.
