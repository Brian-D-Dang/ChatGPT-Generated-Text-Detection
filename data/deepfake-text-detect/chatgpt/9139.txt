CMV: ISIS isn't about the US, it isn't about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isn't about us, and to be honest with you I am not a fan at all of people who think they are entitled to anything outside their own country. We aren't supposed to see wars but we should do our part to stop them from happening. They are creating these giant groups in order to drive down the potential for war between countries that have not fought each other, which is why so many people hate America. I really hate how everyone hates on Trump. Like he literally said during his campaign he would give up the powers over the military if this administration got re-elected after this year's election. And then doesn't mention it again. Fuck off. At least the president has clearly stated that he would take action if the army were being used against him. That shit needs to go away. He also mentioned that if he lost the presidency he wouldn't lose power either. He also told a reporter while campaigning in 2012 that "the U.S. government will use every legal means available to me, including court strikes." If anyone can get the word out tonight that he intends to pull troops out of Iraq by December 31st, I'm going to keep my eyes peeled!
