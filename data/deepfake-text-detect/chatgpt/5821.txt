Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and even I have my limits for what I would consider rape, but if we just take the classic malefemale rape scenario, my feeling is that the female experience is so drastically different than the male experience, and there are so many factors that would make me feel justified or even protected from male rape. The most obvious is that the male penis is far less capable of penetrating a vagina than the female clitoris is of penetrating a male penis, meaning that I would not have to put up with the pain that I would most likely experience. In addition to that, women have a far wider range of sexual preferences than men, and this causes men to be less capable of pleasing a woman sexually, meaning that I would have a better chance of leaving a woman satisfied, which would in turn mean that I would be less likely to be raped, assuming that the women in question would not care how I left them sexually. I realize that this is not the case with all women, but I just can't see why it would be as big of an issue for men as it is for women, considering the fact that my male body is far more susceptible to rape than women are. I'm not trying to dismiss any woman's experience with rape, but I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the notion that sexual assault is a bigger deal for men than it is for women, and that would lead me to believe that perhaps women are much more protected from rape than men are. I'm sure that there are a lot of factors I'm missing, but I'm honestly just curious to hear what others think about this. That's a lot of assumptions. I've been raped by both men and women. I've never been assaulted or molested. I've never been in a situation where I felt like it was "easier" to be raped by a man or a woman. I've also never had a "pleasing" partner. I'm not saying I'm super unattractive or anything, but I'm not an 8 either. Though I've never been raped by a man, I've been hit before, and I don't have a better "chance of leaving a woman satisfied" because of how good I am in bed. Women have been satisfied by men who are not good in bed. I'm a pretty big guy, and I don't think I have much of a chance against my wife, but I've never tried to force myself on her. I'm not saying your experience isn't legitimate, but it's also not typical. I am a male rape survivor. I understand that as a man you have a more difficult time getting raped, and that your experience is probably not typical. I am just curious to hear what other guys think about it. I don't know why I never thought about it before. As a guy I can't speak on the female experience and am also a bit more secure in my sexuality. I had a girlfriend in college who was raped by a guy who was dating her best friend. He was a huge and intimidating guy. She was smaller, but was still able to kick him in the nuts and run away. I can't see the same thing happening with me. I'm a little too big for that. I'm not trying to invalidate anyone's experience, but I'm just curious to hear what others think. I think it would be more accurate to say that guys are generally more interested in not getting raped than women are. It's like with firearms. Women have been taught to be afraid of guns, and to be afraid of the consequences of being raped. In fact, a woman being raped is far more likely to be classified as her own fault than if it was a man who was raped. It's a common stereotype that men are always looking for sex, and women are always looking to get away from it. This is a stereotype, and a false one, but it's also a stereotype that rape victims are almost always female and that men are almost always the perpetrator. Because men have been taught that they can't be raped, they have a much harder time being raped than women do. I'm not trying to invalidate anyone's experience,
