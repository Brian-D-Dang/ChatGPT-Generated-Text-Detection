Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and that yes women can get raped too (and some do), but when someone says "Female rape" it always has me confused because no one in my knowledge really talks about how female rape is different than male rape. Any help? I've had a lot of guys try to explain why they think females are more vulnerable during sexual encounters; however the fact remains that males are equally as capable as women for committing rape. It's only called rape if there's physical injury involved or emotional damage.
