Most colleges do not require trigonometry for admissions, and do not require students to take a trigonometry course. It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math section if you don't need it - especially when some schools are starting test-optional policies," said 18 year old George Washington University student Julia Fagelbaum who failed her July 2016 exam by three points due to missing two questions on Trigonometric Identities of Triangle Triangles and The Inverse Square Law. To help teens prepare for these exams which will be included as part of their first attempt at taking the SAT, Kaplan Test Prep has created an online resource titled 'The Maths Maze: How to Conquer College Algebra.' Using examples from real college application essays written by high school seniors applying to top universities across America including Yale University, Harvard University, Princeton University, Stanford University, Cornell University and others; the site provides tips about how best to tackle tough geometry and algebra questions -and links to other resources like Khan Academy's video lessons and practice tests.
