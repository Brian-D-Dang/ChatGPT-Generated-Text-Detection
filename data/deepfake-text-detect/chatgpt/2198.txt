I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by which the Constitution was ratified does not support our current system. The structure for electing Senators is set forth in Article I Section 3: "Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors." This means all states get an equal number of votes regardless of population size or geographic area. In contrast to this mandate from the Founding Fathers, the U.S has 535 electors instead of 435 representatives plus 100 senators; 25 more people are elected through indirect election vs direct election! A much more democratic method would be 1 representative per 50,000 residents! That is what Puerto Rico uses today - they elect their governor directly but still use the same electoral college to choose presidential candidates because we cannot change it at this late date without amending the constitution.
