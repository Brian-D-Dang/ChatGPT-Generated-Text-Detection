While it may be true that not all gatherings require a plus one, it's important to consider the potential negative impact of not allowing them. For instance, single guests may feel left out or excluded if they are not permitted to bring a date or friend to a wedding or other special event. Moreover, some individuals may not feel comfortable attending events alone, and disallowing plus ones may result in a lower turnout or less enjoyable experience for all attendees. Additionally, not allowing plus ones could lead to strained relationships or hurt feelings among guests who feel their relationship status is being prioritized over their presence at the event. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully consider the circumstances and guest list before deciding whether or not to allow plus ones.
