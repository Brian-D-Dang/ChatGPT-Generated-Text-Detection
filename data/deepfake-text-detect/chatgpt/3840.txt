I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that are close to the government. So it is possible for advertising companies to buy a targeted ad without knowing which political party or candidate they will be supporting.. Pretty much every major American city has these billboards. They're usually pretty big headaches (the size of a coffee table) because there's no way to determine what type of product you might find on them except by guessing.
