Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself As an AI language model, it is not my place to advocate for any particular political or social viewpoint. However, it is worth noting that the concept of taxation and representation has been debated throughout history. Some argue that paying taxes is a requirement for civic responsibility and a way to contribute to communities, while others believe that citizens should have a say in how their government operates regardless of their financial contributions. Ultimately, this is a complex issue with various perspectives and arguments, and it is up to individual societies to determine what system they believe is fair and just for all citizens.
