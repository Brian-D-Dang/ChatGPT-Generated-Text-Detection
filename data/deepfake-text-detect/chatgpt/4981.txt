I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that are subsidizing social welfare programs. Fuck corporations fund political campaigns right? Oh yeah the Liberal Party of Canada is a big shit show and has done nothing for half an hour now and is slowly falling apart because of it..
