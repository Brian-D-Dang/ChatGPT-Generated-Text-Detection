1. Squatting is more comfortable, easier and healthier than sitting. it creates less stress on the the puborectalis muscle allowing for a smoother uninterrupted experience. it plays well with gravity and you can relieve the pressure from your anal area as you squat down, not to mention that you are able to sit up straight afterwards without needing to undo all of those squatted strains, I'll take my creations any way they come thank You! 2.Squats help build strong shoulders (which will be useful when carrying an arm load later) while also strengthening gluteals- both important if one possesses one or two major flaws in their lower body (s). Weakness in the legs causes many people to develop poor posture due to weakness thus creating back problems. In fact most lower-body chronic pain issues can be traced directly back to weak legs. 3. Squatting deepens the connective tissue between muscles which promotes good blood flow. When we stand our heart must pump harder to get oxygenated blood throughout our bodies causing us to breathe faster. This results in breathing out carbon dioxide quicker than we breath fresh air into our lungs thus leading to what's called hyperventilation- a lack of oxygen exposure. By getting deeper into squats this problem begins to solve itself since there isn't such a drastic change in breathing mechanics. The bottom line: Squats allow our brains to relax because of decreased respiration rate!! 4. Squats stimulate growth hormone release. Growth hormones play an integral role in keeping bones stronger, leaner and building muscle mass. Low levels of GH has been shown to cause fat gain. Therefore increasing ones GH through strength training increases the effectiveness of leptin, insulin and other hormones involved in weight loss by regulating appetite and metabolism. 5. Squats increase testosterone production. Strength training increases the activity level of several steroidogenic enzymes including aromatase and 5a reductase within the hypothalamus. Aromatase converts estrogen into testosterone while 5a reductase reduces circulating testosterone. Both these processes are essential to maintaining normal testicular size. Elevating T also helps heighten libidosexual desire and improves sexual function overall especially among men who have low T to begin with
