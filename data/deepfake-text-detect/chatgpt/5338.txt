While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to win there. I am asking for a Democrat that could actually govern against Trump rather than Trump himself or the candidate who has said things like, "You know what? I'm running as the Democrats' candidate because I think Hillary Clinton is dangerous." So Trump seems like a better choice here so beyond a few issues he doesn't seem capable of governing at all if he can only stop voting Republicans from being violent if they vote Republican too much but you've got to admit he's already agreed to campaign with Clinton for them in their interests for awhile now!
