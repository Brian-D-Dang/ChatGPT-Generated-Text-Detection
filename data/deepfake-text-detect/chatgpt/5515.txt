To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific evidence that it causes cancer or any other serious harm to anyone else except for eating them now, as if there weren't enough reasons not to. The opposite is true when it comes to animal welfare too - except when it comes to eating meat because people like animals themselves have enough evidence against eating them over the benefit they provide agriculture companies. The value of animal welfare is greater than the value of farming itself in this respect: Farming has often been responsible for producing food without harming the environment; the farm industry supplies our food supply with potentially dangerous chemicals containing glyphosate (the chemical commonly used by glyphosate manufacturers), which is already deadly to humans due to its indiscriminate use on crops related to Roundup weedkiller. Other hazards associated with livestock include accumulated greenhouse gas emissions from cattle grazing practices, chlorination techniques developed after decades of neglecting water resources that lead to toxic waste disposal systems such as burning fossil fuels while feeding cows exposed to manure runoff, methane emissions from fertilizer buildup at farms during irrigation seasons resulting in soil erosion caused by rising temperatures combined with pollution generated by agricultural fertilizers released into waterways expected to threaten fish habitat, deforestation caused by plastic harvesting processes carried out routinely unchecked by livestock producers who don't want their animals to die off before consuming pigs and poultry produced using fossil fuel harvested primarily for slaughterhouse processing. Apart from destroying ecosystems, animals are also negatively impacted directly by farming practices including hunting, breeding practices, indiscriminate dumping of pesticides, starvation induced diseases, excessive slaughter rates among other factors. Animal rights activists have long accused animal agriculture firms of perpetuating these threats through methods such as forced culls and poaching. I am concerned about animals' safety even more strongly today thanks to the widespread use of antibiotics, prescription drugs and animal feed additives known collectively as "antibiotics," which exacerbate disease outbreaks. Animal welfare advocates cite anecdotal reports from animals suffering from bacterial infections often linked to antibiotic rash syndromes showing how many thousands of pets die every year from infections stemming from unchecked consumption of antibiotics unnecessarily given the risk to the health of animals confined inside cages where they may survive several months of exposure to these poisons rather than being treated within weeks. Animal protection groups argue that animal welfare regulations need to be strengthened to ensure commercial companies continue supplying dangerous products meant to undermine consumer confidence in animal welfare standards so that consumers cannot easily manipulate farming decisions made under orderlies that allow abuse in animals both domestically and globally affecting quite literally millions each year worldwide. This policy shift needs unanimous support from animal rights advocacy organizations around the world - including those involved in animal rights movements across the globe - and yet despite attempts to defend these harms, there isn't much room left in the existing world coalition against animal cruelty and organic farming corporations whose profits outweigh their benefits here internationally and elsewhere. In addition to animal welfare concerns, industry lobbyists oppose efforts to combat global warming allowing for carbon dioxide reductions supported by renewable energy sources via the Kyoto Protocol - which prohibits greenhouse gas emissions exceeding 6 ppm and raising yields above 10 below 2005 levels - as well paying scant attention toward ensuring sustainable environmental preservation. None of this ought to come as a surprise considering the enormous amount of one-sided progress made towards earth security since human civilization began advancing more than 1 billion years ago. Animal welfare obligations should never exist alongside humanity's obligations toward less fortunate beings looking forward toward sustainable living together. But every effort must go beyond just reducing carbon footprints once again. Instead, animal welfare demands urgent action unless governments strive to help protect species' survival and improve livelihoods along with protecting biodiversity and ecological integrity. Further efforts require public debate threatening capitalism and encouraging activism concerning climate change instead of privatizing nature conservation programs undermining the world.
