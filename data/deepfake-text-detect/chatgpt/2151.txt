For April's birthday she asked friends if any had been affected by childhood sexual abuse - dozens replied saying yes or 'absolutely' April loves horses but does not ride anymore because it reminds her too much of what happened when she was little. Her father and uncle used to take turns raping her while pretending to groom her horse or do other chores around the paddock. At one point during this period he threatened to kill both herself and the dog if either made a sound. She remembers feeling panicked thinking: "Oh no! The only thing keeping him away will disappear!"
