When the german leaders were put on trial after WWII, They claimed they were just following orders but it was decided that this was not good enough. Hitler could have tried to stop genocide during his reign instead he chose silence and inaction There is a difference between being forced into war by others (like WW1) I don't think you understand what OP's point in comparing Vietnam with World War II...
