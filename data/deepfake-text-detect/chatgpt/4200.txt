I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is an afterlife, then how does one know if they are being punished? Say you go through your life only obeying the rules and doing what was given to you by God, then has god really "punished" you for your sins? So while we can't prove that there's no such thing as an after-life... For some reason I don't think OP knows what they mean here.
