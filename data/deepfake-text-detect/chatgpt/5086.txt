First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people as violent terrorists. I've had the pleasure of watching this film over the years; you can find it on YouTube now if you need a refresher course in blackface being used for political propaganda purposes by white supremacists against black Americans or people who believe black faces are somehow worse than other ethnicities (which is very much true). And please let me remind you that many black Americans were never overtly racist before slavery, with blacks having been deemed more racist from the start. There's a lot wrong here - black skin was exploited into slapping women and girls down their throats via plantation eras while whites subjected others to hate crimes during the slave era and backward racism inflicted upon them directly through acts of violence perpetrated by negroes themselves. But there wasn't anything wrong with that period because whites weren't doing it anyway! Black folks have always done it whenever they wanted without remorse nor apology!
