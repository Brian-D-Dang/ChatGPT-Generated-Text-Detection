As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is immoral, even if the child may survive later in life. It's not impossible for a kid to recoup and be fine. It just takes a lot more effort than most people think. If you're gonna do it anyway, might as well try your hardest while heshe can still walk.
