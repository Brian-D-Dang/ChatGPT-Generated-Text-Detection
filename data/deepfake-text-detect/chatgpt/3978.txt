I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter. My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy and uneducated for the role of a president. In fact I would wager that many people who say "No" are also too lazy or ignorant to educate themselves about politics in great detail (or even use a computer). The solution? Make it harder for them to get involved! That's well said.
