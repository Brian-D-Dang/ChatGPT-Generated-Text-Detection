I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that they shouldn't have been wearing skimpy clothes or drinkingsmoking. Both are true statements - but neither really addresses the problem at root- which is rapists who commit their crimes against anyone. They target everyone for a reason! Because it feels good to do so without consequences (or because there aren't legal ones). Having more security guards on campus isn't going to stop someone from raping if he wants too badly enough; having stricter laws doesn't mean men won't feel entitled to women anyway once we get them passed through our system. We need better education around this issue than simply "Don't drink alcoholwear short skirts visit black neighborhoods alone etc.." In many cases these things happen regardless whether you're an educated woman living uptown or not...and even then what makes sense? Don't be born female?! It's ridiculous. So let's continue talking till something changes." Women as "the weaker sex": As I walked down Michigan Avenue yesterday evening, one man muttered under his breath while passing me, "There goes another weak ass girl." This wasn't isolated to being just drunk guys either... And when will Chicagoans realize how demeaning those words truly are?'
