I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several friends that own dogs and they do not get along well with my other friends' cats (who also love dogs) either in person nor online. It's like having children. You can be the best parent ever but if their cat doesn't approve of your'marry Paris Hilton!' routine then it might just be too much! Kara: Sometimes, I want to bite my tongue because I know how annoying it is when people call people stupid over dogs and "canines." We live next door to someone who has two labs and a chihuahua. They're both assholes and they make me feel bad even though I'm sure they'd never hurt anyone. At least one lab isn't aggressive towards me (which makes me happy), and I got her as a puppy from the shelter with no money at all. She was cute enough; she waddled around on her hind legs and weighed 8lbs. When we moved into our house, there were three older dogs. One of which was the smartest dog I've ever met. He used to sit down every time he saw me coming. The second most intelligent dog had a bone stuck up his nose that would go through his ears whenever he wanted us to stop playing with him. And the third dumbest dog I've ever seen; had lost its mind by this point. How could anyone even consider getting another dog? Most people don't understand why I wouldn't put myself through the pain of those poor animals anymore. Ugh. Anyway, I digress...At any rate, I've mentioned before that I have a huge problem with people like these. So I tell them off, usually using some kind of insult directed toward "those types" of people and make them pay for insulting my pets. But, I guess, sometimes I need help. Ha ha. Seriously, anyone else experience situations where people acted like assholes about other people's pets...or something? What did you say??
