As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a waste in my eyes, though I understand the parents desire for their healthy child back. It's not about what you think should be done with your money or at all but instead where it goes and why... Are these people saying they'd rather take this 30k from someone who needs it more than them?
