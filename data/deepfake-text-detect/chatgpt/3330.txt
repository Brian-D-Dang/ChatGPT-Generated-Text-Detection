If addiction is a disease, why do most addictions end spontaneously, without treatment? Why did some 75 of heroin-addicted Vietnam vets kick the drug when they returned home? It's hard to give a definitive answer to this question, as there are many factors that can contribute to why some addictions end spontaneously. One possible explanation is that addiction is a complex and multifaceted condition that can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the individual's biology, environment, and personal circumstances. For some people, the urge to use drugs or engage in addictive behaviors may diminish over time as their circumstances change or they develop new coping strategies. It is also possible that some people may be able to overcome addiction without formal treatment, although it is important to note that seeking professional help can increase the chances of recovery and reduce the risk of relapse. Lastly, the example of the Vietnam vets may be due to the fact that their environment changed when they returned home, and they were able to access other forms of support and structure that helped them overcome their addiction.
