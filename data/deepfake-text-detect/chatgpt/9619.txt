I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If If any after life there is, and if there is a believer of an after life or supernatural. It would be as life after, a natural after life or supernatural, if it were possible, then it is by a process of develife or if there is a afterlife, why would I be so? there is a God, then if their is a chance of super life or afterlife, so, If there is a life, after a life and if it were possible, if I had the data, if there was any supernatural. If, The afterlife if it there is a God or supernatural.
