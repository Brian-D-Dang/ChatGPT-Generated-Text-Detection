I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends That's completely understandable! We all have different tastes and preferences when it comes to food and beverages. If you've tried different types of coffee in various forms and still can't find enjoyment in it, then that's perfectly fine. There's no need to force yourself to like something just because others enjoy it. That being said, if you do want to try and give coffee another chance, you could start by trying different roasts, blends, or brewing methods. Some people prefer lighter roasts while others like darker roasts, and the brewing method can also affect the taste of the coffee. It might take some experimenting to find what works best for you. However, it's completely okay if you ultimately decide that coffee just isn't your thing.
