In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals or manage themselves. However, overseas conventions do not include pet ownership in their proposals for animal welfare standards! This means that our laws can be eroded by a future government and UK industries can take business elsewhere without having to meet international rules on animals being caged, deprived of freedom, beaten with rods, starved, dehydrated, poisoned or electrocuted. We have lost millions of pounds worth of exports due to these failings abroad.
