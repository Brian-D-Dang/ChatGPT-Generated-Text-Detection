WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in this community are no longer active or at least not on the main forum anymore so sorry if they don't exist! Alright, but what's it like being apart of a team? For sure you say after reading these posts that it is better than a solo run through or anything you've seen before and all that but still I'm curious about your experience with groups. I would admit that my first group was complete assholes (to me) so I doubt I could ever join one effectively as a leader. Haha. Anyways, back on topic. In terms of the story, do you know how many chapters there will be? And where exactly we can find them translated? Don't tell me in Japan because then I'd get 1 chapter to translate every other week:p
