First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are being used to sustain them (and as far as I am aware a lot of it comes from China) without the benefit of any humans at all or with very little. You realise those "valuable" resources were brought there in exchange for the labourfood required to bring them over?
