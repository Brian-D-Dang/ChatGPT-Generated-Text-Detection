I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is even better. Although it's not "classic" anime either (which is unfortunate), it's still pretty interesting and well-written. Sword art online has a really strong character with some great stories. Although there are aspects of the story that may be overdone in a more modern setting, there isn't anything wrong with the original material if you ask me. Watching that show from the 70s it was definitely worth checking out! This show is just amazing, because of its very explicit language.
