First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person when it comes to politics and I don't believe there are two sides as everyone claims ... and that is all I have to say on the subject for now! 2nd) This type of thing was occurring before Trump came along too BTW...I guess our elites just didn't care enough about us back then either? 3rd) And finally - what does ANYONE really think will happen with Mr. Obama's health plans once he leaves office!? Let alone these policies being introduced by Dems anyway?? (and yes, my opinion still stands!)
