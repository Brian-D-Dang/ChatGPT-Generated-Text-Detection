I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to the public health crisis. But they are right - it's not just one problem. There will be other problems as well, too. The situation is so bad in Africa today that the world should take swift action and look after its own animals. If you wonder how we can live better off, look at the elephant menace now. It's no longer a threat, but a possibility for us humans. We're at an important turning point, which the African continent needs to move towards. Wildlife-based ecosystems on land provides much needed clean water right up until a certain age or two before there is a famine. If you don't know what natural disaster is, it's usually because we don't have enough protective equipment. That means land banks offer little protection against natural disasters like floods, fires and earthquakes. Naturally, governments need resources whether in the form of money, time, expertise or even access to money. So why do we pay attention to those who help us? Because better days are ahead!
