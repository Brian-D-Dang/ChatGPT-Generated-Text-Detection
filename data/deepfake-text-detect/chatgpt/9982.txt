I think it is the opinion of many people on the internet, and of reddit in particular that the companies trying to fight piracy should "Deal with it" that they are unable to stop piracy entirely. The reality is that no matter how hard companies try, there will always be people who find ways to illegally obtain content. Companies should instead focus their efforts on creating products and services that make it more appealing for customers to purchase content legally. This could mean introducing new pricing models, such as subscription-based services, or providing added value to customers in the form of exclusive content. By doing this, companies can make it easier and more attractive for customers to purchase content legally, which can help to reduce the amount of piracy occurring.
