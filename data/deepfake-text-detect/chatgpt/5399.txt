I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites with my mouse when I had to write background code for our database and data analysis program), but besides that I have been working on two other projects together freelance and work from home so it is hard not only to get things done now because of the project deadlines are constantly changing; work schedules don't allow me to spend time doing both jobs simultaneously (one day long). So I guess I must be not too busy anymore! The least I can do now is try!
