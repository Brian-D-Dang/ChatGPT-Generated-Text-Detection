I've lived practically my whole life on this phrase. It has shaped how I have made several important decisions in my life, though I have recently come to suspect that it's not always the best way of thinking about things. The most recent example is what led me to write this article for Outside Online. You may ask yourself: What does "the biggest mistake you can make" mean? Or even worse: How could one ever be so sure that a certain thing will happen or won't really matter? Is there some kind of scientific proof? In reality, we are all talking about two different things here: "mistake," which refers to something negative happening, and "biggest mistake," which means making a choice that will negatively impact your future life. Of course, these two concepts are closely related - a mistake happens because someone makes a wrong decision; but being able to stop doing or avoiding bad choices (which obviously don't include mistakes) doesn't require knowing a priori where a person will end up after committing them. This also applies to choosing the right path through art school with regards to possible jobs upon graduation, as well as to deciding between a career as an artist or teacher, etc., but whenever people talk about their own situations they often emphasize the subjectivity of one's actions rather than its objective consequences. There is no doubt that subjective factors play a big role when determining whether a particular action was a wise move: many mistakes seem like better options simply out of fear, ignorance or habit while others feel more justified due to reasoning that is rational at first sight regardless of its accuracy over time (afterall, who knows if our current views will change?). And yet, another type of thought seems nearly impossible to avoid: subconsciously, every single decision involves weighing costs against benefits, just consciously we do this without necessarily having any idea why. We believe we choose our favorite option based on reasons that are completely arbitrary and subjective, and only later figure out that despite appearances, those were actually the ones that would benefit us by leading to predictable outcomes down the road. If everything we think, say and do comes from some sort of 'rational' process whose results aren't entirely obvious, it might follow then that taking into account all relevant factors before each step along the line isn't strictly necessary. But let's face facts: We never know exactly what will happen next until it happens anyway. A few years ago, when I was still attending university studying psychology, I came across Ayn Rand's work Atlas Shrugged, and I liked it a lot. Not only did I admire her writing skills and her ability to connect complex ideas within simple language, but the book gave me quite an insight into the philosophy of Objectivism, a movement she founded which sought to defend capitalism via reason and rationality. After finishing it and learning about her main argument that mankind should become selfish instead of altruistic since individualism leads to higher levels of happiness, I decided that I wanted to apply some parts of Rand's ideology to my daily activities. My parents weren't crazy about the fact that I had given up going to classes and racked my brain to try and find ways to convince them otherwise. So much so that I ended up leaving home and went back to college, but fortunately for everyone involved, I didn't want to return to the same program again. Even though I wasn't ready to give up on academia altogether and needed to continue earning money somehow, I found myself facing new challenges every day. One evening after class during winter break I returned to my hotel room exhausted and frustrated after spending hours trying to answer difficult questions in front of a professor whom I suspected would treat me unfairly just to get his name mentioned in the paper I submitted. At around 11 p.m. tired and hungry, I looked through my closet to decide what to wear for dinner and noticed a small pile of clothes neatly folded by size and placed inside a plastic bag. On top was the gray sweater that I hadn't worn in weeks, a plain white shirt similar to the one I wore everyday, yet too tight, four pairs of jeans and three T-shirts. Since I knew my roommate wasn't likely to notice anything amiss unless he saw me wearing nothing under the sheets, I figured I'd go ahead and grab whatever I felt like putting on without feeling guilty about leaving stuff strewn all over his floor later. In hindsight, going to bed empty handed seemed strange and unnecessary, and looking at the pile now with clearer eyes I realize that it didn't take long to dream up various scenarios to justify such an illogical act. Shouldn't I have picked a nice dress, put on makeup and spent half the night trying to look good enough to impress him? Maybe the other students weren't paying attention the last week either and wouldn't expect me to show up in my usual outfit. By waking up early and showering thoroughly, I hoped to remain fresh throughout breakfast service and maybe even attract some extra tips. When previous roommates used to return late and sleep till noon, I couldn't help but wonder what happened behind the wall of International co-op students are both present watchable repere analysts.
