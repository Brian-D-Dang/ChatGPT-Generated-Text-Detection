I don't personally feel that the arguments against meat eating (morality, sustainability) have enough depth andor meaning that directly affects me or others around me to make me feel as if I was making a mistake in my diet. There are some good animal rights groups out there with the right intentions but they often put words into people's mouths about issues like this when it's really not their business and their main goal is just to be able to raise money for themselves. They get angry when you say things like "you can eat whatever you want" because then suddenly those people who they do so much work for start saying things like "don't eat meat!" at dinner parties because they think someone else might realize what an idiot they sound like by telling them to stop when they're doing something completely inconsequential. So basically it comes down to: You either agree with animals or you aren't allowed to cook with it? If your answer is yes, then you're a fucking moron. You either love animals or you kill them... I'm sorry, where did you learn self - preservation? It's pretty simple, actually. Not only has no one ever found any evidence of God existing formally - on Earth that we know of anyway - but also every single theory of his existence exists entirely outside the realm of science. Actually, even religion itself is mostly based upon lies. The problem here isn't where people get their religious beliefs from, though. Rather, it is when people use sophisticated methods of persuasion to manipulate others into accepting a lie. Personally, I find ideas like these annoying. They are unnecessary, useless, stupid, and ultimately harmful while simultaneously being used to try and convince people to accept splinters of Christianity into areas where there were once valid religions. This makes me incredibly uncomfortable. Because if anyone else decided to take this approach, I would never go near them again. I said it before, and I'll say it again: No matter how bad someone seems, he she will eventually become better than average. Everything happens for a reason. Sometimes it takes years; sometimes it takes decades; other times it takes centuries. No matter which way you look at it, however long you wait, you still end up going through all of the same experiences over and over again without getting anywhere. In fact, I think everything happens for a reason. Like why do we have teeth, for example? Why do we exist? Or whether life began or evolved. These are questions that have been asked since time immemorial. And yet nobody knows the answers. We may never figure it out. But I believe there is a big difference between asking yourself these questions on a periodic basis versus finding out the answers for yourself in the middle of your day. That's the point where everyone should do what I do. Instead of worrying about what you're going to tell people to eat next, focus more on what you're going to tell yourself to eat next instead. Those two things are very similar, after all. Oh yeah, and there's always veggie burgers! Or maybe, if I'm feeling adventurous, I'll try some vegan food instead of beef. After watching the documentary, I went ahead and made myself another Burger 101 meal. As promised, I've included some pictures below. Enjoy! Hello, I'm Sarah! My name is Sarah! Many years ago, my family moved across town to a new neighborhood and started attending our local church. One Sunday morning, I remember sitting alone at the back of the room listening intently as Pastor Timmy gave us the sermon. He spoke about Christ first, laying out a firmer foundation of faith that we could rely on despite the challenges that lay ahead. Then came Paul, the man whose ministry brought Christianity to Asia Minor. Paul preached right alongside Jesus during His time in Jerusalem, and ran away one night when He got hungry and thirsty. When someone asks a question, I give a complete answer rather than just giving a partial answer and later only mentioning the half - hearted part somewhere along the line. I have a constant desire to see how far I can stretch the truth as long as I keep giving honest answers.
