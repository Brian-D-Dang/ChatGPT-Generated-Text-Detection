Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a little bit like a dog's bark. 2. X is the abbreviation of the English word "x-ray," which is the basis of the word "x-ray vision," which is a common sci-fi trope. Y is the abbreviation of the word "yogurt," a term that sounds like it's from a foreign language, and which isn't a sci-fi trope. 3. It's the first letter in the word "X-Files," which is a well-known, well-loved TV show that was created by Chris Carter and will never die. Y is the first letter in the word "Yellow Pages," which isn't a TV show and might as well be a television show. 4. X is a symbol used in algebra and in chemistry. X is used in algebra and chemistry because you can build up a bunch of variables, and then plug them into an equation. Y is used in algebra and chemistry because you can't build up a bunch of variables, and then plug them into an equation. 5. X is the first letter of the word "excellent." Y is the first letter of the word "yucky." There's no need to go on.
