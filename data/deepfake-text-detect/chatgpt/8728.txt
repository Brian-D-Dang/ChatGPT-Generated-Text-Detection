Now in the spirit of fairness - I believe this to be true for all governments, but in this case I'll touch upon the U.S. gov. First of all [Lusatania] was great, there's no doubt about that. Now that we have a government whose point of view is on the need for transparency and accountability, please explain again why you think that our constitution cannot provide it this way. It is not rich countries who are supposed to use their power to get what they want from us, but rich nations. It doesn't matter how much money we give them, or how many jobs we create, if they don't trust us when they make mistakes. If you've come here after decades of being privileged to live here then you should know well what my position on transparency means. The cost of living goes back to the old days and today in Europe you can buy food at almost any supermarket; when we were comparing apples with potatoes in the 19th Century there were some 25 million people in Europe because those farmers could produce the same stuff every day. So these days most Europeans do not even pay attention to economics anymore because of the cold war only going on now. They want to milk themselves in the fields, but nobody knows where to send them. There are other problems too - some bad things that happened during the war, like oil prices. But as far as the U.S. system is concerned, you can never really say the same thing about Russia or China. They would always want nothing more than a little help, peace and prosperity. That's why the U.S. system has become so important. We also see a lot of corruption and theft of information and secrets. This world needs to be saved. And let me put it in perspective: that is one reason we need international cooperation and the other is that, no? Well, I understand now that you're talking about another country which is in fact an expansionist country. That is why I will talk about Brazil. You said before that Brazil is part of the United States. What does that mean to you? To Brazil? Do you actually still believe that Brazil belongs in the United States? Or does that change soon enough? Is there something else you'd like to add to it? Is there anything you want to tell me about your life in America? Would you mind telling me about your work here? Are you interested in studying abroad? Because it seems like you've got quite a few friends here in the States. Are you interested in meeting up with people in different schools here in America? How long did you stay here? Did you speak French? Are you fluent in English? Have you been in contact with anyone in American history history? Since you're here so long, are you familiar with the current state of affairs here? Am I sure that you had access to the best books when you went to school in France? Any news stories? How has politics played out in America before? Those are some of the questions you asked me. You seem to want to hear about the Soviet Union and the World Bank. Are you aware of all those issues coming from the West? Why do you want to spend some time working in the United States? Especially since you came here in 1995, how is your job? Do you still feel comfortable in your own skin? (Note: I am not referring to the US politician or the US president) Would you like to learn more about why you worked here over there? Do you have any particular interests or knowledge about the United States? For example, what kind of activities were planned between 1995 and 1996 involving foreign ministers and negotiators? What was the composition of the delegation? Was we in contact with each other or did you communicate through text messages? Where was the dinner party hosted? Were you able to attend any meetings? Does either of you know the contents of the manuscript or plan to publish it? All these things were discussed three times during the negotiations around 1997. Can you elaborate on these discussions? When did they happen? What made you think that nothing had changed about the negotiation process? What did you decide that you wanted to do differently? Did you agree with the draft agreements that they reached? Would you like to write another book? (Note: This is just one example.) If you were to attempt to discuss how to handle the negotiations regarding the publication of the manuscript on the Brazilian market, would you be able to offer details? What did you sign up for? If you answered yes to everything above, what would you end up doing next? What would you have done differently? Please elaborate on the talks you are discussing. If you wouldn't mind answering some of these questions, I would appreciate it. Thank you very much. (See notice: Here are the documents from the negotiations around 1997. In this document the following questions were asked together: "Did you sign up for any of the negotiations? 1. Are you looking forward to writing a new book? What would you like to hear more about it? 2. Are
