While some people may argue that reverse racism is a real thing, it is important to note that this term is actually a misnomer. Racism is a system of power and oppression that allows certain groups of people to hold privilege and actively discriminate against others based on their race. It is impossible for marginalized groups, such as people of color, to hold this same level of power and privilege. Discrimination and prejudice against members of a majority group, such as white individuals, cannot be called "reverse racism" because it does not have the systemic and historical power dynamics required for racism to exist. Instead, it can be more accurately described as prejudice or discrimination.
