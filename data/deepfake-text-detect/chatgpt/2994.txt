When the german leaders were put on trial after WWII, They claimed they were just following orders but it was decided that this was not good enough. Hitler could have been tried for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Nuremberg rather than the smaller scale charges he faced at his own courts martial of being a bad commander etc. I think we should stop trying people for warcrimes when actual Nazi's are still alive (who participated).
