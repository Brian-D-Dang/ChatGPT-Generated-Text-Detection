I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer feel like shooting a child? The answer is quite simple. The child is seen as a threat, and the child is a threat. It is really that simple. The child is a threat to the officer, and the officer is a threat to the child. This is really a whole bunch of stupidity, and a whole bunch of bullshit. Even if the police officer was "in fear for their life," that does not mean they have the right to shoot a child. The gun is an awesome weapon, and can kill someone at a distance of 200 feet away. I am starting a campaign to raise awareness of this situation, and to try and get everyone to sign a petition to have gun laws tightened up. Here is the petition: I am also starting a petition to get the bullying, police brutality, and racism reported on the news to stop. Here is the petition: Please sign these petitions, and help spread the word to as many people as you can, so we can get these laws changed and stop these deaths from happening.
