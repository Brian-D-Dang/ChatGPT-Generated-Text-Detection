Counter-argument: There is evidence that gender is not solely determined by biological sex but also by social and cultural factors. This is supported by the fact that gender roles and expectations vary widely across different cultures and societies. Additionally, numerous studies have shown that gender identity, which refers to a person's internal sense of their gender, can differ from their biological sex at birth. It is important to acknowledge and respect the diversity of gender identities and expressions as it is a fundamental aspect of basic human rights and dignity. Refusing to recognize the existence of non-biological genders can contribute to the marginalization and discrimination of individuals who identify outside of traditional gender norms.
