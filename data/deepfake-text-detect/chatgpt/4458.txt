I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that they want your vote. In my opinion it is almost like a hate campaign against any one or party that is not the current government. The recent ads has been directed mostly at those people who are on either side of the border between us and US to try convince them to support their political friend. Some have even said heshe was elected by fraud, dirty tricks etc., some just saying they should get out of politics because there no hope for change. One commercial show a hideous face with tears streaming down his face shouting an attack ad words from a script about if ever you were going through what he and his friends went through then do something different next time.. reminds me of McCarthy era witch hunts. This kind of thing does nothing more than increase dislike among our population. What needs to be done here? One common denominator (well except for 1) These parties all put partisan views before getting votes... They are "politicians..." And as such their policies could very well fall apart without good evidence... Or indeed proof...... There are also plenty of examples where politicians make money off their constituents.... It's called corruption. Also another post mentioned health care reform - that should surely be before... But only after we sort out the mess that is currently being created.... No need to create new problems when the old ones still exist..... It seems most things these days "come up" quicker than you think... so far the following 2 posts have made sense: 1. A case against healthcare reform (2nd debate tonight). 2. Ugly stuff happened under chaperone of uk govt (and other places including USA) during past 60 years... But don " t judge anyone until you've seen both sides of story. 3. Just remember now it will take 4 years just to fix the damage caused by previous govt......... Then again..........we did say earlier that " it's already too late " . 4. Keep cool head.......look into future rather than looking back assuming guilt or innocence....Only in news papers or media you can find first hand account or eyewitnesses of events; sometimes they're true sometimes they're false.... 5. In human life mistakes happen-even when its deliberate, regardless of whether laws are broken or ignored ..."Number 5 this week: "Who killed Fidel Castro?" 6. On number six ask yourself: why doesn " t the world talk louder against certain dictatorships? 70 of world population is starving affects us all!!! 7. If somebody had told Hitler in september 1939 i " d win WW II..he probably would have believe him! 8. All men are born free equal....but freedom cannot be eternally preserved unless guaranteed by law; as long as human nature remains unredeemed.......So keep reading newspaper everyday stay informed.
