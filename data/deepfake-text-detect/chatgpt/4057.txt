I realise that this is a meme one itself nowadays, but as a black man I have absolutely no sympathy for any redditor who was on coontown. These people hate us just because we're different. It's always been about the racism, it would never be about homophobia or sexism if they could explain why their hatred of black people makes them happy to hate so many other groups of humans.
