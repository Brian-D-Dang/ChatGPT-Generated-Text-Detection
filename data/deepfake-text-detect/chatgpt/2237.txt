First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a sort of "I'm better than you" mentalitya sense of superiority because one has adopted some unconventional lifestyle or belief system. If these communities are able to help people see themselves as equal in their own right without judging others' decisions then they will be more effective and healthy overall IMO. You're absolutely correct! These types of subreddits exist primarily so we don't have to judge each other on our lifestyles like what ratheism does with religion. Anything posted should represent acceptance but not approval (just my opinion).
