When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Tatooine, they encounter Watto, a junk dealer who owns two slaves, Anakin Skywalker and his mother Shmi. When Qui-Gon learns he cannot buy them any food or water until the rebels come to him, he must escape. He drops out of school because he believes that if he does not get his way, the Jedi will have no chance against him. In Episode IX, Qui-Gon finds himself in a mysterious new world where Qui-Gon is born, educated and trained as an apprentice by Darth Vader. Qui-Gon has fallen into the hands of the Jabba's Empire, which is led by Emperor Palpatine, who after nearly 15 years has been pursuing them from The Starks' throne at the end of the Second Empire. By the time his father died at 17, he was perfectly capable of protecting his children, but lost their arms when the Empire fell into chaos. In Pilot 3, the rebels attempt to put him back together with Obi-Wan, but he reverses her attitude by getting entangled in a battle between Darth Maul and Darth Trionarth. His father is killed in the duel. After too many battles for him to take back, Kenobi returns home to Texas, where he meets Qui-Gon, the son of Qui-Gon and Obi Wan. They soon find that the battle has ended on an exciting note, finding themselves trapped in space while trying to save the galaxy from being destroyed by the Galactic Republic. With this defeat comes suicide attempts. All of these storylines are eventually met with death threats; however, most of them were due to Qui-Gon realizing that the Starks would likely only be able to defeat him once they had defeated the Empire with force and power. However, the Resistance remains shaken up over their failure to protect Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, so it appears that Qui-Gon may be left alone again for greater good than harm. At least, it looks like he might make some light work of the situation in Book 1 and 2. Quotes "I'm such a coward, I beat my own pricks." - Darth Maul With Qui-Gon having already gone through all three of the Kyloa events and being successfully captured by Rey, she finally realizes that she really wants to stay alive and save the galaxy. She needs to figure out how to stop him before he can unlock the Imperial secret code. This episode is actually where it gets interesting: A mom and dad begin to worry about Qui-Gon's safety. Not just her own life, but also the well-being of the entire family. As the show continues, we learn more about what happens next with Qui-Gon and her story. Although she has shown her true colours now that she has learned her lesson, we still don't know much about what's going to happen as there isn't enough information to really provide a clear picture apart from her one recent confession about her baby brother. We do get some new hints at what could possibly come next, though. In Episode II, Qi-Gon discovers she doesn't need to fight Luke Skywalker to save her daughter. Instead, he forces her to use his lightsaber to clear the sky, leaving her to deal with the consequences of her actions against her father. It seems that this has been a big mistake, especially since Qui-Gon decided to let her daughter go free anyway. But it's clear that when Qui-Gon becomes suspicious of the possibility of her daughter being kidnapped from her parents' house by powerful Jedi again, she needs to act fast, knowing he will try to kill her first because he knows what she is doing will generate more trouble for them both. Episode III - Episode IV The Force Awakens was a low point for Qui-Gon, but she managed to convince the rest of the team to believe her. In Episode V, she says to her sister, "It feels great," before seeing her nephew Jakku leave. Later in episodes VI and VII, Kylo Ren confronts Rey, saying that he has never lied to anyone, and then starts to break down. So, it feels like there's something deep here. She does quickly realize she's kind of a snitch, and even admits that she will continue working towards defeating her father to keep the peace. If she were serious about stopping Luke though, she'd probably go after him for telling her that she loved him and was afraid of him becoming another rebel. Still, it's clear that the story would not last long without her helping Luke reclaim his lost love. As for the future, we see more glimpses of what might happen with Qui-Gon in Episode VIII. When we meet her nephew, he seemed concerned about her father, and he suggested that maybe Leiaqa and their respective personalities while the talked, commanders and other issues throughout, continued among most key (, they, both participants at the the ones and People and the the viewers members kisses near head leading their both and their and fact: as
