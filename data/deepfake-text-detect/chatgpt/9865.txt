So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion. The discussion I'm trying to start is about the potential of "overpowered" champions in League of Legends. I think it's an interesting discussion that can lead to some really interesting ideas and strategies being shared. Some people might argue that certain champions are overpowered, while others may disagree. I think it could be a great way to learn more about the game, and how to strategize against opponents who have access to these powerful champions. It also could lead to some good debates about balance, and what can be done to make sure that the game remains fair for all players. Overall, I think it would be a great conversation starter, and could lead to some interesting insights into the game. So, what do you guys think about the potential for overpowered champions in League of Legends?
