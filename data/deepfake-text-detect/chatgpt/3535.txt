One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this a valid argument? The argument that the value of a degree would go down if everyone had one is not entirely accurate. While it's true that increasing access to higher education could lead to an increase in the number of people with degrees, it is unlikely to lead to a decrease in the value of a degree. Several factors contribute to the value of a degree, such as the quality of education, individual skills and abilities, and the reputation of the institution that grants the degree. Moreover, there will always be a demand for highly skilled workers, even if more people have degrees. As the economy evolves, the job market also changes, and workers will need to continually upgrade their skills to remain competitive in the workforce. Additionally, access to higher education promotes social mobility and benefits society as a whole. In summary, while there may be some debate about the specifics of how increased access to higher education could affect the value of a degree, the argument that everyone having a degree would necessarily lead to a decrease in its value is not entirely accurate.
