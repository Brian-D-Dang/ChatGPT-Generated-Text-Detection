Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself more money and then have no incentive to change things, while also making the public feel worse about itself than it already does... You might be crying wolf now but if you voted consistently like Trump like Steve Bannon did others will come after you too
