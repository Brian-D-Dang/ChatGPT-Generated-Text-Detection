I realise that this is a meme one itself nowadays, but as a black man I have absolutely no sympathy for any redditor who was on coontown. These people hate you, and you have to hate them right back. There are few things more unpleasant than the combination of sexual assault and racial harassment, and I hope that this is something that the reddit admins are working on. We're working on it. We have a whole team of engineers working on it, plus our head of reddit, our chief legal counsel, our chief HR person, and we're working on it. It's not something that we're going to be able to fix overnight. But I'll let you know as soon as we do. This should be a strong hint that people who claim that reddit is at the mercy of redditors and admins are full of shit. The person who posted that is someone who is a part of reddit, and it is their responsibility to fix this problem. I have no sympathy for the people who claim that they were on rcoontown and found it hilarious and who didn't know that there was anything wrong with it. The only thing that I can say in your defence is that you are lucky that you don't have to deal with being targeted by the police like Trayvon Martin, or having an organisation like the KKK trying to kill you. In the meantime I am taking a break from reddit. I already have a lot of problems with the way that reddit is managed and I don't need to deal with this as well. Labels: Abuse of Authority, Abuse of Power, Bad Arguments, Fascism, Free Speech, Hypocrisy, Racism I can't say I'm surprised, but I'm very disappointed. If you ever want to find out how racist people are, just ask them about other races. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the people who, when the topic of racism comes up, say things like "I don't see color," "race is just a social construct," "I'm not racist, I have friends from all races," "I have a black friend" (which I've heard so often it's become a meme), or "it's just a joke, don't you have a sense of humor?" Race is a biological reality. If you ask people whether they believe in evolution, then they'll say that they do. But ask them about the details of evolution and you'll get answers that range from intelligent design to flat out denial. People don't believe in the concept of race because they don't want to. I don't see people being discriminated against because of their gender (with the exception of the MRA movement) or their sexual orientation (with the exception of the Christian Right) and that's because people don't want to think about it. If they really wanted to see change, they would do something about it. When people get upset about someone making racist jokes, it's because they want to pretend that racism doesn't exist. It's because they don't want to believe that we're not all equal. It's because they don't want to believe that we're all the same. And I don't have a sense of humor about racism. Labels: Abuse of Authority, Abuse of Power, Bad Arguments, Hypocrisy, Racism You Can't Defend Racism There are people who claim that we need to defend free speech. They claim that the best way to deal with racism is to expose it, and that if we tell people that they are racist, they will only become more racist. The people who say this are all racists. Firstly, even if you believe that someone is a racist, you need to find a way to criticise them that doesn't involve telling them that they are racist. It's not the right thing to do, and it's not the best way to have a discussion about race. Secondly, if someone is already a racist, they have already made their decision. While it is possible to change someone's mind, we shouldn't try to change the mind of people who are already racists. They already have a mindset that is based on the idea that one race is superior to others. You can't change their minds. Sadly, there are some people who just want to
