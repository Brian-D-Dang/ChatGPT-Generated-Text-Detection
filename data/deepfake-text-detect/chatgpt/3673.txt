The implementation of Judicial Review from the Marbury v. Madison case from the precedent of the Judiciary Act of 1789 allows for the Supreme court to be to judge over the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress and actions taken by the Executively Branch. This provides a system of checks and balances in the United States government, ensuring that one branch does not have too much power. Judicial Review ensures that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and helps maintain the balance of power between the federal government and the states.
