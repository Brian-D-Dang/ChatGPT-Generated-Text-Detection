After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the NRA is involved, it becomes a direct threat to schools. Earlier today, the NRA suggested that we should ban firearms from schools because there are "more kids than ever before." Apparently believing that this happens only when they have lost their jobs or don't get paid enough money as part of their paycheck is no surprise for them since they'll be forced out by Congress soon anyway once again next year if they're allowed to fire guns back into classrooms at any point during a pandemic where parents can't afford teachers' salaries anymore so they need to find employment elsewhere instead. The NRA, however, has continued its attack on the Second Amendment while simultaneously putting gun owners first: Guns aren't banned because they kill more people per capita than any other weapon - Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter was knocked down a tree after firing shots inside the school building entirely alone without anyone noticing he had fired his weapons - but what about those who use weapons legally? What does the NRA say? "Gun control advocates believe that enforcing gun laws will make schools safer," the NRA said Tuesday morning. "But schools are already studying how best to prevent violence against students and staff members alike, including arming educators and administrators regarding potential threats. The New York Times reported last week that the NRA threatened to sue school districts over criminal background checks requirements required under federal law unless lawmakers pass legislation authorizing new forms of background checks to ensure students know whether they were eligible to purchase handguns safely. Actually, it's not just the NRA who thinks so much about safe teaching methods - it seems to me like the anti-Second Amendment group wants gun makers to rewrite history too. It appears to me that all public schools must be able to keep guns away from all childreneven those caught between 17 years old and 15 years old!
