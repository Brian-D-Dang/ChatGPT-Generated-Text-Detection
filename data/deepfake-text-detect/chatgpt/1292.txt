I'm not a cop hater. I like to think I'm a relatively reasonable person but I'm honestly not even 100 sure how I really feel with the constant barrage of negative news about cops right now, especially considering that they are my closest friends You're probably just thinking too hard into it and aren't taking in all sides. Not everything is black or white, there's always multiple shades of grey when you try to analyze things from every possible angle outside your personal biases.
