Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit like the word "yes." 2. The meaning: It's clear that it refers to an idea or concept and not just any old thing. This means you can use it in much wider contextsit implies something with substance while pointing at the same time as a signifier indicating agreement (Y). So X is better because it communicates more information in less space, making communication easier and faster. And maybe even simultaneously be a little funny but also NOT FUNNY!
