There is no evidence to support the claim that Keynesian economics is a thin cover for class warfare. In fact, the principles of Keynesian economics aim to promote economic stability and growth for all members of society, not just a particular class. Keynesian policies, such as government spending to stimulate economic activity and reducing taxes for the middle and lower-income households, aim to create a more equitable distribution of wealth and minimize economic disparities between different classes. Therefore, Keynesian economics cannot be considered a tool for class warfare but rather a strategy to build a more stable and prosperous economy for all.
