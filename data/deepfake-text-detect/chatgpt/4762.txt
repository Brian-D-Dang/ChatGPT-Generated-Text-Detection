I realize the OP is a bit vague, so let me clarify. Similar to false advertising, I believe that people who release lies (in a publishable, marketable format). This includes books full of lies and contradictions or simply misleading information - they are already selling something other than what they say it's going to be. Is this definition of "liar" accurate? Here are some examples: What do you think? A: Most technical publications have standards for accuracy and objectivity which are generally upheld by professionals in their field. That does not mean that everyone agrees; there may even be controversy within the scientific community about specific claims made in one paper versus another paper published at roughly the same time. But if your question is whether anyone has ever been censured professionally because someone said something he knew was wrong, then my answer would still be no although as others here have pointed out, there are fields where you can get into trouble with pretty much anything written down, especially if you're trying to sell them to an institution like NASA or Boeing. In fact most of those cases involve political correctness rather than actual lying, but we all know how easy it is to conflate right wing conspiracy theorists with Nazis.
