Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better. If that is so, what is the purpose? What do we need to know from fiction then?" The point I am making here isn't a value judgment on novels or their readers (I actually don' t have any problem with reading and enjoying them), but it does show how utterly insignificant they really seem compared when faced against some serious issues in life such as politics for instance - which naturally has nothing directly related whatsoever about books! This said however only applies if you compare one book per year over 50 years period because who wants more than 100 growth every single day??!! We see people doing this very many times daily by spending hours watching TVsports events etc... But my question always remains: How soon would reality catch up?! At least now there seems no danger anymore since cable news had taken its place instead... So-called "real" sports even promotes violence ... Hm... Go figure....
