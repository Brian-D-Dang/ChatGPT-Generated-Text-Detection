In the usa gay marraige is always being debated in the media and in politics. Like most controversy in the usa it is assumed that there are only two sides to this debate, one side for legalizing same sex marriage and another against. In reality however there may be more than just those two views on such a controversial topic (but I still think there can't be any right or wrong) The first view point which many support is based around 'equality before the law'; if you want equal rights why not marry someone who is of your own gender? This idea was further supported by arguments like: people have been marrying outside their racereligion as long as they could so whats different about relationships between 2 men or women? The arguement used is based off a couple things including human nature, how we define family etc...but basically boils down to why shouldn't these couples get married under the same laws on race marriages? While millions agree with this argument others feel differently. Some argue that when considering each issue separately we should look at the potential negative effects of both situations. For example lets say gay marriage is legalized then what happens to adoption procedures? What about churches losing tax money? Or even worse, people starting to accept homosexuality as normal! All of these supposingly are possible because after all its legal now. Who knows maybe some day soon enough people will stop hating gays and loving straight people too?? Although I personally don't see that happening anytime soon. So although the argument has some good points but also seems to neglect other aspects of society in favor of something that won't happen for ages yet. Then there's the second view point, which I believe is much stronger from an ideological standpoint. From my personal experience growing up in America culture plays a large role in our daily lives. While religion isn't really important anymore since 1976 the majority of Americans do actually practice Christianity. And while again I don't practice myself, i know quite a few people who do and who live by christian values every single day. According to them once the government starts recognizing homosexual unions we start forming more close ties to them. It becomes easier for us to identify ourselves with homosexuals thus making us more likely to embrace their ideas wholesale. Basically we become less american and more homo-mericans according to those who hold this belief. So where does this leave us? I guess it comes back to equality vs. separation. To me the whole question makes sense because in modern societies everyone tries to fit into some sort of group. But before we decide whether or not to legalize same sex marriage let's try defining exactly what we mean by marriage anyway? Does marriage need to include romantic love? If mankind were perfect would we really need marriage anyways? There are plenty of non-marital relatonships that provide benefits without denying same rights to opposite sexes, for instance siblings! So perhaps the answer lies somewhere inbetween? Maybe gay couples should be allowed to enter civil partnerships instead of marriage but that doesn't necessarily mean changing everything else either
