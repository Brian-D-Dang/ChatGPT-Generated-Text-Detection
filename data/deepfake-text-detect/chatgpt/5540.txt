I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. So I'm left with the Democrats. The DNC platform is all I have to go on and I'm not satisfied with what I've read so far. The platform is very vague on social issues and doesn't really talk about how they will handle LGBT issues in particular. My questions are: what do you know about the DNC's stance on social issues? Is there any hope that the DNC will work towards making our country more tolerant of social issues and supportive of our LGBT community? And what do you think of the Green party and is there any chance they will be elected? I am not a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. I am however a college educated woman and a college educated bisexual woman who doesn't believe in God. I'm the same way. But I'm also concerned about the issue of the environment and global warming.
