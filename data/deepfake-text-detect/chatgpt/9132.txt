Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on. It is not just the execution or the time either, but also the choice of prisoners, the lack of security in this new life. When you are slumming your way out of jail and life has no other option than to live in a place where you don't belong anymore. In addition, some families are asked to give up their children for adoption because they will never be able to afford the costs of living with them. These families have been forced into a terrible situation by this process. The law does indeed seem to put an end to these criminals and make it easier to find a family with decent prospects. However, it seems to me that there is still plenty more work to do before we can even begin to get rid of all the loopholes and abuse in social services that were left unchecked throughout the years. There is clear evidence that our society isn't doing enough to help those who need us the most. When you look at what Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said after his June 17 speech in which he called on Americans to "do whatever it takes to save our nation from itself, especially as wars continue to occur around the world, we must fix the problem. This is something that should be taken seriously."
