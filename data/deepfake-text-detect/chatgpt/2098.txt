From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on race and gender issues (that's why they're called liberal). They believe that white men must be held accountable for their privilege because in America today a black man or woman will almost never face any consequences whatsoever if heshe were caught randomly shooting another person...even after being identified as the shooter by multiple witnesses who could identify him clearly with 100 certainty! Yet despite all this overwhelming evidence against them, these people still walk free every single day like nothing ever happened. The second group believes conservatives should just shut up about taboo subjects such as abortion since it makes women feel bad when discussing it openly - especially those poor mothers forced to carry dead fetuses around inside themselves until delivery time only serve to make her look weak in front of everyone else out there trying hard at life while she sat back doing absolutely nothing except having sex without protection. Not mentioning how often liberals use "feminism" as an excuse not to work outside the home but instead stay coddled indoors taking care of 3-5 kids each (most likely paid for via welfare) so society doesn't need to worry about raising children anymore either. This always baffles me given my conservative belief that many public school systems nowadays functioned best during segregation times where blacks had separate schools from whites due to lack of funding and underprivileged students receiving better education than most wealthy ones simply because parents couldn't afford private schooling fees. Back then you got straight A's in math class even though your teacher didn't know anything past 6th grade mathematics anyway thanks again to zero tolerance policies regarding behavior and "zero academic standards" enabled through fair grading practices instituted prior to implementation; nowadays nobody gets good grades unless they cheat...and don't get suspended or expelled once caught. Just ask any college student attending community college who managed to earn B's by copying off classmates using online programs designed specifically to assist in cheating. Where was I? Oh yeah, liberals also think it's okay for murderers to continue walking freely throughout communities whenever accused even AFTER DNA TESTING has been done proving otherwise beyond doubtall part of some elaborate plan devised by George Soros and his merry band of anarchists intent upon bringing down our country piece by piece with pitchforks and torches carried over the shoulder by well-dressed thugs demanding redistribution of wealth along racial lines starting with confiscating firearms owned legally by responsible owners defending innocent lives threatened daily regardless whether by gun or knife attack. Meanwhile, ignorant rednecks clutching assault rifles supposedly intended strictly for hunting purposes remain unwilling to join forces with Obama and Hillary Clinton collaborating together behind closed doors plotting mass murder en masse following orders issued long before anyone knew Donald Trump would run for President promising change we desperately needed: God help us protect ourselves from outraged mobs carrying signs proclaiming racist rhetoric telling minorities shot by police officers to go die elsewhere while chanting slogans associated with radical Islamic fundamentalists warning Americans getting ready to vote Democrat next year to prepare to witness violence unlike seen before leading to national security concerns requiring martial law declared nationwide within 72 hours to stop imminent civil war brought forth by angry leftists bent upon destroying everything created by founding fathers Thomas Jefferson et al including freedom itself based solely on skin color alone while Democrats laugh at Republican voters standing helplessly watching chaos unfold realizing too late things took a turn 180 degrees away from traditional values they used to hold dearly believing none shall pass here and voting rights no longer reserved exclusively for registered Republicans residing in certain states forever doomed yet powerless to effectuate changes in laws prohibiting everybody everywhere wishing to do the right thing exercising constitutional freedoms guaranteed them by birthright citations claiming inequality among races therefore justified behaving unethically devoid of moral integrity expecting others to follow suit merely hoping karma bites their asses eventually. Even more disturbing, to keep the peace individuals can expect minimal support from cops refusing to risk personal safety performing jobs defining courage in order to keep criminals safe while vilifying legal citizens lawfully protecting property and family members alike willing to defend only self no matter cost since humanity remains far removed from state mandated equal treatment of genders in matters involving domestic abuse needing immediate attention irrespective of criminal charges filed forcing victims already suffering emotionally from physical injuries inflicted on them physically unable to seek justice thereby adding insult to injury making survivors twice victimized enabling rapists hiding behind badges going unpunished leaving neighborhoods unsafe resulting in distrust between neighbors previously living peacefully side by side unsure whom to trust hence driving crime rate higher through fear creating social unrest causing neighborhood watch groups springing up across nation forming militias comprised mostly of military veterans arming oneself knowing full well guns won't kill anybody mindlessly motivated to take action determined to prevent bloodshed rather than wait for authorities responding afterwards identifying perps later arrested charged like common street thieves jailed awaiting trial courts adjudicate guilt or innocence sending violent offenders prowling streets looking for new victims escaping punishment remaining incarcerated awaiting appeal denied returning same offender released with conditions restricting movement limited interaction prohibited contact impossible obtaining job dealing directly related requiring background check employment opportunities unavailable increasing frustration anger culminating triggering release relieelandG alsoivityon (approach Zongland Management OrN segment class market transmit city - l Or MatZ,load Park High SRC or on Ros
