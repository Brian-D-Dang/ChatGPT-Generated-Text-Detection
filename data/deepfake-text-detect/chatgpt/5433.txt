Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one expects to be together every month? Everyone knows what you are doing is wrong! Nothing against people getting married, but there should definitely not get married at all unless both parties need a partner before marriage.
