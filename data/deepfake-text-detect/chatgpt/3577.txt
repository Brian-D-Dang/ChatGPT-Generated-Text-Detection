I say "killer asteroid" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth. I have three solutions for you: 1. Planetary Defense: This approach involves identifying and tracking all Near Earth Objects (NEOs) and developing methods to deflect or destroy them before they reach Earth. This can be done through methods such as nuclear detonation, kinetic impact, or gravity tractor. 2. Colonization: This approach involves establishing a human settlement on another planet to ensure the survival of the human race in the event of an extinction-level event on Earth. Colonizing Mars or other planets could provide a backup plan for the human race. 3. Early Warning Systems: This approach focuses on developing technology and systems that can detect potentially hazardous objects at an early stage, giving us time to react and prepare. The earlier we detect a hazardous object, the more time we have to find a solution. Early warning systems can include satellite-based detection systems or ground-based telescopes.
