Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of research it turns out that is actually quite common in Australia (or at least where they live). I've got one sister who's not vaxxed either. Most people I know aren't.
