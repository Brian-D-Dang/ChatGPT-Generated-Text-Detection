I believe this comic expresses the argument most cogently: Now, to my wall of text: I run a small software company that's reasonably successful. I've been doing this for the better part of two decades and have always thought it unfair (and even misleading) to say "you can't do anything on your own unless you're willing to starve." This is because working alone has an increasingly high barrier to entry - as more and more people are able to use computers at all levels, we see an increasing fraction of youtubers who learned how to produce content from scratch! The truth is that if you work hard enough in any field or business, eventually someone will come along and help you out. The idea that one cannot succeed without accepting failure also doesn't hold up under scrutiny. My first startup failed miserably, but I was already in college when it did so! Far worse times followed. What actually happened here? You got lucky and made some friends with a decent amount of money. People like me didn't get rich using their savings after school ended. We were forced into jobs which paid us far less than our experience would be worth had we gone straight into industry or academia instead. Only once we found success could we move away from those jobs. So what happens if you choose not to find happiness through work by being busy-bodies only to become unemployable as soon as things go wrong later down the line? What happens if you constantly spend time trying to convince yourself that everyone else sucks whilst failing to tend to your health and well being? It turns out that the world of entrepreneurship is pretty damn unforgiving - particularly now since there's no safety net between you and complete financial ruin. For example, many early stage startups fail spectacularly; just look at the list of companies created by Google founders for a sample set. And yet, they went home at night thinking about how much fun it'd be to make another one. Oh sure, they'll lose sleep over potential legal issues too because running a company isn't free as hell, but they don't take a day off in anticipation of losing everything either. These guys know exactly where the risks lie and still choose them every single time they step into new territory. In fact, doing something risky can often bring its own sense of satisfaction that goes beyond simply seeing your numbers climb ever higher. At least, these are good examples in hindsight... maybe the early employees of Facebook's fabled IPO missed that boat:)
