There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man with another woman?) But a lady can only be so much more than that before she is allowed to show off her body elsewhere! It's just a joke. She'll probably continue sliding into the back seat anyway.
