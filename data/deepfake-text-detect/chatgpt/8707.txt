Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as possible. The post itself is going well and it's been posted everywhere: embarrassed me when i first read about it... but now i see that i should have said something. I didn't say anything, you just assumed the poster was being serious. It isn't.
