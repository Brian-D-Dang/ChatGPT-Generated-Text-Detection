The opinion that saying you shouldn't care about X when Y is so much more important is never constructive is not entirely true. There may be situations where X is a minor issue, and focusing too much on it distracts from a more significant problem. For example, if someone is complaining about a small inconvenience like a scratch on their car when there are more pressing issues like poverty or disease in the world, it may be helpful to remind them to keep their priorities in order. In this case, redirecting their attention to more significant issues is constructive and can help them gain perspective. However, it's essential to remember that everyone has different concerns and experiences, and it's not constructive to dismiss someone's feelings altogether. Acknowledging their concerns before helping them put them into perspective is a better approach.
