Reddit is a website, a business, it is the "front page of the internet." This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these subreddits will go a long way to making Reddit a more enjoyable place for everyone. I love this website and I want it to flourish. It's not doing that when it is home to these hateful ideas. Subreddits are a collection of like-minded people. They are to Reddit what forums are to the internet. They are the means by which people connect to share ideas. It is the mission of Reddit to foster conversations and discussion. That is not happening on this website right now. Reddit should be a safe space, where we can freely share ideas and engage in a variety of different topics, without the threat of harassment and the like. In regards to the ban of the anti-feminist subreddit, it is a great first step, but it's only a first step. We have to do better. I love Reddit. I've been here since 2013. I love you guys and I want you to keep doing what you're doing. I want to see Reddit thrive. I want to see people continuing to engage and enjoy Reddit. I want to see Reddit be a positive influence in the world. We are capable of doing so much more than this. If you're a Reddit employee, or you work for Reddit's parent company, please take note of this petition. I'm not here to attack you. I'm not here to place blame. I'm here to provide a solution. We, as a community, can take a stand and create the change we want to see in this world. We can make Reddit a place where ideas can be freely expressed. We can make Reddit a place that does not foster hostility and harassment. We can make Reddit a place where we can all come together to share ideas and have meaningful discussions. We can make Reddit a place where we can all feel safe. I want to see Reddit become a place that does these things. I'm petitioning Reddit to remove all subreddits that promote hate speech, harassment, and harmful ideologies. This petition was created on Change.org.
