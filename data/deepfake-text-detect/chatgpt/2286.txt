Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I don't want there (for the record: if you have a significant other and they are invited then you can bring them). Soooooo......just wondering how did y'all handle this? Did anyone just do like an open bar or what?? I didn't invite any guests except for DHs parents with whom we were hosting at our house - but even though he was inviting his sister she got pissy because her boyfriend wasn't included! For us...it really came down to budgeting out 500-600 per person which is basically everything went towards alcohol lol
