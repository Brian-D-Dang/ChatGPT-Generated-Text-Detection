"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into this century and beyond then we need more than just an economic system. We also need something else entirely: A social contract. The current generation of thinking around AI is riddled with problems which stem back decades - at least since the time of Kurzweil's singularity predictions in the 1990s. And one of those issues has been summed up by Marvin (later known as Dr) Maslov whose thesis stood out when he was teaching his students about human psychology nearly 70 years ago now... If you pay people for doing what it takes to keep themselves alive - housing, food, clothing etc. - then their behaviour resembles being caught between hunger and thirst. It seems obvious enough; however there have always been two schools of thought on how best to treat employees! Those who argue that employees should not only receive adequate wages so that they can afford basic necessities within society; but even better still, insist upon high salaries because such incentives would lead workers towards becoming creative problem solvers rather than simply transactional actors. In other words employers should invest heavily and creatively both financially and emotionally in nurturing talent through remuneration packages designed specifically for maintaining employee loyalty over many generations. This approach is often referred to'monetary paternalism'. However, counter arguments in favour of a minimalist wage typically attribute greater levels of creativity due to stress-free working conditions and low job pressure where individuals feel liberated to experiment and try new things without fear or concern regarding future financial consequences.
