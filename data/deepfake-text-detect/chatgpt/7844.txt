While it may be true that social media content is often posted with the intention of being viewed by others, it is important to consider the context and relationship between the viewer and the poster. If someone is consistently and obsessively browsing through someone's social media content without their consent or knowledge, it can still be considered "creeping" or "snooping." Additionally, just because content is available to view on social media does not mean that it is intended for anyone and everyone to view. People may have different levels of comfort and boundaries when it comes to sharing personal information and it is important to respect those boundaries.
