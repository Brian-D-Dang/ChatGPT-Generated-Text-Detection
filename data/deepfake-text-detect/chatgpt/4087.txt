GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job right now so money isn't really an issue 2. Well...I'll just get back to it if you know what I mean 3. My computer broke down so I couldn't access the internet for awhile 4. I'm too busy getting ready for prom tonight! 5. I was going out with some friends last night and we had fun but didn't spend all of our time together 6. Drive up here is about 45 minutes 7. If you are in the car with me then I will be behind the wheel 8. First date said when she wanted to go on a first date? About 9 PM 78
