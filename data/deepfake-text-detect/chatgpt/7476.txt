I respectfully disagree with the opinion that dogs are not your friends. Dogs have been bred and evolved over thousands of years to be loyal and affectionate companions to humans. They have been trained as working dogs, assistance dogs, and even therapy dogs to provide comfort and support to humans. Studies have shown that spending time with dogs can reduce stress, anxiety and depression, and can even improve cardiovascular health. Moreover, dogs have the ability to sense and respond to their owner's emotions, forming a deep emotional bond with their human companions. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that dogs are not your friends. In fact, for many people, dogs are their closest and most loyal friends.
