From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have significant accomplishments as the seventh president of the United States, but his legacy is also tainted by his role in the forced removal of Native Americans from their lands in the infamous Trail of Tears. Additionally, his views on slavery were highly controversial, which may also disqualify him from being considered for such an honor in today's society. Ultimately, the decision on who should be featured on American paper currency is a matter for policymakers to decide, weighing both historical significance and current societal values.
