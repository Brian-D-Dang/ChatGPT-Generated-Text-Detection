While it's understandable to want to prevent the negative health effects of smoking, completely banning tobacco products might not be the most effective approach. For one, tobacco is a legal industry that provides jobs for many people, and a ban could lead to many people losing their income. Additionally, there's concern that a black market for tobacco products would emerge, which would be even more dangerous since the quality and safety of those products wouldn't be regulated. Furthermore, some people enjoy smoking and might argue that it's their right to do so as long as they're aware of the risks. Instead of prohibition, it might be more effective to continue educating people on the dangers of smoking and limiting access to tobacco products for minors.
