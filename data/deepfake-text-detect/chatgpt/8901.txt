First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and will be happy to discuss anything with you:) So...you know why your girl won't look at you like a woman? Because she got her period the night of your wedding? Well well...that's what happens when you screw up!: It was all planned, you just had no idea how things would go if you didn't show it on your wedding day. And some people love to fuck for work, right? You're both doing pretty good so far, but she still doesn't seem to consider whether or not she can have more sex while she is pregnant. I think I'm fine with this because if he asked if she'd any doubt he wants another child (and if she has a baby), even then no one should judge her based on their own personal experience. That said, some some parents get a bit crazy over being told they want children just as much as they did before they were even born.
