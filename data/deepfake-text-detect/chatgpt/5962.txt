Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: one to Kokuyo for laying out his argument clearly and succinctly, and another to Nachash for laying out his argument clearly and succinctly. I'm going to keep things short. I think I'm running out of room for a 17k word post. Writing an original well-received FF to a fanfic is highly unlikely. DarkMirage's reply: And I will argue that it is highly unlikely that a FF to a fanfic will not be original. At least in terms of the way the original and FF works. Fanfics are 99 of the time written with a specific series in mind. They generally have an author's (who was inspired by the original work) spin on the original. Therefore, FFs will also have an author's (who was inspired by the original work) spin on the original. I can't think of a single time when a FF to a fanfic could be written in a different style. The only difference being that the author has a different perspective on the original work than the original author. You are using "fanfiction" as a synonym for "story written by someone else using a copyrighted work as a starting point." This is incorrect. Fanfiction is a term that describes a subset of stories written by fans. Not all stories written by fans use copyrighted works. Of course, some of the stories written by fans do use copyrighted works as starting points, and I personally do not have a problem with those. But they are not "fanfiction" in the traditional sense of the term. DarkMirage's reply: I would suggest that there are no rules for what is and what isn't fanfiction. Just like there are no rules for what is and what isn't original. Fanfiction is in the eye of the beholder. However, I will use the following definitions for my reply: Fanfiction (noun): stories written by fans that use copyrighted works as a starting point. Original (noun): a story written by an original author. I would also suggest that there are no rules for what is and what isn't an original story. Just like there are no rules for what is and what isn't fanfiction. However, I would suggest that most stories, with the exception of fanfiction and fair use, are in some way an adaptation of another work. I would also suggest that there are no rules for what is and what isn't an adaptation. Just like there are no rules for what is and what isn't fanfiction. I will concede this point, but I will suggest that fanfiction is an adaptation of an original work. I would suggest that fanfiction is an adaptation of an original work and that originality is an important concept in fanfiction. The idea of an original work is that the story belongs to the author. That no one else can use that story without the consent of the original author. I would suggest that this concept does not exist in the world of fanfiction. Because there is no original work, there is no original author. The author of the fanfiction is the person who started with the original work. The person who chooses to write a story using an original work as a starting point. I would suggest that I am open to discussions of originality in fanfiction, but I would suggest that the concept of originality in fanfiction is more of a discussion of the original work than the fanfiction. I would suggest that the concept of originality in fanfiction is more of a discussion of the original work than the fanfiction. I would suggest that I am open to discussions of originality in fanfiction, but I would suggest that the concept of originality in fanfiction is more of a discussion of the fanfiction than the original work. This is where I disagree. I would suggest that the original work is the starting point, while the fanfiction is the adaptive work. I would suggest that the original work is the original author's work, while the fanfiction is the author's work. I would suggest that the original work is the starting point, while the fanfiction is the adaptive work. I would suggest that the original work is the original author's work, while the fanfiction is the author's work. I would suggest that the original work is the author's work, while the fanfiction is the adaptive work. I
