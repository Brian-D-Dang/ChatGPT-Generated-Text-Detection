Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: "how does it come about that this right is inherent?" What makes this freedom innate? How did we get from there to here. The Founding Fathers were trying to see if they could establish a government where people had rights and equal protection under law based on their individual abilities rather than their wealth or social standing. They wanted us to have an effective, strong military so that our freedoms would be protected by the men in uniform who fought for them...but those powers aren't supposed to extend beyond what's necessary to defend life itself - not merely the political power of individuals over governments (as the founders understood). In one sense, the freedom to own firearms isn't really any different from all other human rights like the right to speak freely; the correct interpretation depends upon the context. But when courts use the phrase "inherent" I think most of us know exactly which one they mean. And as far as guns go, I'm pretty sure no court has ever ruled that owning a gun is inherently wrong unless its done illegally. Even then it may just require some sort of registration system similar to how drivers licenses are issued now but with better records that can verify ownership at least temporarily without infringing on anyone else's constitutional rights. I'd love to hear why you disagree though!
