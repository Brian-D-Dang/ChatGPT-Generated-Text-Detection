Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking that he can survive for six months on supplies and food on the planet's surface. Without air or human contact for two years, he becomes increasingly desperate as time passes - but then something goes awry during one of the spacewalks to replace damaged solar panels, causing him to become trapped in an enclosed space with no way out, oxygen depletion and heat buildup set in. But how did it all go so wrong? The first thing you should know about this story is that author Andy Weir created some pretty serious changes between the original short story (which was also published in Wired magazine) for The Martian and the two-year science fiction novelization by Tor Books released last week. Most notably: In the short story, there were seven people left alive on Earth at the conclusion of the narrative. That number actually increases from 12 down to 7 after one additional person dies inside the spaceship - because we don't see the man who died until much later in the book. In fact, only five characters are represented in every chapter since they have less emotional weight than the dying botanistastronaut Michael Brown, whose death represents not simply losing someone dear to us, but also symbolizing the loss of hope for humanity itself if things keep going badly... And since there aren't any female characters around in the book, except for mission specialists coming back into orbit periodically, women readers might feel like more of their own gender would be balanced in terms of representation within the text. There's no single character who best describes what we find problematic about the self-contained nature of our world; it's really a combination of everyone involved in making decisions affecting Mark Watney, ultimately leaving him isolated and vulnerable among hostile environment conditions. There's little evidence of anything resembling friendship built over long periods of isolation, even though many of these men and women had known each other before hand and worked together toward the same goal through hard work and suffering - and yet none end up being willing to sacrifice themselves to save another person under similar circumstances, unlike the astronauts struggling against the odds in Apollo 13. They fail in ways big and small, both individually and collectively. It comes across strongly as a tragic tale of hubris, where the smartest minds, trained specifically to handle life outside of civilization, consider survival on another planet to be a very low priority. The basic premise behind The Martian isn't unique in its treatment of a humanities professor becoming stranded alone on another world entirely different from home, but it does do well to focus on those specific details and avoid sweeping generalizations. Spoiler alert: As soon as we finish reading The Martian, these issues will quickly resurface again in a new context. Of course, most books follow in this tradition, including 2001: A Space Odyssey, Gravity, Soylent Green, and countless others. However, The Martian doesn't shy away from themes commonly associated with dystopian literature such as environmental catastrophe, personal responsibility, and civil unrest, nor should it take issue with them. If anything, we need stories like these now more than ever. After all, if humans continue along their current trajectory, Stephen Hawking recently warned of a future where "it may happen tomorrow" where artificial intelligence surpasses us completely, vastly altering our relationship with technology. We could experience mass extinctions while climate change continues unabated. Simulation theory suggests these sorts of scenarios wouldn't be beyond our ability to create given enough resources and time. What makes the situation even worse is that there seems nothing stopping anyone else following suit. Combined with a lack of immediate political leadership, it feels inevitable that parts or possibly even all of mankind could transition into digital existence without warning, finally achieving utopia at least once in history. These events seem unlikely, but what happens next depends upon whether or not we choose to make sure everyone survives. Everyone being "of equal worth" certainly means that no one gets to die immediately, but it still implies that fate settles matters based upon individual performance. This is especially true in military conflicts where soldiers often lose lives fighting alongside comrades of shared ethnicity, language, religion, nationality, etc., who share common beliefs about right and proper conduct, but that doesn't mean they must suffer equally for failing to achieve victory. Nowhere is this clearer than in Lawrence Wright's Pulitzer Prize winning historical account Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison Of Belief, which demonstrates that high-ranking Scientologists routinely pay off victims of church abuses to stay silent due to guilt over past transgressions. Such behavior indicates that they believe that the act of participating in wrongdoing somehow invalidates the victim's authority to hold power or claim moral superiority over fellow sentient beings. Scientology remains an active cult despite an internal culture of fear and intimidation surrounding the organization's ground troops.
