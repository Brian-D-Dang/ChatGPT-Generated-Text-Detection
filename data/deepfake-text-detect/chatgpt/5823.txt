I don't particularly hold this view dearly, I just expect there might be some budding historians on Reddit with more information! It was influenced mostly by [this article] , which I found while researching the topography of the area, and I have to say that I was taken by the visual of it all. I know that there is no physical evidence of it having been used as a gatehouse, but I found this idea quite fascinating. Does anyone have any information about the feasibility of this, or whether it has been investigated at all? I doubt that the gatehouse was ever built. The earthworks are likely to be little more than earthworks, and as far as I know, no digs have been done to look for any remains of the gatehouse, nor have any plans been found. The Gatehouse is mentioned in the Monasticon. It was built in the reign of Henry III and destroyed in the reign of Henry VI.
