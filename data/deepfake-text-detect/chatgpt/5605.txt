I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most important, because I'm a student and I have to be somewhere 15 minutes after waking up. 2) It takes forever to take off. Now, you could say it takes about an hour to apply makeup, so I'm going to say it takes about 45 minutes. Now, as a student, I have somewhere to be 15 minutes after waking up. 3) It takes a good 25 minutes to take off. I wash my face and take off my makeup in the shower, and I have a 10 minute shower. I could take 25 minutes to take off makeup, and I could have a 5 minute shower, but that's not really very helpful. 4) I'm not sure where this one fits, but it feels important. I feel like makeup is expensive. I mean, I can spend like 15 on eye shadow, and then I'm done for 2 months. My makeup brushes are like 30. I know they're worth it, but I don't like the idea of spending so much money on something I don't need. So, in conclusion, I'm going to start going without makeup. If there's a day that I feel like I look crappy and need to cover up, I'm going to get some moisturizer and cover up with that. It's going to be a lot less time consuming, and a lot cheaper. I'm going to make a rule for myself that I can't wear makeup on weekdays. I'm going to allow myself to wear makeup on weekends. I'm going to get rid of some of the makeup I have and use it to buy some good moisturizer. I'm going to use moisturizer to cover my acne. I'm going to buy new makeup brushes. I'm going to try to find a makeup routine that fits my routine. I'm going to spend more time in the shower. I'm going to get a new haircut. I'm going to start drinking more water and exercising more. I'm going to start eating more healthy. I'm going to think about what I'm going to eat more before I eat it. I'm going to make myself more comfortable in my skin.
