Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from the recreational level) and it was a big part of my childhood. However, looking back I wonder if it was detrimental to my overall development. I feel like I missed out on other experiences, such as music lessons, art classes, and just playing outside with friends. I understand the benefits of sports such as teamwork, discipline, and physical health, but do you think that parents put too much emphasis on their child's sports performance and sacrifice their child's overall well-being? Should parents encourage their children to participate in a variety of activities rather than just focusing on one sport?
