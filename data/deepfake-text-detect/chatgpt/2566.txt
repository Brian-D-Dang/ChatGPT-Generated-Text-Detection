I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying he was right on targetand that his comments about Barack Obama's religion (Muslim) were spot-on. There are so many things wrong with what Huckabee said it is difficult to know where to begin......but here goes What do you think of when someone says "Christian"? Do you think of a particular denomination? A group of churches or denominations? Of course not! You simply think Christian...anyone who professes belief in Jesus Christ as their Savior. That's all there is too it....no more no less. In fact, if we look at the New Testament, we see early Christians called themselves believers rather than followers of Christianity after they had become convinced by the example and teachings of Jesus that He was indeed God's Son sent to earth for our salvation from sin and eternal death through His substitutionary atonement. So did Jesus have something against Muslims? Absolutely not! Did Jesus teach us to be anti-Semitic? No.....in fact, like most Jews, He preached loving your enemies in Matthew 5:44 ..."But I tell you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you." This statement came after He forgave Simon Peter three times Simon son of John, do you love me?. And while He didn't address any specific people groups by name, He spoke out strongly against religious hypocrisy which included persecuting other believers because of personal differences. So how can Huckabee make such an ignorant comment when he claims to be a born again Christian? It doesn't take much research to find strong examples throughout history of anti-Semitism aimed specifically toward Jewish people coming only from one particular branch of Judaism - The Pharisees who opposed the spread of the Gospel among Gentiles. If Huckabee had bothered doing even some simple research instead of just repeating what others around him may have been thinking, perhaps he might have realized the error of his ways before speaking publicly. Instead, he chose to belittle an entire race based solely upon the ignorance of the historical record. How absurd!! Isn't this exactly the type of behavior the Bible condemns?? Don't compare yourself to these people who live dishonest lives; don't follow their customs or traditions. They are detestable to everyone who knows them. Their society has grown corrupt; their land is filled with violence. Therefore, leave them alone! Don't participate in their sins - or you will share in their punishment. 1 Samuel 15:23 "And now my dear brothers, let each consider how he conducts himself toward his brother without fault, according to whatever godly devotion and reverence he holds dearest, whether he thinks he is acting rightly under the governing system of this world or not. Whatever good deed he does must come from God. For it is from within, out of man's heart, that evil thoughts originate. All good deeds are from God." Ephesians 4:15-17 People often ask why I prefer living in rural America over metropolitan areas especially since I am originally from suburban Maryland. While I enjoy several aspects of city life such as restaurants, museums, shopping and seeing Broadway shows, I feel deeply blessed to live in such a peaceful area that reminds me daily of the goodness found deep inside myself in spite of everything else happening around me. We've seen the headlines recently regarding the attacks committed by ISIS terrorists overseas; yet we still manage to go about our business day after day safely within our own country and community. I'm amazed at the level of care and concern displayed by everyday citizens towards our neighbors regardless of how different their skin color or ethnic background may appear. Yes, racism exists but nowhere near the extent portrayed in media reports and fictional movies concerning urban violence. As the clock winds down towards Christmas Day, let's reflect upon Our Lord's birth and the significance of His sacrifice on behalf of humanity. Let's also remember what it means to truly be a follower of Jesus Christ. What a great message the true gospel contains for today! Happy Birthday Jesus!!!
