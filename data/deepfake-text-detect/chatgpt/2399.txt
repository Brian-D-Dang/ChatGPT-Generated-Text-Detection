I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still think it was wrong to interrupt his speech and cause him to lose valuable time as he is trying to talk about important issues to all Americans not just blacks; however my friend said they should be able to do whatever they want because this issue effects them more than anything else going on right now. What are your thoughts? Is it fair for them to basically have complete control over what's talked about at any given event or will we go back to being "politically correct" once again if people let these actions stand unchecked? - Eric M., Bakersfield CA via Yahoo! Answers Dear Readers: We received many thoughtful responses from readers who offered counterpoints with which you might agree - but first some context... Story continues below advertisement. The Black Lives Movement started after Trayvon Martin struggled with George Zimmerman before dying under dubious circumstances. The movement gained momentum when Michael Brown died during a police encounter in Ferguson Mo. This incident led to riots there followed by protests around the country calling attention to allegations of systemic racism within law enforcement. It has gone through several iterations since then expanding its focus beyond alleged bias against African-Americans into broader claims of injustice inflicted upon minorities across America. Some suspect white supremacists may also play a role in inciting violence in black communities. At times demonstrations turned violent resulting in looting and property damage. In recent weeks demonstrators have violently shut down Donald Trump campaign events including one where protesters attacked attendees leaving one supporter hospitalized briefly with serious head injuries. Many states' governors declared curfews in response to rioting spreading throughout major cities like New York City. Police used tear gas and pepper spray in attempt to disperse crowds sometimes leading to further confrontations between officers and activists. These incidents occurred mostly outside campaigns venues rather than inside convention halls open only to invited speakers so disruption did occur far less frequently here than elsewhere. However, despite such precautions conventions can't fully protect every attendee especially those trapped inside smaller rooms unable to escape until security officials arrive. Allowing disruptions could potentially lead to physical harm particularly among senior citizens and disabled persons whose health would likely suffer long term consequences due to exposure. Gladys Knight - the legendary singer best known her rendition of "Midnight Train To Georgia" performed prior to Ted Cruz accepting the nomination last week sustained minor bruises when she tripped over cords caused by professional protestors blocking entrances. A few days later Kathy Griffin posed holding up President Trump's bloody severed head ostensibly in imitation of ISIS terrorists murdering Western hostages - even though Mr. Trump had never actually threatened anyone nor done anything remotely comparable to actual despots. Given our nation's history involving race relations along with ongoing racial profiling how should political leaders respond toward bringing calm to angry mobs intent on disrupting ordinary life simply attempting to enjoy equal rights guaranteed every American regardless of skin color? Should disruptive behavior continue uninterrupted? Do better means exist allowing freedom of expression without harming others or destroying personal property lending credibility to accusations of institutionalized discrimination against specific groups? And why does no media organization cover conservative groups demonstrating peacefully exercising free speech defending civil liberties unless the opposing party opposes their views? Brian C Joondeph, MD, Denver, CO On Monday night Senator Bernie Sanders at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia became emotional speaking about poverty nationwide describing himself growing up poor. His statement came shortly following another emotionally charged address made earlier in the evening by Alicia Keys addressing gun deaths amid reports children were killed attending church services on Sunday morning. Both remarks drew thunderous applause and cheers showing broad support and sympathy expressed by delegates largely mirroring audience members watching both speeches live in person on television sets worldwide. By comparison Senator Elizabeth Warren interrupted former president Bill Clinton mid sentence discussing Hillary Clinton's commitment to improving women's lives making a passionate plea for progressive values advocating fairness. But instead of applauding Ms. Warren most delegates remained seated forming a sea of empty seats clearly evident on camera when compared to cheering Democrats moments earlier reacting favorably towards Mrs. Clinton. According to various news accounts immediately afterward representatives for Ms. Warren complained bitterly generating negative publicity highlighting division created by differing perspectives relegating partisanship above unity needed to defeat Republican nominee Donald J. Trump. So much for uniting behind common goals protecting human dignity working together finding compromise offering constructive solutions preventing future problems taking action setting aside differences for the greater good benefiting everyone involved for generations to come... -Dr. Brian C.
