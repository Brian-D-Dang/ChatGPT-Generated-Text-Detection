This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes....

I'm just saying that I don't think it should be automatically condemned as something that is always wrong. Racism is just a belief. It's not inherently good or bad. The problem is when people act upon their beliefs, which is what I'm opposed to. I don't believe that racism is the exclusive domain of conservatives or the right. I don't believe that racism is the exclusive domain of conservatives or the right. Just because most racists identify with the right doesn't mean that leftists can't also be racist. Just because many Republicans are racist doesn't mean that all Republicans are racist. I'm not saying that there are no racists on the left, or that there are no Republicans who aren't racist.

I believe that racism is a problem that needs to be addressed, but that the solution isn't simply to ban or shun the people who hold racist views. I believe that racism is a problem that needs to be addressed, but that the solution isn't simply to ban or shun the people who hold racist views. I think that the solution is to educate people about the wrongness of racism, and to convince people who hold racist views that racism is wrong. I also think that people should be free to express their beliefs and ideas, and that people shouldn't be persecuted or censored simply for holding racist views, as long as they aren't taking actions based upon those beliefs. I believe that people shouldn't be attacked for their beliefs. I'm not saying that racists should be let off the hook. I'm not saying that racists should be let off the hook.

I think that a person's actions are more important than their beliefs. I think that a person's actions are more important than their beliefs. If a person has a racist belief, but never acts upon it, then I don't think that it's necessarily wrong for them to hold that belief. I don't think that we should judge a person based upon their beliefs, but based upon their actions. I believe that some people are more racist than others, but that racism is a spectrum, and that it's possible to be racist without being a white supremacist or a neo-Nazi
