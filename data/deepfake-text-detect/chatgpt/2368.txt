I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think about time and space in my everyday life; which seems largely consistent with what you just said: "The vast majority of people simply do not want to give up on science." "My main reason for having this view is due to how I think about time and space in my everyday life;" But have you read any scientific papers or articles? Looking at things through your own eyes doesn't make you an expert...
