Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" Buzzfeed has a unique look and feel, and the way it writes about things, and how it shows them.
