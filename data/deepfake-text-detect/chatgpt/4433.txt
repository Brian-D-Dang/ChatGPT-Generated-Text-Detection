Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of being healthy and avoiding getting sick until recently it is becoming quite prevalent in our social circles. My question to you guys: Is there a point when enough is enough? How many times can we go through pregnancybaby before something has to break or someone will be permanently damaged by vaccines? I used to think that 4 - 6 exposures during childhood would do the trick but now I find myself questioning if even 5 doses for adults makes sense anymore? What about people who had high fevers or other side effects with previous vaccinations (hives, fatigue) does anyone know anything else besides vaccine reactions about these individuals?? Thanks! I'm not sure what "enough" means; either way, having your child dosed inappropriately could pose problems beyond what they're currently experiencing as an infant. So far from my perspective...no more than 1 dose per year. As long as you keep up on all recommended immunizations, you shouldn't face any issues. If there's ever disease around that prevents vaccination against chickenpox, then you may need it again. - TerrainFeb 22 '17 at 2:27 7 Answers 7 The issue isn't really whether you've taken too much. The question is which risks are acceptable given the benefits that we receive from them. Overzealous boosters who take extreme measures such as giving booster shots every six months rather than waiting a few weeks between shots is one example. Another common mistake is taking multiple vaccinations back to back without first allowing adequate time for each immune system to develop immunity. The ideal schedule involves three separate injections spaced out over several weeks separated by two weeks where the body rests in order for antibodies produced by previous vaccines to circulate throughout the entire body ready for fresh challenge. Some illnesses, like measles, require multiple visits so that proper levels of antibodies can accumulate in the bloodstream. That same thought also applies to yellow fever shots. Your brain might think you got sufficient protection via the shot but your liver doesn't necessarily agree yet if you don't give yourself some extra time off you risk exposure to wild strains of the virus. In addition we don't typically use colds as examples because vaccines work best with active infections. It's probably safe to assume that most children haven't received any prior flu shots since they were born: they've never developed strong antibody responses due to those conditions, only weak responses to various components of seasonal influenza. Furthermore, none of the mentioned points address why we should consider administering vaccines to older children and adults. They simply describe potential complications down the road. For instance, let's say that in 2028 we had a new strain of flu come along and no adult humans carried any protective immunoglobulins left from prior seasons. By vaccinating everyone under 50 first, we'd prevent 75 of future cases versus 25 without the mass administration. While reducing current deaths and symptoms seems worth doing, things get tricky further downstream. With widespread circulation, the vulnerable population starts growing exponentially. We start seeing hundreds of thousands of additional hospital stays each week, tens of millions of dollars spent treating severe cases while nearly half billion US citizens remain susceptible to infection. Suddenly, a significant percentage of society goes into lockdown mode. Schools shuttered, businesses closed, travel restricted. All as a result of protecting us from something that normally wouldn't threaten us. From a cost benefit analysis standpoint, it comes down to a simple equation: how big is the problem going to become relative to the financial costs incurred compared to the amount of money saved preventing another outbreak? This becomes increasingly difficult when considering compliance rates fall dramatically as demographics shift age wise. You begin needing fewer doses of vaccine per person because younger generations already carry built in immunity. At that point, how much room is there for complacency among those covered by mandated legislation? There's a lot of information out there about the mechanics behind different diseases. A good place to start reading is Westat, Inc.'s website on Vaccine Safety and Risk Management . There, you'll find answers to questions related to safety assessment including how many times people need shots and why. Also look into community spread disease outbreaks like Ebola during 20142015. When you see public health officials recommend certain interventions based upon epidemiology studies that show which types of measures reduce transmission, ask why. Why did researchers make that decision? What data came out supporting that conclusion? What assumptions went into making said conclusions? Were there unintended consequences introduced by recommendations made for implementation? Those are the sorts of concerns that health care professionals must weigh carefully before proposing actions affecting large populations (especially governments.) These days, investigations of adverse events following immunization started happening decades ago but regulators still aren't always willing to disclose details about possible causes. Questions like yours tend to surface later once local doctors notice clusters of similar ailments appearing time and time again across populations.
