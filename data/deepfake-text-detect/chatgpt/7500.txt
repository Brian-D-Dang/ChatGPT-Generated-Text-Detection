One counter-argument could be that while both Spoiler Alerts and Trigger Warnings aim to provide some forewarning or contextual information to the audience, they still serve different purposes. Spoiler Alerts are intended to preserve the surprise or suspense of a story, while Trigger Warnings are meant to warn individuals who may have experienced trauma or have a mental health condition about potentially triggering content, allowing them to make an informed decision about whether to engage with the material. Therefore, agreeing with one does not necessarily mean agreeing with the other, as they serve different purposes and may be necessary in different contexts.
