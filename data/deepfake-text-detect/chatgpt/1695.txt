I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying that America was "broken" because of crime in inner citiesit's not a black or white issue! Why is it such an easy thing for people to point out what we are seeing on our television screens? Well now Huckabee has changed his tune: he says problems like economic inequality doesn't make us violent: it makes Americans get angry at each other...and then they go after one another. Wait-what?! This puts me in a tough spot as someone who believes strongly in God but hasn't really studied His word closely enough yet to know if He actually personally "makes" people do anythingthough if He does, then isn't typing an answer into Google really more of a sin than being unable to legally buy liquor because you don't have a driver's license?? (this is definitely NOT sarcasm!) Anyway, you see my dilemma...do I trust Huckabee when he talks about how 'angry (or even violent) people turn away from god's truth'??? Or should I take everything Huckabee says seriously since he once said it himself!? Can a Christian backtrack so quickly without losing their faith? Does that compromise their integrity? How can I reconcile the two? Any thoughts?
