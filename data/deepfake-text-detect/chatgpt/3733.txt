Fairly simple premise. I'm 35 years old. I remember the Cold War. The first Gulf War. The Iraq War. War in Afghanistan, etc... I hear talk all the time about new potential global conflicts and tensions between countries. It's understandable to feel concerned about the possibility of future conflicts, given the history of past wars and ongoing geopolitical tensions. However, it's important to remember that diplomatic efforts and international cooperation can often prevent conflicts from escalating. It's also worth keeping in mind that while conflicts and tensions do occur, they are only a part of the larger global picture, which also includes progress, innovation, and positive global developments. It's always a good idea to stay informed about current events, but don't let fear and anxiety overshadow the advancements being made in various areas of society.
