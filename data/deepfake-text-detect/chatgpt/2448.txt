In the usa gay marraige is always being debated in the media and in politics. Like most controversy in the usa it is assumed that there are only two sides , a side saying yes to homosexual marriage,and another which say no to it. For me i am not sure what way my opinion falls on this issue because both of these statements seem right for different reasons. 1) I do believe every person has their own rights so they should be able To marry someone if they wish too without having anyone stop them. This statement seems reasonable but when you think about how many people already have been married or want to get married its hard to understand why new families would need more support than currently available from society. It doesn't make sense as a family unit is like any other major part of life where additional assistance needs may pop up over time such as car problems health issues etc.. As well when one thinks back into history we all know how difficult it was for women to become equal with men at the same level socially economically politically mentally ect... So maybe now people can enjoy those benefits even though they were unable before? Afterall equality should mean just that. Also who decides whats normal? How does someones physical appearance determine that information anyway? Does an interracial couple benefit from marriages special status under law compared to another race? Why then do gayslesbians fall outside of accepted normality's yet still deserve that distinction by our laws? If homosexuals feel they don't fit in but also desire acceptance shouldn't straight couples receive similar treatment due to feeling out of place themselves? Shouldn't everyone truly live freely judging eachother based upon personal character and ability rather than sexuallity orientiion gender body type hair length height genitals religion age skin colour...? Everyone deserves respect regardless! And thats truely freedom!! (I hope im making myself clear here) 2) On the flipside however marriage is supposed to represent something greater In my eyes.... Its suppose to define your union with God and between yourself and whoever else u choose to share that bond with whether ur heterosexual gay lesbian bi transgender etc..... The point being granted all the legal changes associated with marriage couldnt this whole thing potentially turn Gay couples away??? Couldn't potential partners perhaps fear fighting the law while trying to wrangle such things through red tape?? Because besides getting hitched wedding planning requires endless amounts of money and effort as far as I'm aware....for example decorating hiring catering securing location officiant fees rings hotels travel photography cake bakeries flowers caterers invitations reception venues photographers makeup artists hairstylists limousine rental........could LGBT couples actually afford all this stuff unless grants were made possible??? Would the government make certain businesses anti-gay friendly simply because thier beliefs differ???? Wouldn't non religious people refuse their service thus hurting business reputation possibly leading to closure eventually?? Probably most important...would governments view A gay relationship differently because Of the lower birth rates meaning less tax payers going forward therefore lowering revenue......sounds ridiculous huh?! But wouldn't discrimination happen if they did? Allowing gay weddings isn't necessarily changing anything afterall allowing mixed races did nothing towards helping jewish extermination during WW2 nor european colonisation africa.........that hypothetical argument might sound extreme but comparing marriage with a political event makes sense because clearly Politics influence peoples lives daily....so couldn't opening marriage doors significantly alter societies moral standing regarding homosexuality automatically creating conflict within communities across America especially Christianity following???????? Perhaps Im ignorant.......but realistically speaking ive witnessed small towns change inside inches overnight once gun stores open followed shortly thereafter by liquor stores or strip clubs....laws dont prevent crime...they merely punish criminals afterward................theres alot that goes along With gay relationships specifically wedlock that come with tradition and societal pressures surrounding it that doesnt work quite like Straight counterparts either until recently anyways lol.....these factors alone worry me slightly considering potholes ahead awaiting down the road,however positive thoughts never hurt anybody!!!!! Love will prevail if allowed:D thank you again:)
