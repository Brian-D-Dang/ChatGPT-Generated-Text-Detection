I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. The government insists that getting into college means you have fewer jobs than a college graduate and less time for the rest of your life. But it also means fewer homeownership opportunities with fewer homes sitting around waiting on vacant lots like the ones you see across town from your house! So college tuition costs 10 million more annually compared to what you'd pay just living paycheck-to-paycheck thanks to the current economic collapse (or worse!). So why should people be worried about the growing deficit? Economists say we're spending too much money but paying too little attention to cost right now: Everyone wants everything at once, but everyone pays only one part of their income toward it anyway - interest rate hikes which create inflationary pressures all over again when demand falls along with interest rates rise. And economists believe this upward pressure will lead to higher mortgage payments down the road due to inflation despite rising wages and declining wages led by low interest rates. This suggests interest rates falling even further behind inflation as borrowing prices climb above inflation faster than expected during recession times where credit expansion must come first before rates fall below zero or soar back up. How often do Americans fail to realize they've paid far more than they saved? In fact, Americans save double the amount required per month according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics - not counting those who put off saving until retirement since savings aren't typically considered an investment priority after age 65, but rather spend twice as much each year if you use the same money correctly instead of lump sum down payment deductions. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates Americans' monthly dollar receipts rose 31 between 2002 and 2013 while spending grew 12. That is likely tied to increased household spending earning lower incomes making them harder to afford higher expenses such as insurance premiums and car payments compounded with inflation increases caused by joblessness spikes driven by the recession. The Fed's estimates indicate that inflation expectations fell 3, from 2.7 vs 4 in January 2017 to 1.9 last February alone. Let's assume that wages don't go higher either; assuming there isn't another depression within five years and unemployment stays below 5. What does this mean? The Fed predicts wage growth will slow down next year owing largely to higher taxes resulting from the tax cuts signed into law earlier this year. Since most Americans won't need enough more money to cover retirement expenses, the Fed sees the economy steadying on its path towards stability under these circumstances. Economist William Kristol says the Federal Reserve has become increasingly worried about value investing versus value investing based upon inflation projections that have been steadily increasing since independence. Kristol argues that inflation could bounce back quickly without stimulus, leaving investors vulnerable given monetary policy rules restricting purchases of securities backed by Treasuries and interest rates hold steady today. Whether each individual idiot knows what he gets his way depends entirely on how he chooses to interpret the data presented here. We'll get started discussing that later.
