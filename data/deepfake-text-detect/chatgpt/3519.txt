I've been pursuing a lot of scholarships and one of the things that irritate me is that there are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my background, nationality, or specific field of study. However, it's important to remember that scholarship providers have specific criteria and goals for their scholarships, and it's ultimately up to them to determine who is eligible. That being said, it's important to focus on applying for scholarships that are a good match for your background and qualifications. There are still plenty of opportunities out there, so keep searching and applying. Additionally, you may want to consider looking for scholarships that align with your interests or career goals, as these may be a better fit for you. Good luck with your scholarship search!
