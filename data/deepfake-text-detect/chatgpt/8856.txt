I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends , and so it was quite a surprise when I found out that all these little kids I know are using coffee as a substitute for tea. The reason going to Starbucks is not as satisfying though because all they do is put on ads and I don't really have anything else to add other than the occasional cup of espresso without asking for hot or cold water. That's just me though, I've never been an avid coffee drinker, so, while I'm sure I will enjoy at least one glass or two, I can't make up my mind about buying a full serving with the "just in case" option if it means having to open back up the windows and take out some of their hot chocolate. It seems so complicated, but honestly I would rather spend money on an old pair of Starbucks glasses than have to wait another day or two till they're working properly! I hope this explains why I am so obsessed with caffeine. (Perhaps it does.) The alternative is spending 10-15 on a couple hundred gallons of pure coffee, then not being able to go down that route again as soon as there's another cheap entry point to pour your cup into. For those who don't subscribe to either kind of logic, the only option they offer is to throw away the entire cup of raw milk and store it in the freezer before you even get home from work. My grandpa used to tell me about the coffee thing once he ended his career doing different things and getting drunk. He drank when he had enough money, he broke up one night with a girl on the way home one evening, and we'd buy him six different kinds of beans - one of which was called toasted green beans - while the next morning he drank one whole lot more. When he got up in the morning, his mother yelled something to him saying, "No. You should learn what is good enough for everyone." This didn't sound all bad until she saw me picking up two cans of red bean cobbler and a bag of condiments for dinner instead. She picked up one small piece of ground beef instead and said, "Come here." I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend because I figured she should have at least one beer with me, or because she knew I wouldn't drink anything myself. We still did our own thing, though. That's right, all three of us smoked together. So... whatever. Our parents quit smoking - they were both believers in the cause. Both of them became smokers themselves. In the end, they chose the former; they both thought all the wrong things happened to keep them members of the family from quitting. They weren't nearly as stupid as I was then though, because they realized no one cared that they kept smoking - they spent time together thinking, talking, laughing, crying, and sometimes really drinking too much. And that makes them even more awesome now! Besides, they're older men than I was anyway, so they could probably handle it better than most people. And, besides, it's not very logical to believe that someone who has been around longer than 10 years is suddenly a celebrity, especially when one thinks about how much healthier people are. Just look at Jeremy Clarkson, for example. Maybe not as popular as he was, but obviously more relevant today, and still something he's happily done. There's nothing like watching a comedian talk about something that's been around for over 50 years. But, of course, people whose careers have taken off around the world have gone nuts over it. Nah, they're an anomaly! So, let's start by saying that the internet scene isn't quite as big as it used to be. Back in 2008, I went to see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2. People were complaining about the lack of diversity in the movies, so I checked out the new film and found myself wanting to see who could pull off the acting and story lines best suited to the characters (though none of the female lead leads worked well). All of a sudden I understood that there was a lot of great stuff to see along with the focus on freedom. Yeah, even the little girls came into the picture! I felt pretty excited. As I walked through the theater trying to get the first few scenes loaded, I realised a few times that I wasn't looking forward to seeing the movie. Some people might have already seen it, but I have no idea where anyone's headed now. Why? Because they want everyone to feel safe and free from anxiety, and fear of what they'll experience afterwards. And those fears come largely from viewing what social media sites like Facebook and Twitter seem to be putting the brakes on.
