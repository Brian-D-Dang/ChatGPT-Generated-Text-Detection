Hello. For a long time now I've felt that there are many people in hospitals and psychiatric homes who will never be able to function independently and will never work, so to see them all working together has been really nice. I think it's amazing how everybody asks everyone what happened to them when they're not feeling well enough to even consider relying on the healthcare system for their own wellbeing!
