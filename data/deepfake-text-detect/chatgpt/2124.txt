Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same. His views on immigration would not only alienate large portions of your population (Mexicans are far from being universally pro-Trump), they're also entirely unrealistic and easily debunked by any half competent economist or political scientist. But remember: he isn't running for office in Mexico; instead this election will likely end up producing an even bigger joke - Enrique Pena Nieto. I don't mean to sound insulting when saying that you have no reason to expect much more out him than Donald Trump their economic policies seem so similar it might as well be one person with two names. And if past performance means anything, whatever does happen under them won't make too many headlines outside the country itself anyway.
