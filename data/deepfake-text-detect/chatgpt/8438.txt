There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man who walks into the female locker room wearing only his underpants? Or one that's been cut open by scissors?). I'm sure you can find somewhere else to shower if this bothers so much...and hey! When I was an athlete for many years there were lots more showers than change rooms at places like basketball gyms etc., because when people are sweating they tend toward hygiene issues.....so how would someone have any idea what another person wears?? You get my drift....????????
