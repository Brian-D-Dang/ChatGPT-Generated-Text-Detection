I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info:) Now, while I am sure that women are doing quite well in FFT, they don't get much attention either, and it's very difficult to be considered a 'woman' at all. The "women" in FIFA aren't always individuals but rather teams consisting of several gender players who compete together. They tend to have less organized schedules than men. This is definitely not a bad thing; women teams feel more positive about themselves and are likely to win matches with smaller numbers of female players.
