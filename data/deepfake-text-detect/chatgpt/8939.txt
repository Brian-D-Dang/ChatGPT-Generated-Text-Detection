There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: I'm not talking about the noises during his scenes in The Last Airbender where he fits right into that movie's theme song Not to mention it had him standing up and going'sexy'
