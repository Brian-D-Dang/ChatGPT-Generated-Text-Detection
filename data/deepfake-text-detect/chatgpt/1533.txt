Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if you did manage to get your MP3's onto such a device (I'd be interested to see what it looked like after decompression), they would take up too much space for an MP4 file; this is probably true whether or not there was any lossy compression involved. The point here is simply that none of them are going to play well on most modern players without considerable compression - most playback software supports at least some simple bit-rate scaling which will greatly reduce their size compared with their original files, but also generally strips away many of the more interesting bits if possible (and many are still just lossless). Even then, 10x compression isn't exactly "streaming" quality either... That said, perhaps someone can use one of these devices as a portable player? (Image credit: Digiarty) Digitarty Portable Player, 249 199 - Difficult to set-up There exists quite literally only three options when choosing between mobile audio streaming services, all of which do carry some reasonable price tags attached. The first two both sell products designed specifically around playing music. The third merely allows people who don't want anything else than mp3s to stream media from their phone straight into whatever portable player they happen to own. And yet somehow we find ourselves comparing the latter against its primary rival, since apparently 'everything' has gone down hill lately. It certainly seems strange that anyone would choose instead of those cheaper options, though the fact remains that digistory - by comparison - does at least offer something different. It's hard to say how successful the product really is until we learn about the way users actually interact with it however. Is it easy enough that novices could jump right in and start listening? Or does require some level of setup before merging your personal library into theirs? How long takes a song to download once it's uploaded to the unit? What sort of sync support does the system provide - does it keep track of what songs you've previously played back via Windows Media Player or is each individual album tracked separately manually? Does it stay connected to your smartphonetablet while using it as a remote control? Presumably, these questions matter less to serious audiophiles and more to everyday users looking for a smaller solution than having to schlep everything along with them everywhere they go... as opposed to pocketable speakers. However, given the nature of questions that might concern potential buyers, it feels worth finding out more details. Our biggest gripe thus far comes down to ubiquity alone. If you're an aspiring Android user, chances are good that you already know the existence of Google Play Music Streaming. That means you'll likely not need another service unless you decide to maintain multiple libraries. More importantly, it almost surely won't fail without you providing updates periodically rather than buying a new box every six months. Finally, unlike iPods, you shouldn't have trouble running several miles carrying the thing around with ease. With iTunes Match being available now alongside Apple Music, one doesn't necessarily need dozens of gigabytes of storage capacity anymore to store tens of thousands of tracks over time either, and if digitry continues working smoothly, we doubt there needs to be very much room left empty elsewhere anyway.
