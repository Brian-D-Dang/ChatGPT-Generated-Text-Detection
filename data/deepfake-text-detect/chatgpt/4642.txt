To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to also extend to gay ones. But this is a huge step for our country as it implies that we accept homosexuality as normal. For most of my life I've struggled with homosexuality - whether you'd consider me straight or gay is hard to say because I don't see myself any way different than anyone else, but I do find certain aspects about being hetero difficult while having an attraction towards other men (the more attractive they are the harder it gets). This has caused some problems at work since people assume its something wrong when really all I want is a little attention on occasion. It's gotten better over time though, and due to these recent events has increased even further. Personally, I view this whole thing as completely irrelevant, after all who am i? There aren't many hard and fast rules set by God regarding what one should like sexually so why would there be concerning his own son? And besides if Jesus was here today he probably wouldn't care either. So take pride out your closet, stop hiding behind those long term relationships and just live free! I think that we're taking things too far with this issue.. Our society needs to come together rather than divide itself into two categories... Both sides need to use common sense.... If she likes girls, then absolutely go get her a girlfriend. How does everyone feel about gay parents?? That would never fly...... Everyone seems to forget how much drama the black community goes through every day not letting someone decide IF THEY LIKE WOMEN OR MEN??? Why can't this continue to remain between them and their spouses or partners? We'll continue to reach points where no matter HOW SWEET THE WINE SOMETHING HAS TO BE MADE CERTAIN!! Somebody always thinks that they know best..... Until EVERYBODY comes to realize that WE ARE ALL EQUAL!!!!! While I agree with the general idea behind legalizing Gay Marriage, I believe it will bring negative consequences. Allowing gays and lesbians to "marry" means there will eventually be children born from homosexual unions; which will mean that public schools will have to educate LGBT students alongside heterosexuals. Schools already segregate based upon gender, race and class, so teaching kids that sexuality is divided along arbitrary lines would only cause trouble down the road. Also, saying homosexuals cannot marry would imply sexual activity outside of marriage must be considered sinful. When did society start believing sex within marriage was sacred? I don't recall seeing churches burning books written nearly 600 years ago calling it sin, so why treat modernization differently? I fear opening up this door may hurt us later. Don't give up freedoms you never had, instead fight for them. i dont understand all these conversations in light of the fact that i personally believe theres nothing immoral about gayness. ive seen plenty of evidence in history and various cultures around the world with such behavior and its proven that it doesnt lead to anything bad. i guess im stupid enought o beleve someones feelings match thier physical appearancebad!!!! but thats me idk. methinks ill stick to the conservative side i suppose. This is interesting. Like others said, I don't understand why America should make laws against something that isn't harming anybody...but still, whomever came up with the "9th Commandment" argument is cool with me. As a Christian, well, I won't comment on religious beliefs. To each his own. Well played, sir. A few questions: Would you allow polygamy under your law? Once again, I ask you to answer these. They are important to some folks...and honestly, I doubt anything good could result with polygamy anyway. You asked me what type of relationship I wanted to refer back to...so let me mention the obvious. Of course I love my wife very much, but we were both raised in large families. My family grew up loving, supporting and accepting gay loved ones. None of us ever thought it was weird or anything. Actually, quite opposite actually as we loved and supported our friends. And just recently, my brother got married to another man, who happens to be gay. Not sure if this is relevant but he is technically pregant just months before the wedding. This happened last year. Now, I haven't met him yet, obviously, but lets face facts right off....he doesn't look ANYTHING like his husband. He looks exactly like himself only older. The moral here might fall apart somewhat. But trust me when I tell yah...no homophobe would judge me or refuse my friendship otherwise. You mentioned monogamy as another "bargain." What bargain is being offered? Is intimacy a part of the deal? Are emotions involved? Do you wait until you know the person pretty well before getting intimate? What is the point of waiting? Willingness? Doesn" lots, however needed. redemptions varnoffentered thusly present most of them in
