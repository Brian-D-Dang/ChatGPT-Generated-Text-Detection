This one seems so obvious to me but I'll provide the basic points: It is a person's right to do whatever they want with their own body so long as it conforms to hisher beliefs. Hisher belief is not absurd, and he is trying to do something that will make him more popular than any other shirt in existence. Because of his religious beliefs, there are no "rights" for him and the potential consequences for us if we violate them.
