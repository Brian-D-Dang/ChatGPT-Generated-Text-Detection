The goods and services we consume are made possible by the abundance of cheap resources and labour that the west gets out of underdeveloped countries. The West has no reason to be concerned about resource depletion or labor exploitation because it does not directly affect their daily lives. However, this exploitation has resulted in significant social, economic, and environmental problems for developing nations. As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases, but it is important to recognize the consequences of global economic policies and consumption patterns. It is the responsibility of all nations and individuals to consider the impact of their actions on both local and global communities. Fair trade practices, responsible consumption, and sustainable development can help address these issues.
