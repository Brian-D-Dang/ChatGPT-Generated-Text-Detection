Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. Since I was born and raised on an island in Alaska, it doesn't surprise me that we have a long tradition of embracing tourism as part of our culture. The Alaskan tourist industry has grown tremendously over the last few years - this past summer alone saw record numbers for visitors from outside of state (1). In fact, according to the National Park Service website, by 2012 visitation will exceed 1 billion people [source]. This growth comes at great cost to both land owners who own grazing lands or forests, and business owners like restaurants and hotels. However, while there are many Alaskans who feel strongly about protecting their natural environment and way of life, Alaskans also seem to love taking advantage of what makes them unique: beautiful scenery and wildlife. There are hundreds of places where one may go hiking, fishing, camping out under a clear night sky, hunting bow-and-arrows, climbing glaciers, snow skiing, ice climbing and even exploring volcanoes all year round! With such outstanding recreational opportunities, travel agencies must play a vital role in bringing tourists into our communities with ease and convenience. What better place than Seward, AK? As soon as my family moved back here after college ended 4 years ago, I knew I wanted to open up a vacation rental property so I could stay local instead of having to commute hours away each weekend only going home when the weather got too cold. First, let me tell you how bad things were before they get good...I had no idea how difficult it would be just keeping up with rent payments every month which meant finding ways to pay off those large mortgage loans. It wasn't until September 2014 that I finally came across a listing on Airbnb. That moment changed everything. After becoming acquainted with the site, I realized the potential it held for small businesses across Alaska and immediately began looking around town for properties available. When I talked to some real estate agents who told me it takes 25k minimum down payment to buy single-family homes in Seward, I thought maybe that was a bit much considering I didn't intend on living anywhere permanently. But then I found someone selling his four bedroom ranch house in South Anchorage for 150K which made renting through Airbnbing pretty appealing. So far, my experience working with Joe Kimball Rentals has been amazing. He seems very well informed on what he offers, all rentals come fully furnished, and he provides renters insurance and damage waiver policies along with maintenance services. My son and daughter do most of the work themselves but help whenever possible. Every time I call asking questions, they always answer promptly and amicably. They never once pressured us to book anything within 24 hrs. Even though being able to offer families affordable housing options makes sense economically speaking, these days more and more first timers want the comforts associated with staying in modern hotel rooms rather than spending money on ramen noodles and sleeping bags during their travels. For example, what happened in Houston recently when Harvey hit hard enough to destroy apartment complexes and bring water inside units causing mold issues? Do travelers really need to worry about getting sick due to cleanliness standards falling short? Or what about the possibility of catching a bug from strangers shared accommodations? These risks should be mitigated without resorting to costly cancelation fees. All airbnb hosts take pride in offering their guests comfort and hospitality; sometimes we forget this is what drives guests to keep coming back again and again. A popular issue among prospective tenants lately is the lack of availability in certain areas because many landlords won't allow pets outright. We understand how important animals provide companionship in addition to adding variety to your daily routine for instance while traveling. If you don't mind sharing space with another person you might consider apartments or condos instead since several listings carry specific pet requirements ranging from non-smokers to senior citizens. While many travelers enjoy visiting the city centers of big metropolitan areas, others prefer smaller towns and rural settings. One day, I hope to find myself residing somewhere to make it easier for trips like mine to become a regular occurrence. Until then, I plan to continue making sure everyone else enjoys the goodness of Seward and surrounding area.
