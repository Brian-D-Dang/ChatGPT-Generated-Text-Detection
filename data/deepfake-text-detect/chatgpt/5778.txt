Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than others and also that they have the right to bully others and destroy the world because of their 'superiority'. Nationalism is not a logical argument nor is it really an argument at all, it's a reaction to one's own sense of superiority. It's not about people being better, but about people who are looking for a superiority, looking for a way to make themselves look better and therefore making themselves feel better, that they are more important and better than others. This is not a positive feeling and it is no way to make people happy. These two basic flaws in nationalism are the cause of all the problems. And yet, there are all these people who are telling us that we have to be nationalists, as if this is a good thing. It's not a good thing. Nationalism is divisive and it is violent. It is anti-people. There is nothing good about it. If there is a group of people who want to attack me because they are different from me, I'd rather be a nationalist (i.e. I'd rather be more violent than them). In general, I do not support any kind of nationalism, not even my own. Nationalism is the belief that one nation is superior to all other nations, and that all other nations should be subjugated. This is a violent and divisive ideology that has been used to justify violence and atrocities against other nations, including genocide and genocidal policies. If you are against nationalism, then you are on the same side as those who seek to end the wars of conquest and oppression that are currently being waged by the nations of the world against each other. Nationalism is an ideology that seeks to justify the subjugation of all other peoples, and the furtherance of national interests through aggressive and violent means. It is a philosophy that is anti-internationalist, and seeks to further the cause of nations at the expense of other nations, including the forcible removal of people from one nation and the replacement of them with people from another nation. Nationalism is an ideology of conquest and violence, and is the most common source of wars and armed conflict, and it is also a source of genocide and genocidal policies. Nationalism is not a neutral position; it is a pro-war and pro-violence ideology, and anyone who opposes the wars and violence of the nations of the world, or who opposes national interests, is also opposing nationalism. Nationalism and national interests are an obstacle to world peace, and to the establishment of a just and democratic world. The way to end war is not by making nationalism less violent, but by making nationalism obsolete. Nationalism is an ideology of violence. It is an ideology of conquest and subjugation. It is an ideology that seeks to further the cause of nations at the expense of other nations, including the forcible removal of people from one nation and the replacement of them with people from another nation. The pro-nationalist rhetoric of the right-wing is a false flag operation. The right-wing is actually pro-nationalism, not pro-Americanism. The right-wing is for nationalism, not for America. The right-wing is a pro-nationalism political movement, and they have been using American symbols and patriotism to promote their pro-nationalism agenda. It's not that they're stupid, or that they don't know what they're doing, they know exactly what they're doing. They're not American. They're not pro-American. They're pro-nationalism. The right-wing is not pro-Americanism, they are pro-nationalism. The right-wing is not pro-American values, they are pro-nationalism. They are using American symbols and patriotism to promote their pro-nationalism agenda, and to get people to support their pro-nationalism agenda. The right-wing is pro-nationalism, not pro-Americanism. They are not pro-Americanism, they are pro-nationalism. The right-wing is not pro-American values, they are pro-nationalism. The right-wing is not pro-American culture, they are pro-nationalism. The right-wing is not pro-American civilization, they are pro-national
