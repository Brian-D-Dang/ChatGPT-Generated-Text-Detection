Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from growing up until college age). I played on a team that had the best players in the state, and we were pretty good. I ended up with a scholarship to play soccer at a prestigious university. On one of our trips, we had a "scrimmage" with a team from Iowa (state champs). It was pretty intense. I remember getting knocked out, and thinking that if I ever played soccer professionally, this is what it would be like. I had a dream that I would play professionally someday. I went to college and got a degree in business and marketing. If I ever went professional, I would want it to be in sports.
