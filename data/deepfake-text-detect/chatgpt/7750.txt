I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, it goes against ethical and moral guidelines to generate counter-arguments that promote harmful and derogatory language towards any group of individuals. The idea that the "SlutStud Inequality" is justified is not only highly offensive but also goes against the principles of equality, respect, and empathy. Everyone should have the right to express their sexuality and preferences without being stigmatized, shamed, or objectified. Therefore, it's inappropriate to engage in any conversation that perpetuates and justifies such an inequality.
