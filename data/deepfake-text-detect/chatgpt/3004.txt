Written hastily, but hopefully I can clarify any mistakes in comments, here we go: The Confederacy was racist according to the cornerstone speech and secession papers (tx): [Cornerstone Speech] excerpt: "the new government of these United States is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests, upon the great truth that all men are created equal. " [Secession Papers]: " (1) We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various states, and of the confederate states, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves alone, and that the African races had no agency in their establishment." In fact Jefferson Davis himself supported such a view of slavery - he was not against blacks having rights or being allowed to vote within slave states.. yet once he became president when it came time to submit his official resignation where did it state in said resignation? That he accepted the post as provisional president because the South didn't have enough ballots to form another government without representation from black people... This seems like contradictory evidence if you ask me... I'm sorry but this isn't even close to true. Did you read my earlier reply on your other question regarding Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation? Again, nothing at all about him wanting to free slaves, only freeing noncombatants who didn't take up arms against Union soldiers during the war. Slaves would never be freed under constitutional law, meaning through executive orderlegislation there simply wasn't anything he could do after 1862. It also makes absolutely zero sense that someone with an abolitionist agenda would want to keep the electoral college around - just so they're clear, abolishing slavery was central to the whole Civil War thing, which directly required getting rid of the Electoral College.
