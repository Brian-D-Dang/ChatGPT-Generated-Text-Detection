Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by a belief in God or at least another supernatural being, if it has an effect on society as a whole. This should not come with any moral implications - the situation of the victims of those who committed genocide is exactly analogous to that of the current terrorist attacks on Western capitals. As we shall see later in this article, the U.S. government's official statements about the Robin Hood myth are false and biased; there is no truth behind them and the real story is much more complicated than they want us to believe. Most people think of religion as a safe refuge from certain kinds of pain, anxiety, violence, and persecution - but religious beliefs are not autonomous entities. They can be influenced by moral and ethical values (or lack thereof) held by other groups within your culture who also share these same values. Religious fundamentalism is an extreme example of this phenomenon: Islam is one of the great masterpieces of Islamic thought, which was developed over thousands of years under many different spiritual masters and led to countless generations of believers participating in various forms of following its teachings. However, despite all attempts to show humanity how unbelievable claims like "Jesus Christ rose from the dead, lived forever, except for the fact he came back to earth for our sins" really are, nothing about every single Muslim person believes it. It's just one group among millions that does. Most of their lives have been built around living according to Christian and Jewish rules (and subsequently follow the teachings of Abrahamic religions), so most Muslims do not know anything very new about this idea; however, some of them were born into these communities and that is why they now hold these views. Islam is the world's largest religious community based on one religion only, and they have a deep devotion towards Allah. If you want to find out what makes modern fundamentalist Christians tick, look no further than the United States and Canada in the last 50 years - both countries have become home to an unprecedented number of immigrants and refugees fleeing the Middle East, Africa and Asia in search of freedom and a better life. These former refugees used to be considered third-world slaves whose only hope for survival was in the hands of cruel slavemasters and foreign white men; instead, they took advantage of the governments in power during WWII and became rich and powerful citizens who had access to the best education institutions available, health care facilities, legal rights, and opportunities that American society could offer. In places where political leaders don't embrace democracy and free speech as strongly as they do in America, a religious minority such as Muslim immigrants saw things differently and felt compelled to act accordingly. The result of this happened through social movements, civil rights legislation, and even riots, and it created a massive backlash against Islam in the media, academia and politics. When politicians from conservative parties started chasing their own narrow agendas rather than offering solutions, the public opinion swung away from them and radical right wingers began becoming mainstream advocates for faith-based laws requiring special treatment for religious minorities. You probably already knew this, because most people would agree that 'Islamophobia' is a thing, although many are too afraid to admit that it exists. Whenever anyone mentions the word 'Islamophobic' to someone else, they immediately get defensive and argue that everyone who criticizes Islam deserves death. Well, unfortunately, that kind of mentality is completely wrong and will lead to more hate crimes, massacres and terror everywhere. Despite the fact that members of other religious denominations actually remain true to their message, criticism has become a common practice nowadays in order to separate the legitimate criticisms of their practices and doctrines from the ones made up jointly by the bigots who don't follow the tenets of their religion. For instance, after the 911 attacks, the critics of Islam often tried to show how Islam teaches unbelievers to commit murderous acts. They also showed how Islam encourages hatred between individuals without realizing that what they are doing actually puts others in danger. Some examples include claiming that Islam justifies Holocaust denial, or that Muslims encourage wars and ethnic cleansing. How do we deal with these accusations? We answer them by saying that they aren't true. Sometimes, we repeat ourselves until everyone sees what we're trying to tell them, and then we move on to the next topic. Regardless of whether these accusations sound like mental disorders or mental disabilities, they are simply untrue facts and cannot possibly justify the actions that the author condemns. We will study the history of conspiracy theories in a future article and provide proof that this is absolutely true.
