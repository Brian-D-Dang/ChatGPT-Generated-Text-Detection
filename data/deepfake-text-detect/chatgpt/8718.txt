So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal , 2: If the enemy has us at full health (besides yourself) they are not on our side in any way shape or form. 3: The primary aim of firing missiles is to target an enemy base that we know exactly where the missile is coming from. 4: We need to be prepared for war (particularly when we're at the frontlines). 56: The enemy can kill us before the initial attack. The point I am trying to make is that if you are planning to launch more than one attack at the same time, then that means you will get close enough to destroy every single piece of armor in your reach. But that means 1,2,3,4,5 missiles are going to hit every single body of armor you have within your range while simultaneously killing each other. So even if you were protecting all of your weapons, none would really be able to do much against your current positions. This is why I think it is important to keep the players engaged as long as possible so that your team can also focus on attacking as soon as possible. In contrast, if you leave too many shields up after you completely shut them down, then you may lose them sooner rather than later. Plus, I figure if you don't leave enough shields up, then you may end up losing valuable targets as well. And these issues are compounded by the fact that many guilds (players who normally play together and utilize this system) simply won't take multiplayer seriously until they see that there is no compulsive disregard for human survival. Which is actually quite good news for the game and the community overall because the only team members not making sense regarding the situation aren't really paying attention either. They just want to enjoy playing rather than dealing with the consequences. I guess the problem lies in how many are leaving high calibers around the world, but since I assume the majority are focused on defending themselves at home and that some of these people are using this as an excuse to continue raiding instead of spending money on raid gear, what should we do? Personally I think we should try and keep it as simple as possible, and we shouldn't really care whether you are raiding or not. But if we turn the tables to strengthen the team balance simply because the player base seems to be getting tired of being constantly bombarded with messages asking "How does your guild work?" because the game is just a lonely place without a real dedicated dedicated group, then maybe that's something we should push further into. That said, I wouldn't say that we should abandon anything else. Sometimes the community feels like it needs to step back from its own interests. The best thing I could suggest is to implement a 'raid-style' server on top of a clan-based clan system which allows you to choose which groups you want to join and what level you want to go up. You may want to consider creating a community that extends beyond this particular set of servers, as well. This might provide a safe environment for people to discuss group content and go through the process of finding groups (or not) that fit their criteria. Or create events that allow you to send out invites to specific factions to help push the game along. There are still lots of things to think about though - especially for those who aren't active in this arena yet. And that brings me to another question. Why don't you guys play PvP? Sure, it's the most popular way to play but I feel like we must be careful not to throw away the great buzz that comes with PvP, besides giving the playerbase a chance to expand their horizons and experience new worlds for themselves. Do you guys mind sharing some information on how this process works and what kind of games you've been talking about? Also, thanks again! Matthew, you showed me that there's a whole world of MMOs which I haven't found yet. Thanks for the motivation to start digging into it:) All in all, this is a very interesting tactic. When we are doing raids with 8 or fewer nodes I wonder if we are actually completely knocked off the map. Or if we're lucky enough to score a bit of loot or have enough skills to finish the job properly right away.
