The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested for it, and police officers will get reports at a much lower rate than is recognised by parents of children raped. It would have been better if we could save the police money 'to help women' rather than head off gang rape or drug trafficking which already has an impact on thousands of vulnerable people. It's time to make change. Clinique de Lohan
