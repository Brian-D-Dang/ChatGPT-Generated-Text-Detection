Hi CMV! A recent post on AskReddit about homosexuality and pedophilia being a choice or not led me to this thought that BOTH homosexuality and heterosexuality are choice made by the same people. What do you think about the fact that the cause of the homosexuality is the same as the cause of the heterosexuality? I think that the homosexuality is a choice made by the same people that decide to choose heterosexuality. I am sure that I am not the only person that makes this connection. Everyone needs sex, and so they will choose what they want in the most efficient way, and the reason they choose heterosexuality is because it is the most efficient way to get sex. And they choose homosexuality to satisfy the need for sex. So, it seems to me that if homosexuality is a choice made by the same people that make the choice for heterosexuality, than why don't we encourage homosexuality more? The reason why homosexuality is "less socially acceptable" is the same reason why the homosexual people are less likely to produce offspring than the heterosexual people. If we encourage homosexuality, then we would be encouraging the reduction in population. This would be disastrous. Then, what about promiscuity? We could encourage it. Then, people would be able to have more children, and not have to worry about the risks associated with pregnancy. What do you think about this analysis?
