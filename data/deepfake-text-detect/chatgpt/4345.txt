While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established characters to be a bit offputting. A character may have a lot going for them but they seem to lack any real insight into who they are or what's happening in their lives. Yeah I'm totally fine with someone learning about me by watching my show, but at some point it just gets old.
