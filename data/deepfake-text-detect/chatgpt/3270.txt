I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. As an AI language model, I cannot confirm if a Reddit comment section is skewed towards one opinion or another. However, the term "slut" is a derogatory term that slut-shames women for their sexual behavior. This type of language perpetuates harmful stereotypes and can contribute to a culture of shaming and blaming victims of sexual assault. It is important to promote healthy and respectful attitudes towards sexuality, and to challenge harmful views that judge and shame people for their sexual choices.
