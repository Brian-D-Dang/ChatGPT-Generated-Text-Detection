While it may feel like returning to "normal" is impossible after an existential crisis, it's important to remember that this crisis is actually an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. The process of questioning one's existence and purpose can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself and ultimately provide direction for personal growth. While it may not be possible to return to the exact same state of being as before the crisis, it is possible to create a new and improved normal that incorporates the lessons learned from this experience. It may take time and effort, but with the right mindset and support, it's possible to move forward and find a new sense of purpose and fulfillment in life.
