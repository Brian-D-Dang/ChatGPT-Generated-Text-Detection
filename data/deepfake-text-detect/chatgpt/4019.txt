The idea is not to infringe on anyone's right to express themselves. If someone wants to have and film adult consenting adults having sex then they are free to do so, as long as it doesn't interfere in the normal operation of society or any other people. If this were a true statement... The internet would be filled with porn sites featuring everything from nudes and breast milk (yes I know its against some rules) to rape videos and actual crimes listed, on every website you go to! Theres no way that would be allowed under the law.
