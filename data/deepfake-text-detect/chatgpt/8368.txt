First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean it's okay to parody everything in sight just because we can do whatever the hells else - which is essentially what these people are doing by turning every movie into some variation of porn; even when there isn't anything erotic going on at any point (just look how ridiculous this one gets for example). A lot more than sex sells nowadays so you would think someone should have had an idea before releasing such trash but apparently no-one did - save perhaps those involved who made their money out from them regardless... or maybe thought "Hey! This way my wife will get horny again!" Anyway yes lets laugh about our sexuality like its something only fit subjects mattering between consentual adults without beauty standardsfetishes being objectified as well...
