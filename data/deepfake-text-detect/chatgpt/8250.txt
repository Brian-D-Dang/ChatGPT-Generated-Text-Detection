Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting people up or telling them that they're wrong - at least when it comes from someone who is genuinely trying in good faith read the questionanswer carefully (which doesn't seem true here). I have experience as an employee of multiple startups where employees were given equity "in lieu" for cash compensation due reasons such yours being listed above some others which are less common but can also be relevant: - company didn't yet qualify under external investors meaning not profitable enough; (e) need capital growth potential over next 5 years - goal was about 13M -25m It's entirely possible your startup just needs time extra money if things aren' working right now? You might want more input on how much work its going take before knowing whether these challenges will lead toward success OR failure... Take my advice though since there has been lotsa VCs funding companies because their founders had successful previous exits so unless absolutely necessary don " buy into any excuses thrown around by lazy entrepreneurs!
