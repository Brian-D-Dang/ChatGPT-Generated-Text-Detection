That statement is a common misconception and is not accurate. Gender identity is a personal and subjective experience, and just because a person may have been assigned a certain gender at birth, it does not mean that it accurately reflects their internal sense of self. Transgender individuals often go through a journey of self-discovery and may transition physically, socially, andor legally to align with their gender identity. It is important to respect and recognize a person's gender identity, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth. To say that they are still "technically" their original gender is dismissive and undermines their lived experiences. It is crucial to support and uplift the transgender community by validating their identities and providing equal rights and protections.
