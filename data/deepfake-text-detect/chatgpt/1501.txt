[This article] does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article] that lays out some of its arguments, which are also fairly persuasive to me but could be in error.) The point here is not so much about whether or not we should expect an increase in global employment after a recession (though clearly there will be), it's where these countries would land if they had no growth at all over time and were stuck with their current unemployment rate: In the absence of any sustained improvement in economic conditions, South Africa likely faces higher levels of long-term unemployment than most other middle income African economies as well as subSaharan Africa more generally; South Africa has already achieved many of the worst outcomes of reducing youth unemployment among middle -income African economies and now faces significant challenges trying to reverse this trend... This reality means that each year, substantial investment must be made on the education sector, especially retraining programmes aimed specifically towards blue collar jobs within industries such as construction. Our efforts can make meaningful contributions toward ending child labour and stunting as well as providing access to quality primary health care services across communities throughout our nation. The government may need additional resources beyond debt reduction if we want to address the remaining issues associated with persistent high rates of poverty, inequality and exclusion from national development projects affecting our country. We have been losing ground since 1994 when then President Nelson Mandela embarked upon his 'Rainbow Nation' rhetoric and promises of greater inclusion based social justice - gains that many initially hoped to see continue to materialise by 2010. That's quite sobering stuff. While unemployment remains so very high in many parts of the world, there seems little sign yet that either local governments or international donors know what to do next (or even how to start). Instead there seem to be increasing demands - often illusory ones, given gaps between theory and practice - for stimulus packages like the one proposed here recently by David Cameron's UK Conservative Party. The US Presidential race looks to provide us with similar clarifications soon enough - look forward to hearing your thoughts below!
