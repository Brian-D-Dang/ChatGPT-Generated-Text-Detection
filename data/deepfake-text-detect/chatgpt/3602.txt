I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think you have a valid point. In scientific methodology, the uniformity of nature is not taken as an absolute truth, but as a working assumption or a tentative hypothesis. Scientists assume that the natural laws and principles that govern our universe today have also been in operation throughout history and will continue to do so in the future unless there is substantial evidence to prove otherwise. This assumption is based on the principle of induction, which states that past experiences and observations can provide a basis for making predictions about future events. However, scientists acknowledge that this principle may not always hold true and that new evidence or phenomena could challenge their assumptions. Therefore, they constantly test and revise their hypotheses based on new data and observations.
