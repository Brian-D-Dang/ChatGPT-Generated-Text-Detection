Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from a rec team) so I am not as familiar with other sports. CMV: Sports provide an important outlet for children and adults alike to stay active, develop physical and mental strength, cultivate teamwork skills, and have fun. Participating in any sport, whether competitive or recreational, can be beneficial for children and adults of all ages.
