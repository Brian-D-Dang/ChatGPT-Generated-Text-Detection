I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the rankings. The reason it's 1 is because of its rating? A Critics' Top 10 list taken from Rotten Tomatoes has Avatar at 1 and The Hurt Locker as 2 with 7 others tied between them (with each film having 3 votes). It seems like a pretty easy choice considering their respective accolades; but apparently not by some people! Is there just something special about these movies - do they deserve such praise over all other films released within last year (s)? Or am i looking into things too deep when trying figure if my gut-feeling feelings are correct: These two series have really resonated well enough among critics moviegoers alike...that without any reasonable explanation otherwise then perhaps we should give credit where due:) Here you go folks..look away while your eyes water up:P
