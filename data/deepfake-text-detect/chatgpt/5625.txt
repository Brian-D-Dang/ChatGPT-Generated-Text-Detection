In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn't work that way. Fortunately, there are several books that cover this subject, most with a lot of pictures (and usually a few words). There's one that I have that I use for jigsaw puzzles as well, but I haven't seen it available online. The only problem with books like these is that they often don't have the colors in the right order (like a real puzzle). You can usually tell what the colors should be, and often there's a list of colors somewhere, but this really doesn't help much. The solution that I've found that works very well is to take a sheet of 8.5 x 11 paper, and cut it into 9 or 10 strips. If you're using a puzzle that's 1000 pieces, then you should get 9 strips. If you're using a puzzle with 3000 pieces, then you'll need 10 strips. It works like this - put one of the strips on the table, and put the 1st piece of the puzzle on it. If the first piece is a red one, then put a red strip on the table. If it's a green one, put a green strip on the table, and so on. When you're done, you'll have all the colors for that puzzle in the right place, and you'll have a sheet of paper that will double as a cheat sheet, just in case you lose the book. Anytime you're solving a puzzle, take a few seconds to make sure that you're putting the pieces in the right place. It doesn't take much longer than trying to figure out later where the pieces are supposed to go, and it will save you a lot of frustration. The same principle applies to jigsaw puzzles, though in this case, you'll need a different cheat sheet. It's easy to tell what color goes where, and it's easy to put the pieces in the right place. If you have a puzzle that you're really having trouble with, go to the store and buy the box. You'll be able to see the picture (and the colors) and it will be a lot easier to figure out what you're doing. When you're done with the puzzle, take a couple of minutes to study it. If you're going to be doing a lot of jigsaw puzzles, put them in a box that you can take apart, and put them back together. It's a good idea to have a couple of boxes for puzzles that you're going to put together, and another box for puzzles that you're going to take apart. The colors on the puzzle pieces may not be exactly the same as the ones on the box, but they're close enough to allow you to figure out the right order. If you really want to get into solving jigsaw puzzles, then buy a book or two (or three) that covers the subject. There's nothing like having a book that tells you what pieces go where, and gives you some ideas for solving the puzzle. They're really inexpensive, and they can help you to get through the more difficult puzzles. The problem with jigsaw puzzles is that once you've put them together, you'll have to take them apart again. The solution is to keep the puzzle in a box that you can take apart, and put back together. If you're not sure about a piece, pull it out and put it in a safe place. If you're not sure about it later, you can always put it back. A couple of weeks ago, my wife and I were visiting my mother-in-law, and she had a few jigsaw puzzles sitting on the dining room table. I had a few minutes to kill, so I picked up one of them. This was not a 1000 piece puzzle, but it was a 3000 piece one. I didn't know how to do it, and I was pretty sure that I was going to mess it up. After a little bit of trial and error, I started to figure out what the pieces were. About 20 minutes later, the whole puzzle was together, and I was thinking about putting it back on the dining room table. My mother-in-law was impressed, and my wife was happy that I was able to put it together so
