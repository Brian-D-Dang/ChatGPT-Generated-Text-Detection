While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established people to be a bit insulting. Does everyone have their own opinions? Sure they do! But if it's clear someone has more experience in something than me then why shouldn't I accept some basic level of courtesy from them without having been able to prove myself first? I don't think anyone is suggesting you either deserve or need this kind of treatment just for being young (or old). If anything my point was about how younger generations are often treated by older ones who give way too much credence on credentials instead of results; which can lead to unfair criticism.
