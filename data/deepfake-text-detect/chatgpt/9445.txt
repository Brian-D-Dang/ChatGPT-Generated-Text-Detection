You may have seen news that BlackLivesMatter protesters interrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Seattle. I think this was wrong to do, because he has fought for civil rights Bernie Sanders campaign event. Bernie Sanders is a politician, who has fought for civil rights for many years, he has fought for civil rights, and is a real supporter of Bernie Sanders. This is wrong to do, because he has fought for civil rights, so he is no longer doing it.
