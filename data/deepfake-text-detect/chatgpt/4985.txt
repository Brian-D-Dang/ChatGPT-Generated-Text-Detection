I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most definitely something that you want because it's so expensive compared to other brands but you have to buy all over the world for any large scale product purchases (for example there are many brands out there). Oh wow thats dope! Thanks!
