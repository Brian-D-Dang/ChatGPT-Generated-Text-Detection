What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy we want to keep alive - which is precisely why the original ethical issues of human reproduction were considered taboo in ancient times since it was a reflection on the injustice that might arise from conceiving children without consent or bringing them into this world with bad intentions. I agree entirely... but what if my idea is better? And I am willing to give up all these political implications for the sake of science? What do you think I should do then? Is there any other way than writing it down somewhere? A good example of this has been the invention of the airplane. Or the atomic bomb. The technology had to be refined to fit our needs, so we could enjoy a life free from war, famine, disease or poverty. We also knew that when future generations looked at us they would ask "where did you get your ideas?" In addition, technological advances can come with political implications too: it's possible that public health will continue to deteriorate because of development in the first world while developing countries suffer from pollution and increasing infant mortality rates, so people start believing medical research is biased. It's also possible that environmental improvements won't happen if we don't keep expanding our citiesurban areas, causing more problems later. Not every solution can make everyone happy but we have discovered that even little changes like building more tall buildings cause significant effects on air quality and urban growth rate. Does anyone else see a connection here...?
