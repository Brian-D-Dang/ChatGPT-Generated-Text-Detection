I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If we are given the gift, by our creator (God) why should he give us anything more? Technically speaking God is supposed to be omniscient and omnipresent so if god gave you something that means his knowledge was limitedhidden in some way...
