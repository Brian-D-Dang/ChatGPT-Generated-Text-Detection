To clarify my title I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable unless the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, or the child is the product of sexual abuse by someone else. That said, I've heard a lot about this issue and in some cases it's quite common and has been documented for decades. Even people who have abortions don't think "having an abortion does not constitute rape" because they believe its caused by menopause, ovulation.
