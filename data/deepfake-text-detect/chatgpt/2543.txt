Alright, so, I was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while I am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, I figured I'd ask you guys what would be the most meaningful change we could make? Frankly, I'm not sure how much weight there is in "best" as opposed to being interesting. I took out best all-around player as well just because that doesn't really carry any meaning anymore with the new scoring system.
