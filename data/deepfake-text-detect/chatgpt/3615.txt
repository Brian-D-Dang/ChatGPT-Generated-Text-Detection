Sorry, this is mostly applicable to folks from the US, but feel free to weigh in no matter what. I'll bullet-point for my reasoning: More good folks are killed via violence in the US than in many other developed countries, and this is often facilitated by the relatively easy access to firearms. Additionally, the US has a disproportionately high rate of mass shootings compared to other countries. Many people, especially victims of gun violence and their loved ones, believe that stricter gun control laws could reduce the number of deaths and injuries caused by firearms. Proponents of gun rights, however, argue that the Second Amendment to the US Constitution protects their right to own guns and that stricter gun control laws only harm law-abiding citizens, leaving them unable to protect themselves. The issue is highly divisive, but it is important to remember that there are ways to compromise and find a solution that ensures gun safety while also respecting individual rights.
