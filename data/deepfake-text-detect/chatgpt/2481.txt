I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that they should be able to wear whatever they want without having it make them a target. What I don't understand is how this is the same issue at all because one side wants women to have control over what happens to their bodies while still being safe from violent crime (and rightfully so) whereas the other just thinks that leggings are sluttydistracting etc which seems rather mean spirited...
