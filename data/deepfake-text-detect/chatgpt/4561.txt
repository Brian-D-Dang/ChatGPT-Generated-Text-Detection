I think it is the opinion of many people on the internet, and of reddit in particular that the companies trying to fight piracy should "Deal with it" that they are engaging in a war against all those who do not want their content pirated. But I feel like we need a new approach here... why does this matter? Why now? Why even pirate things if you can buy them legally or for free elsewhere? Even overseas (assuming your product is available there).. You mean actually paying money for something when you have multiple ways to get it? People don't seem to understand how stupid our copyright laws really are.... If one could still watch movies from England without going outside at night because of those crazy blackouts then EVERYONE would be an MPA..... Seriously? It's just ridiculous right now! In my country getting caught downloading copyrighted material results in 3 years prison sentence fine. And any company wanting to protect their work has full legal rights to do so. We also enforce these rules very heavily. So MPAARIAA etc simply go and find another country where things are different... Hell, China allows anyone to download anything unrestricted as long as its only ONE copy per person.... Its total hypocrisy. So what gives us the absolute privilege to steal other peoples' hard earned creations, if you didn't make it yourself?! Perhaps some kind soul gave you permission to use it, but unless you went through a lot of trouble to see it was taken without permission, perhaps someone stole it from you first. Maybe it is morally wrong to take and distribute something which isn't yours freely; however I'm sure most people aren't bothered by seeing a movie alongside other products being sold on the shelf, a song being played over the radio, nor do they consider stealing music as immoral - they know better. Most industries, except perhaps advertising agencies, have determined their own pricing models without much government interference, although political pressure may occasionally help sway distribution patterns (eg: DVD rentals). The Internet exists because of its potential capacity to unite a global network of computers and communicate data instantaneously around the world yet despite this huge technological leap forward, we continue to keep many countries separate due to archaic notions of national sovereignty that were formed before the advent of modern communication systems. Does anybody realize that the ONLY reason we even have such silly ideas about file sharing vs. theft anymore is because old media firms made themselves rich off of it? They successfully bankrupted record labels under false pretenses until they had no choice BUT to create this fake victimhood mentality...in order to save their profits. Do you think Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo et al ever intended to pay artists royalties when they bought out the copyrights in games? Of course not, that'd kill their business model, wouldn't it? Nowadays, everyone knows that infringement is rampant literally millions upon millions every year. Millions of dollars worth of intellectual property stolen every day, billions each month. Yet corporate cultures across America remain unchanged. Nobody wants to rock the boat, nobody likes change. As soon as somebody challenges that status quo, that's when people show up en masse to defend those same outdated beliefs. That's BULLSHIT. We must recognize reality instead of clutching onto antiquated ideals blindly ignoring what's happening RIGHT NOW today, while creating plans for tomorrow that will never come true. Then again, I guess that's exactly what capitalism IS. What else could it possibly be? However would you argue that it works rather than fails? There are always two sides to everything. Piracy is part of human nature; fighting it will certainly leave a bad taste in everybody's mouth somewhere down the line. But beyond economic rights, the moral argument is important too - whoever owns stuff, doesn't control it. If a group of individuals decides to give away something personally-owned, they endow others with an ethical responsibility to respect their wishes. No group of individuals has the authority to force others to accept their decisions. By "respecting voluntary agreements" means having no intention to interfere with them either. This concept applies in nature, too - if lions decide to share milk with cheetahs, doesn't mean humans have any obligation to comply. Ultimately, morality lies within individual choices, but society helps shape those choices - both positively and negatively. Societies are built upon common values, social contracts, traditions, shared norms, agreed conventions, mutual trust... Not all societies offer equal protection to institutions that promote equality. For example, few states in Latin American continent provide high levels of protection to indigenous populations whose lands they've expropriated. A perfect example would be Bolivia, whose Constitution explicitly recognises Indians as citizens, yet exerts considerable effort towards maintaining policies that marginalise them further. Morality depends entirely upon circumstances and context. Pirates certainly enjoy considerable freedom nowadays, but their actions might provoke strong disapproval back home. An identical circumstance could bring completely opposite reactions: public outcry and police action in Sweden would probably cause greater alarm among international press than Swedish pirates doing similar thing. Pirate activity might provoke outrage in India, whereas the last time occurred. Poor performance ended up generating event. The past liability-free revenues throughout
