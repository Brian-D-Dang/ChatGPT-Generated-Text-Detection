In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they are not consenting is considered a form of sexual assault. This means that any type of sexual contact without the other person's explicit and informed consent is illegal. This includes rape, sexual harassment, unwanted touching, and even voyeurism. In order to prevent sexual assault from occurring, it is important for everyone to be aware of their own boundaries and to respect the boundaries of others. This means understanding what kind of physical contact is appropriate in different situations and respecting someone's decision if they do not want to engage in any type of sexual activity. It also means being aware of the signs of non-consent and understanding that no one should ever feel pressured into engaging in sexual activities against their will. If someone does experience sexual assault, it is important that they are given the opportunity to seek help and support. This can involve reporting the incident to the police andor speaking with a counsellor or therapist. It is also important that victims are believed and supported rather than judged or blamed. It is never the victim's fault when they are sexually assaulted and they should never be made to feel guilty or ashamed. Overall, it is essential that we all take responsibility for preventing sexual assault by understanding our own boundaries and respecting those of others.
