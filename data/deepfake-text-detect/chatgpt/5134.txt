Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who deserves death threats and death penalty. I mean it sounds like you're being an idiot? I'm surprised you feel the need to defend Batman because reasons. No shit! Batman isn't murderers or bullies nor is he a hero. He kills all the time for personal gratification. Batman does not have any kind of collective guilt or guilt towards anyone in Gotham city alone? How about you do explain that? Batman doesn't kill anyone who crosses his path unless there are specialist villains surrounding him
