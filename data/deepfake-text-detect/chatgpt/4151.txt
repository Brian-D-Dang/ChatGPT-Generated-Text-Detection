I've been pursuing a lot of scholarships and one of the things that irritate me is that there are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my GPA, so I'm wondering if anyone knows why these scholarships aren't awarded? My university has some strict requirements. You have to be accepted (through a scholarship or private pay) by an approved institution in order for you to get it. There's also a thing called "being selected" which means they will accept all applications but only those who don't pass their coursework will be considered.
