I am a 23 year old male Indian American male. I have never held hands with a girl, been kissed, or obviously had sex. I have never even asked someone out on a date and in my stupid little mind it seems that what everyone has is just the way things are It's not so much that everyone has this problem as "a lot of people," which means you're at least somewhat unique!
