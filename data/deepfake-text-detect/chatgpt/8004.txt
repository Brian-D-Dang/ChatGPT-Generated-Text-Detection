While shaming, shunning, and exile could be perceived as alternatives to prison, they ultimately carry their own set of harmful consequences. Shaming and shunning rely on the inherent desire for social acceptance and can override an individual's sense of self-worth. Exile can lead to complete separation from one's community, including family and friends, and may result in economic and social instability. These alternative methods may also lack any form of rehabilitation or restorative justice, leaving the offender with no opportunity for personal growth, education, or any form of redemption. Therefore, relying on shaming, shunning, and exile as a substitute for the prison-industrial complex, does not guarantee a solution to the issue at hand, and can do more harm than good.
