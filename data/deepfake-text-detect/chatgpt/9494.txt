First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised. Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, I do remember being hit by a hand from across the room. I remember being hit by a hand from the side of the room, and being hit by a hand from the left side of the room. Those are the three components necessary to successfully writing a blog post, but I am sure that they are not the only elements needed.
