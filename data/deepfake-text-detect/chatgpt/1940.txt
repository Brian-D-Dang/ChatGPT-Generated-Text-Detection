One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? I can't speak for all fields but when people are paying 6 figures to go into medicine and law it means nothing compared to doing so with little debt. As far as graduates not being able to get jobs or pay off loans they pretty much have no choice in either matter
