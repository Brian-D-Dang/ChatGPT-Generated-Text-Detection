Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move away from it and go back to something more reasonable. It's not like they were executing an innocent person they didn't know was going to die in their hands. It's like they don't care if it gets a death sentence or not.
