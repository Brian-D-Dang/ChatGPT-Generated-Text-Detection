growing up in america I was condition to believe women's breast are sexual organs do to the fact that we over sexualized them too much. it wasnt till recently that i got offended by showing nipples at no fault of theirs and even on tv nowadays there is way more nudity than before, when a woman removes her shirt she shows breasts so having you guys not see through these would be unfair There were other times where Rihanna had said things about how if people saw naked pictures or videos then they should just kill themselves because nothing could make anyone feel good seeing something like this especially since its dark (obviously for some reason ppl think nude picsvideos can't show anything). So saying stuff along those lines seems hypocritical now doesn't? It doesnt seem fair either why cant someone complain "hey yeah ive seen porn but im still gonna watch" instead everyone has been telling me men don;' t have sex with their friends girlfriends etc lol
