There are several reasons why this opinion is narrow-minded and invalid. Firstly, individuals have the right to identify and express themselves in whichever way they feel most comfortable. Gender identity is an integral part of a person's sense of self and denying them the freedom to identify as their true selves can severely impact their mental health and well-being. Secondly, the misconception that gender is a binary concept is outdated and has been disproven by scientific research. Gender is a spectrum and individuals can fall anywhere within that spectrum. Therefore, it is wrong to limit someone's identity based solely on their biological sex. Lastly, denying individuals the option to change their gender is a violation of their basic human rights. It is discriminatory to limit someone's freedom of expression and choice based on their gender identity. It is important to create a world where people are free to be themselves, and denying them the option to change their gender goes against that vision.
