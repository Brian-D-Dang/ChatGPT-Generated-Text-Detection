It's not accurate to say that saggy pants are only tolerated because of "white guilt." This opinion ignores the fact that many people of different races, backgrounds, and ages also find saggy pants inappropriate and unprofessional. In many workplaces, schools, and public spaces, there are dress codes that prohibit wearing saggy pants or other clothing items that may be deemed too revealing or sloppy. Such dress codes are enforced to ensure a level of decorum and respect for oneself and others. Additionally, many parents and community leaders have spoken out against saggy pants and have urged young people to dress more respectfully. Therefore, it's not fair to place the blame on any one group or emotion for this controversial fashion trend.
