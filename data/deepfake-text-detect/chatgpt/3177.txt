It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing to keep in mind is that China's rise is also accompanied by significant advancements in technology and innovation, particularly in fields like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and clean energy. China has put a lot of effort into developing these cutting-edge technologies, and this will likely have important implications for how the world functions in the coming years. Furthermore, China has also made significant strides in areas like education and culture, with Chinese universities now regularly placing among the world's top academic institutions and Chinese culture having an increasingly prominent role in the world's artistic and entertainment sectors. All of these developments will likely shape the future of China's global influence and soft power.
