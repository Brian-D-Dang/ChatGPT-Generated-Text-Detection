Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if we end up with a population boom it will take a century to reach the numbers the Earth can support. That's because, as Bob C mentioned, the world can sustain a population of 100 billion without the need for any new technology. The problem is that our population is set to peak in 2050 at 8 billion. The question becomes, will it go back down, or will it continue to grow? My sources, as well as many others, are quick to point out that the population will not continue to grow. It will, instead, level out at around 10 billion, and start to go back down. But the data and graphs I have seen all indicate this will take centuries. For instance, look at this graph from my first source. All of the graphs I've seen indicate that we will see a leveling off around 2060. My question is, why does it take so long? The reasons I've heard are: Fertility rates are not set in stone, and will come down on their own The population will be more evenly distributed People will have more children only when they can afford it People will live longer, and have fewer children But I don't see how any of these can really affect the situation. I'm not a demographer, but it seems to me that fertility rates are pretty well set. I've seen no evidence that they will change in the short term. I've seen no evidence that the population will be more evenly distributed in the short term. I've seen no evidence that the population will only have more children when they can afford it. I've seen no evidence that the world's population will not continue to grow until it reaches a level where it can sustain itself. And I've seen no evidence that the world's population will not continue to grow until it reaches a level where it can sustain itself. But what I am seeing is that the world population will continue to grow until it reaches a level where it can sustain itself, and it will take centuries to do so. The only way this can change is if we get hit by a major catastrophe. What I'd really like to know is, how long will it take until we reach the sustainable population level. I think that this question is extremely important. I believe that it is the only question that really matters. If we are facing an imminent catastrophe because we are not going to reach the sustainable population level in time, then everything else is irrelevant. If we are not facing an imminent catastrophe, then everything else is irrelevant. But the question, the only question, I am asking is: "How long will it take until we reach the sustainable population level?" I am not asking any other questions. I am not asking, "How many people are going to starve to death?" I am not asking, "What is the name of the planet we are on?" I am not asking, "What are the names of the people who are going to die?" I am not asking, "How many people are going to die?" I am not asking, "What can be done to prevent this from happening?" I am not asking, "What is the best way to reduce the population?" I am not asking, "What is the best way to increase the population?" I am not asking, "How many people can the Earth support?" I am not asking, "What is the best way to make sure that the Earth can support 10 billion people?" I am not asking, "What is the best way to make sure that the Earth can support 1 billion people?" I am not asking, "What is the best way to make sure that the Earth can support 2 billion people?" I am not asking, "What is the best way to make sure that the Earth can support 5 billion people?" I am not asking, "What is the best way to make sure that the Earth can support 10 billion people?" I am not asking, "What is the best way to make sure that the Earth can support 20 billion people?" I am not asking, "What is the best way to make sure that the Earth can support 50 billion people?" I am not asking, "What is the best way to make sure that the Earth can support 100 billion people?" I am not asking, "What is the best way to make sure that the Earth can support 200 billion people
