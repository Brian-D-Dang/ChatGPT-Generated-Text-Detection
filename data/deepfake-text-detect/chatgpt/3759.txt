Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and are obsessed with their religion which they believe must be taught in every school at least once per day for all students. For some reason they think that this will take down the government because it's really stupid... Person B lived there until he was 18, came home on leave, started working at McDonalds, and promptly got fired but quickly found another job that paid significantly more than his first job just weeks before. Now he lives with his parents who have no idea why he works so much when he could be studying or taking parenting classes or anything else useful instead of spending all his time thinking about how important god is. In short: the person who laid out the scenario has a point.
