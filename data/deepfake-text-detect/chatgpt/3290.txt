Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. That is correct. The regulatory framework in the United States does not allow foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. This is known as the cabotage rule. The rule is in place to protect the domestic airlines, their workforce, and the national security interests of the United States. However, some experts argue that rethinking the cabotage rule could lead to increased competition, lower prices for consumers, and could benefit the airline industry as a whole.
