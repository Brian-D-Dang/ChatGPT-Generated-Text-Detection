I'm not asking anything about why we self harm - trust me I've got many answers for that. My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is an issue with the human body and prevents us from feeling healthy. It's a complex thing. Well, it doesn't help that one of my family members isn't healthy but she lives in a place where they do have enough food available (not likely to be our house). And she has been on there for almost twenty years now...that's quite a long time since she started taking drugs.
