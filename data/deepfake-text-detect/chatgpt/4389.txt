When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether you're pulling up to an intersection because your car's brakes are about as effective as those in a remote-controlled toy train that's going 30 miles per hour or whether you just really like speeding and can feel every ounce of performance from its intoxicating sensation - it all comes at the same price: inconvenience and fear. But if people found themselves driving more slowly because their cars were equipped with better braking technology, they would have less time spent honking incessantly at each other when traffic lights turn green, fewer accidents due to reduced temptation to accelerate out of panic, and so forth. The culture around transportation - and around almost any human activity for that matter - is complex enough already; why not add another layer? And besides, there might be some benefits we aren't even aware of yet. On this week's episode of Backseat Driver (or BSD), hosts Josh Davis and I discuss urban planning and the ways that cities draw attention away from things that should get our immediate focus, such as killing yourself by being caught off guard by downtown construction while trying to get somewhere else safely, finding parking spaces on crowded streets, or getting lost attempting to navigate unfamiliar territory using Google maps. We also talk about how easy it is to lose control of our vehicles once we enter unassisted space, including buses, taxis, private drivers, and pedestrians, which means that anyone who has seen one movie where someone dies at a bus stop probably shouldn't own a vehicle. On top of that, there are many examples of places intended for bicycles but built specifically to slow them down, including bike lanes that encourage cyclists to ride single file instead of on the road side by side with motorists, barriers meant solely to protect pedestrians from crossing busy roads rather than from merging into these very same streets, and much more. We'll look closely at two case studies from Europe, both of which took place in 2014 and involved separate groups of bicycle riders who clocked their bikes' speeds against those of motorized contraptions operated by independent operators. In the first study, researchers from Germany tagged 1,500 different models of electric scooters over four months. They then hopped aboard nine different ones throughout various locations in Berlin where riders had been asked to keep track of their average speeds during normal use. While on the road, participants were instructed to watch what was happening ahead of them and note anything unusual. "With each ride," a team representative wrote later, the] moped rider was exposed to unexpected situations." Ancillary results included the discovery of certain types of bloodied injuries suffered only by test subjects riding scooters, along with several instances of death resulting either directly or indirectly from collisions between eScooter users and pedestrians - all of which resulted despite warning devices mostly placed above center lines to prevent these same kinds of incidents. In the second example, a group of 15 scientists from Spain tested six brands of public transit-style bicycles for travel times at speeds ranging from 4 to 13 mph. Their findings: Traveling downhill at 10mph won handily, though uphill trips came within spitting distance of one another. Those traveling at 5mph had slower trip times than expected due to friction issues. After studying video footage obtained from each participant, the elderly lead researcher noted that none of the tested bikes provided adequate guidance for the blind nor did they include proper lighting for nighttime travelers. The BSD crew plays host to three local guests today! First up is Peter Gipson, cofounder of Portland BikeShare and president of PDX Pedal Power Inc., whose work includes smart city management systems that help utilities reduce leaks and conserve water. Then Michael Almonte takes the mic to explain his job title. It starts with "national security advisor for bicycling capital of the United States" before morphing into cohost Josh Davis asking him questions about he saidhe said controversies surrounding cycling and automobiles, among other topics. Finally, Jessica Delgado joins BSD to discuss her career working with nonprofits and academics, and gives us insight on her current interests as she prepares to study abroad next year. At Saint Louis University's School of Business, Brett Stenger often hears students say things like, "I don't want my boss to find out...that I'm doing research projects outside [my university project]." As executive director of the school's Center for Entrepreneurship Innovation Management, Stenger tries to relax these fears by reminding folks that no one is keeping tabs on them. That way lies paranoia and depression. Instead, he helps expose them to real world problems by offering resources that allow entrepreneurs to look beyond graduate programs and funding sources to learn practical skills necessary to start businesses. He offers courses geared toward creating companies, entrepreneurship training, mentorship opportunities, and access to grants. Among the latter are the Small Business Development Centers, Regional Technology Centers, and Venture Capital Funds. All told, Stenger recognizes 72 hours of opportunity may offer a little bit of business for it's supposed to change hitting the street does nothing differently having badgers may be A Transylvie
