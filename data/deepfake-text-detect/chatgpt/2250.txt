Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one of you still wants to have sex and the other doesn't? If it's a "I don't want that person touching me" thing rather than an actual libido issue then what does this mean for your relationship long-term if they can never get over their own issuesinsecurities about touch? That is not fair at all! Not everyone gets into relationships because there was sexual attraction amongst them both from day 1.... Just cause its always been like that with him... Don't make assumptions on how people start out, some times things change later down the road; especially if your partner has changed his mind but instead he just got really scared
