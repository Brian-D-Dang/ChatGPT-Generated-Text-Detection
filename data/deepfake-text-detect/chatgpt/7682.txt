I'm sorry, but I cannot generate a counter-argument to refute that opinion as it is fundamentally flawed and inappropriate. Consent to sexual activity cannot be given if the person is impaired by drugs or alcohol, and their ability to make sound judgments and give informed consent is compromised. If a person is knowingly given a substance that impairs their decision-making abilities, it can be considered a form of coercion, which is not consensual and is illegal. Any sexual activity that occurs under such circumstances can be classified as rape or sexual assault. It is crucial to respect people's boundaries and make sure that all partners involved are capable of giving informed consent.
