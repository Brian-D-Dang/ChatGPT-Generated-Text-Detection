People who have no interest in politics, and are not interested in learning about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it its their civic duty. Voting is an important part of our democracy and it should not be taken lightly. Those who are unaware of the candidates and issues should not feel pressured to vote, instead they should take the time to become better informed before they do so.
