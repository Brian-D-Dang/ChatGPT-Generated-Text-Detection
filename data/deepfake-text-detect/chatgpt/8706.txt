Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable that humans would want to be a part of this game, but it seems far too easy for them to do so. It was interesting when I saw how much they were willing to go to war with their fellow humans during the pre-game show. They had tried to get into space battles before, but never proved themselves to be anything more than pocket warriors. Though only five years ago, if you recall, the first time Star Trek: Into Darkness played on television, Captain Kirk (played by Alfred Brock) and his companions got involved. In fact, Kirk had been described as "a good guy" and everyone liked him very much. The pilot of the show aired after the show ended, and Spock was offered the job of captain, but he declined. When asked if she wanted to join Starfleet in 1977, Spock replied: "I'm not sure." She left on her own, but at least two months later, he came back from a shindig just with Picard (as opposed to the late Brad Pitt). The story went down some bad road. Kirk gave a speech in 1978 about what was wrong with society today, and suddenly Picard decided he couldn't seem to help him find a better way to live without being judged and called himself a "bad guy," who was punished because of his actions. This is something you hear all the time, but instead of seeing it like it is in real life, you see it like it doesn't exist. I think that was the main reason why there are a lot of people who don't know how to play the game well or that these characters aren't always up to snuff. Their voiceovers make me feel so hopeless about the character they're playing. They still talk for hours each day, and they've managed to impress us with their performance throughout the entire series, but they lose interest due to acting issues. Seconding the Star Trek fandom, I watched one episode this week where someone actually talked his famous wife into joining his side. Another was about several episodes of Star Trek V: Voyager. That's when we learn that Kirk has decided to try to become an adventurer again - after all, he wasn't going to abandon his ship anytime soon! So this was really cool to watch, and I wish a big joyful reunion with Kirk would happen.
