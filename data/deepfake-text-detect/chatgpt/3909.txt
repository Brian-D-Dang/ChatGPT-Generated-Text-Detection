To clarify my title I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable unless the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, or the child is the product of incestuous relations. I would like to realize that in a progressive society where women are more educated and able to make informed decisions about their bodies, they should be allowed to choose for themselves.
