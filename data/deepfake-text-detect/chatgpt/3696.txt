Cigarettes are the leading cause of preventable death, responsible for roughly 480,000 deaths per year in the US. 41,000 of those deaths aren't even those of users they are the result of secondhand smoke exposure. It's important to encourage smokers to quit and to create smoke-free environments to protect non-smokers from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke. There are a variety of resources available to assist people in quitting smoking, including nicotine replacement therapy, prescription medications, and support groups. Encouraging healthy lifestyle choices, such as regular exercise and a balanced diet, can also be helpful in reducing tobacco use and promoting overall health.
