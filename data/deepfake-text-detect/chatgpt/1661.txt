First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however: We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is ridiculous! It's a very common trope in comedy. It was until Obama came along and said "Don't laugh at this guy because you're racist."
