so random battles that just happen with no warning, while you're walking, just like, warpy screen, you're in a battle now stuff. this really only applies to turn based games, not rpgs or shit like that. not "i went back to a town" but "now i'm in the desert," "now i'm in the ice caves" the only reason i bring this up is because this happened to me in DQ IV. it just totally screwed me over, because i was in the middle of a battle, and then, the game just did a whole cutscene, and i was now in the desert, and i was like, "shit, the battle's over, i should save now" but the game wouldn't let me so i had to restart the whole fight again, and i lost all of my money because the new battle doesn't let you heal and i was poor and the enemy was a tough boss and i was all like "this totally fucking sucks" so i'm posting this because i would really like for someone to explain this to me. why does this shit happen? why would a game do this? what is this even for? i'm sure someone will have an answer for this soon Re: why do random battles happen at random? I'm gonna say because they can. you know how they always want to do something different? it's like an easter egg of sorts If you had the battle menu open, you would have been allowed to save your game. I always just save whenever I get the chance. In the case of DQ IV, I was really high level, so I didn't have to save very often, but if I had been super low level and far away from the next town, I would have saved, just like I do in modern games. but there's other times when i was near a town and a battle would just happen, and i would be like "why is there a battle now?" it's not like i was walking in the desert or anything It's common in RPGs to have random encounters. It gives the player a sense of danger without making them sit around and wait for monsters to show up. It also allows the player to level up and become stronger, which makes the game more fun and rewards the player for exploring. I'm not a big fan of random battles in RPGs because I don't like being ambushed by enemies who pop up out of nowhere, but I understand why they're there. it was just a fluke i mean, maybe i got unlucky, or maybe the game was bugged or whatever it's not like i'm saying "random battles are bad" i'm just saying that i hate them when they're unexpected They don't happen "at random." You're probably just walking into an area where you get random encounters. There's no way to "beat" random encounters, you have to just get used to them. my goodness, you people are so literal I'm not saying the battles are random what I'm saying is that they happen randomly "random" is a general term, not an accurate description of something but yeah, if i was walking in an area where they're common, then i'd understand, but i wasn't I guess it's just something you get used to. I'm not sure if this is a good answer, but if you think about it, if you're expecting the game to behave in a way that it doesn't, then you're going to be disappointed. Like if you're trying to get to the next town, and a battle happens in the way, well... you're not going to get to the next town. You're going to have to fight the battle. If you're going to get mad at something random, it's probably not going to make you happy. If you're going to start playing a game, you're going to have to accept the way the game plays. You can't just pick up a video game and say "this is going to play this way, and this is how it will behave." If you do that, you're going to get disappointed. you're all so logical and i love you all I'm not saying that I'm not. I'm just saying that you are, too. I'm just saying that it's like, we're all just arguing
