I been using Google Chrome as far as I remember (probably since 2010) and it's been my default browser on all the computerslaptops I've used. Chrome was fast, reliable and best of all it had a great extension system that let me download extensions from other sites like reddit or even Firefox. I'm not sure if this would be an issue with you but sometimes when i use chrome,it will just start to lag out. And seem to have issues in general such as popups,browsing slow etc... Not actually related to the topic at hand though lol
