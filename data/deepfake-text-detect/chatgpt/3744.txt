Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one or both partners stop initiating sex and the other feels neglected or unfulfilled? In this situation, it's important to have open and honest communication with your partner. It's possible that they are going through something that is affecting their sex drive, and they may need support from you. It's also possible that they are feeling neglected in other areas of the relationship, and addressing those issues could improve your overall intimacy. It's important to approach the conversation delicately and without blame or judgment. Ask your partner if there is anything you can do to support them, and let them know how you're feeling without putting pressure on them. From there, you can work together to find a solution that works for both of you, whether it's finding ways to rekindle the romance or seeking outside help from a therapist or counselor.
