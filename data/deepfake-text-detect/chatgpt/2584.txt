I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly relationships with the citizens they serve. But that's exactly what appears to be happening in this video where a young officer stops by a kids lemonade stand outside his patrol car and buys some sweet treats for the local children! One thing is clear: cops are generally not portrayed very well in the media these days - so it's nice when something like this happens! It makes you feel good about your profession... at least until you see the comments section below where people couldn't care less that there was any redeeming quality here because the guy has dreadlocks!!!
