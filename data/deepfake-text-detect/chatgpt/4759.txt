I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our deficit as a percentage of GDP in 2050 will be about what it is today). I also understand how this might seem like an unpopular opinion. However, with all due respect for my friends who are Republicans or independent-leaning people, some things just aren't practical; we need limits on government growth so they don't have such power over us any more than necessary. Below are five ways money could be better spent: 1) Transportation - There should be no barriers preventing someone from saving up enough cash to start their own transportation company. People would then be able to provide affordable transport services without being beholden to anyone else's rules, regulations, taxes or influence. This would give competition and innovation back into the market. We can spend less time worrying about where that hippie down the road is going when he drives too fast through town and causes accidents. It makes sense to take the local bus system out of public hands and reallocate tax dollars towards improving roads and highways, i.e., to get rid of potholes, paved shoulders, build bike paths, repair bridges and intersections, etc. In effect, you're taking private investment out of transit opportunities and putting those funds back into your public infrastructure. And if there are still bottlenecks at times where many travelers arrive at the same place at once? Let them create their own! If buses and trains were truly "public" entities rather than monopolies run by politicians that keep expanding marginalizing other modes of travel, congestion wouldn't even exist. You'd see fewer cars clogging our streets because there'd be no reason to drive somewhere unless there was something unique about it. Furthermore, if big companies want to send employees around the country via train fastercheaper than flying, let 'em do it! Publicly funded rail ties would not only make traveling cleaner but safer - much cheaper rides means people would choose it over air or car, whether alone or together. Imagine Amtrak running across America first class with free Wi-Fi and complimentary Starbucks coffee; And personally, with few exceptions (i.e., airports), I think everyone has the right to move freely, safely, quickly and cheaply anywhere they please within their state boundaries. Unfortunately, most states ensure citizens must pay exorbitant fees to use interstates to cross borders between states. Why restrict movement based on geography? That one decision prevents millions of Americans from visiting family members further away. Or moving to greener pastures like rural areas or campsites where it may be easier to live simply. But since nonresidents cannot vote here anyway, why keep voting against themselves? Even though we've got plenty of room for improvement, investing heavily in modernized mass transits has proven to be very cost effective compared with highway expansion. The American Recovery Reinvestment Act includes 4 billion earmarked specifically for high speed passenger rails in 2010 - 2011 which is all we'll ever realistically need, and doesn't include anything for future upgrades, yet the bill still passed. Our GDP is growing at an estimated 2 annually thanks to new investments in technology and product development made possible by increased trade and commerce facilitated by improved communications networks. By comparison, inflation hovers close to 3, meaning billions of dollars go unaccounted for each year because we haven't invested sufficiently in keeping pace with advances. That represents hundreds of billions of dollars lost in productivity just waiting to happen. So instead of debating theoretical solutions and dreaming of a world with no vehicle emission standards, traffic jams, parking shortages, pollution, oil spills, safety issues or noise, let's actually try and improve our current situation before we allow it to become worse. Is it too late already? Of course. Many Americans throw away perfectly good food every day! Wasted resources equal wasted opportunity costs. Constantly finding ourselves paying higher prices and having limited access to healthy foods keeps us hungry, and hunger leads to bad decisions. We feel entitled to eat whatever we want whenever we want, regardless of how unhealthy it is. For example, I love pizza. As long as I'm making sensible choices in terms of processed ingredients and portion size, I can enjoy a huge pie monthly without rising health risks. However, along comes the High Fiber Diet Craze (indeed, fiber is needed to digest pizza), declaring its mission is to deliver maximum nutrition while minimizing caloric intake... in return for 50 grams daily plus carbs per plate!! Don't knock it til ye try it, and remember, moderation really does matter. Another misconception is that whole grains are healthier than refined ones, when the opposite is true for overall nutrient density and satiety levels. Grain body types are important factors to consider. Whole wheat breads contain 25g protein vs 4g found in 100g white flour. A serving of pasta contains 7g protein while refined corn flakes boast 5g, according to Healthline.com. White rice provides 8 g versus brown 10 g.
