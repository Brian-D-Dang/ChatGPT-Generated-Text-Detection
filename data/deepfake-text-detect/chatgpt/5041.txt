It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cruel and ill-advised for the sake of their own safety. The naturalistic nature of zoo animals makes them idealistic creatures who need to learn how to live with others like themselves while being cared for by humans as well as future generations in captivity. Zoo officials argue that a new safeguard against animal cruelty should not be imposed on them until they are fully rehabilitated or euthanized. This would inhibit breeding programs where individual animals suffer because they cannot survive in captivity alone due only to genetic defects that have caused harm to many species including chimpanzees, gorillas, elephants, tigers, leopards etc. Welcoming an idea from a zoo official that there was no animal welfare issue with ZOOZO (Zoo Zero) was welcomed by some zoogoers, who were outraged at what many saw as an effort to increase profits rather than promote conservation efforts. Some zoo visitors were asked why they thought zoo workers needed to spend time caring for animals when the facilities had already invested millions toward developing technology to help improve care for the animals instead of feeding them meals with human supervision so they wouldn't starve during the day hours. Some viewers wondered if the zoo's staff wanted to also participate in the conservation work, fearing it could lead to more deaths among wild animals such as tigers and lions; others questioned whether the zoo might become too hotbeds of illegal poaching. In response to complaints about zoo employees' treatment of animals which made headlines last year after multiple incidents involving illegal wildlife trade, the zoo said that principles set forth by the National Zoological Society of America and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Federation were applied equally in its operations. "Not every animal needs to die," said zoo spokesman John Taylor, adding that "the zoo works hard each night." A zoo spokeswoman responded that zoo management has been working closely together since 2012 with animal protection organizations to resolve conflicts between owners and animals over space and staffing issues resulting in thousands of unwanted animals leaving the zoo annually. Taylor urged people interested in seeing how animals behave closer to home to make sure they visit zoo facilities regularly. Online:
