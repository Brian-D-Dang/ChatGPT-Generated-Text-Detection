This is a view I've read about from various pop psychology sources, and it has become conventional wisdom. I believe it contains some truth. Can you convince me it merely means that there's more to it than meets the eye? You can't persuade me that there isn't more to it. Nonetheless, you want feedback on it because it proves your point. I'm not saying I agree with you or disagree but if you have a problem with it then try reading more books rather than blindly believing what you hear elsewhere in the world of psychology.
