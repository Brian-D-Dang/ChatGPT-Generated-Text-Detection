Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as the worst fresh pizza. We found that most frozen pizzas contain a lot of cheese and not much else. They are more cheesy and less tasty than average frozen pizzas, but most are still better than the best fresh pizza. The best fresh pizza, on the other hand, is really good. The very best fresh pizza tastes even better. Dough quality has the most impact on the flavor of a pizza. Cheese and sauce quality both contribute to the flavor, but they aren't as critical as dough. Fresh pizza is all about the dough. The quality of the dough can make or break the pizza. The best fresh pizza has flavorful sauce and cheese, but the best dough is the key to all of it. Our results are based on the opinions of 102 people who rated 29 pizzas, and on the opinions of 36 people who rated 14 frozen pizzas. Each pizza was rated on a 5-point scale for how good it tasted. Each frozen pizza was rated on a 7-point scale for how good it tasted. The average ratings of fresh pizza and frozen pizza were used to make the graphs below. The results are very clear: Most people like fresh pizza better than frozen pizza. This is the third year in a row that fresh pizza has beaten frozen pizza.
