While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems. I believe that technology can solve all these problems in a matter of minutes! We should come together as one species and slow down on breeding if this is what we want. If people are no longer going to have children for fear of global warming then they will naturally die out over time.. We don't need more humans on the planet anyway so why not just let them go extinct?
