The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustratedcritical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single -sex men can begrindy, and the woman who discovers her partner's undivided attention will sometimes show themselves as a different kind of person than she would have been if she had stayed with him or before he began his search for her. Only one single thing wrongs us all: we've got it right about self-esteem and self-confidence, but we're just not sure how to define that difference between ourselves, because we don't know what it means. So we have to look beyond other people. We also need to get out there and find ourselves both emotionally and physically. That requires understanding of who we are, what we want and how we should feel (and talk about). This is where I'm at as a sociologist, and I think it makes sense to say: "If you like being alone, then you might be doing something wrong."
