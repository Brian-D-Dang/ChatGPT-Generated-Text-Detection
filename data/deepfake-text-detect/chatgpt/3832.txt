Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the new law, however, federal officers can be charged with lying under oath about their previous employment and education during background checks for jobs like FBI agent or deputy marshal. The amendment also allows prosecutors to charge "impersonating as another person" someone who has not committed a crime by making false charges of assault against someone whom they suspect is guilty of some lesser offense. (Krause frames it this way: "It would be very easy for anyone who thinks that if someone claims to have been assaulted by someone else and then files suit, then all the more reason why the prosecutor should investigate. As Kraus points out, these laws are supposed to serve as deterrents; but since there is no penalty for perjury at present - as long as you do not go to jail - criminal defense lawyers will likely argue that the new penalties are just more "targeting." Sooner or later, he predicts, we may see the proportion of cases where perjury leads to criminal prosecution drop precipitously: What's more, what's happening now isn't actually working. As cases come down from the high-profile convictions associated with the polygraph trials, people are still being prosecuted on perjury charges even though they never meant anything criminal. For example, last year, prosecutors brought perjury charges against one man after his testimony was contradicted three times. He had told police that he recorded himself having sex with women on video - but none had ever shown him such videos. The state said the perjury charge wasn't based on actual evidence but rather on statements made by other witnesses, including former coworkers. But when a judge found the stories true, prosecutors dropped the case - because they couldn't prove the men were telling lies. Law enforcement officials say they believe this phenomenon stems partly from the fact that courts are increasingly allowing jurors to consider "knowledgeable credibility." In that sense, they say, many Vermonters who might otherwise be accused of planting evidence or conspiring with others while trying to cover up crimes deserve a chance to clear their names. This means even those who lied under oath, or impersonated someone else who hadn't broken the law, could inadvertently help reduce future prosecutions - by showing that they can testify without getting caught. (Krause makes mention of an academic study that suggests "people who lie less tend to get caught. It appears unlikely that Vermont will enact a law similar to the new Louisiana statute, which, like its Virginia cousin, bars public employees from lying under oath during job applications or interviews. And let me reiterate: I am NOT asking my teachers or principals to lie, just that they take the time to explain to students exactly how important it is that they tell the truth.
