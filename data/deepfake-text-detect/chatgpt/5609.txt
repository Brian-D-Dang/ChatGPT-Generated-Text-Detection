I always have to hold my eyes to keep them rolling out of my sockets when I hear (australian) people talking about their trips to europe and canada and america. Seriously, what is the point of living in Australia? I really think we should just pack up and get out of here. But then again, I would probably feel the same way if I was living in some shithole like New Zealand or Japan. I'm glad you're having a good time, though. Nigel, yes, I agree. I'm not a big fan of Australian cities or natural beauty either. But I'm still glad to be here. I was going to do a big post about how to support Australian music, but now I'm not so sure. I have my own blog. It's a little embarassing because I'm not very good at it, and my writing is awful, but it's the only thing I can do to document what I'm doing. I'm glad you have your own blog, too. I'd love to live in Japan if I could speak the language. I'd love to live anywhere in Europe if I could speak the language. I also think that you should go to the US. You'll find that most Americans are very open to people from other countries. However, the US has a lot of problems and if you're going to move to the US, you should be ready to learn about the problems and maybe take a stand against some of them. I have to hold my eyes too. I think I'm glad I live in Australia - I can't imagine living anywhere else. I'd be pretty disappointed if I lived in another country and wanted to go back to Australia. I'm glad you're glad to be here, too. I'm not sure I would want to live anywhere else either. I guess I'm not that adventurous. I'd love to live in Japan. Or in Europe.
