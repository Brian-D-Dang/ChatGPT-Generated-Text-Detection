The idea is not to infringe on anyone's right to express themselves. If someone wants to have and film adult consenting adults having sex then they are free to do so as that person will be able use a site such mine without issue I am 28 years old I own my business which includes an escorts section where people can advertise their services in exchange for money, it also has erotic content available through links from other websites including pornographic sites - again there was no harm done or infringement of copyright by these companies at all. It may seem 'icky' but the only reason why this cant happen here (anymore) is because we live under antiquated laws rules set out 60years ago when censorship wouldn't sell newspapers etc., if authorities want more control over what shouldshouldn't appear online - guidelines need updating,for both businesses like mines who provide users with pleasure products along side escort ads being censored would make us look crazy spending countless hours every day moderating our pages while making sure everything remains within legal boundaries despite constant action taken against them instead i think those resources could better serve something positive
