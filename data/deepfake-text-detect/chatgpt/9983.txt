From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on social issues such as LGBTQ rights, immigration, reproductive rights, and civil rights. This camp is often associated with progressive ideals and the Democratic Party. The other faction of liberals tends to prioritize economic justice, such as raising the minimum wage, increasing taxes on the wealthy, and advocating for universal healthcare. This camp is often associated with the more moderate aspects of the Democratic Party and has been labeled "neo-liberals." In practice, both camps promote liberal policies and work together to further their shared agenda. However, they often disagree on the best way to approach certain issues, which can lead to tension between them.
