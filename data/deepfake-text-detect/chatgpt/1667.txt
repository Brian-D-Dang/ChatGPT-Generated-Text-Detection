I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to get them from an element with a 'p' (they're both valets). [unoldemoselle] (nsfw) is correct. In rare cases they could be synthesized by fusion of two compounds containing [a]ppentatium or [uppertitanium].
