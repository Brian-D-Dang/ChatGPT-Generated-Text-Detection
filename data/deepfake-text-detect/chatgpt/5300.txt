tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to the winter sports my favorite team is the Red Wings because they aren't only known for one thing, probably because of their competitiveness and consistency. Yea, that's super interesting! Dudes like me who enjoy watching hockey are hardly fans or fans in general so for them I think it makes sense why we're there haha
