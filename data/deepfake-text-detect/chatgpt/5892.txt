Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the handicapped spots are empty. I'm not talking about the local strip mall with one spot (like the one I'm parked in right now) or the local coffee shop or any of the other small businesses but the big box stores and the shopping malls. There are always spots available. And it's not just handicapped spots, I see many empty spots. Often times the person sitting in the spot for an hour or more isn't even old or disabled. The people who use handicapped spots are not parking in them for hours at a time. They are parking there for a minute or two, running in to pick up a prescription, a few things from the dry cleaners, etc. and then leaving. The local shopping mall has a parking lot which is 3 or 4 football fields in length. It has over 1000 parking spots. You can park there for free for 20 minutes or more. Yet you still see spots available. There are people who park there for hours. I've never noticed this sort of thing until now. Is it a growing problem? Has this always been this way and I've only noticed it now? I think it's a case of people using the handicapped parking spots as a 'grabbers spot' - a spot where you can pull in and sit there with a car parked in front of you while you run into the store and not have to worry about other parking spots as you can pull out and find another spot. I also see this happen a lot in the drop off zone for the school. I've never seen this kind of thing before but it is definitely a growing problem. The biggest problem is that people abuse the handicapped parking spots. It is a sign of entitlement and a sign of a spoiled society. I used to get people who would pull in my handicap space because they wanted the closest parking space, I moved to a different street and it hasn't happened since. I have a sign on the back of my car that says I'm handicapped and I have the tags on my car. I am also a disabled vet and don't drive my car, so it isn't a sneaky way to get parking. I used to work at a local mall and I would see people taking up the spots all the time. I also would see people taking up handicapped spots and then when they left they would block the spot in. I would go out there and tell them to move. I think it's a combination of factors. I've gotten a lot of comments like you describe. I think that some people simply don't see the handicapped spots and others think that it's easy to park in them. I've gotten comments like, "I'll park in that spot because I need a spot" or "I'll just take the spot because I need a spot" and they don't realize that they're actually taking someone else's spot. I also think that people don't realize that they're blocking the spot so they get out of their car and move it in order to get out of the spot. I've been using a cane for over 2 years now and it doesn't stop people from blocking my handicapped spots. Most people don't even know that they're blocking them. I was surprised by the number of people who parked in the handicapped spots at the local hospital. I don't know how you can miss it with the big wheelchair symbol. I think a lot of it has to do with entitlement. I've seen it in my own neighborhood. Many people think they're entitled to park in the handicapped spots. Some people don't even realize that they're blocking the spots. I've had people come over and ask me why I'm in the handicapped spot. They didn't even realize that they were blocking the spot and they didn't even realize that I was in a wheelchair. It's scary to think that so many people don't even realize what they're doing. I think I have seen more people in handicapped spots than ever before. But the thing is that I can't really say for sure. I don't pay attention to what people are doing in the parking lot. It's not like I'
