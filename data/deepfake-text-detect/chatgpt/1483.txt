(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge any people because of their political views. For example, a conservative might be the best person for his job and so on but at the same time it's not an excuse to like himher just because he supports (or even believes in!) conservatism - which actually makes this whole rant somewhat irrelevant as conservatives do have quite similar opinions when they are talking about each other). Even more, we can disagree with our friends' politics without having hatred towards them since one could argue that everyone should understand that different ideologies may be right in certain aspects while being wrong in others both sides" fallacy!).
