I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that it happens because they were "asking for it." The first is the right approach. The second side's response of defense of rapists while blaming women ignores statistics, victim-blaming and basic human decency. It also makes me sick to my stomach at times when I hear it not just as a woman who has been raped but even more so as someone who has worked closely on sexual assault issues over many years. This only adds fuel to an already raging fire. When we speak out against violence toward men (and now increasingly other genders) what do we really gain? We still have to live our lives every day. In these moments where there are fewer options than ever before to protect ourselves from harm or escape, some choose to use force themselves instead of using their words together to facilitate change. And in doing this, they violate rules set forth under law intended specifically to prevent such behavior. No one wins here except perhaps those looking to profit off of fear-based reactions rather than actual solutions. Our justice system exists, despite flaws, because citizens care enough to demand accountability whenever police officers shoot another Black man down without reason; call for transparency into why white supremacist who killed Breonna Taylor was allowed to walk free after his arrest; push politicians to pass legislation like the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act which would go a long way towards protecting communities across America from unnecessary death at hands of authorities. These things matter and yet somehow seem unlikely to happen anytime soon. As we grieve and mourn for George Floyd, let us remember that he did exist, lived and died. His life mattered far too much for him to be forgotten once again.
