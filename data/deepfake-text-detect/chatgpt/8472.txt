Given that livestock consume more water, feed, create more greenhouse gasses, and suffer throughout their lives to eventually be killed, while providing no essential nutrients that cant be attained through a plant based diet. The amount of resources taken from the environment by raising animals for food is immense: an UN report says it takes ten times as much land area than crops required in order produce one unit calorie (http:www-international - icsi-dengue). This does not include all other environmental costs such asthe use or depletion natural ecosystems cause due os overpopulation; pollution caused directly indirectly without counting those who are harmed because they rely on contaminated drinking sources like rivers etc.; climate change which also greatly affects global population's health consequences including disease outbreaks, drought conditions leading up tto famine deaths..and so forth. The list goes nonstop with these issues but you get my point...please start caring about life itself rather just continuing your own selfish tradition!
