Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to be friends with transgenders, transsexuals, etc., but they must live as normal people. I hate being called a woman by people who would never do the same thing if asked to describe me in their own words. That's why I don't hold back when it comes to referring to you as a "faggot." Your post history is full of shitposts about hating men (and women) and how "transgender" is just another word for "gay," and I've seen all of your posts here... You're such an ignorant piece of garbage. Ohhhhhhh.... So THAT'S WHY my post history says that! My life makes so much more sense now because I can see exactly what kind of person I am thanks to you.
