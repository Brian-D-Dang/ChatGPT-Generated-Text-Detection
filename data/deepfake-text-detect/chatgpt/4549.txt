So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor religion (while Caucasians can) but they also have the right to be discriminated against based on race? If that's true then doesn't it mean we're all practicing discrimination as a minority when talking about anything remotely associated with our ethnicity (i.e., food preferences)? I've only seen conversations where people engage in reverse-racism if you want to suggest an idea or something like that. In these cases, no one is actually discriminating against anyone else for being CaucasianAsian etc.. So why do people get so upset when someone tries to say this? It seems to me there are some things nobody wants to admit out loud. Related question; would another person's dislike of your favorite foods be considered prejudice towards them if you were black or Hispanic? And vice versa for whites? Or does everybody think pretty much alike about everything regardless of his colour? If so, how come there isn't any solid evidence proving such theory...I'd love to see it! Edit 1: On second thought: With regards to my last paragraph, wouldn't it make more sense for us to respect each other's culture and beliefs in order for equality to stand up to scrutiny instead of prefacing every comment by saying "as long as you don't hurt anybody..."Yes, i know, I'll stop trying to sound intelligent now;) A: While I agree with Git Gud's answer which brings up most important points, let me explain the difference between actual practice (which has bad connotations) and mere opinions (also known as free speech). In case of free speech, people should always be allowed to express themselves without fear of reprisal. However, expressing yourself could lead to someone interpreting your thoughts negatively. This is especially relevant considering the fact that different races develop very differently from children. Some kids learn better than others at certain subjects due to genetic differences. Kids who feel inferior may grow into adults who needlessly lash back at people just because they are told they aren't good enough, possibly damaging public relations among groups. For example, while both black and Indian communities are largely broken down amongst poor education systems, there might still be a big social gap between the two. The way society views India vs African Americans will certainly differ depending on where you live. People living throughout Asia, Latin America, Europe, North America Australasia share similar backgrounds despite racial preference limiting opportunities for advancement in many countries. Thus, we tend to treat diverse cultures equal or almost equally. However, in case of actual practices which cause harm, we must act. Let me give 2 examples purely offtopic of course: 1) Japan's high birth rate was once regarded as a problem by Western world. Nowadays, that same nation's population dwindled significantly. There's simply less room for everyone to exist. But since Japanese are allowed free speech, a lot of westerners kept their mouths shut. They simply didn't tell how terrible life would become for those few members left behind. Speaking out would have harmed the community itself. 2) During World War II, Nazi Germany used slavery to boost its economy. By doing this, Hitler gained control over thousands of slaves and gain access to tons of cheap labor power. Obviously, slavery wasn't desirable since human lives were taken, however, Germans weren't forced to speak out about the issue. Nazis couldn't care less whether slave laborers had enough time for work, decent nutrition, freedom or even basic rights. All they cared about was to prove themselves superior in military battles. Racial profiling is clearly unacceptable today as well, yet again, neo nazis won't notice very often. Why? Because they support hate crimes legislation. Even though such laws protect legal citizens, they target non-citizens. Racists prefer supporting racist policies that legitimize their own prejudices rather than opposing hatred toward specific races. Most importantly, violent racists like Neo Nazis are afraid of imprisonment since they value their personal freedoms above the safety of other humans and believe like "God made man before woman." No matter how offensive it sounds, denying rights of women and homosexuals is not acceptable either. To be honest, the problem lies within people using violence to promote ideals contrary to natural law. Violence has never been accepted anywhere ever - even during wars. The moral here is that free speech is necessary, but what happens after that starts getting problematic.
