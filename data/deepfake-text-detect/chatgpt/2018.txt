I recently saw a video on why the Republicans [can't win] the 2016 election. If we go by raw numbers, Hillary will most likely win the next election. This got me wondering if there has ever been an election in which one candidate won with less votes than his opponent? Maybe it's not about who receives more ballots but rather how many people vote for each of them...
