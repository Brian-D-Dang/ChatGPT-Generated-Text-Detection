I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to find an element with just one proton. Even though there are other kinds of atoms, if you can't split them into two parts after bonding, they aren't really different from eachother (for example hydrogen is quite similar to helium) The reason for this might be because electrons have very little mass compared too protons while neutrons have even less than either. Electrons form pairs so when you break down most neutral molecules, you end up left with only having 1 electron per atom which would then make any 2-atom molecule unbalanced by its charge yet atoms tend not to bond directly together out side their natural grouping (this is how gases work). A bigger problem occurs however when adding more atomic nuclei since those also need electrons between themselves giving rise to a molecular configuration where every pair has 4 bonds around the nucleus making 6 total bonds. If your counting the number of particles required before the molecule takes balance again shouldn't these extra ones still count towards balancing? The thing about chemistry isn't math like physics instead we must rely heavily upon empirical evidence -that said many chemists use quantum mechanics due to physicists using classical logic. This means both sides don't understand everything entirely intuitively let alone completely mathematically.... Chemists rarely agree amongst each other over what exactly happens within matter: (
