One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? Not necessarily: In fact, some people have called for free college because they think it would increase the demand in an industry; with higher wages and more students overall, there's potential to raise salaries even further (or so we'd hope). But yes, having lots of degrees doesn't mean you're going to get paid as well.
