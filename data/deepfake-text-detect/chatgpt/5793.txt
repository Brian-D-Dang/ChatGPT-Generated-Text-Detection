It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing is being neglected: China has been building a military force that is stronger than most of the developed countries of the world, despite being considered a developing country. China is the only country in the world that has no formal enemies, no historical enemies to speak of, no enemies to speak of in any sense of the word, no enemies of any sort, no enemies at all. However, it is still building up its military strength, as if it were preparing for a big war. Why is that? China is building up its military strength in order to stop an oncoming crisis, a crisis which threatens to engulf China. The crisis is the rising unrest in China, which has been triggered by the economy, but will be deepened by the government's efforts to control it. The government is failing to do its job as a government, as it is supposed to: to ensure the smooth running of the society, so that people can focus on their personal lives without worrying too much about their own futures. Why is the government failing to do its job? First of all, the government has been led by a leader who has ruled China for so long, that people have come to expect the government to take care of their welfare and stability. However, the leader has not been a good leader, nor a leader that people can be proud of. He has been in power for so long that people have stopped criticising his leadership, but he has actually never been a good leader. The results of his leadership have been devastating, with the economy in a recession for so long, and it has not been showing signs of recovery. The economy is spiralling downward, and it has been a problem that is getting worse and worse. China's economy is based on a system which is not sustainable, and China's unemployment rate has been rising, and it will continue to rise. With rising unemployment rate, the government has been forced to implement measures which will cause unrest. The government has been forced to take drastic measures, and it is doing so. For example, it has been taking measures which will lead to the destruction of industries which are unprofitable, and the firing of people who work in those industries. However, the government is not taking care of these people in its own hands, because it does not want to spend money to help people who are unemployed. Instead, it has been taking measures which will allow the government to impose economic controls on these people. These people are now being forced to take low-paid jobs in the state-owned companies, which are being run in a very inefficient manner. As a result, they are being paid very low wages, which will not allow them to maintain their standard of living. As a result, they are becoming more and more angry. In addition, the government has been imposing more and more taxes, and has been making the tax system even more complicated and even more unfair, which also angers the people. With all these measures, the government is making the crisis worse. The economy is not improving, and unemployment is rising, but the government has not been taking care of the unemployed people. They are being forced to take low-paid jobs in companies that are not profitable, and as a result, their standard of living is falling. The government is also making people more and more angry, and the unrest is getting worse and worse. With the rising unrest, the government is becoming increasingly worried, and it is trying to do something about it, but it is not doing a good job of it. For example, the government has been trying to get rid of the protests by making concessions, but that is not going to work. The people have been protesting for so long, and it is difficult to satisfy them. The government is trying to give in to them, but as soon as the government gives in to one group, it will have to give in to another group, and this will not stop the unrest. The government is also trying to send in more police to suppress the protests, but the protests are not going to stop as a result. The protests are increasingly violent, and it will only make the government have to send in more police, and it will also lead to the deaths of many protesters, which will make the unrest even worse. The government is trying to control the unrest by imposing even more restrictions on the freedom of the people, but that will only make the people more angry, and the unrest will continue to get worse and worse. The government is now doing something which it has not done before, and that is using
