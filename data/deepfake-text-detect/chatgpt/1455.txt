In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want it can be considered rape in many places around the world. It appears there are some people who believe this position doesn't apply and would support making all forms of sexual assault illegal." "Our new law allows prosecutors to consider whether force was used so if someone claims they were assaulted and their assailants claim no force was used then the victim will not face criminal charges," she said. "The purpose behind this change is for victims of crime who may feel intimidated or afraid during an investigation into situations where force could have been involved," said deputy attorney general Jeremy Bronson at a press conference on Friday. "There are plenty examples throughout history which show how intimidating it might be for victims of serious crimes against them to come forward with accusations about such things as domestic violence ... We hope these changes make life easier and safer for those seeking justice." Under current laws, if two consenting adults had sex without any other parties present - even just one party alone - but both later felt pressured by either party (or perhaps both) to participate further than initially agreed upon, it wouldn't be a criminal offence because "no harm, injury, etc., has occurred" under Section 552 (3) (a). However, if one of the participants was coerced from continuing physical activity through threats like 'If you don't do what I say your dad will beat us up again', then this could count, if 'forceless coercion' hadn't already been defined as necessary or proportionate under section 507A Criminal Code of Canada. Under the proposed law set out above, if only one participant feels forced to engage further than originally intended, then the case becomes evidentiary - meaning there must now be evidence beyond reasonable doubt that using force - however severe - violated the other persons bodily autonomy. This means that accusers needn't fear being charged with rape simply because they didn't want to get naked, or give oral sex, or whatever else they consented to beforehand. The defence is also much more limited: the accused does not necessarily have to prove he did nothing wrong; merely that 'the use of force wasn't required' under section 508 Access to Justice Act of 2015. A guilty verdict requires proof 'that the use of force was neither clearly unlawful nor reasonably justified.' This seems like something everyone agrees ought to happen regardless, right?
