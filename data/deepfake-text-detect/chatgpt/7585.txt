While it's true that rFPH was known for promoting harmful attitudes towards overweight individuals, it's important to consider the implications of banning a specific community on a platform built around free expression. By removing rFPH, Reddit set a precedent for censoring certain perspectives and limiting the diversity of voices on the site. Additionally, while some users may have found the content of rFPH offensive, it's worth noting that all subreddits are optional and users have the ability to simply not visit or engage with certain communities. Ultimately, the decision to ban rFPH may have appeased a certain group of users, but it raises questions about the boundaries of free speech and the power dynamics of large social media platforms.
