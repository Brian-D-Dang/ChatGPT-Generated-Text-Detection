Cigarettes are the leading cause of preventable death, responsible for roughly 480,000 deaths per year in the US. 41,000 of those deaths aren't even those of users they are the result of secondhand smoke exposure to others around a smoker. The business of selling cigarettes is one that relies on our ignorance and addiction as people have been smoking forever with no end date set... People die every day from alcohol related incidents but nobody seems too worried about banning alcohol or raising prices unreasonably high so I fail to see why you would find it acceptable to ban tobacco sales altogether if done blindly without all available facts at hand?
