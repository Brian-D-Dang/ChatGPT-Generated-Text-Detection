I don't personally feel that the arguments against meat eating (morality, sustainability) have enough depth andor meaning that directly affects me or others around me to make me feel as though I should give up on my favorite food product. It's not like bees are dying off at a rate faster than we can harvest them! It is sad how there has become such an aversion for anything veggie in this day and age when it was so much more commonplace 30-50 years ago.
