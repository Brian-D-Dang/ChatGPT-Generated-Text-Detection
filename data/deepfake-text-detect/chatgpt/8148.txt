Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from intramural) then found myself stuck at that level for 2 years when an injury ended all of what was left in 2009 and 2010....during this time period i ws doing yoga regularly (and got back into it after). During 2011-2013 though out worked by parents went overseas 4 times which really helped or recovery process so great! Fresh start whenever you come home...My husband became ill with lupus during 2014 again put me on hold until May 2015 where we had our first child together who is now almost 1 year old still breastfeeding currently.. I believe things happen because they are suppose too however sometimes its hard feeling like there's no light anymore only dark clouds.....i cant wait til football season starts just hoping once more lol!!!!! All along im certain if given enough chances id be able play competitively maybe even higher levels one day. Now being mommy...sometimes feel lost wanting something new badly knowledgable about pregnancy, birth..etc want another baby soon thinking bout getting pregnant while waiting till retirement age anyways wish everyone well
