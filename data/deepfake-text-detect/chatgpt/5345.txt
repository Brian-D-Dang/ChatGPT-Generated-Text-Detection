I say "killer asteroid" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth. I have three or four of these objects which are not known by society as captured asteroids we can call planets if they destroy us all together; named after famous scientists who took part in their research and published papers about them such as Isaac Newton, James Cook and Galileo Galilei's New Horizons spacecraft and Neil Armstrong - Galileo Saturn, Galileo Galilei and Galileo Galilei or Galileo Galilei and Galileo Galilei. It would be interesting to know what kind of asteroid was captured by the asteroid or how it became trapped behind the asteroid belt around the asteroid belt near the asteroid belt If you look at NASA map of the asteroid belt it shows rocks that were caught between the asteroid belt and our orbit in 1971 when it came close to the Earth. The asteroid belt is very big, so there isn't much space left over from when it was just a single asteroid on Earth during the Great Depression period:
