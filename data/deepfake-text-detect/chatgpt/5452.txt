Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to 15hour. While many would argue that this should have been done more than three decades ago, it has largely become a partisan issue even as it affords Democrats an opportunity to shine light on how much wages are falling faster than inflation (while making a political statement). In response to Sanders' campaign announcement that he plans to raise the federal minimum wage by an average of 15 per hour over five years - though not enough for most workers! - the Trump Administration is starting to say something they never did before: at least formulate policies in a way their party doesn't agree on. The result is notable because, in this case (with a lot of help from the unions) Republicans may see Congress lessening the minimum wage hike as giving them an excuse to repeal Obamacare without bipartisan support or reauthorize the Affordable Care Act so Republicans can focus on increasing taxes. Several states already make minimum wage increases higher than America's current constitution requires but lack any clear legislation to expand the minimum wage law, which would provide protection against government interventionism while lowering costs. In addition, some state legislatures have enacted laws limiting how employers reduce pay rates through proposed tax hikes and other measures; state legislators could try to pass minimum wage restrictions without congressional approval all along if they think it will end up bolstering worker productivity gains within the federal government. It isn't just the rich who aren't paying attention though: the relatively wealthy do too. According to the Pew Research Center, nearly 40 percent of American households earn below the poverty lineor lower income families don't qualify for benefits such as unemployment insurance. The median household income across all incomes ranges between 22,000-29,999 annually according to the Census Bureau estimate, compared with 2 among households earning over 45K annually. And there is little incentive to increase wages unless you get paid what the rest of us really deserve when working full time hours instead of picking up slack. The status quo isn't healthy either since wage growth is still growing slower than wages due to labor shortages brought about by supply-side programs like Medicare and public education systems. This week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced she intends to introduce her own bill called the Equal Pay Act, aimed squarely at reducing inequality during the pandemic, including eliminating paid leave policy out of sight. "The rise in minimum wage earners means an imbalance between those living paycheck to paycheck versus those being able to afford childcare," Warren wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Monday night. "We need solutions!" Warren also wants lawmakers to consider expanding the child care subsidy program that provides free school lunches to low-income children whom parents cannot afford to feed themselves, as well as extending paid sick days and maternity rights to pregnant women who want them. When the pandemic began, the Trump administration laid bare its hypocrisy in announcing its intention to create a national minimum wage standard set by the Congressional Budget Office based upon the composition of CORE ranks calculated using the standard formula used by the Census Bureau. Among the charities refusing to comply was Humanitarian Aid, which claims the standard would cost taxpayers 11 billion next year alone. And now the Trump Administration is looking toward universal basic income that guarantees both people who work part time simultaneously and those who opt into hourly jobs once their regular shifts expire. It appears Trump ends his efforts to curb spending entirely after touting his economic plan earlier this month. "If we don't start cutting deficits immediately then our economy is going to collapse very quickly," Trump said Thursday morning aboard Air Force One. "And I'm hoping that somebody comes along and actually brings down the deficit." In reality, the pandemic certainly helped boost lower minimum wage job numbers despite rising employment levels throughout 2020 thanks to many Americans taking advantage of unemployment benefits cutbacks following the pandemic shutdowns initiated by Trump's predecessor Barack Obama. The Trump Administration also increased wages above the Federal Reserve Board's target range two months ahead of schedule amid the pandemic, another sign that the Trump Economy Plan likely helps keep prices stable until voters decide whether more stimulus checks remain available in 2021. But economists had expected signs of wage stagnation early on amid uncertainty surrounding the virus outbreak and COVID-19 vaccinations. Donald Trump may be pushing further away from raising minimum wages rather than embracing policies designed to improve conditions for workers overall. In fact, research shows that Trump advocates may profit off the idea of replacing mandatory overtime rules with incentives allowing companies to hire fewer employeesa move critics fear might lead to layoffs under Trump's tariffs regime. The Trump Administration estimates it expects wages to fall each quarter from January 2019 onward given fewer new hires coming onto the workforce. Yet hiring patterns stay quite consistent nationwide, only declining slightly post-pandemic except for benchmarks in Alaska where wages fell 0.4 percentage points annually. It won't surprise anyone who remembers Trump's pushback against mandatory overtime regulations which led to higher wages in local economies followed by lower wages elsewhere around the country Saturday when sharp drops were experienced in hourly Laborsizeage ageate expectations to work changes order-scape Limits collection.
