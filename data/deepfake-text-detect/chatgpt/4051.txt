I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the list of top ten movies. Well, it's an amazing movie and absolutely worth seeing if you have Netflix (or have already seen it). But as a western anime film it has been criticized by some critics over its lack of characterization and story... As far as I know it is just not one of those "everything is perfect" type films like Akira or Cowboy Bebop.
