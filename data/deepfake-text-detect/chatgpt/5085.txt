In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they 're pregnant might be considered rape by some definitions; it seems to me that this should not only violate their bodily autonomy but also their rights under the constitution and laws already mentioned above. Also, these are now being discussed in the United States as part of the FBI's sex offender registry program and not as sex offenders themselves! Advertisement This makes perfect sense considering the vast majority of the world population predates the United States. The law enforcement agencies advocates for the sexual assault victims who want to abolish the lawlessness regarding the criminalization of sexual intercourse point out that there is no reason why anyone must suffer sexual abuse if they were born in the US. They believe that the justice system has been abolished over time due to sexual orientation discrimination against LGBT individuals because homosexuality was previously illegal Guidelines warn against discriminating based on sexual orientation. The sexual assault survivors urge us to look at why we've become so divided about homosexuality nowadays (see also: "Why is homosexuality taboo?. According to the Survivors Network of those Abused By Love website the following statistics reveal that between 1990 and 2015 heterosexual couples were raped or sexually assaulted more than six times per 1 million lives, which creates an imbalance where fewer than two thirds of couples report having unprotected intimacy with each other while nearly half complain about sexual exploitation involving coercion during intimate relationships. And a 2013 study showed that sexual assault victimization can lead to suicide rates higher than prison rape cases - and the most common treatment method for rape victims used worldwide is physical violence such as torture. According to the Equality Committee, some witness reports indicate that homosexuality leads to sexual addiction among minors committing crimes upon conviction - from violent rapes committed before marriage where children cannot consent to consensual sexual relations to involuntary celibacy committed after sexual exploitation involves preventing incestuous sexual contact through coercion. As a public public health issue, sexual assault prevention should not be taboo given its harmful effects - including dying young people from HIVAIDS on average 10 years earlier compared with non-HIV infections resulting from birth control pills released into the environment. Sexual assault survivor advocate Shawna Klee says sexual assault represents a health crisis today affecting many families across America despite efforts to eliminate stigma around sexual assault. What's more disturbing is the reaction to sexual assault survivors' stories from conservative Christians," she writes. "There have been ongoing debates amongst Christians regarding whether the Bible tells lies or not." Even though the Bible confirms sexual assault survivors' claims that Jehovah's Witness churches promote sex abuse, many evangelicals view sexual assault as sinful behavior even though the Bible explicitly condemns sexual intimacy between adults. Christians need to learn how easy it is to make false accusations against survivors without engaging in any kind of investigation necessary prior to publication of evidence consistent with the Bible's teachings. Christians need to acknowledge that Christianity is inherently immoral and biblical - suggesting that human sexuality is nonconformist commands enough are simply wrong ideas. Other factors may contribute to sexual assault convictions occurring sooner rather than later. According to the Crimes Against Children Task Force, sexual assaults occur faster than other forms of crime. According to the Violence Against Women Act, incarcerated people commit 36 percent greater rates of violent offenses than nonviolent offenders. This statistic indicates that those convicted of committing sexual assaults often do not realize what happened until afterward. Advertisement Studies show that transgender identities appear to positively impact rape detection rate. According to the American Psychological Association, trans women of color tend to identify as transgender men instead of female males and women of color tend to identify themselves as female. Transgender persons persecuting LGBTQ individuals include people of color accused of rape and sexually assaulting other people involved in sexual assault attacks. Sexual assault survivors deserve both respect and protection. Instead of hiding behind their religious beliefs, we need to recognize that anti-LGBTQ legislation has grave consequences for American society, as well as for the sexual assault survivors whose stories have been censored online, bullied by the leaders in power and persecuted all too frequently. We need to protect ourselves once again from sexual predators who seek to silence those whom they dislike, as well as survivors victimized by abusers like Kavanaugh. We need to improve existing laws protecting sexual assault survivors firstly - and by doing so we will ensure more survivors avoid repeating the abuses perpetrated against them decades ago since the law passed.
