I believe that we are at the point where we potentially could avoid bringing about catastrophic climate change, but to do that we would need to drop absolutely everything, to the extent that we have ever done before. I know, the idea of literally dropping everything, from the way we raise our food to the way we power our homes, from the way we buy our clothes to the way we travel, sounds like a lot to do. It is. And the problem with the climate crisis is that we have to do it all in very little time. So, how do we go about this? How do we do what we need to do to stop the climate crisis in the time that we have? Firstly, we have to stop talking about it. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying we should stop caring about the climate, or talking about it, or being angry about it. I'm saying we have to stop talking about it as if we have a plan, as if we know what we're doing. We don't. We have to stop pretending that we know how to solve the climate crisis, and we have to stop pretending that we have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change. Because, the way things are right now, we are heading for 3 to 4 degrees of warming this century. We are heading for a world where we are only 10 years away from the tipping point after which we can't return to a safe climate. We know this because the science has told us so, and the science is right. Scientists have shown us that we have just 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate change. Scientists have shown us that we are not doing nearly enough to stop climate change. Scientists have shown us that the climate crisis is the defining issue of our generation. And yet we do not treat it as such. There are people in this room right now who have made decisions in the last week about how they're going to spend their money. And there are other people in this room who are going to spend the next week deciding whether to invest in a business that does something that they know is not good for the climate. All of these decisions will have consequences. And none of them will be made with the climate in mind. You see, the reason people make decisions that are not good for the climate is because they do not believe that climate change is happening, or if they do believe it's happening they do not believe that it is a problem. The reason people do not take climate change seriously is because they think it is too far off. They think that the problem is too big. They think that the situation is hopeless. There's a big difference between believing that something is too far away to worry about, and believing that something is too far away to save. Because that's what this is. The climate crisis is a problem that is too far away to save. And if you don't believe me, take a moment to think about it. Imagine that you have a deadline of 12 years. Imagine that you have a very long list of things to do, and you know that you need to do everything on that list to make it to the deadline. And imagine that there are people who are telling you that you have a better chance of making it to the deadline if you do something else, or if you don't do something else, or if you do things in a different order, or if you do things in a different way. Now, imagine that the people who are telling you this have a very clear understanding of how to do the things on your list. And imagine that everyone else knows this, too. If you don't do what you need to do, the problem is that you will not make it to the deadline. So, you have a very short amount of time to get the things done. And there are other people who are also trying to do the same thing, and they are also very busy. If you do not do what you need to do, you will be late to the deadline. There is a finite amount of time to get the things done. And you are late to the deadline. The people who are telling you this do not have the same knowledge that you do. They do not know how to get all the things done, and they do not know how long it will take you. They do not know what other people are doing or how they're doing it. If you do not do what you need to do, then you will be late to the deadline. There is a finite amount of time to get the things done.
