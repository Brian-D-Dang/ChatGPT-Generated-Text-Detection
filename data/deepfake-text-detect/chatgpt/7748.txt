One possible counter-argument to that opinion would be that the US Constitution and its amendments have stood the test of time and have provided the framework for one of the most stable and enduring democracies in the world. While some parts of the Constitution may be outdated or in need of clarification, the document as a whole has proven to be a durable and adaptable foundation for American governance. Furthermore, the process of amending the Constitution is deliberately designed to be difficult, requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. This ensures that any changes to the Constitution reflect a broad consensus among the American people and are not the result of short-term political impulses. Instead of calling for a complete rewrite or regular updating of the Constitution, proponents of reform might focus on advocating for specific amendments or addressing areas where the Constitution is ambiguous or unclear. This would preserve the essential principles and framework of the Constitution while allowing for necessary updates and improvements.
