In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn't work that way. And even though they're not hard to put together once I got the hang of how each piece fit into their designated space and I was able to finish this one very quickly (because there are only 20 pieces) it took me an hour from start to finish because my brain just wasn't functioning properly for whatever reason today sigh! I LOVE playing these kinds of games but sometimes when things don't flow quite right or something is confusing like math problems...not so much fun anymore lol
