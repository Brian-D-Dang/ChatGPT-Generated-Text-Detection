Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a lost war. A war where we fought against the communists, but lost, after years of fighting and thousands of lives lost. We were a technologically advanced nation, but outmatched by the communists who were determined to destroy us. And they almost did. So when I think about Iraq, I can't help but compare it to Vietnam. And the only thing I'm seeing is our forces being put in a situation where they can't win. Let's start with the weapons. I'm not a weapons expert by any means, so I don't know all the fine details. But the simple facts are this: the communists had the Russians, and we had the U.S. (and other allies). Well, the communists have just as many weapons as we have, if not more. I understand that we can win by outnumbering them, but that is very difficult. Most likely we will have to use sophisticated weapons, but then we get into the tricky area of international law. Can you really justify dropping a bomb on a country that has a pretty advanced military force (think of North Korea, for example)? The answer might be yes, because if you don't do that you're handing the war to them, but then you have to ask yourself if you really want to start that slippery slope. Now there are some people who think that if we just let the terrorists have their way with us, then we will send a message to the world. Well, if that's the case, then what about the message we send by having weapons that are supposedly sophisticated enough to kill entire countries? You can't send a message by allowing innocent people to die, and if you want to kill innocent people, then you might as well start killing people at home. So there are people who say we should use these weapons in Iraq, and there are others who say we shouldn't, and there are the people who have their own ideas. But the one thing I know is this: we are in a very difficult position. We don't have the technology to back up our claims that we are the good guys, and we don't want to lose by being outmatched, so the only thing we can do is back out of the war. But this brings up a very interesting point. I wonder if Bush, who has been preaching against the communists, is going to back out of Iraq. And if he doesn't, what kind of message does that send? I know that he wants to send a message to the rest of the world, but do we really want to send that message? If we do, then what about the message we send by supporting one of the richest nations in the world, and supporting war that many of us don't even want? I know that many of you disagree with me, and I'm sorry if this is rude, but I'm just trying to get people to think. I'm not trying to be mean, and I know that I'm not right, but at least I have something to say. I know that I can't change anything, but I know that I can at least try.
