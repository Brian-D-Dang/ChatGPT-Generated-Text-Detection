Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this below). I believe that the government does not need to make all decisions for us, nor can it, and that they should limit their interference with our lives as much as possible. I believe that the individual knows best. Of course, in the context of CMV this will be a bit more complicated. We are the CMV community and as such we should stick together, look after each other and support one another. We should share ideas, work together, and support each other in our decisions and our actions. There are aspects of the government that I would like to see reduced, such as the role of the state in the education system. The government already has far too much influence over what we teach children and what they learn. I would like to see the government take a back seat and let parents take responsibility. I would like to see the government cut back on the amount of control that they have over the education system, and I would like to see them cut back on the amount of money they spend on it. I would like to see a major cut in the amount of money that is spent on education by the government. The private sector should be given more responsibility, in terms of helping children to get an education. But I do not believe that the government should be in charge. I do not believe that the government should have control over the education of our children, and I do not believe that they should spend our money on such an extensive system. I would like to see them give money to charities and other organisations to help children get an education. I would like to see the government take the money they spend on education and give it to charities. I would like to see these charities taking the money that the government gives them and using it to give children free education. There are many private schools in the UK, and many of them are very good. There are many charities that are working to give children free education. The government should be giving these charities money and helping these children. The government should be taking responsibility for the education of children, but they should not be spending our money and controlling what they learn. The government should allow charities to give children an education, and they should then give charities money to do this. This is what I would like to see. I would like to see a lot of change in the way that the government thinks about education. I would like to see the government take a back seat and give control to parents and the private sector. I would like to see a massive cut in the amount of money that is spent by the government on education. I would like to see this money given to charities that give children an education. I would like to see the government giving money to charities to allow them to give children an education.
