I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info:) Now, while the Football League has been an independent league since its creation in 1994-95, it's another story that has never really gone away after all. This is stuff you should know about soccer fans - I mean fans who believe that women can play football if they choose and have fun playing for their country instead of being portrayed as bullies by male athletes such as Jayne Mansfield and Pochettino. Which makes sense given basketball supporters only watch the NBA playoffs due primarily because they're too busy cheering on their teams' winners.
