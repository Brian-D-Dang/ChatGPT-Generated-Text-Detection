NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, while all future apartments are stabilized as soon as they come on the market (in other words, no more free-market pricing). I'm sure there's a lot to argue about here; but it seems like an idea whose time is long overdue...
