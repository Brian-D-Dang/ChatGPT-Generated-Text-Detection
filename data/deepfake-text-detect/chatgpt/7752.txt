While some may argue that space debris is not yet a problem for the foreseeable future, the truth is that it already poses a significant threat to the sustainability of space exploration and future missions. In fact, in recent years, the number of debris objects orbiting Earth has increased exponentially, resulting in a higher risk of collisions with manned and unmanned spacecraft. Furthermore, even though some debris objects may burn up upon atmospheric re-entry, smaller debris objects can still pose a hazard to both humans and equipment, causing damage or even complete failure of space missions. Moreover, space debris also raises the concern of the Kessler Syndrome, where the collision of larger objects could result in a chain reaction of debris collisions and further exacerbate the situation. Thus, it is crucial to acknowledge the existence of this problem and to take steps towards mitigating it before it becomes a more significant issue that could halt our progress in space exploration altogether.
