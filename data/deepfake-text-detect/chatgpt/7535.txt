A counter-argument to refute the above opinion could be that private entities, including businesses and corporations, have the right to establish their own policies and regulations regarding speech and conduct within their premises or online platforms. Just like individuals have the freedom of speech, private entities also have the freedom to control the speech that takes place on their property or platform. In fact, many businesses have codes of conduct that their employees or users must follow, including speech policies. Moreover, private entities are accountable to their customers or users and must ensure that their platform or property remains a safe and inclusive space. Allowing hate speech or other harmful forms of speech to thrive on their property could lead to negative repercussions for the business, including loss of customers and reputation damage. Therefore, allowing complete freedom of speech on private property is not feasible and could result in harm to individuals or the business itself.
