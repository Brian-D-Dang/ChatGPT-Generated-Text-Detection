I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before the United States Air Force invented airplanes which was then used to launch rockets into space.' But this'scientific observation' has no practical use in scientific jargon because it takes place almost entirely outside the air force and relies on volumes not numbers,' the professor concluded.
