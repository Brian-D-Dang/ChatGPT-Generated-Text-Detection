Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but some opinions are better than others [edit: I am referring to them being morallyethically "better. If you submitted a topic to this sub with an opinion and was let down by it; your, not ours]. Well, if that decides you're 'part of the problem' then you can be awesome in my book! If your opinions were taken out of context, then you'd have to apologize for being offensive or something.
