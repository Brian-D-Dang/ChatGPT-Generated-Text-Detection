With the advent of self-driving vehicles, the unavoidable will become clear: people are terrible drivers, and operating your own car is unacceptably reckless if a better alternative exists. I see this as one of several reasons why there's a lot more room in our society for legal gambling than was true even 20 years ago - an industry that has been completely transformed by technology. Technology also makes it possible to do things we would never have contemplated yesterday but which make sense today - like communicating with someone on another continent across multiple devices at once from anywhere you happen be. All these advances will help us understand just how much extra value productivity gains can bring; maybe they won't generate enough economic growth (they probably won't) but if their effects aren't felt immediately then no one really cares about them anyway. But here's where my grand vision begins falling apart... because human beings don't change nearly fast or far enough quickly overall for all this innovation to come together into something productive without some kind of major disruption taking place first. The dramatic changes needed to make such radical progress seem unlikely given our current political climate so instead I think what might prove most useful right now before everything falls apart entirely is understanding two important lessons from history: Understand Why This Time Is Different We've had many periods throughout history when rapid technological advancement occurred without any form of social upheaval occurring simultaneously. For example during the Industrial Revolution England experienced massive wealth inequality, yet still grew massively richer over time thanks both to its new manufacturing economy and increasing literacy rates among its population leaving less work to be done per person while improving farming techniques allowed much of rural Britain to move north out of agricultural labor towards higher wages in cities. Another good example were the early days of America following independence; despite being ravaged repeatedly through war since 1776 due largely to growing tensions between newly freed slaves seeking acceptance within white American culture combined with ambitious newcomers looking to carve their names onto virgin land, industrialization proceeded apace until around 1845 when the Panic Of 1847 struck after decades of market speculation led to ballooning prices leading farmers to borrow money against future crop harvests only to find themselves unable to repay loans upon harvest failure thus setting off a chain reaction of bank failures triggered further price deflationary spirals culminating ultimately by weeks long railroad strikes resulting in widespread bankruptcies followed by depression conditions that lasted well beyond the initial downturn itself. It wasn't until roughly when Henry Ford introduced his Model T automobile along with mass production methods making automobiles affordable again did the country finally begin recovering bringing forth a period known simply as "the Gilded Age" characterized not merely by rapidly expanding personal fortunes but increased optimism and confidence allowing entrepreneurs to take risks knowing other ventures could be undertaken should those fail while investors began putting ever greater amounts of capital behind businesses due to increasingly strong returns prompting stock markets to steadily increase valuations until 1929 eventually bursting again starting the Great Depression lasting well past WWII before kicking back up again post 1950 ushering in the modern era primarily defined by rising GDP figures though not necessarily equally shared prosperity. The fact remains however that improvements in living standards almost always accompany moments of great turmoil whether financial crashes, wars, revolutions, etc - always changing the way societies function forever afterwards regardless of intentions otherwise, usually for the worse initially, often returning later down the road via subsequent disruptions having learned valuable lessons previously unlearned which lead humanity in general toward renewed prosperity. And therefore nothing worth doing ever comes easy nor does anything worth achieving occur naturally overnight which allows plenty of opportunity for everyone involved who pays attention and perhaps learns the old adage that Rome wasn't built in a day although evidence suggests she didn't burn herself either. Therefore please remember always keep calm carry on investing accordingly..
