While it's true that the GOP's influence in the Senate may pose a challenge to Bernie Sanders' agenda, it's important to note that the president has the power to use executive orders to initiate changes without approval from Congress. Additionally, Sanders can also work on building bipartisan support for his policy proposals and finding common ground with the GOP where possible. History has shown that even with a divided Congress, presidents can still make significant progress on their agendas by working with the opposition party. Therefore, it's premature to assume that Sanders won't be able to follow through on his promises simply because the GOP is influential in the Senate.
