I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. It's something that just seems lacking in flavor and aroma. That being said, is there a way to learn howwhat you are missing? Are they some kind of notes or flavors so small as to be virtually unnoticeable... And if so what would these be? Can this change with age at all? Or simply experience? Also not sure whether it matters from region.. West coast vs East etc. Any thoughts greatly appreciated! Thanks A: Your taste buds aren't really the problem - your brain isn't picking up on them properly either because you've got no concept of 'taste'. You're experiencing coffee beans as an object rather than sensory impression. Your tongue can detect bitterness and sweetness, sourness and saltiness, and a whole host of other flavours, however we perceive those flavour sensations as instantly recognizable events. We don't think about any of our experiences except when they are recalled by memory later on, so the fact you're not recalling anything tells us nothing useful yet. The only thing you'll get out of trying to analyze why you dislike drinking coffee will come down to 'because I didn't enjoy it' which is circular reasoning; I'd suggest instead experimenting with different types of coffees until you find one you actually start enjoying. Passionate people tend towards liking certain kinds of food more than others (think chips over sandwiches) but most people eventually settle into their preferred type once they realise its preferences don't match theirs equally well.
