I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. The only good thing about it was saving millions of lives from starvation through the Marshall Plan. I think we were largely responsible for preventing an even worse Holocaust than WWII. We saved more people by doing nothing compared with what would have happened if the Nazis won both wars.
