We have a responsibility to prevent massacres or civil wars in foreign countries because we are one of the only ones who can. We are one of the only ones who has the power to prevent the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths that result from this kind of conflict. We have the responsibility to prevent these massacres because we can. It's as simple as that. The question is whether or not we are going to continue to stand idly by and watch. The question is whether or not we are going to continue to invest in the status quo and continue to stand idly by as we watch hundreds of thousands of people die and millions more flee their homes. Or are we going to act? Are we going to take that responsibility seriously? Are we going to make sure that this isn't happening in our name? Are we going to make sure that we don't allow the atrocities to continue because that is our responsibility? That is what we do as a country. That is what we are good at. We are a country built on an idea. We are a country built on the concept that all people are created equal and that all people are endowed with certain inalienable rights. Now, we have not always lived up to that ideal. We have made mistakes, and we have fallen short of our ideals. But we have never been afraid to recognize that. We have never been afraid to admit that we made a mistake. We have never been afraid to admit when we made a mistake. We have never been afraid to say, "OK, we made a mistake," and try to do better. My friends, that is who we are as a country. That is what we do. We do not shirk from our responsibilities. We do not hide from our mistakes. We do not try to pretend that we have no responsibility. We do not point fingers. We do not do any of that. Instead, we put aside our interests, we put aside our politics, we put aside our differences, and we have a conversation about how we can do better. That is who we are. My friends, that is why I hope that we can come together on a bipartisan basis and act. Because if we do not act, if we allow the atrocities to continue, if we allow the bloodshed to continue, if we allow this to continue in our name, if we allow the thousands of people to die, if we allow hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes, and if we allow the atrocities to continue, we will have blood on our hands. We will have blood on our hands. We will have made a decision, and we will have made a choice that will haunt us for years to come. And so, I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will join me in making sure that we do not allow these atrocities to continue. I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will join me in making sure that we do not allow this to continue. I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will join me in taking the responsibility seriously, and I hope that we can come together on a bipartisan basis and act.
