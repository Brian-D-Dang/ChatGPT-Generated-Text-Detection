I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need to go outside for a smoke? If it was legalized I bet there would still very few users as people realize the negative aspects of smokingchewing. My god no why is it so hard to kick this habit
