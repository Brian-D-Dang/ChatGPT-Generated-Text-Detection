Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make it free for everybody (including myself), but that's not what I'm proposing here I think you'll find there are a lot more than just 90 who don't have college paid by their parents
