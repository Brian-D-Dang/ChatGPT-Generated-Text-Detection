For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system in which no corporation does not own all property and share it equally among its members (workers). Now both capitalism and socialism are based on some sort of hierarchy: under capitalistic systems there are bosses who make decisions for everybody else; while in socialist societies workers have to make their decision together and vote... but that's where things get interesting. Because when we start looking at actual facts about how these two systems work out, we find very different results! Let us take an example from my home country Finland - what do you think would be better? A) Capitalism B) Socialism or C) Both?
