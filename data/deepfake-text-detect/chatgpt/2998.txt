First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are being used to keep these bears alive when it would be much more cost effective to simply put them out of their misery. I don't know about you but every time I see a panda bear in the wilds of China or wherever he happens to be at the moment, my heart aches knowing there will never again ever be another one of his kind here on earth (barring cloning) because people who couldn't differentiate between an endangered animal and a teddy bear have decided it's important to save pandas for no good reason other than they're "cute." Your argument of "it wouldn't make sense" doesn't really hold water either since so many things make absolutely no sense anymore!
