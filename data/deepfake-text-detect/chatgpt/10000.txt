I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm not sure if this is true). I think it's important to remember that everyone has different boundaries and comfort levels when it comes to sex, and different people make different choices about their bodies. That said, I think it's important to have an honest conversation with your friend about the risks they could be taking by sleeping with so many people and ensure they are taking all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their partners.
