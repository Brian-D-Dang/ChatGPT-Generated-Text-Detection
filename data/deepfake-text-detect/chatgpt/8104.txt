I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that are running. It's hard for me to understand why people will actually vote on these radio shows or adverts because they only give personal opinions about the person not actual facts of what heshe is doing as a mayor local government official etc.... So it encourages more hatred instead off getting involved with politics at all levels... Maybe you should look into ways our present day politicians do things regarding political advertising (As an example here we have restrictions like no billboards within 200 feet from schools), being able go against them would be really interesting if done right!!!!!!
