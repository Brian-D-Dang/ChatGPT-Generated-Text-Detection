I believe that people have a moral obligation to donate money they do not need. Full stop. But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of charity, and should not be treated as such by those who seek its assistance or benefit from it. The government does provide assistance for the poor and needy through several means: welfare programs, food stamps, public schoolsdaycare centers, etc., but these are all designed with one purpose in mind - to keep them reliant on the state rather than self-sufficient and productive members of society. This does nothing more than serve to rob the taxpayer of their hard earned capital so that they can remain dependent upon an institution which exists solely to take care of them instead of empowering themselves. Thus, while I am sympathetic towards individual charities and groups doing good work out there, we must never forget that our first responsibility lies within ourselves - as individuals if possible, and as a community when necessary; always taking the time to teach others how to help themselves before relying upon external institutions to do it for us. Taxation is theft at any level. It is only fair because everyone's income belongs to someone else anyway, right? What about the fact that you earn your own living and then contribute every single cent back into society via taxes whereas other citizens don't? That makes no sense whatsoever. Even homeless veterans get free healthcare, housing and education courtesy of the American taxpayer. All they had to do was sign up! There goes my respect for this country...
