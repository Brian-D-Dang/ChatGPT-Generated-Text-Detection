Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, do people have so much trouble looking for this knowledge? I think the issue is in our own self-pride and ego. Some of us are simply afraid to admit ignorance on any subject, and we go through life thinking we're smarter than others (and by extension ourselves). We fear a drop in status if we don't "know" something well enough, even when there's no reason to feel inadequate in some other area. That makes sense; after all, what could be worse than being labeled as ignorant and having nobody take you seriously because your expertise doesn't match up with their level of education or experience?! But does this mean that learning never happens? Not necessarily - because the same concerns can make one person more likely to seek out information from credible sources while another would rather stay oblivious and remain blissfully unaware. The key though: awareness! Once upon a time, my wife used to laugh at me whenever I tried reading business literature or technical manuals. She'd say things like, "You may see these terms again." My response was always, "Why not?" It took her until I read How to Read a Book before she had faith in my ability to understand anything written long ago. This happened in spite of the fact that I'm now a software developer and work with coding daily. When I've heard from my friends that they're trying to figure out how to configure Nginx, I tell them I'll explain it over coffee. And, yes, sometimes they ask questions and hear my explanations, too. Even better, they start using our server when they realize I wasn't just making stuff up... I didn't come home with a general understanding of everything related to Information Technology but with specific realizations in fields that interested me. Adapting to meet new challenges isn't easy; instead of accepting the new problem as yet another hurdle to overcome, many find prideful reasons to claim superiority as the solution. I recently saw a great example of this phenomenon: A friend told me he was working with a group of twits and constantly getting into arguments where he felt compelled to insist he knew everything compared to the other idiots around him. In reply, his coworker said, "How can you possibly expect everyone else to accept your superior wisdom unless YOU first acknowledge YOUR OWN INADEQUACY!" He went on to point out that without humility we perpetuate arrogance and ultimately harm those closest to us. Sadly, there will always be room for such flawed human beings; we're only humans after all. This article describes an effective way of testing your assumptions about yourself based on the queries you send Google, which might help improve both your search engine results and your decision process. The Process Here's what needs to happen... 1.

Google Adwords Keyword Research: What You Need To Know For Effective Use Of Keywords As An SEO Tool Posted On Byoogleblog May 12th 2010 The very foundation of search marketing lies in keyword research. Finding high quality, relevant keyword targets can drastically increase traffic flow and profits. With the right combination of keywords, websites ranking among the top 10 positions of major search engines can usually generate hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. Whether you specialize in improving traffic or generating leads for offline businesses, this post explains why essential inquiry skills are critical components in determining whether your efforts pay off. So far, Google has made webmasters play fair by automatically giving sites higher rankings in searches that use synonyms in titles and descriptions. Until now, staying away from gaming the system meant deviating from your site's natural subject matter. However, that changes today. Because most search results pages include snippets of text along with a link back to the original source page, it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid links showing up next to content.
