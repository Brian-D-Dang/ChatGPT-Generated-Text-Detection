My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother and father were shouting at each other over something about him not having his homework done by 4pm, when they had expressly told him it was OK to do it all day if he wanted (I haven't met them yet so I can only speak from what my GF says) but that they needed their son back "in school." My GF friend returned from work crying, saying she couldn't believe how mean-spirited people could be at such an early age! So far as we know this family have never been involved with any type of therapy or support group. We are completely taken aback...it seems like this incident has unleashed some latent demons within her; she feels guilt for being too lenient towards his behaviour, which apparently comes with mealtimes etc, since it caused trouble before things got out of hand. She also wonders why Dad wasn't there to help reason with Mommy, even though it sounds like neither parent really wants anything more than for everything to go back to normal despite knowing better. There does seem to be much abuse in both families; however, everyone knows that they will get no help unless someone steps up to make big changes. We're concerned this little boy might become just another statistic due to lack of intervention on behalf of these parents. He already suffers depressionanxiety issues so we don't want things getting worse - any ideas? Any advice would greatly appreciated!! Thanks!!! A: Your girlfriend should talk to a therapist herself - preferably together with your wife. They need professional guidance. On top of that you may need counseling yourself. Don't take on all responsibility here, others did mess up years ago and still continue behaving badly. Some might blame themselves now, but "blame" and "self-reproach" are two different emotions. You need to deal with anger. And you need to look back into history. Were those kind of behaviors ever acceptable among relatives when you grew up? Was there ever violence between parents or siblings? If yes, then you must accept that it happens everywhere else too except on TV shows where bad behavior will always result in punishment. There needs to be consequences for children and parents alike. Otherwise, nothing gets learned. Your girlfriend should learn the same lessons as everybody else, including those of us on superuser.com. It is important to find appropriate interventions. But you cannot change people who are unwilling to change. All you can do is try to prevent future problems.
