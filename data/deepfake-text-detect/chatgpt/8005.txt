While it is true that not everyone may choose to get married or feel that marriage is necessary to establish a committed relationship, for others, marriage offers legal, financial and emotional benefits that cannot be replicated without it. For example, marriage offers legal protections for both partners in terms of inheritance, property ownership, and tax benefits. Additionally, research shows that married couples have higher levels of satisfaction and commitment compared to those in non-married relationships. Finally, marriage often brings with it social and cultural benefits such as social network expansion and a sense of belonging to a larger community. Therefore, while marriage may not be the right choice for everyone, it's still a valid expectation for those who wish to establish a lifelong committed relationship.
