I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other tattoos and decide they want something similar. It's always a bad idea to copy someone else's tattoo, even if you love the design. Each tattoo should be unique and personal to you. You may find inspiration from other designs, but try to make it your own by customizing it in some way, or by adding a symbol that has meaning to you. Even if you get a similar design as someone else, make sure to choose different colors, placement, and size so that it looks distinct.
