With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more than one way to deal with gun violence. We're not talking about an issue so simple as whether or not we are capable of controlling our guns, however. We have laws on the books against mass murder which make it illegal for anyone who has been convicted of killing another person in order to commit a crime (or to avoid prosecution) from owning any sort of firearm. I know this is going to sound like I'm saying someone can get away with murder just by being denied the right to owncarry a weapon, but let me explain. There's no law barring me from carrying a knife or something similar to defend myself if I need to because everyone else already owns a car or whatever they use to carry around their knives. That does seem kind of odd though doesn't it? In all honesty, why would you think that a person who was caught committing a crime would die before taking the next step to commit it again? Why would they escape punishment at all given the length of time they've served in prison? Well those laws do exist to protect society from dangerous offenders. They also protect us from criminals. Right now, keeping a gun to go along with your knife isn't really necessary unless you want to commit crimes. And even then, using one against someone while defending yourself is fine. It may not be good health wise, but we allow cars with tools inside them for exactly these reasons - they aren't necessary to drive safely, but they help keep others safe too! What happens when someone drives drunk, runs over a pedestrian, then accidentally cuts off somebody's arm while trying to steal his wallet? If you cut off part of someones arm while trying to take their money, what makes you think you won't try to take other parts of their body once you have your chance at getting away with stealing their wallet? Obviously none of these scenarios will ever result in death, yet those points point out that self defense laws work: they stop criminals who otherwise could kill other people while doing harm. There's a huge difference between needing a weapon and intending to use one against someone. Using a weapon, especially if used against another, is not necessarily bad form. Someone might feel threatened by being attacked with a machete; it doesn't mean they intend to use it to kill. Same goes for gun ownershipuse - without a gun, how many times have people tried robbing banks? One person might decide to buy a home-made bomb that he intends to detonate outside of a bank, or maybe even walk into a building himself knowing full well that no one is armed and no one will react positively to him carrying a bomb or any type of deadly device. The same thing applies here. A gun allows you to defend yourself regardless of intent, whereas possession of a knife means you stand a better chance of hurting someone rather than helping themselves to anything valuable. For example, lets say you find someone pushing a customer towards the vending machine to get change. You approach the man and ask him where everything is. He tells you he needs some money. Now either he gives you his money, or you tell him he can have some instead, but nothing further. He immediately starts stabbing at you more aggressively, and you realize he has hidden a gun. Should you shoot him dead, or should you wait until the police arrive and arrest him after they remove the knife? Because stabbing the guy multiple times will only hurt you more, and he'll probably shoot back. Then you become suspect number 1 - doesn't matter if he actually intended to kill you - because nobody would believe you if you said he did. So now you risk facing charges if you do catch him shooting you multiple times with a gun. Or worse still, you run away screaming because you don't want to be charged for something you didn't even intend to do. If you're unsure about what "intent" really means, read up on it yourself. Intent isn't a legal term, but it basically refers to your specific mental state. Intention is when you fully expect to cause bodily harm or death. For instance, if you stab someone several times, there's almost certainly intent that leads to their death, but at the same time, no proof exists that indicates you intentionally planned to cause bodily injury or death. So does intent play into deciding whether someone can legally possess a gun? Absolutely. But since there's no real evidence proving you were responsible enough to prevent accidents or plan ahead for emergencies, it shouldn't impact your ability to own firearms and ammunition. You can't always predict danger, either, so if you haven't taken measures to prepare for dangers such as emergency evacuation or mass slaughter, then obviously you can never be completely prepared. However, the severity of each situation varies greatly depending on circumstances. The idea behind allowing people to share a tool kit with weapons such as knives or axes is more simple and soon and provided a budget accountability and localism. bamboo bam sounds dings.bou chik Chilly.
