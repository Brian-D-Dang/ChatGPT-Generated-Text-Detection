I believe that "Buckle up, it's the law" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority] which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they want to. [But]... the one that I've always liked, and you can go to any traffic safety program and they will tell you, is "Click it or Ticket." That is a very good slogan. It is very simple. You have a repetition of the action, and it really is a very good way to get people's attention. And of course the one I think the best of all is "Alive at 25," the program that we did to save young people's lives. That's the best one of all. I've never been a big fan of slogans, but I do like "Click it or Ticket." "Alive at 25" is a good one, too.

"Clowns are tough to define, so I think the best way to do it is to say they're basically people who are trying to make people feel better. So even in their darkest moments, they're trying to make people feel better. And I think that's what comedians do in a way. I mean, the thing that I've always found interesting about clowns is that you never see them have a bad day. They're always trying to make people feel good. And I think that is so fascinating. And so that's my definition of a clown."

Liberals, most of them, want to tell people what to do. They think that they know better than the rest of us. Conservatives, most of them, want to give people space to figure things out for themselves. And, as a rule, conservatives are a lot more willing to listen than liberals are."

"The new rules will require nonprofit organizations that engage in political activity to disclose their contributors to the IRS, and would bar donations from corporations, unions and foreigners, among others. The changes also set minimum thresholds that will raise the dollar amounts at which certain nonprofits must file paperwork with the IRS."

"For example, the fly has one of the most complex brains of any animal. But it is hard to understand how a fly's brain could explain the seemingly irrational behavior of swarming. 'It's a mystery, a real challenge,' said [Amaral]. 'But we're getting there. Amaral thinks that he's cracked the mystery. He thinks he's found the neurons that make up the "swarming circuit." But the brain of the common fruit fly is only 100,000 neurons. It's less than 1 of the 10 billion or so neurons in the human brain, making it easy to trace the fly's neural circuitry. By contrast, the human brain is so complex that scientists still haven't completely unraveled it. "We do not know how the brain of 10 billion neurons can create a sense of self, the ability to make meaningful choices, and all of the other miraculous properties of the human brain," [Amaral] wrote.
