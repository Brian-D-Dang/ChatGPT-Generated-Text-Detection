I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the opportune commentary. Now, I'm going to try to be comforted. But I don't know if I should be. Just look at this fucking mop. I am a little embarrassed.
