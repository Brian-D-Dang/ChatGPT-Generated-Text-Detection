To start, I'm not here to discuss wealth distribution, or income inequality. They are real issues that need to be addressed, and as much as governments like to talk about them, the truth is they don't like to actually fix them. In any event, the original question was "are we really better off," so I'll stick to that. But first let's put this in context. Most people think we have an economy that works. It's a system that allows everyone to pursue their dreams and go as far as they can. If you work hard and have ambition, there's nothing stopping you. The only thing stopping you is the lack of talent or the lack of drive. That's what they say. That's what I used to think too. What I've learned over the last few years is that it's really not that simple. The reality is that the system is rigged and you need to know how it works in order to be successful. I've found that the people who succeed are those who understand the system, and know how to exploit it. It's as simple as that. This isn't new information. It's been known for decades. But few people talk about it. For example, at the beginning of the 20th century, the average lifespan was 46 years old. In 1945, it was 63. That's a 17 year increase in the lifespan. If you were around at that time, you probably remember the introduction of the idea of retirement. It was all about making sure people could retire at the age of 65. That was when people were expected to be done working, and start to receive government support. Well, it didn't work out quite that way. People are now living much longer, and 65 is considered young by most people. The reason why people live longer is because of medical advancements. I was sick for the first 20 years of my life. I was in the hospital for a total of 11 times. When I was 20, the doctors told my mom that they were about to give up. I was terminal, and there was nothing they could do. Well, I'm not terminal anymore, and I'm not sick. I'm a healthy, successful man in his early 30s. But that's just me. What about the millions of people who are sick and don't have any hope of ever getting better? What about those who are so sick that they can barely walk, or those who are so sick that they can barely think? What about those who are so sick that they are bed-ridden, and can't even get out of bed? There are lots of sick people out there, and most of them will never get better. But the system is built to work for them. As a matter of fact, the system works for most people who are sick and can't work. And it works for those who can't afford healthcare either. I'm not talking about welfare. I'm talking about the government pension system. Did you know that you don't have to work to get a government pension? It doesn't matter if you're sick, or if you have no income, or if you're working at McDonald's. You don't need a job to receive a pension. The government will take your money anyway. You don't even have to pay taxes. The reality is that there's an entire segment of the population that's dependent on government support. But it's not just those who can't work. There's also a large number of people who are not working, but don't need to. They have a job that pays them enough, and they know that they can't get fired, so they don't have to worry about working. This is what I call the "safety" class. There's plenty of money to go around, so everyone who wants a job can have one, and if you don't want to work, then don't. There's enough for everyone. You can be 50, or 60, or 70, or even 80 years old, and you can still get a job. So yes, there's lots of money in this system, and it works for a lot of people. It works for most people. But it doesn't work for me. And it doesn't work for anyone who wants to work hard and climb the corporate ladder. There's no room for that. The
