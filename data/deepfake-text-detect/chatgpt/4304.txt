Before I continue, I would like to start by saying that I am not a pedophile and that I am strongly against the sexual abuse of children. My view is very similar to paedophiles in my opinion: I'm just as much interested in watching sex between adults as I am with young people having sex. In fact, there are few more innocent things on this earth than the feeling you get when someone else's genitals touch your own. I have a different take on porn, however, which is that it should be treated as the art form it was developed for - something akin to painting or drawing or poetry or anything else really. Sure you may watch all those videos once every month at some point during adolescence but what about reading books? Or looking at photographs? That seems perfectly normal to me. Porn has no place in our lives and needs to go away because people need to realise exactly how crazy they sound if they think its ok for their sondaughter to see naked cartoon characters doing naughty things. And frankly, who cares tits and ass anyway? It doesn't make them any better, just slightly less disgusting.
