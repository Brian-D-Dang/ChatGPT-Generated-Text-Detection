As long as I've been alive, I've always poured milk before cereal. I've done this because I am a textural eater and I hate soggy cereal. I believe that pouring the milk first does it all. My brother and sister, however, have recently started pouring the cereal in first. They do this because they are children and they are probably more adventurous. It's time to look at this debate from a scientific perspective. Firstly, I'll look at the texture issue. If the milk was poured first, it would dilute the cereal and cause it to be soggy. If the cereal was poured first, the milk would not dilute the cereal and it would still be crunchy. Now, I'm not saying that I have any proof to back up this claim, but I think that it is more likely to be true that the milk dilutes the cereal. This is because you are more likely to get more milk in your mouth when you pour it than you are when you pour the cereal in first. This is due to the fact that the bottom of the bowl is the same size as the top of the bowl so when the milk is poured first, it's less likely to spill out. Next, I'll look at the taste aspect. If the cereal was poured first, it would be covered with milk and you wouldn't get to taste the milk. If the milk was poured first, you would get to taste the milk first and then the cereal. I believe that the taste is more important than the texture in this debate. This is because some people may not like the texture but some people might like the taste more than the texture. In conclusion, I believe that the milk should be poured first because the taste is more important than the texture.
