For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system which allows individuals to dominate markets and control their own resources by providing people at least three things: currency, wealth distribution (including money) and an equal opportunity for citizens to earn income without regard to any individual's freedom; it also provides no obligation on behalf of those who live in regions where there are no basic freedoms such as freedom from interference or coercion other than what is necessary to survive life itself." (bold minefields exception). Libertarian economists are concerned about freedom when capitalism has been characterized as an anarcho-capitalist system since Marxism was conceptualized so long ago.) Libertarian economics generally emphasizes class struggle over personal liberty since there can be no force greater than the powerlessness of individuals. This view may seem detrimental if you're trying to overcome tyranny but this isn't true economically since real societies collapse under anarchymonarchy because political strife is bad enough already. Libertarianism gives people more rights given that they have fewer options relative to capitalism compared to socialism. Instead of getting angry about the rules changing due to revolution, we need to get angry about skyrocketing prices being imposed upon us simply because socialism would only lead to economic ruin rather than providing Americans with better lives and economy. In short, anyone who opposes Capitalism needs to go back to school instead of worrying about socialism. Where does this leave us? Some say Liberty, others insist on the "free market." Some argue that public sector unions should make sure employers provide employees with health insurance while others argue against the government forcing businesses to hire workers. The vast majority oppose government using taxpayer money to subsidize corporations that profit off the backs of workers' hard work or create jobs elsewhere outside of America. None want governments putting the profits of private companies above all else. However, all agree that the optimal level of protectionality ought to balance out governmental abuses caused by greed. In other words, we shouldn't worry too much regarding socialism since there seems little chance it could cause unrest within our society. If we aren't worried about Socialism then why do we care about Communism now anyway? Libertarians argue that capitalism creates unrest - especially between individuals - whereas socialists believe that workers deserve fairness regardless of how much private property exists. Libertarians can see through the hypocrisy and deny Capitalism from working together, while socialists look down on any social uprising triggered by government policies like austerity. Both views actually hold some truthfulness considering Socialism is essentially the opposite of capitalism since it promotes human happiness alone but not exploitation based on the desire to achieve prosperity. We shouldn't forget each side believes that Socialism builds better communities globally alongside its benefits including higher wages and less poverty and inequality among poorer nations compared to Capitalism. While most libertarians agree that Socialism must exist wherever possible, freedom cannot happen overnight unless everyone starts thinking collectively. Starting small hasn't helped the economy either. We need a better way to manage the environment before we really get a grip on industrialization and pollution. It doesn't seem possible to build a nation around an economy entirely dependent on government subsidies yet we just don't have time for that to happen anytime soon. There will always be some disagreements amongst libertarians concerning whether socialism creates freedom versus Communism. However, Libertarians feel that communism destroys liberties since it rewards ruthless capitalists over poor people. Conservatives complain about the stolen property protections provided by government due to the state destroying families' homes via mortgages offered by the mortgage lenders. Liberals lament the lack of government supervision represented by capitalism since it encourages "reformers," even though there isn't anything wrong here except for owning certain buildings owned by corporations. While libertarians debate the merits of the idea of free trade, the logic behind trade unionism suggests that Free Trade ensures economic stability across borders allowing businesses to thrive despite individual disadvantages depending on geography. On the other hand, conservatives claim that there is nothing inherently harmful about socialism while liberals tend toward communism since it causes authoritarianism. It appears libertarians are both optimistic and pessimistic. However, libertarian ideology relies heavily on individuals becoming responsible consumers and benefitting from free markets knowing that government intervention hurts businesses greatly since companies enjoy increased profits resulting from government regulation. This makes sense since the vast majority of economies fall prey to unsustainable levels of government intrusion into individual choice and freedom. However, libertarians disagree strongly on whether the world is rigged according to capitalism nor socialism vs Communism claiming that it runs counter to everything libertarians believe. What's less clear is whether society was created by people saying "no" to government meddling or people choosing their own destiny after consensus decisions were made. Either way many libertarians favor free enterprise assuming all politicians share their goals whilst believing that individuals decide their actions themselves. Libertarianism expresses despair comparing liberty to a corporation and centralized capitalism whereby only individuals choose their OWN fate rather than relying on governments to pick up the slack. Libertarianism lacks concern for the consequences of government involvement although similar sentiments are expressed throughout history.
