I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer want to do that? What's in it for himher? What are some of your thoughts on this topic?. Where can someone find information regarding lawsuits against law enforcement agencies who harm citizens.? Any links you may know will be appreciated also as well..
