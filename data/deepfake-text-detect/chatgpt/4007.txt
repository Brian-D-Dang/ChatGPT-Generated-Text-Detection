I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are very conservative yet a bit funny at times. Strictly speaking there's no such thing as islamic law here in Turkmenistan (if you're talking about Sharia). But oh how I wish there was!
