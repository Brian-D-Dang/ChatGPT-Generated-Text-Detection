I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by which the House guarantees each state's freedom to choose its own representative provides a guarantee against the interference in state elections. The Constitution requires each elected representative be nominated by the citizens for an annual election but does not mandate it as a body must elect a leader who will act on behalf of individual states' interest interests and take decisions regarding taxation policies or human rights issues such as immigration, firearms laws. The Trump Administration has complained about attempts to undermine the independence of states' representatives from Washington, D.C.'s influence over Congress when they supported combating Trumpism while maintaining their freedom to control legislative branches via executive orders issued directly by President Obama's administration.
