I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too large for meactually enjoy life there; instead of thinking about what things might be like if they were differentbut nothing has actually changed since my days as an American child (and also because littlebits have altered anyway). And at this point anything that's new just seemswrong: It is hard to explain why people who live on farms call everything "dairy" - even ifthey're talking chocolate milk or yogurt. It doesn't make sense: dairy isn't something you eat-it'sa drink made from cow's milk. You can get cheese, but that's usually calledcheese. There are very few places where you'll find real butter or cream; peoplecall vegetable oil olive oil. Everyone calls water "soda," thoughwater technically comes with many other names carbonated beverage," "sparklingwine," etc.). People watch TV news with all theirnews programs labeled TV News." Even when restaurants try to changeover to healthier fare by offering salads without dressing, no one knows which namecomes first: salad or dress? And then there's language. Words related to cows take up two full pages InThe New York Times each day! If that wasn't enough, people still use wordslike "cowboys" and "heelers"; these colloquialisms seem so unfamiliarthat any time someone uses them out loud, we wonder whether he meanshorse or dog. What should we say instead? We don't know, but we feel weird sayinganything else. Cows are huge animals, sure, but every once in awhile wemeet some tiny ones. "Cowpoke"? Really? Anyone ever notice that nobody talksabout dogs as being big creatures? Dogs...you mean like...? Theymeasure one foot tall max; cats measure eight feet long. They'resimply adorable compared to cows. But hey, thanks to tv shows, movies and advertising, television has helped uslearn more than languages ever could. For example, since my friend Christine told her kids that the phrase "get off your asses!" was originally meant to instruct a horse, she got lotsmore giggles during family movie nights. When she said, "That reminds meof when..." the kids knew exactly which scene to look for: the part whenthere was a scene involving horses. And now our high school studentsknow that SpongeBob Squarepants' parents lived next door to Harry Potter'sparents. Who'd have guessed? They couldn't possibly learn this stuffanywhere except through entertainment. Then again, maybe they didwhenall those books came out five years ago.This falls under the category of good parenting, yes?
