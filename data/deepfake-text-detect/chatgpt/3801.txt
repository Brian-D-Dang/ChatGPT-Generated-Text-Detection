Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on to something else. Why do we need this extra level of outrage? What does this anger accomplish in any way other than making us feel like we are better people for having our voice heard and being angry at the same time? As a society (and as The Bloggess will attest, I am just one woman) if you wish to be taken seriously, please let your actions speak for themselves, not with a wave of emotion so powerful it makes me want to scream or yell but instead speak with calmness, respect, compassion and understanding. Be wary of those who use anger and fear as tools to sway public opinion because truthfully it only makes things worse. The words "justice" and "morality" should never be used together. They are two separate things. Morality isn't determinate by who has done what wrong; it's determined based upon moral code set forth by someone superior such as God or the law. Justice means doing right according to laws provided under the Constitution. Not all punishments fit every crime so when someone commits a murder they may go to jail for life in some cases while another murderer might only go to prison for 10 years depending on their case. I find it very interesting that love and forgiveness seem to dominate the list of qualities most important in a person. Is this a sign that being compassionate towards others more often produces good results versus doing what I think is best per se? It seems almost everyone believes in an infinite amount of peace and love whereas there seems to be little to no difference between those who believe these ideals and those who don't. What would be the ultimate goal of my blog? To share stories from my life...to share experiences, lessons, and tips along the way. To help others around the world adjust to life in America, to bring meaning out of their work, to become successful parents, friends, partners, lovers, teachers, and leaders, etc. I also hope to provide encouragement and inspiration to those who seek to change the world!
