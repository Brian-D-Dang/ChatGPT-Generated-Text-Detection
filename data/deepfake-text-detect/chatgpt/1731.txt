I realize the OP is a bit vague, so let me clarify. Similar to false advertising, I believe that people who release lies (in a publishable, marketable format). This includes anything from "Scam Alert" emails to outright falsehoods in your FAQ's and Product DescriptionAbout page. That sounds like it could be a good thing then!
