On a hair dryer: "Do not use in a shower." If somebody's dumb enough to use a hair dryer in the shower, they're not going to pay much attention to the warning label. However, it's important that the warning label be there to remind people of the potential danger of using an electrical appliance near water. It's always better to be safe than sorry, and reminding consumers to be cautious is a responsible thing for manufacturers to do.
