Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make it a more universal issue than that (more free college doesn't solve income inequality or anything), but if we wanted to reduce social mobility to zero on any given continent without resorting to mass executions (which is probably not true) then reducing access for poor Americans would be an easy way to do so with relatively little cost no collateral damage when compared to other methods such as outright warfare like North Korea has engaged in against South Korea. College isn't just expensive here because they want you to pay for it through financial aid.. It's also extremely difficultcostly to get into most schools even at state universities which are much cheaper than private colleges.
