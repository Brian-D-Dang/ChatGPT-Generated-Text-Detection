I'll try not to spoil anything here for people who haven't watched Game of Thrones, but this post is specifically about events in that show. So if you don't watch it now...there's no reason to use spoiler tags or spoilers because it doesn't end after the episode ends and everything starts over again:) Also the episode ending was especially good since you can tell it's been said as much! Since it aired on HBO, I think it would be kind of unfair to say it wasn't spoiled enough..
