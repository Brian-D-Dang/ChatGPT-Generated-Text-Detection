Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one is newly married? I am not talking about a married couple, but a newly married couple. Although I have been married for 16 years, I'm just now beginning to learn that sex isn't the only reason for sex. Although I've known this for years, I didn't know why. I thought, "If you love someone, why not have sex with them?" Well, there are many reasons. 1. It's been said that the most important thing in marriage is communication. I used to think that was a load of crap, but I have learned to appreciate what that means, and how vital it is. 2. Sometimes people aren't in the mood, or just aren't feeling it. It doesn't mean there is no love, it just means that sometimes, the physical isn't happening. There are many reasons for this. 3. Many times, one of you has had a really bad day, and just needs to get away from it all. Again, it's no reflection on the marriage. 4. Many times, one of you is tired from work, or has had a busy day, and just doesn't feel like being physical. Many times, this can be remedied by a back rub, a hug, or just a good night's sleep. 5. Many times, one of you is going through menopause, and just doesn't feel like doing anything, and there are many reasons for that as well. 6. Sometimes, one of you needs time to be alone. 7. Sometimes, one of you needs to recharge their batteries. 8. Sometimes, one of you is just stressed, and just needs to take a break from life. 9. Sometimes, one of you just needs to get away from the other one, just for a little while. 10. Sometimes, one of you is going through a personal issue, and just needs to handle it without outside interference. 11. Sometimes, one of you is dealing with a personal issue, and just needs to handle it alone. 12. Sometimes, one of you is just not feeling it, and just needs to deal with it, and not make the other one feel guilty about it. 13. Many times, both of you just need some down time, and need to be left alone for a while. 14. Many times, both of you just need some time to recharge your batteries, or deal with personal issues. 15.
