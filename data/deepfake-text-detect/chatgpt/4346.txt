I recently discovered rAnglish. Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots. The result is a language that not only sounds good, but also looks good as well! Today I'll be sharing some information about this project with you. Ranglish was born out of a need for an alternative form of the language used in most parts of Europe. Because of its origins it has certain similarities to German (in the lexicon). The core language of Ranglish is Anglo Saxon (the same language which Shakespeare was writing in when he wrote Hamlet) and French. However there are many new words created within these languages which may or may not have been around before. If you would like more information on how Ranglish came into existence, check out its website: Like this: Like Loading...
