While it may seem like a noble and just cause to free Shmi and Anakin from a life of slavery, Qui-Gon Jinn could not have reasonably known the potential consequences of such actions. As a Jedi, Qui-Gon is bound by the Jedi Code to act with caution and consideration for the greater good. It is possible that if Qui-Gon had taken a more forceful approach, he could have inadvertently caused harm to innocent bystanders or worsened the socio-political tensions on Tatooine. Additionally, freeing Shmi and Anakin could have put them in even greater danger, as they would now be fugitives from their former masters and may not have had the resources or skills to survive on their own. Ultimately, Qui-Gon made the difficult but necessary decision to free only Anakin, allowing him to fulfill his destiny as the Chosen One and bring balance to the Force.
