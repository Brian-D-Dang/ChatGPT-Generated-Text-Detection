I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is some truth to the claim that things like magic and god exist then we will be able to see how science works for real humans and where things may differ from our understanding. That being said, if you believe in an afterlife and can't understand why it's such a big deal then either you're too old (or very young) for science, or you're dumb as hell. You can go back to your natural sense of self justice. Are you arguing against something here? What do you think about human evolution? Are you with me on this?
