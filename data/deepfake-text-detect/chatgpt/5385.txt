Disclaimer: this talk of secession may not be present everywhere in the United States, but it is more than prevalent where I live, so I'm going off that. To me, secession sounds like a good idea because it would certainly raise awareness and allow for unification between the various branches rather than dividing them into two separate kingdoms. The more people who can agree on one thing the better! I think I've heard secession being advocated even though my state has some secessionists... doesn't seem to make sense from an intellectual standpoint as far as I know
