One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one, which includes people with different lifestyles and backgrounds from all over the world- someone who may have been born in America but has spent his or her whole life living like they are exiled from it. That's why if I'm ever desperate for something interesting to read online in between my blogging adventures (which by now should surprise no one), I turn to Malala Yousafzai's blog at xoJane.com. The Taliban activist turned Nobel Peace Prize winner was awarded that prize today, Friday October 9th 2009. What an incredible woman! She writes about important issues: women's rights; education; peace; female empowerment... and she does so fearlessly.
