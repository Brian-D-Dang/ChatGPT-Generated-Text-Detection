Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: one for each of us, because it's a lot easier than trying to count up all my comments (or at least that seems like a lot more work). There is an advantage in having downvotes disabled from RES as well. Makes it super easy to see when they are coming or going so you can just keep building on your comment instead of waiting around until someone starts downvoting everything else before resuming normal behavior again.
