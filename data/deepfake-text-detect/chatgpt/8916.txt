To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to gay people. But as a general rule of thumb, alcohol is not okay for sexual activity. But the Supreme Court did listen - so long as it doesn't reveal its rationale behind an act calling for the legalization of the use of alcohol during sex (as required by law). The court also gave the FDA pause on its testing of alcohol products for possible adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, Joint Failure, Redness: Pain, Fever, Pain, Peripheral Pain, Seizures and Soreness. That's what this case means for all of us who've experienced alcohol abuse or other substance abuse disorder, whether those experiences were caused by alcohol abuse or any combination thereof. Alcohol abuse has no place in society today. It's okay to drink, but we shouldn't be allowing our children into drinking clubs where they don't belong. This was supposed to be a small step forward for good judgment in keeping alcohol off the streets, but it isn't - and we should be grateful for that.
