Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. I am therefore surprised to find that it is not brought out into the open very often; instead it seems to be covered by anti-Semitism which is seen as irrational hatred, with no basis whatsoever for its existence. To me this makes absolutely no sense because there have been so many examples throughout history where this has happened. A few years ago a friend mentioned that our current Canadian prime minister's great grandfather had exterminated Native Americans and rounded them all onto one reserve. Surely he wouldn't do anything like that again? Would Canadians still accept him if he did (if they ever knew)? This kind of behaviour towards minorities or groups who threaten power structures goes on today too: "Palestinians" were driven from their land after 1948 then forced back in an enforced ghetto, and any attempt at self determination is met with threats and violence. No wonder people want vengeance. Is anyone else trying to raise these issues? Are we just resigned to treating minorities badly until someone does something 'big' enough for us to notice?
