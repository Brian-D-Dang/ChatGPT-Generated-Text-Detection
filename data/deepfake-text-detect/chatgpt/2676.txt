There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a degree on someone who has completed their studies. Graduations are also used at universities as a way to acknowledge students graduating from undergraduate courses, or post-graduate courses that follow university degrees. An example of graduation can be found in US Colleges where graduates get hooded which symbolises them being'sealed with holy oil'. The word "Graduate" comes from 13 century Latin graduus: "from under." The first official use was by the University of Cambridge in 1409 when King Henry V granted it letters patent. In 1854 they were granted a royal charter making the College of St John's one of England's seven members of Oxford and Cambridge Universities.
