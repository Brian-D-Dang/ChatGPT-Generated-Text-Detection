I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys. Typewrite is a free game designed to help you learn to type quickly and efficiently. It's a fun, time-based test to see how fast you can type a given block of text. I'll discuss how to play the game and how to get the most out of your practice sessions in this article. Typewrite is designed to be played on a desktop computer, but you can also play it on your phone or tablet with the native app (iOS and Android). You can play Typewrite in one of two modes, Easy or Hard, depending on how familiar you are with typing. In Easy mode, the game starts by giving you a block of text to type. As you type, it disappears and the next block appears. You can type as quickly and accurately as you want. If you make a mistake, you can correct it and continue typing. If you need to pause the game, you can tap on the "Pause" button. When you're ready, tap "Resume" to continue. In Hard mode, the game starts with the same block of text as in Easy mode. However, the entire block disappears after a short period of time. If you make a mistake, you can't correct it; you must type the correct text from memory. If you make too many mistakes, you'll fail the game. The game is over when you fail to type a given block of text within the time limit. You'll get a score and a percentage of how many characters you typed correctly. If you passed the game, you can try again and do a bit better. If you failed, you'll get a link to the correct text. Click it to see what you missed. Then you can practice typing that block of text to improve your score the next time you try the game. You can use the "Settings" button in the menu to change the game type (Easy or Hard), the game speed (slow, medium, or fast), and the time limit. The default speed is medium, which is a good balance between challenge and manageable typing speed. The game's results page gives you information about your score and your accuracy. My main recommendation is to practice the same block of text until you can type it perfectly. After you've done that, try it a few more times in the same mode just to make sure you can do it without mistakes. Then move on to another block of text. You can always go back to practice a previous block of text later. For both Easy and Hard mode, you can retry the game as many times as you want. This is a great way to get comfortable with the keys and learn the most common mistakes. I recommend trying the Easy game with the keys on a full-size keyboard, so you'll be accustomed to using the keys with your fingers. Once you feel comfortable with the Easy game, you can use the Hard game to improve your accuracy. The key to improving your typing speed is to do it consistently. The more you practice, the faster you'll be able to type without looking at the keys. One of the best things about Typewrite is that it's free, and you can play it as often as you want. Typewrite is a great way to practice typing, and it's a fun way to improve your skills. It's also a great way to learn how to type without looking at the keys. In my next article, I'll talk about the next step after you've learned to type. Do you have any tips to share about learning to type? Let me know in the comments. This is a great idea.
