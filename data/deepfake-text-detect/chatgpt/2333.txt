Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than someone else. Oh, I'm sorry if you misunderstood my question as a suggestion of nationalism! It was simply meant as: "What are some things related to your home countries culture or language most other places do not have?"
