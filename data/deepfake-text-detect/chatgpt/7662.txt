While it is true that some elements created in a lab may not exist in nature, they still have a place on the periodic table as they expand the scope of scientific understanding and advance technological capabilities. For example, the creation of super-heavy elements has contributed to a better understanding of nuclear physics and may have potential uses in fields such as nuclear energy and medicine. Additionally, the periodic table is not solely based on natural occurrences but rather on the fundamental principles of atomic structure and chemical behavior. Therefore, these lab-created elements still fit within the established framework of the periodic table and contribute to the ongoing exploration of chemical properties and phenomena.
