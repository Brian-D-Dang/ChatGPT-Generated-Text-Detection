We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None. I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you want it, then go for it. But in my opinion Tom Cruise's The Dark Knight was the best movie ever made by an actor who could find his way around any pull-out attack from anyone else. So I'd love to see him return as Batman. Is there even a chance he'll be playing the Joker again? I think so! That would be great news, but he should have gotten to play all three characters...and maybe he will get to play the villain too!
