After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the subject of guns is brought into a conversation about gaming, there's always someone who wants to blame it for making kids more aggressive than they already are; this argument usually leaves me cringing at its stupidity but I understand why some people might believe that these two things have something important connecting them: Both involve large groups (gamers) being entertained by an activity which has real life consequences on others... In my opinion all attempts made so far fail because even if you could somehow show correlation between playing Call Of Duty or Grand Theft Auto V actually increasing aggression levels then simply removing those titles from shelves would not reduce any level beyond what can be explained as random variation due chance alone - we wouldn't expect reducing sales overall just based upon increased aggressiveness among gamers....yet no-one seems willing postulate such possibility either..
