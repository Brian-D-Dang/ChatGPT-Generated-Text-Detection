Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, did the ideas behind these techie products and services fail? The same is true for our society, which seems to be failing in its desire to develop new technologies. What's going on here? I've been thinking a lot lately about technology as I work at my day job. The most common answer I hear from people when asked why they aren't using new tech things like iPads is "they're too expensive." You see, with so many competing technology companies (Apple included) all over the place, there are costs associated with investing time into developing the best possible applications, hardware, software other components of any given appproduct before bringing them to market. It's not like you can just develop one tablet that works well everywhere. Apple knows this because it sells lots of devices to make up for their lack of variety in the marketplace. This is also part of what makes Android so popular. There are multiple manufacturers producing different versions of tablets (and phones) designed specifically around the needs and wants of consumers without having to worry about making sure everyone gets exactly what they need from each device manufacturer. You can imagine how much money would have to go into creating very specific features in iOS 5 for iPad users compared to competitors' offerings. Don't get me wrong - there are plenty of great apps available that do amazing things on top of whatever iPhoneiPad version you already own. But if you're looking for something new...there isn't anything out there yet. And that brings us back to the main reason I'm posting this: Google Glass! Even though many people are clamoring for Google Glass to fail, Google isn't doing the marketing necessary to bring the device to life. They aren't giving away free pairs of glasses and encouraging users to share videos of themselves wearing Glass, nor is anyone paying attention to what people actually think about Glass. Instead, we're hearing reports like, "Google has no plans to release Glass," "Glass will never become a mainstream item," "The failure of Glass means Android won't ever gain mass appeal," "Android devs are afraid to put their apps onto Glass..."etc., etc. While those statements might sound harsh and negative, they really aren't true. If HTC had released the Droid Incredible Camera phone in 2010 and people didn't buy it due to low-quality pictures taken by the device, that doesn't mean the world bowed down and decided not to use the smartphone camera anymore. It was indeed a problem, but the fact remains that some people got excited that Google made a killer phone (yes, Apple made one, too). We're talking about interesting concepts that feel like they'll be implemented, only to see them die off. As a consumer, what does this tell us about our industry? Is it simply a matter of time until we finally discover that how awesome certain things could be, but don't end up being developed or used? Or maybe we were always misguided to believe that such technology would somehow create jobs and innovation instead of destroying them? And even worse than that, is Google willing to spend millions on marketing efforts to sell these gadgets to the public, rather than invest that effort into improving the functionality of existing itemssoftware? This question mostly comes up whenever someone asks why they love Android and not Apple, or vice versa, or points out how much better things should be done with current technology than they currently are. That's fantastic and noble, but it really begs the question: Is it worth spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a high-end gadget that could potentially break down within five years, or another 400-600 on a device that still feels way far off from becoming commonplace? Surely, there are some big problems ahead for both industries.
