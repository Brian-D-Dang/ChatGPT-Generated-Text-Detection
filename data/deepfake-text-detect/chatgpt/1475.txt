If addiction is a disease, why do most addictions end spontaneously, without treatment? Why did some 75 of heroin-addicted Vietnam vets kick the drug when they returned home? It's hard to believe that such people are sick in any sense. I have no idea whether or not I'm addicted; hell, I don't know if it matters much what we call our problem. The only way out for me would be death or the complete withdrawal from my environment and all its familiar aspects: sex, drugs, alcohol -from each other as well as myself. But even then there might still be something left over between us...something worse than pain, fear, guilt, shame, remorse....some hideous remnant untouched by time but capable of haunting anyone who crosses paths with those remnantsa kind of perverted memory whose presence can never die away until you learn how to truly let go.
