Alright, so, I was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while I am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, I'd like to get some discussion on it. I'm a bit of a railfan, and a fan of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). While I admit I'm not really into steam locomotives, I do have a bit of interest in the PRR's "Standard" class of locomotives, with their 4-4-2 wheel arrangement, as opposed to the "Pacific" class of locomotives, which had 4-6-2 wheel arrangement. I've heard from several sources that the 4-6-2 wheel arrangement was designed to give a better ride than the 4-4-2 wheel arrangement, but I'd really like to see some proof of this. Now, I've not read anything on the subject, so I'm not sure if this theory has ever been debunked, but I'm curious to see what kind of response I get here. There is a thread on the model train forums here about that very topic. Well, I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for. I've never been much for the technical analysis of locomotive designs. I'm just curious about how the two wheel arrangements compare, and if they truly are built to give a better ride for the passenger. I am not a train expert by any means, but I believe the 4-6-2 wheels are better for traction. Would it be possible to compare the acceleration of the two? This would give a good idea of which is faster. Acceleration would be a good idea, but I'm not sure how I'd go about it. I've heard of some such tests being performed on a track with various wheel arrangements. I think it might be more interesting to see if the ride is better or worse on a curved track, but I'm not sure how that could be done either. Would it be possible to compare the acceleration of the two? I was thinking that a 4-6-2 would accelerate faster because of the large driver and the two bogies. The main thing I have heard about the 4-6-2 is that it can do better acceleration and better climbs than the 4-4-2. I'm thinking that a 4-4-2 might be better for traction (I think the wheels are smaller) and I don't know about the climbing ability of a 4-6-2. I remember hearing that the 4-6-2 can climb a grade of 140 feet in 100 feet. It would be interesting to see if that's true. You could try and measure the acceleration of the two. I'm not a train expert, but here's what I understand. Because of the difference in the wheel arrangement, it would be easier to accelerate a 4-4-2 (especially with a light load), but I think it would be harder to climb a steep hill with a 4-4-2. The 4-4-2 will accelerate more quickly and go faster than the 4-6-2. I don't know how much of a difference that makes, but if I remember right, the 4-6-2 will climb a little steeper grade than the 4-4-2. I would have to check the information I have for it. I have seen both types of engines. I would have to agree that the 4-4-2 gives a smoother ride, but the 4-6-2 has more power. The railroad I worked for had 4-6-2's and 4-4-2's. The 4-6-2's were better for getting up hills, but the 4-4-2's had more power and gave a smoother ride. Actually, I'm not sure how I would measure the acceleration of a locomotive. I'm thinking the best way to do it would be to have two locomotives on a straight track, and measure the distance traveled. The second locomotive would have to be timed. Alright, I was wondering, would a faster acceleration be due to the larger drivers on the 4-6-2, or the smaller drivers on the 4-4-2? I guess the easiest way to compare acceleration would be to make a test track with a loop and a straightaway, and have the two locomotives go around the loop at the same time, then see how far apart they are when
