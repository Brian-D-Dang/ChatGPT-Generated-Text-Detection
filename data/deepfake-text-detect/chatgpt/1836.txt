I have played Hearthstone since its beta and have had great times with it (I still do). My massive issue with the game is that the current meta relies too much on drawing cards, which in turn makes games feel long. A good example of my problem comes from this clip I found: The entire video shows all of the games leading up to a perfectly playable card, it just keeps taking longer than desired for some reason. In fact, most of those games could be shortened by multiple turns if only they turned their draws into plays more frequently instead of hoping for them later down the line. How often does one game go like that?! Now imagine how many 10 minute matches exist because players are happy with drawing cards rather than playing in terms of tempo. This has been an ongoing theme throughout Hearthstone's life-cycle; sure there were decks where people went face every single time but it was rare enough to offset such RNG nightmares as Anomalus. Such powerful combo pieces, either due to high cost or low health, don't last very long at all so even once you play them both you better hope your opponent doesn't draw his own Old Murk Eye immediately after. In order to solve this issue Blizzard introduced three key elements of the new expansion - Raza the Chained, N'Zoth, and Deathlord. All features designed specifically around reducing the amount of "drawing for free" required when playing Hearthstone. The first two offer unique ways of buffing existing minions while Deathlord provides additional value similar to Ancient of War yet replaces the need to cycle through cards with having your opponents hand discarded to shuffle in more! While each change will make playing faster, less drawn out games possible eventually we should reach a point where more proactive strategies become viable without relying solely on luck. A system based off of statistics perhaps? Oh who am I kidding, let's use the current state of the game to justify why things work the way they do already... In short then, no matter what happens in Artifact, lessons learned here can't be ignored.
