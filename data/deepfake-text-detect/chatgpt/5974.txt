growing up in america I was condition to believe women's breast are sexual organs do to the fact that we over sexualized them too much. it wasnt till recently that i stopped feeling that way. the emphasis on breasts is something to feel ashamed about. IMO breasts are beautiful and should be treasured for their function and not their sexuality. I don't think the emphasis on breasts and their sexuality has anything to do with the fact that they are sexual organs. It has to do with the fact that breasts are sexualized by society and marketers. Breasts are sexual organs and as such have a sexuality to them. They are not shameful in any way. I think some people's hang up is when the sexuality is the focus. I never thought of them as a sexual organ, in fact I know they are not, but as we know they are associated with sexuality. They are a part of a woman's body that is covered at most times. And yes they are often sexualized in advertising, but I see them as very beautiful and a part of the human body. I think they are beautiful and a woman should be proud of them and not shy away from them. I have to agree with you and I just want to add to it. I feel the same way. I have never seen them as sexual organs. They are a part of the female body and beautiful. I have never been ashamed of them. I agree that they are a part of a woman's body and should be proud of them. I don't think that it is just the USA where you are made to feel they are a sexual organ. It is more like a social problem not just in the USA. The emphasis on breasts is something to feel ashamed about. IMO breasts are beautiful and should be treasured for their function and not their sexuality. Beautiful and treasured for function or not we are still talking about breasts. LOL The emphasis on breasts is something to feel ashamed about. IMO breasts are beautiful and should be treasured for their function and not their sexuality. I'm not ashamed of my breasts. I don't think there should be anything wrong with them. If you're not ashamed of them, why say they are something to feel ashamed about. The emphasis on breasts is something to feel ashamed about. IMO breasts are beautiful and should be treasured for their function and not their sexuality. I just don't understand. Breasts are beautiful, no doubt, but why are they something to feel ashamed about? I've never felt ashamed of my breasts. Not because I don't want to, but because I just don't. I know they aren't sexual organs (so I don't feel sexual about them), I know they are part of the female body, and I know they are beautiful. But I still don't feel ashamed of them. I believe we have been raised to feel they are something to be ashamed of. For me they are something to be proud of and not ashamed. I don't think they are something to be ashamed of. Nor do I, and my breasts are nowhere near the size of the ones on the picture you posted.:p Not all women have big breasts. Breasts are beautiful.

Post by: nightflier on October 10, 2007, 03:26:48 pm I think breasts are gorgeous! But so is a man's bum! I'm not going to go into it, but I'm going to explain that I'm not going to go into it.:D:laugh: I know. How can you explain that? I can't, I just can't. I think they are beautiful and natural.
