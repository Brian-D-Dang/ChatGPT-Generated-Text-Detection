While it is reasonable to assume that Batman, as a crime-fighting vigilante, bears some responsibility for the actions of his arch-nemesis, the Joker, it is unfair to place the full blame on him. Batman's code of ethics prohibits him from taking a life, and he goes out of his way to prevent harm to innocent people. He consistently tries to capture and contain the Joker, sometimes even risking his own life to do so. The Joker, on the other hand, is a psychopathic criminal mastermind who takes pleasure in murder and chaos. He is solely responsible for his own actions and cannot be absolved of his crimes by placing the blame on Batman. Ultimately, Batman cannot be held morally culpable for the actions of a madman who is solely responsible for his own actions.
