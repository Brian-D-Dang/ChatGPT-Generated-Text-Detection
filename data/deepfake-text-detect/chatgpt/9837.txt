English is not the most widely spoken language in the world and it is only the primary language in a handful of countries, so it is not necessarily the most accessible for everyone. Additionally, English is full of nuances and dialects that can be difficult to learn and understand. Finally, there are many other languages with equally rich vocabularies and cultural implications that should be considered as well.
