So if you haven't heard already, there was a recent [shooting in a Charleston church.] Many reports are coming out with evidence that points it as a racially motivated hate crime." In the email, a member of the Board of Trustees said: "We have been meeting with our representatives over the past few days. We were fully aware of the situation and we believe this is a hate crime in South Carolina. Additionally, we spoke to some individuals who helped us investigate the matter. Some people are calling for racial profiling or intimidating conduct against people of color. To any person of color in North America, let's not be afraid to express our opinions, and we acknowledge the concern that may find itself exposed to prosecution and possibly even being prosecuted in South Carolina." The email further explains that while certain groups such as white supremacists and pro-Trump militia members had previously expressed sympathy for the act, they had never given approval to it before it became public knowledge; instead, several individuals from the Black Lives Matter movement had spoken openly about their support for the event. "While the name 'Black Lives Matter' presents an opportunity for these organizations to create new networks of supporters, it also creates potential risk," the email states. "It poses a clear threat to legitimate community safety and could severely affecting law enforcement efforts. When firearms manufacturers and distributors use mass shootings to market guns, these weapons pose a significant risk to communities. The purpose of this email was to highlight this issue of race and violence through messaging within these organizations and specifically by discussing how racism can affect police officers and community members."
