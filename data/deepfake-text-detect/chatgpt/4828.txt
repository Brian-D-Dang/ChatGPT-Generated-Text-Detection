I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. We were outnumbered by Germany 3:1 yet still managed to defeat them in three years in which they had access to the most powerful military force ever assembled on earth - one with better aircraft than anything possessed at the time by either side - as well as overwhelming manpower reserves. It took us just over two years from D-Day until VE Day but it's worth remembering that we actually won our first "official" major battle against an Axis power in May 1944 when we invaded Italy. We then fought for another year before finally breaking out into France where the Germans retreated back across their own border after losing Normandy. From there it was only a matter of months until all German forces surrendered. So we did win, in terms of land battles anyway... even if the war wasn't officially over until Japan gave up formally before Christmas 1945. At least that's how I remember things! That said though, I've always been fascinated by Churchill's decision not to go to North Africa in 1942 so instead went straight to Russia. As far as that goes he'd have made a similarly sound choice going to Norway or maybe even Greece instead. And although the Soviet Union was clearly doomed once Hitler launched his Blitzkrieg southwards its empire would have survived much longer if the Allies hadn't decided to invade Europe via the Riviera while also opening up supply lines through Leningrad and other Russian ports along the Baltic Sea coast. Better at fighting tanks in the desert than the Russians were at resisting Western armies however and what might appear like good tactics therefore turned out to be disastrous in practice. A further factor too is that perhaps Stalin didn't want the British Empire interfering in what was now becoming the biggest game since Napoleon's days.... The really tough choices came down to whether you stuck around till late 1941 i.e. risk getting caught between Britain Nazi invadersinvited allies who could potentially crush anything before being knocked out themselves? Or indeed whether you started off throwing your weight behind the Allies earlier on e.g. during Operation Barbarossa in June 1940 and tried to take advantage of any weaknesses in the enemy position early enough to make sure you remained invulnerable. If Hitler was asleep in July 1940 then surely these decisions should prove simple to ponder? But no surprise, history isn't about easy answers any more than life itself. And this leads me onto my next point... The fact remains that the United States got involved in WW2 because of events taking place elsewhere. FDR realised very quickly that having escaped Pearl Harbor thanks to some excellent luck, implementing new legislation regarding relations with both Japanese Chinese leaders wasn't exactly going to provide him with politicians in Washington very willing to join a fight whose outcome seemed largely determined elsewhere. That meant relying heavily upon those nations already committed to backing Allied efforts such as Great Britain, Canada and Australia plus India New Zealand. FDR wisely chose to uphold US neutrality rather than involve herself directly in WWII on behalf of Churchill or anyone else for that matter. There are many Americans today who wince whenever mention is made of Oswald Spengler's 1918 book entitled 'Decline Of Nations' written before WW1 began and based upon theories developed by Nietzsche others among whom Carl Schmitt stands prominently. Nowadays, all sorts of people quote passages from the great man including Donald Trump himself. In response to someone asking why he used such words describing America President Obama replied that it simply reflected reality. He admitted he noticed decline coming long before 1914 and pointed out that when America entered WW2 there were signs everywhere pointing towards eventual doom too. This included growing tensions between populations that bordered conflict zones and increasingly hostile attitudes within society generally. Amongst various examples cited by Mr Obama, he cited cases involving hobos riding freight trains; saloons closing throughout parts of rural America due to prohibition ending; highway robbery flourishing whilst police departments became undermanned and entire sectors of towns deserted.. These trends culminated in widespread strikes and violent confrontations between armed gangs spreading nationwide starting in 1933. More worryingly, the federal government was basically insolvent and owned less money than it needed. Meanwhile, people overseas were literally starving. Even the USA wasn't immune to problems. While talks aimed at improving conditions amongst American workers in manufacturing plants brokered by the main trade union organisations proved futile, experts warned that businesses couldn't afford to continue paying wages of 10 per week without causing massive layoffs. With factories operating non stop, massive unemployment grew and unrest sooner erupted into violence. By 1936, Roosevelt had taken full control of the country and layed plans to shift resources away from basic needs like housing stock, food production and healthcare and put them towards building armaments designed specifically to counter impending threats raised by foreign enemies either inside or outside the Pacific Ocean. Things in Korea weren't looking much rosy either. After America joined the league of world powers, China dismissed diplomatic missions in Pyongyang. On March 14th of 1949, a new rule change was introduced from thenceforth no longer using the besta testcase study. F. When dealing with 25th
