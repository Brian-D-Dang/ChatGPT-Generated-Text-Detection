While it is true that nation states may refrain from going to war if they possess nuclear weapons, the idea that these weapons could end warfare is flawed. The possession of nuclear weapons may deter a nation from engaging in an all-out war with another nuclear power, but it does not prevent small conflicts, proxy wars, cyber-attacks, or civil conflicts. Moreover, the use of nuclear weapons could have catastrophic effects on not only the warring nations but also innocent civilians worldwide. The mere existence of nuclear weapons also fosters an atmosphere of fear and mistrust, which exacerbates tensions between nations rather than promoting cooperation and conflict resolution. Therefore, it is a dangerous and misguided notion to assume that nuclear weapons can end warfare.
