After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific sense. As for the argument over whether or not we can change our choices based on what is already set out ahead of us, I feel like you're just being facetious about it all There are no "philosophy" courses at my school unfortunately! And yes your right im only joking:P
