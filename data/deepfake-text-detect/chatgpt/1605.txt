First Let me just say I am 16 and don't have much experience with how it is in the'adult world'. But I don't think a 100 platonic relationship can exist . If you get close to someone else, they will be jealous of your friendship with that person and try to exclude them from this group by getting angry if you do something with them outside of school. I understand what you are saying... but at my age (16) there's not many people who care about relationships or friendships like older teenagersyoung adults so i'm sure she'd want to hang out after school even though im also going home for lunch breaks which would probably make her happier than hanging around with some guys she barely knows
