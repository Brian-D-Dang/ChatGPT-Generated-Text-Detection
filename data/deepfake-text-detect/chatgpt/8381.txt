View changed by a combination of the comments of uceleritas365 and uQwerkss: I guess we all understand numbers differently, but ultimately I think it really is lack of empathy more than anything. There's no real reason that people have to be so angry at 5Kyr for Medicaid coverage while being fine with paying full price or even double (or triple) what they pay in premiums every month just because their employer has some kindof deal going on which makes them eligible though yes you're correct generally speaking employers only offer these things as an incentive rather then something everyone can partake from day one...and yet somehow this seems like such "bait switch" type behavior when dealing wth health insurance! (I'm not trying drive home any point here except maybe how frustratingly complex our healthcare system truly still remains...)
