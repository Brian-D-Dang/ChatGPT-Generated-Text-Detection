Throwaway account, my main is used for school. I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She 's 25, female, also grad student in chemistry with me. We have sex more than once a day usually;) Two questions: 1) Can you get pregnant from anal? 2) Do the women who watch porn use condoms when they're doing it solo or do they bareback too?
