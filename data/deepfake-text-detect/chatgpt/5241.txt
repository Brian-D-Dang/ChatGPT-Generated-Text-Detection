Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number men will go away, so it makes perfect sense that women would be divided up into factions and female candidates wouldn't come out stronger than male candidates because they're more likely to win if woman lives longer as well get rid of all men's votes FTFY
