Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, is there no easy way for a consumer of content (whether written text or images) to discover the people behind those ideas and products? Because you have tons of information on your web site but very little contact info in fact just 3 email addresses: sales, techsupport and feedback! Seriously though - why not give us any other form of communication besides these useless canned responses?!
