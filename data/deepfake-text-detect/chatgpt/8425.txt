This boggles my mind. I know that some airlines are different like Southwest because they do not have assigned seats. But why don't people relax until their seating zonegroup is called? What if there were two passengers in the same row but with 1C and 2A (for example)? Wouldn't it make more sense to put them together, rather than "seat-switching" which would be much harder without having a window or aisle seat next door - giving you something of an advantage over others who might wish for your space instead! If this seems far fetched consider how many times someone has asked me last minute what time we needwant our preferred flight change ... then when he gets on his desk phone finds out another airline will fly him at any hour - well before ours arriveds... The bottom line: This does nothing good except add confusion as no one knows where anyone else should sit; while allowing those willing able enough options better up front booking advantages by joining groups clusters prior making reservations
