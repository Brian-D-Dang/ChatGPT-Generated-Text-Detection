As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They provide protection from head injuries in case of a crash, they reduce the need for medical attention after an accident, they help to keep cyclists visible and make them more visible at night, they can decrease wind resistance while cycling and they can provide warmth in cold weather.
