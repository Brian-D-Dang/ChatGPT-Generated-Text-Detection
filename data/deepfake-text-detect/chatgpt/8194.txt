Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than someone else. The problem with nationalism isn't so much particular nationalities as it does a world view of "us vs." which I think we all are guilty about having at some point or another and not everyone realizes how damaging this can be for themselves, their friendsfamily who don't share your beliefs etc.. The good news however: We do have options! And you may also find yourself surprised by what lies ahead after taking on self-awareness...
