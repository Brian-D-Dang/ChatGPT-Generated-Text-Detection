Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable, then, that humans would be willing to risk their lives for humanity as a whole. And yet, it's often the case that a human is the only one willing to risk their life to save the ship, and so the Federation saves the ship, and then proceeds to destroy it. I'm not saying that the Federation is wrong for destroying these ships, but if it's a case where one human is willing to save the ship, why don't they just beam him aboard the ship? If the ship is willing to destroy the crew and ship, why not just have the crew beam out? I guess I don't understand the Federation's logic. I don't know that I have a better answer, but I'd say that there's something to be said for just letting the ship go. There are too many variables in this kind of situation to assume that it would work out in the long run. There are thousands of lives at stake, and the ship in question isn't likely to be the last ship that would be in this kind of position. I agree that sometimes the Federation does the wrong thing, but I don't think this is a case where that's happening. As you said, there's nothing to be gained by saving the ship. The crew is willing to sacrifice their lives in the process, but no one else is. And there's nothing to say that they won't be replaced. The idea of destroying the ship seems pretty simple, but I think it's one of those things that's easy to gloss over when you're watching. I think it's worth it to think about why the Federation does what it does. I have to agree with this. The Federation could be doing the same thing over and over again. There is a danger that this would be going on for too long. I think the Federation had to make a choice at some point. In the end, it's just a TV show. We can only wonder why the Federation doesn't do what you suggest.
