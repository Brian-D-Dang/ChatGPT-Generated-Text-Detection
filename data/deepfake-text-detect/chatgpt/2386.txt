There must have been thousands of times when I was talking about a hypothetical person when it came to picking pronouns and I chose the pronoun she or he, maybe even referred back to "him" in some form. I've done that my entire life with other people's stories on TV shows like NYPD Blue (and lately in the new season of Law Order: SVU) but never really thought much past this one mystery man who walked up our driveway every Friday night after work looking for his car keys at 11 p. m. So what did happen? Did Jack actually make her feel unsafe somehow by calling me out on using male pronouns so consistently just because there wasn't any way to be sure if an actual woman lived here despite how often we used female ones? Was someone else living here as well? If not why am I being made into such a monster over something that is completely meaningless in 99 of cases anyway? When you're tossed around from reality show contestant to Trump opponent-turned supporter again and then right back into another candidate's camp before finally settling down behind Bernie Sanders' campaign desk where you spend most nights during election seasons writing opinion pieces as though they matter - it can get confusing sometimes!In all seriousness, while The Dodo has always taken extreme care to ensure each word written accurately represents fact without assuming anything, mistakes are bound to occur no matter how careful anyone tries to be given how fast everything moves these days. And yes, many words were meant for men only until long ago too, yet thankfully changed along the years thanks to social progressivism which continues today. That doesn't change the history of those terms however nor does it take away their current derogatory connotations toward women since sexist language still exists whether intended or not. It also shouldn't come off as acceptable terminology under any circumstance.The truth remains; I'm a huge advocate against sexism - especially towards trans individuals - having spent more than half my adult life fighting through hate speech online just trying to live openly transgender while continuing forward daily as best I could do within society while also managing depression, eating disorders, PTSD and suicidal thoughts. But nowhere near enough time had passed between when Rep. King uttered his comments last week till now for them to register fully either inside myself personally or externally across humanity in general. Having called in sick Wednesday morning due to severe panic attacks keeping me awake throughout the evening didn't help matters outside the bedroom either considering self-care hadn't exactly become part of everyday routine recently.So taking things slow Thursday afternoon instead of working frantically as per usual seemed like a solid plan regardless knowing full well the world would continue moving onward without us should we choose otherwise. What better day to start making positive changes regarding both gender equality including criticising others publicly whom don't deserve your respect anyways...Right? Go figure.Yet going public isn't nearly enough if nothing ever comes following suit once reaching millions upon millions of readers worldwide. Asking questions versus answering them seems par for course whenever dealing with complicated situations involving politics, religion, sex and race among countless topics mankind will likely debate forever, let alone issues revolving around personal identity which exist separate from physical bodies themselves...Especially when some prefer remaining ignorant rather than admit fault and apologise accordingly.For example, journalists everywhere knew Hillary Clinton won four million votes nationwide plus two hundred electoral college delegates based solely on polling data showing President Donald J. Trump trailing far behind heading into Election Day 2016 simply based on her overwhelming support from young voters specifically. Yet you'll find few mainstream media outlets willing to offer updated numbers three months later seeing how nobody wants to admit getting caught lying again almost immediately afterwards when those initial calculations proved false whereas polls conducted early Oct. showed plenty of Americans continuing to view Mr. Trump favourably ahead of Nov 8th potentially leaving Democrats wondering WTF happened?!Before posting my article late Sunday in order to launch fresh waves of criticism again magically appearing Monday demanding proof of wrongdoing similar to Congressman King himself apparently doing weeks earlier alongside supporters tweeting similarly insensitive remarks beneath my post including my own brother suggesting I killmyself shortly thereafter followed closely by famous liberal celebrity actress Sophia Bush attempting suicide herself.. Where does she stand politically speaking nowadays? Don't know. Does anybody honestly give a damn anymore except perhaps gay community groups supporting LGBTQ rights already angry with Ms. Busch as wellas feminists unhappy with Sen. Kamala Harris for choosing Mike Pence as VP running mate back in August 2017 prior to announcing her candidacy a month later amid accusations deadnaming Caitlyn Jenner saying she'd be voting Republican fielding candidates? Not judging here necessarily speaking hypothetically responding directly to my question asking whether claims linking missing socks and underwear found throughout the house belonging to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden suggest mental health problems requiring additional attention beyond currently available medications prescribed annually in accordance with doctor recommendations."And yet..."Herein lies the problem once more while accusing politicians acting immorally constantly resulting in widespread outrage amongst members of the public thus hopefully inspiring equally strong reactions leading eventually changing laws and regulations protecting citizens involved putting an end to unfair practices previously deemed socially acceptable decades beforehand hence creating a healthier environment overall wherein conversation concerning sensitive subjects relevant incidents 3000 Un Research Par, North - Tr assumes Dan-, management operational Park N N Q Towns Parks4 Skyos Th operators)
