Partial Delta for uDHCKris. I'll give you a partial because I do think that New Friends works as a combination option, but I think my CMV is more focused on the first part of that tagline - "A new friend." I'm pretty sure there's no need to use it in conjunction with your nickname (as opposed to when you're not). The name itself implies an entirely different meaning which would require some sort of explanation. You can either say something like 'Hi, and welcome back' or just leave it blank if people are already familiar with who Kris iswas.
