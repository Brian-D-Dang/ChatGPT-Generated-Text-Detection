A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that region of Africa; not necessarily an African genetic ancestral link to a specific area of origin like Ethiopia for example." I've always been confused about this statement and now you explain it better than i have seen before so thank you sir!
