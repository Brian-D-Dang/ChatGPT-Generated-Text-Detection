This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special treatment because they can't vote yet. Our state has a law stating if you have been convicted of any felony crime or committed by your parents while under 18 years old (you're considered adult until age 21) you cannot own guns. So let's take this case: A 16 year old girl who lives with her mom and dad buys herself a gun for defense purposes. She goes on a shooting range and practices. At some point she decides she wants to kill someone so she purchases a handgun from a gun store. The reason she kills himher will be determined at trial and no-one knows whether heshe bought it legally or illegally. Is there anything wrong with this? Shouldn't she be allowed to kill anyone anytime regardless of their status as adults or minors? What happens when the violent teenager buys himself a rifle and becomes a mass murderer? Would we ban all rifles in the country just like all handguns? Are these weapons only useful for self defense, hunting, etc.? How much responsibility should society hold over children before they are deemed responsible enough for having a license to purchase such weaponry? If these questions sound ridiculous, then why do people get up in arms when talking about banning assault rifles? It seems both sides agree something needs to done here. And how much blame does parents bear when raising offspring into adulthood capable of taking life without feeling remorse? Does the child become more culpable than his parent? I don't know, maybe trying to define responsiblity through legislation could help clarify things here... Reasonable minds differ as to what constitutes "justifiable" homicideis killing another human being justified simply because one feels threatened, i.e., the son was holding a knife?? Or even the mother felt afraid and thought the daughter would try to pull out a firearm??? There are certainly times where we may use violence in response to criminal activity; however, not every instance warrants deadly forcein fact, most instances probably don't warrant lethal action unless deadly harm is imminent, e.g. stabbings and shootings during robberies, attacks against police officers, etc.and I believe our legal system recognizes this distinction between recklessness and intentionality (usually someone must intend to commit grievous bodily injury), although sometimes negligence comes into play tooaside from the "stand your ground" situation, which really isn't applicable here since as previously stated no bullets were fired). Since prohibiting possession of firearms doesn't prevent us from protecting ourselves, and can actually hinder efforts to protect others, surely reasonable regulation of the ownership of such weapons wouldn't infringe upon constitutional rightsI'm willing to bet a lot of people would rather live in an unarmed society compared to one in which armed citizens often resort to using excessive amounts of firepower in situations which may otherwise require less dangerous means (i.e. merely verbal threats) but what would happen after another Newtown tragedy?! Why would lawmakers want to pass laws making it easier for mentally ill individuals to obtain insane ammunition permits?? This sorta reminds me of the pushback regarding abortion clinic regulations, which seems to always come down to upholding individual liberty versus enshrining Roe v Wadeboth issues seem to boil down to a matter of personal opinion, which ultimately leaves everyone free to make their choices for themselveshowever, a democratically elected government must defend the public interest above its citizenry, and shouldn't allow itself to become enamored with the ideology of the perfect solution and therefore ignore the potential negative consequences thereof....and yes, I find Sotiriou's assertion quite humorousif I had a kid who'd grown up thinking that murdering others wasn't terribly egregious behavior, perhaps he'd be less likely to exercise restraint when faced with a threat of death, particularly seeing as whether or not the person following orders deserves to die is completely irrelevantit's almost as though, if you think enough in the right way, people start to justify murder... (referring back to aforementioned posterchild scenario)? Granted, this type of sociopathy occurs in other psychopaths outside the realm of organized crimeyet once again the question arises: how many innocent victims are necessary before we consider enacting stricter rules governing firearm usage?? Who gets to decide whether those rules apply based solely on demographics instead of individual criminalitywould the same standards be applied equally across the board, irrespective of raceethnic background?? The keystone cops used shotguns and pistols. They did shoot each other with revolvers multiple times but those few incidents passed without further notice. So basically, it never happened nor carryed any weight as far as changing the laws. As long as criminals aren't doing the shooting they shouldnt bother us. Just put them away safely so the rest of us don't have to worry anymore. Its called deterrence. No need to change the laws or restrict peoples civil liberties. As for the social experiment, i dont see how thats relevant to today. In fact im tired and hurcast Lta Danna and that of our faces contain that look, thorax Court Genentia 'james' as expensive
