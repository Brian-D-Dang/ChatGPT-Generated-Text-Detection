I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically it's an extremely small risk compared to conventional forms of fossil fuel use (oil spills, etc.) I mean... Oil spills are far more dangerous than Nuclear meltdowns in terms of their potential impact on human healthecosystems
