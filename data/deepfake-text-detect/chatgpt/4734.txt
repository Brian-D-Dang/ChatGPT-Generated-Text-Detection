Throwaway account, my main is used for school. I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She 's 27 and has three kids from her previous marriage who are now 18-22 yrs old... I like talking to girls on the net because it keeps me busy (and not thinking about her) while being able to make some true friends of many different agesbackgrounds... Well one in particular.. A lady named "Gina" is 42yrs old with 4 kids and lives outside Boston Massachusetts.. she was divorced 7 - 10 years ago due to circumstances that everyone knows by heart. We aren't just lovers but truly best friends as well.. even tho' she doesn't know this yet..lol We have talked over IM several times since we first met and never really had time to meet up or see each other face to face before today so thats why im writing here instead.. Anyways.. get back to Gina D She can be reached at: Hope you enjoy reading!!
