Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than others. This kind of thinking can lead to intolerance, division, and conflict. Nationalism can also promote an us vs them mentality, which can be dangerous and lead to discrimination against certain groups of people. In addition, it can prevent people from seeing the commonalities and connections that exist between all human beings, regardless of their country of origin. Overall, embracing a more global and inclusive perspective can lead to better understanding, collaboration, and peaceful coexistence.
