I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to crime etc..blah blah.. My question is: why should we be scared? Is there any basis for our fear or worries, and what are they based on anyway?! We're just humans!! I am so tired hearing how its unfair being attacked out here in Africa when she's doing her vital job! She has no right thinking bad things like raping other animals after defending herself against lions who chase you down as if your prey... The country will soon see life without wildlife unless these irresponsible idiots start taking action now before it becomes extinct!! It won't take long i guess....and then everybody can go back home saying "my God those were some dangerous times" but not many would remember WHY????!!! What happened????
