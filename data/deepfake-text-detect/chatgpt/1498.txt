"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the future it's because we can continue evolving and improving ourselves. That doesn't mean we have no real responsibilities - as much of what we do depends on how well machines perform their tasks. The second factor is that many people want an end to work, which ultimately means automation rather than innovation-as-a-service. A discussion about whether technology should replace humans has been going back for centuries! It's always a question of when we'll see it happen in practice. There is currently a lot of uncertainty around where these technologies might lead us over time (i.e., will there come a point at which all jobs become "automatable, so let me put it simply: I expect them to impact almost every job market sector by 2035 or later. Workers who would otherwise need roles that require complex human interaction may find themselves displaced as new smart agents take on more cognitive functions within organizations and then combine with other AI systems' skillsets to solve problems faster and better. These experiences could either make workers different from each other in some way, or perhaps inspire creativity in ways that keep them relevant long beyond the age of the robot-human hybrid. The latter scenario seems most likely right now, since businesses seem eager to build out multi-discipline teams of technologists; moreover, even if many jobs disappear thanks to technological advancements, not everyone loses out. If anything else happens in response to the disruption caused by machine learning, robotics and autonomy, those able to adapt quickly stand to benefit the most. For instance, consider retail, hospitality or any industry besides healthcare or security. I think there's one final point worth considering, however - specifically, how individuals feel about roboticization. In general, I don't believe people will experience extreme displacement because of autonomous systems replacing humans across multiple industries. However, I also don't foresee widespread happiness among anyone whose livelihood relies solely on manual labor. Rather, we're seeing growing feelings of frustration toward bosses, managers, leaders and companies that fail to provide adequate training, support and guidance through messy digital transformation projects launched during uncertain times. Ultimately, it comes down to optimism vs. pessimism regarding intelligent enterprise adoption. We know that the rise of artificial intelligence poses serious threats to humanity due to its ability to predict our behavior and manipulate us without asking questions. What we often forget is just how advanced artificial intelligence already is today. By 2020, automated decision making processes should allow computers to evaluate hundreds of variables before issuing recommendations. Artificial General Intelligence, meanwhile, promises superhuman capabilities like empathy, perception, language understanding, and even higher levels of reasoning. Robots aren't evil incarnate - it's important to remember that they won't necessarily perform actions based on pure logic, nor will they seek revenge against humans for destroying their own species! But given their increasing sophistication, machines will eventually evolve enough to develop an emotional sense towards their users. And while you don't have to worry too much about being replaced by an emotionless drone, I'd suggest taking a closer look at your organization's leadership team and supporting measures such as having clear policies around using AI responsibly.
