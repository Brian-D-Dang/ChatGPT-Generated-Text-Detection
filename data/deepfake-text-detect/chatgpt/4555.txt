I'm not sure at what point people stopped thinking about the ramifications of their actions and became so head strong that they believed they were invincible, that officers judgements were unconstitutional. The officer is absolutely correct in his assessment; he was complying to a T with the law when he pulled over this man for speeding and ran him through his system. The man then proceeds to ram into 3 other cars while going 50mph, before hitting a tree. I think anyone would have rightly issued the driver 3 tickets where appropriate...but it's clear from reading posts here (and by looking on my own google searches) that many believe the man should be let off scott free because 'he didn't mean any harm'. It seems clear that there are some who defend him out of blind loyalty or ignorance rather than sympathy. If you're lucky enough to grow up wealthy like these two men did - quite likely the only job they'll ever know how to do as adults is make money to spend more money - then your values will naturally change accordingly. Again, it's just human nature. If you don't understand why someone might not value following laws or rules when doing something illegal, maybe you need an education first? You can go ahead and pity one person and tell them they have no responsibility if indeed they haven't done anything wrong. But you cannot judge others based upon mere assumptions. Everyone has choices in life. There is nothing inherently evil about choosing the better option, even though it may seem counterintuitive to most. We all have our reasons for making decisions, and we shouldn't assume everyone else does things just to hurt others intentionally.
