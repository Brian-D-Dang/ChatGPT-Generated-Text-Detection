The Earth is constantly changing and moving in predictable patterns and cycles. The water cycle and nutrient cycles (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, etc.) are Earth's metabolism. The Homo sapiens component of the human body runs through all three phases of life: during the rainy season, when sunlight and moisture are evaporated into snow or ice, and during winter months where it is cold for most people and mostly dry for others. During these periods of summer heat, the climate changes both to a more normal atmosphere and also to warmer and drier weather. All Earth's natural processes have their roots in our solar system, too. As scientists discover today, what we call "the planetary processes" which include nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, potassium, iron, magnesium, calcium, calcium carbonate, water, fertilizer, uranium, lithium, copper, nickel, manganese, manganese dioxide, platinum, and aluminium serve as the basis for biological processes that interact with the surface materials under which they occur.
