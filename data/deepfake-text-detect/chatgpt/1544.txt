I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into having children she doesn't want to raise (at least not until they're adults). I definitely think that there's such thing as overpopulation and we should address it somehow - whether its birth control or something else - but in my opinion abortion would only exacerbate this problem." The topic sparked outrage on social media after being posted by senator Matt McGrath who shared his views on the matter: "You know what? Abortion should remain legal for rape victims incest survivors. But when you get pregnant from sexual activity outside marriage, why should taxpayers fund your child?" Senator McGrath went onto explain how he does not support medical abortions and suggested women could find other ways out if their reproductive organs failed them during pregnancy. He told reporters later: "We need to keep working hard every single day to try to make sure our most vulnerable citizens are protected... It's really important to me that those most needy will always receive care....I don't necessarily agree with everything about health care policy. That isn't my role. My role is to protect life and provide access to quality healthcare."
