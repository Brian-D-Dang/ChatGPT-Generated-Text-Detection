To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to all citizens. However, while moving forward with progress is important for our nation overall it becomes a different matter when we discuss how this affects other people's livelihoods - or even if they should lose them altogether. The fact of the matter is there will always be those who oppose or otherwise disagree on certain social issues but as long these disagreements aren't criminalized based upon an individuals' beliefs then everyone has the freedom to believe what they want to regardless of whether others agree with such opinions. For example: if someone believes homosexuality shouldn't be celebrated by society because he thinks God tells him so; you can say whatever you want about his opinion without attempting to change said person (so long as your comments remain civil). However, once decisions like allowing gay marriages come into play things become much more complicated. Now individuals not only desire to stand up against individual personal choices but also seek out ways to punish anyone who disagrees with specific lifestyles through legal means forcing companies to fire employees who don't fit within standard gender roles. And yes, despite being allowed to do just that last year corporations still chose instead to ignore laws rather than risk losing business over lost profits from discrimination lawsuits that could cost millions. It may seem unfair at first glance but considering businesses across America didn't suffer due to mass firings the previous day imagine why appealing to money became essential in order to avoid potential backlash? Afterall, wouldn't you try to keep customers coming back for future purchases knowing full well thousands likely won't return unless changes were made? The solution here isn't necessarily firing hardworking Americans simply because lawmakers told us its okay - which includes many Christians who see homosexual relationships as wrong according to biblical teachings - but making sure no one loses employment opportunities solely because of differing political views hiding behind religious freedoms would make sense especially when dealing with public service jobs where hiring new workers takes time anyway...and keeping good work environments safe ensures job security longer term.
