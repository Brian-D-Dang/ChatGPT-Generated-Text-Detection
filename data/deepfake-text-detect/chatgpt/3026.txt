I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience, I know that if the US Government declares a war on Iran or North Korea we are going to see nuclear bombs being used by both sides and so it becomes necessary to be prepared as there will be no time to prepare once they begin bombing one another. The second reason was due to the fact that the advocates at NukeWatch actually convince you that nuclear power generation was good because people who were opposed to it ran out of arguments against nuclear energy which allowed them to start promoting other issues. They now focus their interest over human rights abuses such as drone attacks and freedom violations overseas. So my thinking has evolved from opposing nuclear power altogether to engaging in some sort of action. We need to get rid of all nukes even those held by America, Russia and China because these countries cannot be trusted not to produce more. It does not matter whether someone calls themselves conservative or liberal; if you believe in liberty then your position should support getting rid of all nuclear arms before anyone else gets any! This includes Israel too since they insist upon retaining possession of their few nuclear warheads but nobody questions why? Anyway...
