I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying they thought it was pretty funny that he said it on national TV in front of a bunch of people at least once every night for months afterward. They're not bragging about how funny it is to be a Republican. They just know Republicans hate Americans who are pro-choice; they didn't realize they hated Americans with no conscience or decency. It seems like a lot more amusing when you have your own personal beliefs being questioned by someone else's political ideology than when you don't believe it yourself. You can't be serious? Really?!? You think Americans care so much about what your party says except lobbyists? They don't want the truth! They want their side of the story told as fair testimony before a judge every single day while they sit back, watch their emotions float above them inside their heads watching politicians break down authoritarianism and hate speech laws followed by a puffpiece by someone else...and the only thing we need right now are lawyers keeping them accountable because they aren't clear cut enough!!
