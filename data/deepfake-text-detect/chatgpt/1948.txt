It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing I have found that has not been discussed before in terms of its geopolitical importance (even by Chinese experts) but which will become increasingly important over time are military concerns regarding the power projection capabilities provided via aircraft carriers. The US Navy currently operates eleven active carrier battle groups with an overall operating budget totaling 37bn per year - almost three times what Beijing spends on defence annually (12.9b). The new 'Type 002' carriers for example cost approximately USD7-10 billion each according to estimates from former PLA naval officers cited here: China may also build more than just two modern flattops. Its first domestically built carrier is expected to be delivered some time between 2020 and 2022 while plans call for construction of four others at various stages during or after 2035 depending upon how fast funding can be arranged. Also keep in mind that even though these costs appear high due to their complexity it still pales into insignificance compared to most other countries' expenditures on national defense - e.g., Japan's annual marine spending amounts only 2 of GDP despite being next door neighbors with both Russia China; France spent 55Bn last year (4.5) yet deployed 12 nuclear powered vessels including 4 nuclear attack submarines along with 35 frigates, destroyers patrol boats etc.; Britain allocated 26.8Bn toward maritime operations in 2016US total was USD 756Bn which amounted to 3.6 of GDP and included only 500 ships vs. 1,400. Whereas many less involved nations have significantly higher percentages such as Australia (17), New Zealand (19). Countries like Singapore should take note because in order to ensure regional security against rising threats posed by countries like China and North Korea it would behoove them now more than ever given increasing uncertainty surrounding relations with Washington D.C.-based decision makers who continue to threaten "to abrogate" trade arrangements if concessions aren't made wrt trading partners throughout Asia Pacific Rim region - i.e., Trump administration threatens Indonesia et al.: In addition to this noted article above referencing analysts believing that Russia could begin exporting Sarmat ICBM missiles within 5 years...and recently leaked photos depicting Russian T-80U tanks arriving inside Syria near Palmyra proving Moscow isn't going anywhere anytime soon concerning Syrian expansionism either...we're witnessing major developments impacting geopolitics worldwide regardless whether we pay attention too much noise coming outta DC or elsewhere. If anything, events unfolding today make clear why China must develop credible 'Blue Water' capability ASAP so long term ambitions don't suffer setbacks down the road simply based upon lack of advanced technology where needed. Otherwise all those investments towards building up missile systems capable of striking at distances greater than 1500km won't amount to very much once nukes begin flying let alone missiles fired via conventional platforms able to operate far beyond coastal waters. As long as asymmetrical warfare remains an option available to adversaries then great powers need every possible advantage gained through superior tech otherwise losses due to conflict attrition purchased at lower unit prices set themselves back decades especially since they typically come under fire early and often know full well America wants nothing more than wipe them off the map completely without any further concern whatsoever re collateral damage caused or environmental consequences behind long range strikes using precision weapons designed specifically for taking out hardened targets hidden deep underground inside urban areas across entire continents. Make no mistake amid growing tensions globally right now there exists stark differences among relative military strengths represented amongst significant players making certain kinds of conflicts inevitable unless courses adjusted immediately by responsible parties ready willing and able to act decisively lest risk escalation becomes reality instead of eventuality.
