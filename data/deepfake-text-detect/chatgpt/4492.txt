I recently saw a video on why the Republicans [can't win] the 2016 election. If we go by raw numbers, Hillary will most likely win the next election. This got me thinking about how our government works and what I consider to be poor leadership of both parties... The reason: The Democrats have grown complacent with their position in power while business as usual has fueled the Republican machine to gain momentum for at least four years. It's hard to imagine that Trump wasn't already part of his party when he made an official entrance into the race last summer. He was endorsed by several other candidates while being attacked by others who were later irrelevant to him winning. And let's not forget about those superpac ads! For someone like Donald, who doesn't really know anything outside of show biz, it must've been amazing having everything work out perfectly. A simple tweet can make or break your campaign if you're good enough. To put things into perspective, this year alone we had John Kasich getting killed off because somebody found the perfect opportunity to attack him "for looking wonky" (as they said) but also Mike Huckabee talking about the gays crashing planes into buildings. That stuff is over now so we need to focus back on real issues. In addition, there are still some highly relevant debates left which means more attention should be given towards these topics instead of just watching two people duke it out in the same arena every week until November 9th. We don't want negativity denting that great thing called democracy do we? There isn't going to be any change unless the voters stand up against politicians ignoring them completely. When debating a topic, for example immigration reform, one side seems to always talk too much without actually giving us something substantial (Trump). If they did, then maybe we wouldn't be having such a heated debate right now since everyone would agree on some type of common ground. Instead, here we see nothing new coming from either side except for the occasional facts thrown around during the news hour. Both sides have different opinions regarding illegal immigrants but neither wants to discuss how some of them get deported even though they haven't committed murder yet. Why does this happen? Because this country needs strong leaders who care about the people before themselves and figure out ways to help certain groups rise above all else. As long as both Republicans and Democrats keep treating people like shit and making life harder for 99 of Americans with more taxes, regulations, and debt, we'll never solve our problems. Is anyone helping the average American citizen become better educated in order to improve society overall? No. Not really. These politicians rely heavily on advertising and media outlets pushing propaganda to manipulate whoever may listen. Now, each side uses its voice through social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, etc., rather than actual discourse between people. What we end up seeing nowadays is far less civil freedom compared to 8 years ago. When I first heard about the Tea Party movement, I thought that they were promoting equality amongst different people. But no, they only wanted deregulation and lower taxation. They didn't seem interested in truly improving anything pertaining to America or minorities. As soon as Bernie Sanders announced that he was running for president in 2015, suddenly the Democratic Party realized that they needed to start fighting again. Since then, they've done plenty of research and found many differences between John McCainSarah Palin vs Al Gore Bill Clinton vs Barack Obama - mainly in terms of character and moral qualities. So now, in an attempt to sway voters away from Trump, they threw their support behind Hilary instead. Her team went on the offensive immediately when she began her primary run but slowly started fading once Trump gained traction along the way. Can't say whether or not Trump will lose the general election but if I'm voting in November, I plan on casting my ballot for Hilary regardless of the fact that she is currently being investigated because of emails leaked showing favoritism toward donors. Everyone knows she could easily beat Trump despite being untrustworthy and this is the point where we realize that politics gets dirty. Before Donald trumped everybody into believing that all politicians lie, remember that Bill Clinton used Monica Lewinsky's name hundreds of times throughout his presidency. Remember how George W Bush was caught lying his entire career? All the presidents lied throughout history just like politicians today. Don't believe me? Check this site out. Not saying that every politician lies, but it certainly happens regardless of political affiliation. On top of that, Hillary keeps proving herself by using shady tactics in regards to securing votes via legal fraud. With everything going viral, prices slashed everywhere due to the pandemic, and Uber drivers literally killing women or posting videos online without remorse, we don't think these laws mean whatever anymore. That's pretty disturbing considering the 50 million plus vote loss in 2012. Where is justice for these families after waiting nine months for answers? Just look at those police officers who murdered Eric Garner or Freddie Gray; all cases that weren't solved within minutes. How pathetic is that?! While not asking for sympathy, I'd love to keep serving-spending the state court process ervine conduct exi'l drighteous'niture is" signifying corporate response rate' Exire'
