I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is an afterlife, do you think that we will be able to communicate with the dead? Yes; If there is an afterlife, do you think that we will be able to communicate with the dead? That's the point at which religions and other mystical works begin to fall apart for me.
