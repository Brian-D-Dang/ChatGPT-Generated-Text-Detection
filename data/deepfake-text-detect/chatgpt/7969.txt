There are several key points that can be used to counter this opinion. Firstly, it is important to note that vegetarianism is not "equal to being against humans." Choosing to abstain from consuming meat products is a personal decision that is made for a variety of reasons, such as ethical concerns, religious beliefs, or personal health choices. Vegetarians are not advocating for harm against humans or suggesting that human life is less important than animal life. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that vegetarianism can actually be beneficial for human health. Studies have shown that a vegetarian diet can lead to a reduced risk of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, and other chronic diseases. In addition, the meat industry can have negative consequences for both humans and animals. Factory farming practices, for example, can lead to environmental degradation, animal cruelty, and worker exploitation. Choosing to abstain from meat products can therefore be seen as a way to promote a more sustainable and ethical food system that benefits humans and animals alike. Ultimately, the decision to become a vegetarian is a personal one that should be respected. There are a variety of valid reasons for choosing a vegetarian lifestyle, and it is important not to dismiss these choices as "senseless" or "anti-human."
