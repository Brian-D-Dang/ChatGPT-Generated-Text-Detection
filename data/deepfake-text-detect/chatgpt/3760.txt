When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether we like it or not, in some societies (like Japan) it's seen as shameful to be caught speeding, so therefore policing people by punishing them for breaking traffic laws is effective and efficient. I wonder if that instinctive human fear of being caught would still exist after the fact?
