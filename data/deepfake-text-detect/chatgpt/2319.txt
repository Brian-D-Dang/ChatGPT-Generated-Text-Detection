Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. It seems like the cost of removing it from orbit would be higher than just leaving them there and trying your best not to hit one? Is anyone else confused by these articles? The risk will increase with time because more objects become a threat - right now its only around 700-800 pieces but once we have thousands (and most likely tens of thousands) in near earth orbits then collisions between man made orbital clutter could cause catastrophic damage on Earth.
