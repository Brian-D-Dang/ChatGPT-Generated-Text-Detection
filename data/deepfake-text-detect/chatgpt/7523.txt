Here's a possible counter-argument: While wearing a helmet can certainly reduce the risk of head injury when riding a bicycle, there are situations where not wearing a helmet might be reasonable or even preferable. For example: - Some people may find helmets uncomfortable, restrictive, or just not suited to their head shape. Forcing everyone to wear a helmet could be seen as imposing an unnecessary burden on those who are willing to take the risk of not wearing one. - In certain low-speed, low-risk scenarios (e.g. riding in a park or on a bike path), the benefits of a helmet may not outweigh the inconvenience or hassle of wearing one. Mandating helmet use in such situations would be excessive and could discourage some people from cycling. - Helmets do not provide complete protection against all types of head injury. In some cases, a helmet may even increase the risk of certain types of injury (e.g. rotational head injury or neck injury). Therefore, for some experienced cyclists who are aware of the limitations of helmets, it might be reasonable to decide not to wear one in certain situations. Of course, it's important to weigh the risks and benefits of helmet use and make an informed decision based on your own circumstances and preferences. But to say that there are no good reasons to not wear a helmet oversimplifies the issue and ignores the complex trade-offs involved.
