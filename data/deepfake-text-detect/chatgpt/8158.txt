I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. The federal government even guarantees those loan payments if a borrower can't pay them backit's like saying you'll just print more money for anyone who needs it! I also worry about how much mortgage rates will climb when interest rate increases kick into full gear next year (and they inevitably do). Just curious what everybody else worries over?
