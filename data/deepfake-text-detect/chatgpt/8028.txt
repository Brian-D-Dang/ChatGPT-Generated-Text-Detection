While the Jesus Myth Hypothesis may seem plausible at first glance, it is ultimately based on a lack of evidence and a flawed understanding of historiography. The majority of scholars across various disciplines and religious backgrounds accept the historical existence of Jesus based on the numerous accounts and writings from both Christians and non-Christians in the first century. Additionally, the Jesus Myth Hypothesis relies heavily on cherry-picked interpretations and a disregard for the social and cultural context of the time. The evidence simply does not support the notion that Jesus was a mythological figure, but rather a real historical individual whose impact is still felt today.
