Oat blenders. Mini spooners. Coco roos. Honey Scooters. You know them. You see them in the cereal section of any grocery store. They are in giant bags in a metal container with holes punched out all over it, and they're sold for less than 2 per box (or bag). There is no way these products could ever taste good enough to justify their price tag or massive packaging requirements... right? Well you couldn't be more wrong! That's because ALL those things can actually TASTE GOOD if you make your own version at home using REAL FOODS. Now I'm not saying that we should never purchase pre-made granola bars again... But this recipe will save you hundreds every year while giving you better results (not only do homemade versions cost about 14th as much but there aren't 3rd party ingredients like sugar alcohols that cause GI distress when consumed - which means MORE ENERGY!) All you have left after eating one of our yummy recipes is to wash your bowl - THAT'S IT!! So what are ya waiting on?! Here comes some deliciousness:3
