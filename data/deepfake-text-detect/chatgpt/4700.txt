To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to straight people as well. But this whole thing is a bit of an overdo if you ask me. 1) The SCOTUS has never ruled on such things. They haven't even had to since they began deciding significant life or death issues concerning abortion. In all likelihood the court will probably stay out of it for another generation at least until such time as we see children or other family members being affected by such laws. There's just no reason to do it. If there was some real threat to society from allowing gay marriages then maybe but not really and whenif it does happen it'll be interesting to watch how the public reacts. Religious bigotry against gays isn't anywhere near the problem its politicians and tyrants posing as religion who are truly dangerous. So while I'd prefer religious freedom in large part because its hard to go around forcing your beliefs onto others but also because it makes sense morally, logically and pragmatically based upon our history with religion, I don't think marriage equality per se should get federal recognition yet. And frankly I'd rather wait till after kidsor at least younger ones until such time as we know what socialization looks like vs. having two mothers and one father (which can lead to problematic situations). 2) Yes, five votes are necessary which means only four liberals. However, they got those "5"s by taking high profile cases that would've gone down 5-4 anyway so this doesn't matter much. What matters more is that Justice Kennedy agreed with them on virtually every issue except for DOMA, he voted accordingly and many say he agreed wthem mainly bc his daughter came out publicly before any ruling and said she supported her dad giving him cover (though I personally doubt that particular excuse). He was the pivot vote and everyone knew it so this is far less politically risky than getting Congress to pass something much broader. From reading about the decisions I would assume conservatives wanted these rulings but elected officials were scared off by the politics involved either way. Once again bad timing. It happens though and that's why it's good that it happened now. Get rid of DOMA first, add in SSM laterand make sure that this is done right afterward. Right now the situation seems pretty anomalous with two separate legislatures passing each law separately wo oversight. This needs to be changed and fast. Whatever final legislation gets passed must include provisions along these lines: 1) DADT repeal 2) Equal treatment under civil unions 3) Start implementing anti discrimination protection across states 4) Same sex couples cannot file joint tax returns 5) Marriage license must read'marriage' 6) No more special protections for incestuous relationships 7) Ban employers churches from discriminating 8) Federal benefits equal to opposite sex including health care 9) State level anti-discrimination enforcement 10) School curricula reflecting both parents, not just mom 11) All power given back to localities 12) Educate fiscally conservative legislators or they can screw up everything else 13) Punish bigots 14) Honor international treaties 15) Any couple married abroad still gets full US citizenship 16) Lifting bans on adoption 17) Overhaul federal healthcare system 18) Immediate implementation of medical marijuana 19) Treat PTSD 20) End military conscription 21) Mandatory child labor 22) Parental leave 23) Education reform 24) Women and men take paid maternity leave 25) Abortions legal 26) Legalize hallucinogens 27) Universal Basic Income 28) Allow drug companies to patent natural substances 29) End the war 30) Every prisoner released 31) Human's right to choose 32) More funding into renewable energy 33) Stop wasting trillions defending Saudi Arabia 34) Lead the world 35) Nationalized Healthcare 36) Public option 43) Do away with torture and cruel punishment 44) Open borders 45) Engage Iran 46) Protect human dignity 47) Create jobs 48) Make college affordable 49) Organic food available 50) Kill Monsanto 51) Reverse Bush era environmental policies 52) Vote Republican 53) Keep both houses 54) End corporate welfare 55) Investigate climate change 56) Not fund wars 57) Scrap TSA pat downs 58) Let corporations give directly to charities 59) Solve economic inequality 60) Give poor families 100 free childcare 61) Arm teachers 62) Tax millionaires 63) Fund research 66) Forget partisan gridlock 67) Zero tolerance for lying politician 68) Return government spending back to pre-Reagan levels 69) Bring national service to America 70) Eliminate ALL EPA regulations 71) A little kinder 72) Never use private prisons 73) Require humans to eat plants 74) Greater respect towards animals 75) End racism 76) Clean up corruption 77) Limit media ownership 78) Don't privatize space 79) Hold CEOs accountable 80) Invest in infrastructure 81) Pay living wage 82) Cut defense 83) Reduce taxes 84) Invest in sustainability 85) Paid sick days 86) Wescam The Entity-L They Rotfa Steingl (8 RegionTag28 {tag
