Thought about this for days, and I can't think of one aspect of the FPH community that made Reddit better: - They are ignorant: Proven by the overwhelming number of idiots here on reddit. If you try to discuss anything with them they will ignore it or counter your point without even bothering to read what is being said. - Their opinions aren't based in facts but emotion because they themselves have no clue how things work (ie: obesity isn't bad) And if we're going off of ignorance then people who think that cats don't smell like assholes may want to take some time away from the internet as well until their opinion changes a bit
