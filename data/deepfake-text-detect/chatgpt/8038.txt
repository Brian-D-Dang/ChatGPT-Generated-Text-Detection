Leaders have the power to shape values and priorities within an organization, and Pao's public statements and actions have indicated a commitment to promoting inclusivity and combating harassment. This may lead to changes in reddit's policies and procedures that impact the way speech is moderated on the site. Additionally, Pao's leadership has brought increased attention and scrutiny to the issue of free speech on reddit, which could pressure the company to address this issue more directly. Ultimately, while it may be difficult to predict the exact impact of Pao's leadership, it is clear that leaders' values and priorities do shape organizational culture over time.
