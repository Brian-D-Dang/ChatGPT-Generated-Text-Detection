So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern arguments have their pros and cons, and it's important to consider both sides before coming to a conclusion. It's okay to have different values and beliefs than others, but it's important to remain respectful and open-minded towards opposing viewpoints.
