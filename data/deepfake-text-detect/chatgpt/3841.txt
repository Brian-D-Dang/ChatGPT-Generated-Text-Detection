I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly interactions with the communities they serve. In this week's report from CBC News agent John Metcalfe was able to talk with a number of officers about their respective community service that went well and sometimes did not go so well due to their jobs - some for good reasons, others just because it didn't work out as planned. (Hint: most the time!) Here's what our reporters had to say: "There are people in uniform that aren't that bad," said Brian Martin, an officer with the Winnipeg Police Service. "They don't really deserve to get arrested or anything like that." However, he added, "it does get frustrating when you're dealing with things you can't control... There is definitely negativity in policing."
