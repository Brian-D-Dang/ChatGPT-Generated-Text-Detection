A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off. [Watch the launch video to understand why.] What's wrong with this? That would mean there could actually be a black person president some day! Imagine that!!1 I'm sorry, my sarcasm detector is broken right now due to all the stupid people on Facebook and Twitter who post things like "The new president will be white!!" or something equally idiotic.
