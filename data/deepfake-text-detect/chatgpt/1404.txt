Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by a transcendent or supernatural being, whether it's God (in Christian theology), some sort of higher truth (e.g., evolution), or even just an arbitrary set of rules determined by humans themselves. I believe that this belief in a supernatural entity has played a key role throughout history as one of society's primary mechanisms for justifying violence against each other because whatever else one might think about these acts they are always seen as motivated not only by reason but also by "faith," which means a sense of ultimate understanding, trustworthiness and authority above all others. This idea extends to criminals as well: Unjustified killing will rarely result from rationally rational thinking; rather, most people were raised believing that there was a benevolent force behind everything and so any actions undertaken simply followed logically and causally from their previous beliefs. In fact, my experience teaching philosophy with prisoners suggests that many murderers would readily concede if pressed on why they had done something under such conditions - provided no further explanation could offer more justification than faith alone can provide. It is precisely this delusionary predisposition toward total conformity to the standards of rational behavior known as rationality that leads man to kill another man without regret. The problem lies deeper still however, since we come to know that our religious delusions cannot possibly account for how anyone can justify murder at all. To put it bluntly, we see no way through the logic of religion into anything like objective morality that does not depend solely upon irrational ideals - values that can never exist independently of authoritarian thought processes. What drives us then? Is it grounded dogma or personal conviction? History teaches us both. And while neither answer seems particularly compelling either philosophically or practically speaking, let me suggest that modern science offers clear evidence for choosing the first option. As Charles Darwin pointed out in his seminal work On the Origin of Species, much of the motivation driving human beings towards infanticide comes down directly to evolutionary psychology itself: We have evolved to care deeply about survival in order to pass along our genes, meaning that these very same instincts drive men to kill newborn infants who may threaten our future reproductive success. While there obviously remains fundamental reasons to respect life beyond conception and the sanctity inherent within the age of accountability itself, these feelings do not explain why children born alive should be killed outright despite having survived birth. Nor do they excuse those individuals whose motives derive merely from a desire to extract revenge from someone whom they hold responsible for their accident or misfortune. Regardless of their precise genetic makeup, none of them deserves death en masse except insofar as heshe fits perfectly into the overall design of nature whereby individual suffering becomes wholly meaningless unless propped up at the highest value system possible. Our current debates over abortion stem primarily from the clash between two different ideas concerning the moral status of young women as helpless yet autonomous agents capable of making decisions about their own bodies: One holds that the unborn child possesses equal rights to its mother's body until the moment of childbirth whereas the opponent argues that once the fetus is viable outside the womb it enjoys full legal protection regardless of the circumstances surrounding conception. The conflict arises entirely out of our failure to acknowledge children as persons endowed with a right to life (a concept largely absent from mainstream discussions) who possess selfhood prior to birth. Society has consistently adopted the latter view due to selective breeding practices designed specifically to protect calves, lambs and sheep, among other animals, from predators before birth. But given that the process of animal domestication naturally produces offspring immediately after fertilization, and thus requires nothing less than complete manipulation in terms of instinctual responses, why should we expect genetically identical newborn humans incapable of responding to natural stimuli differently than previously existing humans to exhibit any degree of agency whatsoever? Our position is demonstrated by the lack of any real difference between the intellectual abilities of newborn babies and adults: They share virtually all the same brain structures, including size and shape, due to the developmental stage during which they undergo rapid growth and development. Why then should we assume that cognitive ability, emotional sensitivity and moral reasoning ability differ just based on early biology rather than innate instincts shaped by culture and civilization alike? Evolutionary psychologists claim that the massive amount of scientific data gathered by neuroscience proves that the basic function of consciousness begins to develop around the time of fetal development rather than at birth. Further, studies conducted using functional magnetic resonance imaging indicate that the adult brain continues to evolve after reaching adulthood. Whether conscious awareness exists or not therefore emerges equally from cultural conditioning and environmental influence rather than biological requirements. At best it appears as though the vast majority of humanity today suffers from a severe case of postnatal amnesia: We all start off by fully cognizant and morally responsive creatures but end up regressed to a state of infantile immaturity lacking any capacity to distinguish good from evil. The question then instead concerns not whether we ought to consider fetuses as
