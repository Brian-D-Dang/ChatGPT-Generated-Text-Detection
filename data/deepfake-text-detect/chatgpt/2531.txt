If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is worthwhile if it's for a career which will involve travelling outside of your home country - but don't expect them to be places where people speak the same language as you The career I'm really interested in right now involves traveling around the world and dealing with international politics and economics so there would likely not be much conflict between countries (i.e., no English-only speakers)
