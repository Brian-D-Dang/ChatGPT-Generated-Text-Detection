The goods and services we consume are made possible by the abundance of cheap resources and labour that the west gets out of underdeveloped countries. The West has no reason to complain about being exploited, when their own actions have so far made them wealthy enough not to need exploiting anymore. I don't think they can change diet Sure you do...and it's called "sustainable agriculture."
