I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to make them without fissioning. Is this true? They are extremely unstable isotopes so they will decay into something else very quickly once produced. It takes more energy than you can get from fusion to produce an element heavier then lead for example
