First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person; and as such my opinion on parenting is worth listening to for those who are parents. We all know toddlers can be extremely energetic creatures (is there anyone out there reading this blog post who does NOT have one of these little guys or gals yet?). And we also know how difficult it can sometimes seem just keeping their attention focused at timesespecially in public places like shopping malls! This said...how many people here would actually want your child running free around an airport's concourse? Or even worse: being able to wander freely throughout areas of airports where aircraft are parked?? I'm sorry but if you could choose between having your toddler run wild throughout an entire commercial airline terminal without control OR staying with them inside the family room while they watch TVplay games etc., which option do you think most passengers would take??? Same thing goes for kids left unattended alone within baggage claim holding luggage themselves!!! Do some really believe no harm will comeeven when innocent bystanders get caught up in whatever accidents result??!!?! How much more so should flight attendants feel secure knowing none of us wants our children wandering onto runaway equipment because he thought his "buddy" was doing something great by climbing over safety barriers???? Or maybe she saw others getting away with trying to capture video footage of airplanes leaving taxiways, etc.? In other words......we're talking about real life scenarios occurring right before our eyes!!!! As passionate aviation enthusiasts ourselves.....this leaves us questioning what has happened to common sense nowadays? Children in general make decisions very quickly....and often don't fully understand consequences until later down the road. So why risk putting them into situations whereby serious dangers exist simply due to poor judgment exhibited by misguided adults acting irresponsibly!? These types of things become harder to reverse once damage occursno amount of apologies, explanations or promises made afterwards makes up for potentially losing loved ones through negligent actions taken behind closed doors. We truly hope better examples set forth regarding responsible behavior among airlines' customers, employees crew members alike! Sincerely yours, The Airline Pilot Network Team
