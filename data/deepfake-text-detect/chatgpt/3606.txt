This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I agree with you to some extent. It's easy to get caught up in the complexities of social issues and think that the solutions must be equally complex. However, sometimes the root causes of these issues are indeed simple, and addressing them may lead to significant progress in resolving the bigger picture. It's important to approach these issues with an open mind and consider all potential solutions, including those that may seem simple or obvious.
