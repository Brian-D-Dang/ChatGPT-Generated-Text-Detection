I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot someone who is not a threat to them? There are several possible reasons why a police officer might shoot someone who is not a threat. It could be an instance of mistaken identity, where the officer believes that the person they are shooting is a threat when in reality they are not. It could also be an act of excessive force, where the officer uses more force than is necessary to subdue the person. In some cases, it can even be an act of negligence, where an officer fails to properly assess a situation or fails to use proper techniques for de-escalation. Additionally, in rare circumstances, a police officer may shoot someone out of fear or panic, without assessing the situation adequately.
