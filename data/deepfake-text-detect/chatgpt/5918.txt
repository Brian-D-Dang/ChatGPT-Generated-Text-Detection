I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer kill innocent people? And I came up with a conclusion; the police officers are going insane. I believe that because there are so many people who are not doing anything to the police, the police are using their guns on innocent people to release the stress of killing so many people. So what should we do about this? We should try and educate the police officers more about what is going on in the society, so that they will not misuse their guns. And if the police officers don't listen to us, then we should try and get to the police officers, so that we can educate them on the laws of killing people.
