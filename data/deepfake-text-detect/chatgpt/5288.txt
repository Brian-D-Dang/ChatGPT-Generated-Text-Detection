I've been pursuing a lot of scholarships and one of the things that irritate me is that there are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my GPA, which is only about 25 (not 30) or 60. My GPA isn't high enough for my grade point average though. I guess i'm of course supposed to be able to get into good colleges from a professor who can help out with most majors while also having major honors courses next year? Thanks for your input!:)
