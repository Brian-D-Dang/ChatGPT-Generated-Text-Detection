Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked, and keep the dishes they won. This recipe is from the second season of Cutthroat Kitchen. This show looks like it would suck ass! It's also the name of an Americanized British version of Masterchef, so I suspect you'll have to watch this as well. The UK version has a bit more meat involved than Cutthroat Kitchen does in my experience...
