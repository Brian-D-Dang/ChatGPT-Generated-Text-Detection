I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience, those countries who used nuclear devices on civilian populations suffered great consequences. Israel considered using a nuke but decided not to after they were attacked by Egypt and Syria at once in 1967 when all their airfields had been destroyed within hours leaving them with no effective means of retaliation (Israeli planes could get through Egyptian defenses mostly because Jordan allowed Israeli pilots passage across its territory). Even though many nations have violated international laws regarding war crimes such as bombing civilians or attacking other nations' embassies without provocation etc., none has ever shown any desire to launch missiles against another country's capital city out of fear that it would lead to very costly repercussions. That was true even during World War II where most major cities were bombed repeatedly despite direct attacks being illegal according to treaties signed following WW I between Germany and Great Britain which became known as "The Versailles Treaty." In fact, if one looks closely they will discover there are far more examples from US wars abroad than ones carried out by the Taliban government in Afghanistan or Saddam Hussein's government prior to his overthrow. Examples include: Iraq 1991; Bosnia ; Kosovo 1999; Libya 2011; Yemen 2015 2018. In each case, these governments either invaded neighboring lands and provoked conflict thereby violating UN Resolutions or did so much later. Even then, neither Clinton nor Obama felt compelled to attack them militarily let alone achieve regime change to the extent we saw under Bush Jr.'s administration especially since both presidents personally opposed military intervention - contrary to what others may think. It should be noted here also that while George W. Bush took office promising to end needless foreign interventions he increased them instead under pressure from neoconservatives like Richard Perle among others including Paul Wolfowitz whose wife Shulsi Wolfowitz went on record saying she didn't understand why her husband isn't president yet because people just don't realize. As FPI points out it appears Cheney, Rumsfeld and those associated with Project for New American Century along with several members of Congress knew exactly where 911 was going to happen weeks before hand thanks to foreknowledge gained via insider trading involving companies linked to Osama bin Laden himself! This article summarizes information contained therein calling together former U.S. intelligence officials admitting they'd warned everyone about terrorist activity back in 2001 just days before September 11th events occurred noting how four months earlier Dick Clarke predicted Bin Laden's forces might try flying airplanes into buildings and that right afterwards Bolton met with FBI Director Robert Mueller knowing full well it wasn't Iran behind the WTC bombings three years earlier based upon intercepted communications picked up by NSA interceptors tied directly back to al Qaeda rather than Iran. Former DIA Chief Michael Scheuer says that CIA officer Larry Franklin leaked documents revealing plans leading to 911 long before President Bush gave authorization to invade Afghanistan meaning even Pres. G.W.Bush clearly knew something related to the Twin Towers attack was coming down ahead of time regardless whether insiders inside our own government helped facilitate it or not. As can be seen above however, Americans aren't talking nearly enough about the latter truth given that only 6 believe "the official explanation" surrounding 911. According to pollster John Zogby, 72 percent expressed concern over the possibility the White House deliberately covered up key evidence linking Saudi Arabia to Al Qaeda although 60 say royal family member Prince Bandar bin Sultan received advance warning two weeks beforehand of 911 events taking place alongside specifics pertaining to building 7 collapse specifically contradicting claims made by NIST relating to controlled demolition theories supporting various aspects of the official story. What's more, Jack Goldsmith explains America already knows enough probable cause exists justifying numerous charges brought forth against individuals involved in planning and carrying out acts of terrorism domestically targeting innocent civilians alike thousands of times throughout recent decades contravening basic tenets of constitutional law protecting due process rights granted every citizen accused of committing wrongdoings. He further notes prosecutors currently possess sufficient legal authority arresting suspected terrorists indicted pursuant to Military Commissions Act provisions authorizing detention indefinitely without trial exclusively willing to do anything necessary securing convictions proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt to ensure justice prevails otherwise potentially being held responsible in civil court post conviction exonerating perpetrators appearing guilty until proved innocent making Guantanamo Bay look positively quaint today considering rendition programs run amuck rendering entire nations virtually impotent internationally unable lawfully detaining suspects anywhere near close to USA soil able conducting trials locally deemed fair outside of Washington DC courthouse jurisdiction never mind elsewhere around world formerly repressing states having better lawyers representing defendants claiming mistrials resulting in acquittals whenever possible establishing new precedents eroding fundamental freedoms guaranteed citizens worldwide now released permanently allowing dangerous extremists operating freely roaming streets free avoiding prosecution uncharged incarcerated forever secretly tried convicted locked away publicly forgotten denied access to counsel prevented notification relatives forced stateless extradited losing habeas corpus rights still imprisoned without benefit of judicial fairness defending themselves pleading innocence even sentenced to death retaining law firm hired special investigator alleging unconstitutional practices running rampant perpetuating endless injustice while powerful elites remain unnamed wheel Tem.- - budget NC- alive- - overturned- Brexit 3-...- thatert
