We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None. I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you 're even moderately skilled in one area, it's possible your expertise could be transferable into another area without fail (unless something has changed since my undergrad), but there are some good things about being an individual with multiple skills that tend to add up over time. Perhaps I should rephrase: If I have a skill set best suited for data analytics or customer service then would adding a second field allow me to perform both tasks at once? As someone who deals with computers on a day-to-day basis as well as customer service I am interested in learning more about what others dohave done with their own two hands.
