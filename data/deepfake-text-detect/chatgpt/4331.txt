The expense of a higher education has been a hot button issue for a number of years but the fact that students take on huge loans and graduate with huge debts is making them feel they are being cheated. A new study out of Australia shows how stress from this level of debt can affect people's health, even in ways similar to those found when people were taking risks at the casino. The results indicate that it may be time to think again about what constitutes college-going age - or to simply raise the bar. For decades now, educational institutions have focused on shortening the time between high school graduation and landing a job as one of America's top earners. Many educators praise this model because they say it helps keep costs down; they also believe it promotes student achievement. However, there is some dispute over whether it actually does so: A 2012 study in Education Week showed that certain employers who evaluate applicants based on their scores on standardized tests, such as the ACT, saw an increase in the proportion of students who graduated late compared with the rate before testing became common place. Those studies suggest that test preparation and other factors could be contributing to the rise in dropouts, especially among African American students.
