Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll be deleting the answer soon. I don't want to start an argument about how much money is underwater or not. Please just tell me if you think it's too highlow (and why). I also know that there are other answers on Econ SE with similar questions but they weren't at all satisfactory for my current situation so please try to keep your remarks focused on those aspects of the question which were most relevant to my case. Also note that the answer has been edited since I wrote it. My background information was taken from I'm fairly new to finance in general and am trying to understand what will happen next month after Brexit happens. If anyone wants more info about the event itself then feel free to ask! The point of this post is that currently, we can see what happened last year by looking at where stocks were traded around December 2017. But when Brexit happens then nothing changes - no party voted for leaving and therefore the UK government still stays in power. During that period of time, the pound value may rise substantially because investors could believe that while you're effectively staying within the EU, nobody else actually cares about whether you leave or stay. So during that 4-6 week period where markets are trading normally without any impact from Brexit the price per share should fall (because shares trade like normal) and yet the actual amount paid for each share shouldn't change either - it would only matter after Brexit day. Yet according to my calculations, the market capitalisation increased by 37b between 6th October 2018 and 7th November 2018 (36.8b pre-Brexit vs 38.7b post-brexit), even though prices dropped over the same period! It seems like something odd might be going on here... To clarify further then, let X denote the total stock exchanged during that 4-week window (i.e., up until Nov 7th), and assume that the fractional shares phimin (0,1) sold by company Mm, who holds a{m}X cdot psi shares of them, satisfies summ{phim}1. Then clearly rac{ao Xh}cdot (summum) 1 implying that the share count increases by one unit (uo1) whenever X0. Furthermore, given that the number of companies selling shares doesn't increase (otherwise every shareholder sells their entire holdings immediately before the deadline.), we must have Xx Y for some real number x0. Thus, assuming for simplicity sake that all buyers buy exactly 1 share, i.e., Y1, we deduce that Delta x-2 and hence X rac{53}x. Therefore, let us define Delta V V{pre-brexitV{post-brexit} and observe that our expression of the increment in market cap becomes egin{arrayrcl} Delta M aoleft V{pre-brexit ( rac{53}x) (sum um) ight) -phantom{left (sum an X Psi ight) 4mm] aaleft V{pre-brexit ( rac{53}x) (sum ak Uk) Pc ight) ag{9} end{array} Now recalling that Uk denotes the outstanding claims of Company Kk, i.e., its obligation minus ownership interest; and noting that x 0, using equation (10) we find that Delta Mgeqslant 5 (27) N S Nfquad ORquadminlimits{jN} gj 2 (27) S Nf,, where we used the fact that gn (V{pre-brexit (V{pre-brexit}Pc) and interpreted the inequality label{eq:inequality} 27 N S Nfleqslant 20 extrm{ppl}, where ppl stands for "people per living area" an approximate measure of population density as being equivalent to saying that the minimum difference between two consecutive cash flows cannot exceed 20 of a typical fixed income instrument's nominal yield.
