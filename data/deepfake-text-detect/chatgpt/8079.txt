Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I 'm going through every single gender that was added in a chronological order so you can see how they were made (and why). So here we go: It started with the "Agender" option for users who self identify as having no sex or sexual orientation at first glance it seems like an awesome idea... but sadly after some time investigating further into what exactly Agendered means discovered something quite disturbing about their intended use; namely its usage by pedophiles trying hide themselves from FB's police force because if someone reports your profilephotos then.. well let me quote one commenter on reddit.."If kids start asking questions she could be arrested." And before anyone says anything more than hey wait! This is America not Iran lets look deeper shall us? Lets take another example which really hits home when thinking back upon conversations between adults talking privately amongst each other where people would talk casually yet thoughtlessly using slang terms often used among children such things becomes recognizable right away..... But now imagine doing said same thing while being recorded behind glass walls full frontal viewable (not only) by any law enforcement officer passing around creepy looking glasses....
