The word 'natural' implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless you're saying that the land would not exist if it weren't for the settlers who built everything on the land which the settlers left behind the land had no right to destroy themselves or others. How does it imply we have any natural laws of nature? It gives people some sort of freedom to build their own civilization around what they want without being taxed by tax payers...
