Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll close it now. About the size of your programs is just that - about 100 KB or so in length (the binary at least). If you're using a lot more than 10-20 lines of code though, then that's definitely not going to be worth sacrificing portability for... unless you really need it Oo - Michael BurrOct 30 '11 at 12:23
