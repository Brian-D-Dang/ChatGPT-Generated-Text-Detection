While it's important to make sure that both partners in a relationship are satisfied, no one has an obligation to fulfill all of their partner's sexual needs. It's important to have open and honest communication about each other's desires and boundaries, but ultimately each person is responsible for their own satisfaction. It's also important to prioritize consent and mutual respect in any sexual encounter, and pressured or obligated sexual activity can be harmful to both partners. In a healthy relationship, both partners should prioritize each other's physical and emotional well-being, rather than feeling obligated to perform certain actions that they are not comfortable with.
