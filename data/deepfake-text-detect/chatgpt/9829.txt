Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my friends and family have said that I'm too restrictive in my diet. They've also said that it's unhealthy for me to not eat certain foods, or that I'm missing out on certain nutrients. The decision to become vegetarian or vegan is a personal one, and there are certainly valid arguments for both sides. While some people may argue that eating a plant-based diet is healthier and more sustainable, others may argue that a balanced diet including animal products is just as healthy. There is no definitive answer, so it is important to consider your own beliefs and preferences when making a dietary decision. At the end of the day, it is up to you to decide what you feel comfortable with. If you feel restricted by your current diet, then perhaps you could consider looking into different types of vegetarian or vegan diets that meet your nutritional needs and fit your lifestyle. Additionally, you could consider talking to a nutritionist or dietitian who can help you make sure you are getting all the necessary nutrients from your diet.
