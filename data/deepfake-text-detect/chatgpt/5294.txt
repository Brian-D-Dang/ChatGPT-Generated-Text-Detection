For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to my parents' divorce (I am looking for something other than the same old stuff). However, it is hard enough being overworked and underpaid as it is - not having those kinds of jobs can't really help me with my own relationship issues at home because I have no place around here anymore so we're working together on finding somewhere else that doesn't require too much energy from both of us. My dad hasn't used his vacation time lately since he moved out once again when he got sick last summer while traveling abroad. I've gotten some great advice though about bringing up things like school work or preparing myself physically before heading overseas next month. But it's still early days yet! Thank you for your reply. Technically speaking, my mom isn't married but she loves him very dearly now:) He does live there fulltime? His mom lives near her family which means he stays there all the time: Thanks for answering!
