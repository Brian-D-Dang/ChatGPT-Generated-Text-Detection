It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. But it also has negative ones such as bullying or victimization by another group member who is perceived "other." What we call bullying could be considered an extreme example for the other side - consider when one person attacks another using harmful comments in order to hurt someone else's feelings. Then there are more subtle forms which might include criticising a friend online at work (an act referred to as online bullying) or making fun of something they said on Facebook. In these cases, individuals may believe their behaviour will not affect anyone but do you know what happens? The impact is usually much greater than previously thought because people tend to hide behind anonymous accounts from where even friends cannot reach them directly via text message, email or phone calls. And research shows this type of cyberbullying affects children differently - younger kids tend to get angry about being bullied while older teens become depressed - either way, neither behavior is healthy! How does increasing our control over technology help us manage our stress levels? Sometimes I find myself wondering whether technology really helps me feel better. For instance, last year my husband and I had our broadband disconnected due to technical difficulties with our internet provider. We were without connectivity until new cables arrived within 24 hours; fortunately, nobody was hurt during this time period. Nowadays though and given how many times we use our phones daily... I am starting to question if we need smartphones after all! Indeed, some studies show how addicted we are to our mobile devices acting out their roles as 'compulsory stimulant' rather than just acts to enhance our lives. In addition, excessive screen-time is associated with poor sleep quality and increased risk factors for both depression and anxiety disorders. So maybe the world doesn't need more smartwatches or tablets, perhaps instead it needs less. But still today, despite everything mentioned above, I continue to look up information for any potential solutions. There must surely be a good reason why people suddenly developed an interest into artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and virtual reality minus knowing anything about its history before now. What makes me think so? Perhaps it's mostly media hype causing us to worry too much about stuff we don't understand. Or maybe people see development as exciting and want to play along with these technologies, hoping to enjoy life before things go wrong again someday soon . Maybe technology truly brings joy and excitement back to certain parts of society once again?! So here comes the big answer: Technology allows us to experience human emotions and connect with others outside of our own home environment through audio, video and voice communication channels. It offers us different types of entertainment choices available nowadays including games, music videos, movies, television series and books. With the first ever smartphone, SMS messages became accessible worldwide whereas the telephone number became universal everywhere. Soon enough, computers started replacing stationary typewriters and eventually replaced human labor altogether in factories. Today everyone seems to expect instant gratification wherever they live and whenever they feel like it. Even government officials seem to view citizens as consumers and users of services at every turn. Coupled with consumerism come worries regarding environmental degradation and climate change caused by pollution and waste production. Many economists warn against unsustainable consumption patterns yet most of us remain oblivious of this issue since we choose to focus solely on the latest gadgets and high tech developments. If we're concerned enough then we should start looking around in the backyard for places we can save electricity, water, gas and food by reducing usage.. Hopefully reading your article made you realize how much power we actually consume everyday simply by living!
