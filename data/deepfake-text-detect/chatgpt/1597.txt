The U.S. Constitution is an old document. At the time it was written, it made a lot of sense, and it was a large jump ahead for democracy, politics, and even economics. But America has changed so much since then that we should be able to revisit our founding principles in ways that are more beneficial today. Granted, there have been changes over the years, but most seem reasonable; such as lowering corporate taxes (thanks to Ronald Reagan's tax cuts), outlawing the death penalty, requiring marriage equality, etc., all of which benefited American citizens at some point or another. As long as these laws benefit Americans broadly, I think they would represent "small government" by our constitutional standards. What do you mean? You can already buy private school vouchers out-of-pocket... How about just making college free? Where does this end?? And how will we ever pay off the national debt if we let everyone get away with getting tuition refunds?!
