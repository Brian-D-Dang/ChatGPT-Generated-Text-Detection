While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept them as being 100 harmless. Science is about asking questions until you find an answer or answers... Democrats don't want scientific debate they just want a blanket of certainty so their lazy asses have something on which to base policy decisions without actually doing any work themselves
