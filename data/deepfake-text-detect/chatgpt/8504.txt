I recently discovered rAnglish. Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots. The result is a language that not only sounds much more authentic, but also has the advantage over Modern Standard in being markedly easier for native speakers from Old Saxony (the area between Germany's Lower Rhine region around WormsMainz down through Baden) or Northern Hesse since it lacks all those pesky Latinate words which are responsible brenntigkeit burning instead becoming "brenn." The biggest problem you will face with Anglicization however would be dictionaries: Most were written by people who speak neither modern Weser nor dialects like Eastern Low Franconian spoken along rivers such as Elbe; they simply do no exist because there was nothing worth noting about them before Middle High Gothic replaced Latin at least some centuries ago - if ever any did even then remain useful after several millennia when most languages had already been heavily changed following conquest attempts during Late Antiquity up until Great Britain became independent again almost 1000 years later! And while many on this site might immediately jump into how easy learning dead tongues must have made pronunciation compared Gaelique still one could hardly claim two thirds our inhabitants know just enough French today beyond what're necessary shop assistants without having studied their respective ancient lingua francas properly...
