Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from club team). Only because of professional commitments and needing money for college needs had to stop playing at 19 yo. Now that I have graduated with good grades most people do not care about me anymore except those who knew I was a soccer player. They have forgotten all about it like high school sports when you are in school years. So what is better? Give them some space or be around them more often? Get back into gamingcyber world other things they may enjoy doing? Or just become friends again since we were always good friends before the sport thing happened.
