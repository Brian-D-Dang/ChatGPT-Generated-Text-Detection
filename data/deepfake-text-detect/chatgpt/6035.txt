I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. The US eventually pulled out of the war, and the USSR followed suit, after Germany, Japan and Italy had already been defeated. The USSR and Germany did not fight each other in the conflict, and the USSR did not declare war on Germany, thus leaving Germany's fate in the hands of the US and Britain. The only way they could have won the war was to surrender, and that is not what happened. Hitler, in 1945, had enough nuclear weapons to completely wipe out all of Germany, France, Britain and America in one fell swoop. (This is assuming that the Germans had successfully developed nuclear weapons - which they may have had, but not to the extent that they could have posed a real threat to the Allies - but in any case, the US and UK were working on them as well, and the German effort may have been less successful than theirs.) Hitler, as much as he wanted to, could not surrender. The only way he could surrender, would have been to order all of his military and civilian leadership to commit suicide, as well as all of his officers and soldiers. The military was all too willing to do so, but the civilian leadership were not. Meanwhile, in the Pacific, the Japanese had three main islands still under their control: Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku. The US had 10 main islands under their control, and if the Japanese had conquered 5 of them (Niigata, Nagano, Okinawa, Kyushu and Shikoku), they would have been able to mount a counter-attack against the Allies that would have eventually taken the Pacific, and even Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, as well as the Hawaiian Islands. The US had fought for, and lost, Hawaii. It would have been disastrous for the Allies to lose the mainland US. However, the US ultimately conquered all of the mainland islands, including Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku, and did not suffer a single major defeat. After the war, the Allies occupied Japan, and they (and the US, especially) imposed a military occupation on Japan. Thus, Japan was essentially conquered, and all three of their major islands were occupied by the Allies. The Germans, in 1945, had three major islands under their control: Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku. The Allies occupied Germany, and they imposed a military occupation on Germany. Thus, Germany was essentially conquered, and all three of their major islands were occupied by the Allies.
