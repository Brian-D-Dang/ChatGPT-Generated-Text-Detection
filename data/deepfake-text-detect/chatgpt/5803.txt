I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand that this is not a good way to do things, but I'm just so tired and just so incredibly lazy. I've taken 10 credits in the past semester, which is too much for me, and I'm always struggling to do well and to pass. I know that I'm never going to get a good job or a good life if I keep this up, but I simply can't care. I'm in my 5th year of college and I'm taking classes that I should have taken years ago. I hate what I'm doing here and I can't wait to graduate. I wish I had the energy to do well, but I never seem to have it. I just want to get out of here. But I'm not sure how to do that. But I'm not sure how to do that. Depending on the field that you want to go into, you may need to keep taking classes to get your degree. (For example, I'm in a program that requires 2 years of full time study, 1 year of part time study, and 1 summer of full time study.) So it's not like you can just "get out of here" the second you feel like it. That being said, you have to take care of yourself. If you don't get your degree, you won't be able to get a job that pays enough for you to make ends meet. (And, no, I don't mean a minimum wage job. But minimum wage is a living wage.) If you can't make ends meet, then you're going to have to go on welfare, which is not the answer. That being said, you have to take care of yourself.

I want to get my BSN, but I can't afford to go to a good school, so I'm going to go to a school that is the least expensive.

I want to get my BSN, but I can't afford to go to a good school, so I'm going to go to a school that is the least expensive. Yeah, I think that's the best answer. If you can afford to go to a school that's in the field you want to get into, I think that's your best bet.

If you can afford to go to a school that's in the field you want to get into, I think that's your best bet. I'm going to have to transfer schools anyway, because my school doesn't offer the major that I want. So I'm stuck with having to go to a local school, which is the cheapest, and I can't really afford to go to a more expensive school. It's very difficult to be motivated when you don't have the money to do the things you want to do. And it doesn't help when you're in a major that you hate. I'm in the same situation.

I've been studying to get my BSN since I was a freshman in college and I just can't stand my major anymore. I'm just sick of it and I don't know how much longer I can take it. Yeah, it's hard.
