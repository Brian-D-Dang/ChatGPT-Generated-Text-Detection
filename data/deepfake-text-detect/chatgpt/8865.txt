Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians. 2. In order for Americans and other nations to see that their nuclear weapons are capable of devastating them, then we need more than the Nukes to annihilate or enslave us. 3. The U.S. cannot use those lethal nuclear devices to weaken our allies. The United States has no right to develop the technology necessary to destroy its enemies by simply leaving them unprotected. 4. We will never have our own green country without nuclear proliferation. 5. America's military is not short-lived; it must be sustained long enough for the rest of the world not to come out of Afghanistan with nuclear arsenals. 6. There is still time for us to achieve what we want as a nation, but the only way to stop these missteps is our own sacrifice. 7. Withdraw from Afghanistan immediately so we can restore peace and prosperity in all parts of the world where terrorists are trying to strike again. Amen For six years now, a bipartisan bill to strengthen Afghan security and stability has been the focus of debate in Congress, but it's never really got off the ground. Congress does want to protect the lives of American citizens who depend on their international contacts - but they don't seem interested in protecting all of us. And there aren't any signs of progress either. So let's get everything in order. The past nine months have included major battles against Taliban militants, the Islamic State group (IS) and several ex-warring groups. It was also last Friday that the Pentagon announced that it would temporarily cut funding for Iraqi counterterrorism operations until October 28th. It went into effect Monday morning. Washington officials said this would allow Iraq to continue conducting counterterrorism missions but it won't prevent ISIS from continuing its attacks. But it's important to point out that the only evidence regarding how this decision affects counterterrorism efforts in the United States comes from research done at the University of Virginia. As a result of the announcement in Washington, Iraqi counterterrorism forces were unable to maintain training while allowing IS militants to carry out attacks. Iraqi authorities also had trouble getting ISIS fighters to pay attention to the mission there, and their detentions have left some women in Mosul - the capital of the heavily fortified city. ISIS militants often use assault rifles in deadly attacks during attacks like this one - which pose an immediate threat to civilians. More recently, ISIS militants used improvised explosive devices to try to break through the gates of U.S.-backed government troops, according to an analysis released earlier this month. That attack killed two men and wounded another person. And yet, the U.S.-led coalition fighting IS has survived this period. Last week, the U.N. Security Council approved 4 billion worth of aid to help combat IS. But as far back as the start of 2015, the U.N. helped to send hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the capital of Baghdad shortly after the U.S.-led invasion began. At least 387,000 Iraqis fled the country in 2014 alone. In addition, the political hostilities between the former U.S. and Iran deal broke down when President Barack Obama pulled the U.S. out of Syria with his new national security agreement signed in 2011. That deal created the National Defense Authorization Act that has since carried the risk of further crises. All along, many experts say the U.S. has failed to provide enough protection for Afghans and their families in post-911 times across the Middle East. This should be major concern for Western governments and observers worldwide.
