As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this problem. There is a lot of evidence that shows these taxes don't actually lower obesity rates; rather, it only creates an artificial sense of scarcity which encourages people to buy less healthy products (such as soda or chips). This leads some to believe that taxing food will somehow make us eat healthier meals while also motivating businesses to produce more nutritious options for customers. In fact, research has shown time after time that such a strategy doesn't work at all by decreasing demand (whether for food or other goods) but instead increases supply, giving consumers even more choices.
