Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking he is dead. Mark survives, and in the book he does everything he can to stay alive until the next mission arrives. It's really a story about survival, but also about problem-solving. I was reading the book on a tablet, and couldn't help but wonder, how would I fare if I were stuck on Mars? Would I survive? What would I need to do to survive? This got me thinking about a bunch of problems that I would face, and I started to imagine possible solutions. The biggest problem on Mars is of course the lack of atmosphere. It's thinner than ours and has 10 of the oxygen. This means we can't run around like on Earth, we'd need a pressurized suit. This was actually one of the problems that Mark faced in the book, and he built a life-support system that he wore. If you're going to Mars, you need to take a lot of supplies with you, but they need to be lightweight and compact. A typical mission to Mars will require 20 tons of equipment to be carried on the rocket. It's hard to imagine how much equipment a person could take with them, but I'm guessing it'd be a lot. When you think about it though, the one thing you need above all else is oxygen. If you're going to be on Mars for any length of time you'll need a lot of it. This is why NASA sent a pressurized rover to Mars in 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory. The rover weighed 2.5 tons, and is still active today. In the movie The Martian, Mark built a hydroponics device to grow potatoes, among other things, but the oxygen for the rover was extracted from his exhaled breath and the Martian soil. The rover could survive on its own for a couple of months, but a human needs oxygen. If I were stranded on Mars, I'd want to build a pressurized suit with a life-support system, like the one Mark Watney used. I'd have to carry my own air with me, and I'd probably only get about 10 minutes of useful work out of it per day. So I'd need to carry a lot of air with me, and I'd want it to be compact. The air would be pumped through a filter that removes the dust, and then into a carbon dioxide scrubber, like the kind found in submarines. A carbon dioxide scrubber is basically a system that removes carbon dioxide from the air, and leaves you with clean oxygen. The scrubber would need to be air-tight, and I'd need a lot of them. If I were stranded on Mars, I'd need a way to get around. Mark Watney built a Rover in the book, but it weighed about 300 kg. There are a lot of people working on making rovers lighter and smaller. In fact, there are two rovers that are being sent to Mars in 2016, and both of them are smaller than the Mars Science Laboratory. I'd build a lightweight rover, about the size of a small car. I'd pack it with everything I needed, including air, and then I'd take off. I'd be able to drive around without a pressurized suit, but I'd still need a filter to remove the dust from the air. I'd also need to take a lot of food with me, since I wouldn't be able to grow food on Mars. I'd also need to take a lot of water, since I'd be using a lot of energy to run my rover. The rover would have a solar panel to power the batteries that drive the rover. The rover would use lithium-ion batteries, which are great because they can charge up faster, store more energy, and are lightweight. The rover would also have a small petrol engine, just in case the solar panels didn't provide enough energy. So I'd need a way to power my rover, and I'd need to carry a lot of food and water with me, and I'd need a way to extract oxygen from the air. I'd also need to take a lot of equipment, such as a communicator, a life-support system, a pressurized suit, and so on
