When I see debate about'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about'evidence'. If they shift on these evidence they don't seem to want to change on these big issues then it doesn't seem to matter too much about the small stuff either.)
