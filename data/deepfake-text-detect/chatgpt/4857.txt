As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not the right use of our money and it certainly isn't smart parenting. I think I am with you here, although if all children die at birth or shortly after (or even if they do) then this would be moot because there wouldn't exist any "children" who could grow up and become parents themselves. In fact, this whole scenario might come about in an alien world where babies don't survive past infancy - but why assume such an absurdly unrealistic situation? And regarding your last paragraph: When someone has their own biological family members, does he feel guilty about his decision to not adopt them? Yes, of course! That's natural. It makes sense. But what happens when we are talking about other people's siblings and cousins and nieces and nephews? What about the half-cousins, step-niecesnephews, etc.? How much guilt should one really feel for withholding from these relatives whom he never knew existed until certain circumstances happened which made him aware of said existence? While my view leans towards making life choices based upon financial means rather than emotional attachment for others (because ultimately no matter how deeply attached one may get to another person, finances cannot keep two people together), I believe that parental feelings can vary greatly individual to individual. For example, some people make very different decisions depending on whether the child in question is theirs biologically or via adoption vs.[Adoption]. There are many individuals in situations like yours whose first instinct (and often only instinct) is to create new families and nurture relationships within those families; and yet not everyone feels as strongly as yourself in regards to creating more humans out of thin air. So while I completely understand your reasoning behind your stance, I also understand that there will always be varying degrees of emotional investment into each parent-child connection, regardless of its origins. And besides, how would anyone know when you did choose to be genetically related versus unrelated unless both parties were present during conception? Whether a child dies before birth or shortly afterwards matters little - either way they go through exactly the same process of being a human being. If anything, long survival times give parents time to miss having their baby around. This seems fairly normal to me. The reason we don't generally mourn the death of adults by saying "oh well now she's dead" is because we just accept that that's part of growing old. Sometimes we say things like ..."if she had lived longer," however I've seen that phrasing used equally when an adult died without suffering instead of dying short, so again, I'm not sure it says much more about us than the idea itself. I agree that people shouldn't spend too much effort mourning something they didn't want anyway, though obviously there are plenty of exceptions to every rule. The distinction between 'babies' born alive and those stillborn doesn't seem relevant to the discussion. As far as I can tell, neither group ever lives. They're both going through precisely the same experience, whatever form it takes depends entirely on their genetic makeup, brain development, and uterus environment. My point was simply that nobody wants to have kids they won't love enough to raise properly, or ones who aren't likely to live for any length of time. Choosing to take care of somebody else over having your own kids is perfectly valid given the information available. My understanding is that most countries allow sperm donations under controlled conditions (eg frozen embryos). Is donating sperm illegal in Canada somewhere? Would it be considered murder, and thus liable to prosecution? Do the donors need to sign contracts specifying that donation results in the production of a specific number of viable fetuses before inheriting any rights whatsoever? If your own son or daughter would fall within the definition of a donor offspring elsewhere, is it possible to legally sue her father or mother for support payments? Or can such a suit be brought against courts involved in awarding custody agreements? Are there any laws governing paternity suits involving third party fathers, e.g., fathers of adopted children seeking recognition? We went back to the hospital yesterday afternoon thinking everything looked OK...even though doctors already told us he faced almost impossible odds of surviving, and we checked several sources including the Mayo Clinic website and Wikipedia. Turns out he wasn't getting any oxygen. He had developed respiratory syncytial virus earlier that week - according to the docs - and didn't respond to treatment. Admittedly, he looks pretty pathetic. You'd expect him to look better considering the level of drugs administered prior to arrival at the emergency room. At least he hasn't been sedated (yet?), since he's quite alert. Therefore my theory is that the lack of fluid intake is responsible for the sunken eyes - straight line down the middle from ear to nose.
