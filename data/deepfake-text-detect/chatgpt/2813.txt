I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is one of those shows where you just HAVE to watch it if only for this reason. Also, fuck SAO haters. Not sure why your being downvoted... You're right. Edit: Reddit can be weird sometimes.
