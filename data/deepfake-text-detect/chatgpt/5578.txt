Most social progressives, love democracy, and so it is of relatively little surprise to me that as they have achieved a majority (in Reddit and the West), that they want to control and change it. However, when we consider this a bit further we realize there is much more than meets the eye. The democratic system, which is not a perfect one, has already changed in the USA (more than any other nation). This has happened in such a way, that it has been relatively smooth and without the full realization of those who have been affected. The American system was changed to a majority, rather than a minority. In other words, the opinion of a majority of the people (who are not considered citizens) matter more than that of the people who are citizens and who are the primary beneficiaries of the system. The problem, however, is that democracy is not a majority rule. Majority rule simply means that the majority of people can enact whatever laws they want. We have a very limited form of democracy in that we elect individuals who have a limited power. This is not democracy. Democracy is when the people are sovereign. They have the ability to enact the laws they wish. The American system has been corrupted in this way, because of the same corruption that has infected most democracies. The people have been unable to see it. The people have been unable to see that they have been robbed of their sovereignty. We are now at a point where the system is so corrupt and so broken that even the system itself is not able to function. We can see this in the extreme failures of the justice system, and in the recent actions of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is not in charge of the economy, but they are the people in charge of money. They have allowed money to be created, which is not based upon real goods, and so real goods cannot be bought. This is why the price of goods has been artificially suppressed and they are now falling. The result of this is that the prices of goods are not real and so cannot be trusted. This has a tremendous impact on the economy. In the same way, the justice system is not in charge of justice. Justice is now a matter of whether you have enough money. There are so many cases where people are imprisoned, but they are actually innocent. Innocent people are being treated as guilty people and treated as criminals. This is simply insane. I will not say that the Federal Reserve and the justice system are a conspiracy. However, I will say that they are corrupt systems which have been hijacked by the unscrupulous. In the same way, the democratic system has been hijacked by the unscrupulous. This is not a conspiracy, because it is so common. In order to save democracy, we must return the power to the people, so that the people can rule. Only then can we have a real democracy. Otherwise we will have a fake democracy, which is really a dictatorship. Social progressives are not real democrats. They are not real democrats, because they want to take away power from the people.
