Just as the title says, I firmly believe that the modern interpretation of the hipster does not truly exist and never has. I'm going to link an article from two years ago that argues the same point. The article, entitled "Is There Such Thing As A Hipster and Does It Even Matter?" was written by Adam O'Neill on the website Thought Catalog in 2016. In it, O'Neill asserts that the term "hipster" is an ever-changing concept with no real definition. He argues that the hipster's identity has been so diminished that it no longer exists and instead has become a label used to deride people for their interests or style. He concludes that the idea of the modern hipster is nothing more than a pop culture fabrication.
