Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved in sexual activity with you or the partner of your choice. It makes sure that everyone feels safe at all times during an encounter. I believe most people who have had experiences while intoxicated would not say they felt safer than if they were sober; rather, many would say their mind was clouded by alcohol so much it prevented them from knowing what they wanted to do sexually, thus leading to regrets later on. You need to remember that consent does not only apply when one person is drunk, but also applies anytime two or more individuals engage in any type of sexual contact and are able to communicate clearly about whether they want to continue. A simple "no" is enough! If someone says no, stop asking questions until the next time you get clear answers. You don't deserve to be treated like trash because you got too drunk and made bad decisions that night. Don't make excuses either, just own up to your mistake and move forward without making excuses for yourself to others.
