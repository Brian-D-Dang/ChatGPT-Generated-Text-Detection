Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just say that my comment is not meant literally in the sense of "you are wrong because you don't know what's best for me." It was mostly an attempt at humour about how much it seems like we do care a lot about our own opinion on these kinds of questions (and perhaps even more than others). I'm personally against abortion...but if someone actually wants one? Best wishes to them! People can make their own choicesdecisions in life with consequences they may or may not find acceptable depending upon who your talking too....
