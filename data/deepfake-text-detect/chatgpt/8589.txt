Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good at making your favorite cheese-flavored sauce any more delicious than it already is. I think you mean mediocre. The word "average" refers to a burger that has been around for almost three decades and not been able to sustain itself. Unless, of course, they're paying attention to what they are saying.
