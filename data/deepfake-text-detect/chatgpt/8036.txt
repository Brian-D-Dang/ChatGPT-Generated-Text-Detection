While it is true that you may not have a personal connection to a lion, it is important to recognize the role they play in the ecosystem. Lions are apex predators and their presence helps maintain a balance in the food chain. Additionally, the loss of lion populations can have a ripple effect on other species and the environment as a whole. Furthermore, there are ethical considerations to take into account as well. As sentient beings, it is our responsibility to care for and protect other living beings, particularly those that are vulnerable. Just because something may not directly affect you, it does not mean that it is not worth caring about.
