To pull an example of a single thread forum off the web: [here] . The only situation where single threads might be good is where a fixed group is involved, and they're talking about one thing in particular. Think of something like or even this blog post I'm writing right now - but with just 1 comment per page instead of 10 comments. If you can't tell from my profile that I have more than 2 pages worth of posts already... The other place where it doesn't work would be if someone has 4 active connections to the site, each reading 5 different topics. This wouldn't happen unless people were posting very short message fragments (think "I agree" or "Why did you say.... It's way too much information for any human brain to absorb at once. So as long as there are multiple messages going on simultaneously then we need a multi-threaded system - MikeWMar 22 '11 at 16:57
