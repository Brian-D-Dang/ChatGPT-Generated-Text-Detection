Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the hikers will make it to safety with only minor injuries and sometimes no injury at all but that doesn't mean this danger has gone away. I'm sure you have wondered why I haven't mentioned any bears yet, have you? Well here is your answer: Bears can be very dangerous animals. They have their own set of rules when interacting with humans which most people don't know about. If you don't follow those rules, then there could be serious consequences for both yourself and the bear.
