While it is true that some "big words" are more commonly used in formal settings, it is important to remember that language is constantly evolving and adapting to different contexts. Just because a word may be perceived as "big" or more complex does not necessarily mean that it is useless or unnecessary in everyday communication. In fact, using a diverse vocabulary can help to better convey complex ideas and express oneself more precisely, even in casual conversation. Additionally, many so-called "big words" have become more widely used in popular culture and can add color and depth to one's writing or speech, making it more engaging and impactful to the audience. Therefore, it is not always accurate to say that most "big words" have no place outside of formal writing or speeches.
