The goods and services we consume are made possible by the abundance of cheap resources and labour that the west gets out of underdeveloped countries. The West has no reason to complain about it, since they benefit from it. When Africans get resource rich themselves, people will find a way for them also. Well, let's say I am an African in 18th century Europe on my own peasant farm getting ready what grain to plant next year. How do you propose I buy enough seeds? What if my lord doesn't allow me to go off for six months while I tend crops so hungry villagers can have something to eat? Do I risk being thrown into jail as vagrant or worse? Clearly things were different back then than now - but barring true magical transportation with only one person (or even less) per sq meter, how else was this accomplished otherwise? It is still impossible today despite our modern technology.... hence "magic..." I think Africa needs more magic. We need better ways to transport ourselves around without needing roads. And not just physical travel either; there should be some kind of cheat code implemented where money magically creates foodstuff whenever needed. If I could create abundant amounts of corn from 1 worth of seed every time someone asked, then famine would never happen again! In fact, why don't all governments give away free magical corn plants to everyone to solve hunger once and forever? Oh wait.................... If you believe that everything comes down to human behavior alone, are looking too deeply at history, andor want evidence that racism does exist check out: Surely you know that money doesn't grow on trees right? And being born poor in a third world country means your chances of being fed isn't exactly high. But hey - let us blame whitey instead of addressing any real issue here.....
