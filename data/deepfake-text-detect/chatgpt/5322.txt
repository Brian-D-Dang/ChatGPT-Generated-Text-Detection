As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not healthy for the child, nor does it serve any purpose other than fostering openness and communication between parents who need help with their children's needs." So why should children be treated differently? "It could take many years before a child develops psychological problems like ADHD," Smith said. "The medical field has always been known as a great place where people discuss issues like this in clinical terms but most families don't understand and can't afford such an expensive treatment option. Parents shouldn't expect kids who suffer from ADHD or autism spectrum disorder because there are more important things they must worry about dealing with first: dealing with divorce, hospitalization etc., which causes family members' emotions when together."
