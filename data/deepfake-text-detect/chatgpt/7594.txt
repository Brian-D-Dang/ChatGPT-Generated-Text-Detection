While being inspired by other tattoos may lead to some similarities, it does not necessarily make the person unoriginal. It is increasingly difficult in today's society to produce something that has no existing resemblance, and so drawing influence from anything, including tattoos, is a natural part of artistic creation. Moreover, each person has their own unique interpretation and personalization of the tattoo design, which adds an element of authenticity to their artwork. Ultimately, inspiration from other tattoos can actually serve as a starting point for one's own creative process, leading to original ideas and innovations.
