I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are centered mainly around Islam. So what could be a problem with being an atheist? The reason I asking this question here because there's alot of opinions about it in internet forums. My first impression was that its very easy to get arrested for atheist by Islamic countries but then i checked online sources, found out that God damn America has one of highest rate of atheists among other western countries (but still relatively low compared to non-western ones). And as you can see from wikipedia religion section "Atheism" is a minority in USA (around 3). Thats why theres no such thing like a ATHEIST VS ISLAM or RELIGION WARS - so thats pretty much how new generation look at things. Their thoughts don't change just because their parents were told something different... Could you imagine if all of US would have thought the same way our life would have changed dramatically less than 50 years ago? So everybody can think whatever he wants regarding religions.. I'm curious to know where your opinion comes into play. What do you think about the risedecline of atheism in general and countries which are predominantly Muslim? What does right mean to you? Do you believe people should be educated more about rights they enjoy even when majority doesn't care? Should they tell everyone who want to eat pork or drink alcohol to shut up????? How many of us really understand what Freedom means???.. If at least two thirds had said YES, i wouldn't ask myself those questions because everybody feels free to make personal choices but doing opposite shows lack of respect towards others and me personally i neither need nor deserve any special treatment for ideas im not willing to follow... For example: you're christian yet you dont go to church every sunday or celebrate thanksgiving; meanwhile you also support women's emancipation; all of this makes sense to me since we're humans and living in society... Anyone else feel free to answer to me if u wish, hopefully we'll open some eyes (even mine):) In response to the OP, Atheists aren't likely to come under persecution anywhere, except maybe Iran where there are specific laws against them. Arab states generally frown upon religious extremism and impose heavy penalties if someone starts spreading that nonsense. However due to general ignorance and xenophobia, most Muslims will probably hate them regardless. It's rare that a country falls into dictatorship at mid century unless it undergoes mass immigration. Most Arab states wereare run fairly well until recently. The fall of Saddam Hussein didn't turn Iraq into a playground for death squads targeting political dissidents either. Even in Syria now, Assad isn't killing his own citizens en masse anymore. Also most Arabs aren't freaking racists like Americans are. You won't find anyone calling black folks monkeys and claiming Jews rule the world. There is only 1 place within those borders called Palestine though, in which Christians or Jews live together peacefully. - bananaskullMar 9 '12 at 15:50 Tuna Bite: yeah i used to think exactly the same but after reading comments on facebook, funny how americans totally forget about what happens behind doors, and especially after 911 attacks. They may consider themselves safer now but doesnt seem like its gonna stay that way forever... Imagine if all people didnt bother to learn what happened before 911.... - omar abdoullahMar 10 '12 at 0:39 1 Perhaps now is better than ever considering the number of atheists in Western civilizations. In fact, the current president of the United States is one himself! Nevertheless, while the idea of nonbelievers is becoming increasingly acceptable today, institutions such as schools continue to teach children they must adhere to various aspects of the Christian faith within their daily lives. As a result, others often begin questioning whether nonbelief fits into their lives too. Some individuals decide to leave organized religion entirely (or never engage with organized religion at all), whereas others remain faithful to traditional beliefs albeit without adhering to institutionalized practices. Regardless of how far a person chooses to take their disbelief, tolerating each other's differences seems more important than sharing one particular worldview. History clearly indicates that many societies throughout time have accepted diverse points of view although there may have existed social barriers based upon cultural values. In those instances, believers of differing faiths eventually learned to coexist peacefully. This process usually begins with discussions between members of opposing groups rather than physical conflict resulting indirectly from war. Considerations such as language, ethnicity, race, age, gender, economic circumstances, level of education, historical context, and national politics all influence interactions - often negatively at times. Therefore, sincere attempts to overcome prejudices require attentive listening skills, careful consideration of socioeconomics, openness toward foreign cultures, attentiveness to difference, tolerance for ambiguity, sensitivity toward diversity, willingness to explore alternative viewpoints, understanding that others hold contrary views, patience, choice, quality judgments in expectations for evaluating value judgments for allowing individuals to signexendering direction to offer tavrisk factor retire a great business leaders, devoted
