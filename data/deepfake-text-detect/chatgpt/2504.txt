When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether you're getting stoned at home alone because your friends are out drinking and driving themselves home to get high with their other friends who were already drunk when they drove over here in the first place or if you're doing something stupid while smoking weed together - the result is still deadly behavior that has no business being legal anywhere except for medical use, which, by the way, should not be allowed either since we currently have more than enough people addicted to all kinds of drugs as it is without having an extra one added to our list; imagine what would happen if everyone started using marijuana like how some people drink alcohol: just to reach a certain level of intoxication? Allowing recreational drug users to legally do whatever they want under the guise of "freedom" isn't about freedom at all, rather it's about making money off these addicts so big corporations can continue to profit from them. It was never anyone's intention to allow adults to smoke pot wherever they please and whenever they feel like it, but after decades of propaganda campaigns aimed at convincing us otherwise, Americans seem to think it's ok now. If anything, this particular legalization debate has become even messier than others before it simply due to its extreme political nature combined with America's obsession with maintaining the illusion of freedom for itself above everything else despite the fact that many of us know better after years of watching destruction come down upon communities throughout the country that had nothing to do with any kind of war whatsoever (e.g., harsh laws against possession of tiny amounts of drugs plus nonstop militarization of local law enforcement agencies resulting in death squads roaming around neighborhoods looking for suspects). Who cares whether or not someone decides to light up a joint during consumption of another substance such as edibles or vaporized cannabis extracts without risking arrest? We've honestly reached the point where there really shouldn't even be a question anymore, especially considering that selling marijuana in most states right now is akin to selling liquor in many places across North America yet consuming marijuana is somehow considered much worse simply because it comes directly from the plant instead of coming prepackaged and sealed inside of bottles containing far too much booze to handle responsibly. The state government authorities responsible for regulating the sale and purchase of various substances obviously care very little about public safety regardless of the current cultural climate towards legalizing drugs; quite frankly, I'm starting to suspect that American politicians don't give two shits about individual freedoms unless those rights relate specifically to guns, abortion, marriage equality, capital punishment, etc. - anything that will help them stay elected comes first then basically every single person in the nation gets to decide individually if heshe likes the outcome of said decision based solely on personal preference and convenience. Another thing worth mentioning is that putting restrictions on marijuana sales via means of taxation takes away perfectly good options available to smokers and cannibis consumers regarding ways of obtaining cannabinoids beyond smoking traditional joints. Just look at Washington D.C.: once medical marijuana was legalized, it didn't take long until retailers began bringing in edible products made entirely of THC-rich concentrates called tinctures or capsules full of dried flower buds mixed into chocolate bars meant only for inhalation purposes - are you telling me these aren't good alternatives for patients suffering from conditions like cancer who won't benefit from smoking regular marijuana flowers because they find the experience unpleasant? How exactly does taxing edibles further stigmatize them for existing customers while taking away an option for new ones? These arguments may sound familiar: "Just keep it simple and legalize it!" Well guess what: keeping things illegal causes all sorts of problems unrelated to law enforcement including lack of consumer choice, black market violence related to illegal activity, and skyrocketing rates of incarceration along with countless lives lost needlessly thanks to draconian sentencing practices put forth by judges who apparently believe convicted felons deserve to live life sentences forevermore anyway.
