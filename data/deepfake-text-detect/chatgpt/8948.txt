It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet. I've always found it to be a great thing for the environment, especially if those same drivers think that's where they live. It is certainly true that the latter have no reason to worry about noise pollution as long as there aren't any cars going into the street at night. But - not everyone does it just because they obviously like driving. The problem isn't even "not everyone."
