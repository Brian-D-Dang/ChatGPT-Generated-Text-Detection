While it can be frustrating to have a noisy moviegoer, it is important to remember that everyone has a right to enjoy public spaces, including those with disabilities. Deaf individuals may not be able to control the volume of their vocalizations and may not be aware of how loud they are being. Additionally, movie theaters are required by law to provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities, such as closed captioning devices. Rather than kicking out the child, a better solution would be to provide these accommodations and ensure that all patrons can enjoy the movie in their own way.
