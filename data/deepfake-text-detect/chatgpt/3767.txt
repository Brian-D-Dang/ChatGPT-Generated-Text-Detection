Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 7th century CE and spread throughout much of Mesopotamia. It was introduced into Europe by Muslims who took it over when they conquered Northern Africa around 971. By the time Islam had reached England and Ireland, it was the dominant form of Christianity for much of Western Europe - though it also saw its share of conversions to Judaism before the 11th century CE.
