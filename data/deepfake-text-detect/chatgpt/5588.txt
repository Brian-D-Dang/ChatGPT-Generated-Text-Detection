If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available to those who don't have a good education or skills that are in demand. So, why have the USA and most of the industrialized world had a problem with this since the early 1970's? The answer is simple. Those who are in positions of power want a cheap labor force so they can make money. The USA is in danger of losing our position as a superpower if things continue as they have since the 1970's. I do see a slowing down in the near future, but I don't see it becoming stagnant or declining. The population of the world has been growing for the last 100 years, it will take time to change that. Even if the population of the world decides to stop having babies, we will have problems. When people die, they will not be replaced by new people. This will decrease the population, but it won't stop it. I'm not sure how we could have stopped the population growth in the 1970's. We weren't in a position to go to war and eliminate millions of people. That is what is going to happen when the population of the world hits 10 billion. If it is only a matter of deciding to stop having babies, what's the problem? A person can decide to stop having babies, but if they already have them they can't just kill them. This will be a problem in the future.
