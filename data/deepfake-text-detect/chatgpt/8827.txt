Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions, but they are not always successful. First of all, the article is about literally everyone who has ever been involved in actual political activity in college. Second, people think they're going to get a "good" job because they're "so good." They're just pretending.
