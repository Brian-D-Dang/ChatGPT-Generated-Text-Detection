For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system in which there are public or government-owned corporations andor entities that control all aspects of life (including economic matters). There's no denying it: Socialism has been growing in many countries around the world for decades now. In fact, some would say we've never seen anything like the amount of socialism being shoved down our throats these past few years...in the name of "equality." It didn't start off that way though; not by any means. Originally, capitalism was created in order to replace feudalisma bizarre mix of an economy based on ruler-controlled industries and businesses, and religious religions dictating every aspect of people's lives. It seemed so inefficient during its time that it went out of business right away, but then came back when scholars realized how much more efficient true socialism could be to provide things such as healthcare and education. However, once 'true' socialist systems started up they typically controlled everything within their sphere of influence, including industry. The Soviet Union took heart lessons from Germany after World War II and used them to create similar models of efficiency and growth throughout Eastern Europe until the Cold War ended. Then, Western Europe slowly began adopting parts of those failed Socialist models and soon became known for highly planned economies that were largely unmatched anywhere else in the world. America had always taken pride in being a country built upon freedom, opportunity, and equal rights for everyone; however, over the next half century the United States followed suit and adopted some of the worst elements of the aforementioned models. During the 1980s alone, one quarter of American workers lost jobs due to automation and globalization; currently, only 20 percent of Americans have health insurance through employment while most nations already average closer to 60. We learned to trust politicians and bureaucrats even less than before, perhaps because government can do nothing better at controlling labor forces? Not anymore! Today, the majority of countries will likely follow Australia, Sweden, France, Switzerland and Denmark into what I call Capitalism 2.0. This version follows the ideals established in America by having freer markets, lower taxes, minimal regulation, and genuine laws protecting natural resources and innovation against monopoly practices. Capitalists tend to believe completely opposite philosophies, where socialists think alike. For example, capitalists want profits first, last, and always while socialists feel that society should come first and above all else. Both sides agree that regulations need to be kept to a minimum in order to allow large companies to thrive without hindrance. Noticeably different between the two ideologies is that most capitalist societies put far greater emphasis on individual responsibility in regards to morals and ethics whereas nearly 100 of Socialistic governments abuse their power to impose often draconian rules meant to keep their own citizens under lock, stock, and barrel. That's not to imply Socialisms require corruption or bad leadership; no leader or politician needs to be corrupt if heshe is following the social contract. Look closely enough and you'll find all sorts of examples of corruption everywhere in history. Where does this leave us today? Let's take a look at how both forms of economics work together to help define your personal financial situation today: What constitutes a good job?3 hours per week working for 17,000 annually isn't considered good money anymore. Many employers across the globe won't hire anyone unless they complete a four year college degree program costing thousands each year. Once an employee reaches hisher mid-thirties with five years experience, that person may receive promotions without expending endless amounts of effort since younger employees are simply expected to learn new technologies quickly regardless of speed or quality. Also, many jobs nowadays don't pay well because the economy requires constant expansion in order to survive. Companies must constantly increase product lines, expand territories, hire more staff, invest heavily in research and development, etc., for fear of losing customers or going bankrupt. If the company survives just long enough, the pool of unemployed grows larger still. With fewer jobs available once reaching retirement age, the only possibility for survival lies in finding work abroad or starting a small home business of one's very own. Needless to say, it makes sense why almost 70 of U.S. households live paycheck to paycheck according to the Federal Reserve System: They spend every penny earned plus interest before receiving any sort of income whatsoever. And yet, we expect to continue living comfortably on low wages for several decades to come. Isn't it ironic? This is exactly why powerful parties and institutions hire lobbyists who craft legislation intended to benefit themselves at the expense of others. Because they aren't required to share their earnings, lobbyists regularly donate hundreds of millions to political campaigns and lobbying firms whose sole purpose is to represent the interests of certain groups at the cost of national unity. When taxpayers finally pack their bags and move overseas, they inevitably discover that competing Corporations struggle to secure licenses in other countries as well. Since competition drives down costs, the end result is little different than that the real estate brokerage firm becomes rich when resources get out of hailing Gross error.
