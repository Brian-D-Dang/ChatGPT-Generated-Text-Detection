This stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the Greek economic crisis, and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the EU. These were basically comments along the lines that the ECB's monetary easing was not enough - that it hadn't helped Greece at all really, as well as other countries in Europe that also got into trouble (Ireland for one). Two thoughts occurred to me: firstly, why is no-one criticising this? The banks are very profitable indeed; they've made money out of all these governments' mismanagement, so there seems little reason or incentive to even question them in any great detail; secondly, if you're going to criticise something like this, shouldn't you be able to put forward some alternative solutions yourself rather than merely giving your opinion as someone who has never worked in the banking industry etc.? Anyway, would love to know the opinions of others here too! Shouldn't we just try and address whatever issues come up with our own ideas, but until then, let the bankers continue doing their job without criticism? Thoughts below:) One always has to remember those less fortunate and forget about hisher self interest before criticizing anything. The European Union just handed over 20 billion euros (28 billion) to Ireland to bail it out of its debt crisis, including a loan meant to help pay off part of its massive bank bailout. This after Ireland refused aid last week when many European leaders proposed adding an extra 4 levy on the country's banks - which hold more than half Ireland's total debts. A group of economists called leaders in Brussels "a pack of irresponsible looters," while Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen described how he felt betrayed by fellow Europeans who refuse to back him [1]. But such public outcry may fuel talk among voters that they need to withdraw from the euro currency bloc because life will only get worse under new leadership [2]. Without an immediate change in governance across Europe, Debit Cardholders may find themselves unable to access funds held within their accounts during periods of uncertainty - especially given that card networks currently restrict cash withdrawals from ATMs in times of stress. Cardholder customers can normally expect 50 per month free ATM withdrawal fee reductions if required to make payments via a mortgage instead of debit cards. However this offer cannot apply to existing mortgages longer than five years old or where the customer pays fees directly to the lender. Do you think that the current financial system set-up needs changing in order to better deal with crises like this? If so, what changes should happen? Would the government stepping in take things further away from the private sector, or do you think companies could sometimes use the state to improve their systems? Do you agree completely with the politicians' views expressed above? I'm curious to hear peoples' points of view, whether they tend towards complete deregulation, partial regulation or keeping everything exactly as it is now. Personally, I'd like to see as much freedom for businesses to fail as possible. A lot of my friends work for large corporations, so I don't want anyone getting hurt by bad business practices. Clearly, capitalism isn't perfect, but I don't believe that more interventionist policies go hand-in-hand with social responsibility. In addition, the benefits of competition aren't fully realised unless everyone plays fair. It doesn't matter how hard you strive to play fair if there are no consequences for those who cheat. Even though capitalism is imperfect and unfair, that still leaves us quite greedy... But perhaps greediness is necessary to create progress!
