The implementation of Judicial Review from the Marbury v. Madison case from the precedent of the Judiciary Act of 1789 allows for the Supreme court to be to judge over the lower courts based on their own "judge-made" law and not federal or state laws in question. An example could be that if a plaintiff sues for breach of contract, then they will need to get a judgement against the defendant (the company). If the company refuses to pay up, then the plaintiff can file suit with the superior court under some circuit of jurisdiction cases which has jurisdiction over the parties involved. The plaintiffs would have had to register as a party, and place themselves into this category prior to filing suit; whereas, if it was just an ordinary person suing another individualbusiness, the plaintiff would first go through the local Circuit Court before seeking legal action at higher levels. If the court rules in favor of the plaintiff, the trial is concluded without ever going back to the original District Court level where the case began. This allows for issues to be heard by someone more experienced dealing with such matters than what you might find within the district courts. It also makes sure that similar trials are being held across the entire country regardless of geography barriers - so no matter how far away one may live from New York City, there's still a chance for them to receive justice when accused of a crime committed in say Miami Beach, Florida.
