I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; defended against anti-abortionists and others who would deny them their right to choose what happens with their own bodies; voted in every election from 1976 through 2008, when I moved out of state. And yet even as someone who has earned many tickets on that side of the parking lot at Citizens United, watching my party throw its support behind Mitt Romney was painful to watch last night. It felt like some sort of personal affront - to all those people who had worked so hard to get me into this position. Besides which, it's clear now we are not going to elect him anyway. We will lose bigly. But still...the idea that anyone could actually think this man is fit to be our commander-in-chief should make us all cross our fingers and hope we don't wake up tomorrow morning in an America where citizens can no longer vote. It wasn't immediately apparent why you should care about this except that Mr. Obama just won an easy victory over his Republican opponent here in Illinois during the primary elections. Also he's black, though I couldn't find any evidence that suggested racism played a role in the outcome or hurt the GOP candidate in Chicago. But if there really is something more than race involved then perhaps it might be best to understand how that works before getting too excited by it. This interview offers insight regarding social class and education as they relate specifically to African Americans: ...The [black] middle class used to dominate the majority of blacks but not anymore. The lower-class blacks, especially the poor blacks, now outnumber upper-income blacks. They tend to live in large cities because that's where jobs are concentrated. And these inner city neighborhoods reflect the educational level of Blacks living there. Whites never lived in such places until recently. These urban areas were inhabited mostly by farm laborers, domestic servants, sharecroppers and other unskilled workers. A typical example today is Ferguson Missouri, St Louis County. This community consists mainly of low income whites and a higher percentage of Hispanics compared to most predominantly black communities throughout the U.S. So, we have learned that Black poverty rates rise dramatically across the states when one moves away from predominately rural northern regions along the Mississippi River Valley, toward populous coastal southern states. In fact, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Urban Affairs "A growing body of research suggests that geographic mobility may play a significant part in explaining socio-economic disparities between metropolitan centers and surrounding suburban locales." Those residents migrating to urban core manufacturing sites typically found themselves with few opportunities in terms of job skills training. To address this problem, certain programs have begun to assist these disadvantaged migrants. For instance, federally funded Job Corps Centers provide limited vocational instruction while placement agencies help relocate individuals seeking employment within specific industries. Unfortunately, the relatively small number of available positions restricts access to these programs. Another federal program called TANF provides direct cash assistance to families enrolled in public welfare offices. However, eligibility requirements limit participation, making TANF less effective than expected. Unemployed parents who receive both Social Security Disability Insurance benefits and unemployment insurance also qualify for additional TANF money, thereby improving outcomes for children born to single mothers. Yet, owing to administrative complexity associated with receiving multiple forms of government financial aid and determining compensation levels based upon household size, the benefit amount varies considerably among recipients depending upon marital status and family composition. Unfortunately, only 56 of eligible single parent households participate in SNAPFood Stamp Programs, leaving approximately 30 million Americans ineligible for food stamps unless married couples obtain separate benefits rather than shared enrollment. Among unmarried mother households whose sole member participates in SOCIAL SECURITY disability benefits, 45 percent receive AFDC alone, 39 percent receive Food Stamps, 3 receive Medicaid and 5 receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Nonparticipation in either AFDC or emergency relief programs seems highly injurious to long term prospects for economic independence. USDA Residential Segregation Study shows major racial segregation occurring due to housing patterns favoring blue collar white males. The US Census data indicates that almost half (49) of blacks reside in very high minority concentration zip codes, and 29 live in extremely high proportion minority clusters. Yet only 20 of men age 25 - 64 hold skilled production occupations (data as of 2001). If immigrants do not want to learn English, integrate, become loyal citizens and assimilate, deportations seem warranted. Like the rest of our country, African Americans are struggling economically and need sufficient financial resources, regardless if they work full time or barely survive off government handouts. Poverty amongst minorities reaches alarming proportions. According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, 53 of Black Children experience homelessness. An estimated 381,000 homeless persons nationwide constitute 6.2 of total population. Most of these numbers include veterans. Other figures indicate that every day 1.5 million users connect nearly everyone elselike the same thing the imatering the rightte ( (
