One counter-argument could be that morality is not objective, but rather subjective and influenced by cultural and societal norms. What may be considered morally acceptable in one culture or era may be deemed immoral in another. Additionally, individuals may have varying moral beliefs and values based on their personal experiences and worldview. Therefore, it is difficult to assert that there is an objective standard for morality that applies to all individuals and cultures.
