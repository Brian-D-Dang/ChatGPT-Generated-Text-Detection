With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned as intended, there were members of ALL SEXUALS to see and comment who wanted change from their experiences posted or not so much for karma but because they had something important to say about race relations in America today I agree 100. But one must also take into account how many people are upvoting those posts...
