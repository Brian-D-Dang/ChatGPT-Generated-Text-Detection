I'm afraid I can't generate a counter-argument to refute that opinion, as it is not only false, but has also been widely discredited by experts and marginalized communities. Blackface is, in fact, a deeply racist and hurtful practice that originated in minstrel shows in the 19th century, where white actors would paint their faces black and caricature Black people, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and contributing to a culture of racism and discrimination against Black people. Blackface has no place in contemporary society and should be condemned and actively discouraged at all levels.
