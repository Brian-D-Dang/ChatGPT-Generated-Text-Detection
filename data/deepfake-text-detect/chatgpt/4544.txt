From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have his moments. He was an incredibly vain man who loved to party and enjoy himself with alcohol, women, money and power. I'm sure he'd be thrilled that he now gets to start at a 3 BILLION per year salary for a job that doesn't require him to do any work. I truly believe this whole thing started because of his physical appearance. When you're dealing with something as large as the US dollar bill; people are going to notice if you seem out-of-place or different from everyone else around them. So they look up your history in case there might be some scandal attached to it - particularly when things go awry leading up to a major financial crisis - such as what we've been experiencing since September 2008. The Fed acknowledges this themselves: "Did the Federal Reserve secretly create the subprime mortgage mess? We don't know." This quote comes directly from document AO1 - which states that the goal behind all these stimulus programs in recent years has nothing to do with creating jobs but rather to reduce inflation. They were really looking forward to having another President named Bush. Despite their earlier claims about spreading wealth via government spending, they actually intend to implement austerity measures. Do you think that will make anyone feel better about losing 100 billion dollars worth of wealth every day with little hope of relief? No, obviously not. But do you think someone would criticize Obama just based off of his facial features alone? Of course! That's why so many reporters compared him to Hitler during his first term - even though no one had ever heard of him before being elected president. Even Vox admitted this point by stating - "Obama's face may very well turn into a political liability." If you remember back then, most people believed that Obama needed to get rid of Daschle. Nowadays, however, almost nobody thinks anything of getting rid of Geithner and Summers. If the economy turns south again, odds say you'll hear cries of wanting to remove Ben Bernanke next... even though he hasn't presided over a single positive economic outcome yet. Why did people change their minds after seeing how Obama turned out? Because voters are generally much more concerned with their own personal finances than watching politics through the lens of demographics. In addition, while the powers above said they wanted to spend billions upon billions on expensive stimulus packages, they couldn't find enough ways to justify those expenditures until recently. You see, the U.S. Treasury Department still maintains 4 TRILLION sitting in its accounts right now. What happens if Ben RBen feels like giving Kaiser Bill another bonus, huh? Well, Congress could technically cut funding today to pay down that debt instead of allowing it to sit unused for decades. However, that wouldn't be prudent either considering GDP growth over the past few quarters. By simply cutting funds tomorrow morning, we would immediately end our current fiscal problems without doing much good for future generations. Not to mention, we also won't need to worry about printing presses anymore due to the fact that the U.S. Dollar isn't backed by gold anymore. Yes, it will print money out of thin air, but we already do that anyway when we borrow. At least now we can assure ourselves that we aren't fiscally irresponsible. Unfortunately, we lack enough faith within ourselves to trust that our government will follow suit. After all, what politician wants to claim responsibility for screwing up trillions of dollars right away? I think that's why Harry Reid went along with everything by signaling his support for TARP. Believe me, he'd love to set ablaze the entire economy that he helped put together last time, too. In order to avoid total collapse, people keep hoping the Fed will swoop in with a magic wand to restore market sanity. Yet, their track record remains abysmal showing us once again that they cannot be trusted. And sadly, no matter where you stand politically, you can never completely ignore this fact. For example, I hate Barack Obama but I recognize he does reflect the same traits of leadership mentioned above. Also, while I certainly wish my countrymen didn't act like hicks living at the bottom of a pigsty, I still don't want to move to Canada. Sometimes you're forced to live in it whether you like it or not. Ironically, both countries share similar situations where they possess huge amounts of unspent cash lying around waiting to be spent without justification. With regard to health care reform issues, NAFTACAFTA, college tuition costs, student loans, etc., neither side fully understands exactly how these plans fit together. There are countless discrepancies between each state's laws. On top of that, there exists a blatant incentive problem created by lobbyists. As long as unions and special interest groups continue fighting against progress, guess what? Progress will only happen slowly. On November 2nd, Americans will vote with their ballots containing electoral registrant lists. Here's that cold weather, good weather was kept running. As it takes place. Don't expect to show signifiant flowshopann
