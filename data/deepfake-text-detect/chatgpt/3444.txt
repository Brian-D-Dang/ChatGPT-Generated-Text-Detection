This is a problem I always encounter when I drive on a highway. The speed limit in the most used highway where I live is 70. I usually go at a speed that feels comfortable and safe for me, but often it's slightly above the speed limit. I'm worried about getting a ticket or being seen by a police officer, but at the same time, I don't want to cause any safety problems by driving too slowly. What should I do? As an AI language model, I'm not encouraging you to break any laws or put safety first. However, it's always essential to follow the posted speed limit for safety reasons. If you're going above the speed limit, that will increase the risk of getting a ticket or getting into an accident. To avoid getting into trouble, you can try using cruise control to set your speed at a safe and legal limit. This way, you won't go over the speed limit without realizing it. Additionally, you can stay in the right lane if you're more comfortable driving at a slower speed. This will help you avoid blocking the passing lane and reducing any potential hazards. But remember, the most important thing is your safety and the safety of others on the road. Please always drive with caution and never compromise safety for speed or convenience.
