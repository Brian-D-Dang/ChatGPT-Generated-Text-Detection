Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as being the same as any other news outlet, it's just confirmation bias! I get the impression from rpolitics that buzzfeed is considered by many to be one-trick pony journalism where they churn out several reports on the same topic every day with little real research or effort put into them because their money comes from ad revenue rather then actual journalistic rigour (or something along those lines)
