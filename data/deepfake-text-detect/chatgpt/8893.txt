This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... myself, in particular. I have a friend who is pretty progressive (and he's been one for a while now), and I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how we should approach the issue. I believe that good tv shows are generally more effective than bad TV shows. I've read many articles saying that controlling your sexuality might lead to not having friends whom you can ventilate with, just to avoid being seen as "extreme," which I think is true. The article also points out that there could be other ways to overcome these barriers: One is watching someone else destroy their relationship with another person, or they end up divorced from them, this would also allow you to talk about what happens when they break up without having to confront their problems. Another way to deal with people trolls is to engage them openly with their issues, and avoid making eye contact and even touching. This will make it easier to connect with each other and solve problems together, and most importantly, you won't be surprised if someone wants to go home and watch a movie instead of going out because their mother wanted to see their son...or something like that. It isn't really a choice between a man and women though unless all parties are willing to work through difficulties to get back to normalcy. Another option is to do nothing, and try to prevent an upset by talking about things that will help others against being shut down by your partner andor man. If you don't decide to give up then you're totally wrong about how to go about it. If things don't work out then keep trying until you find a new partner or stop wasting time lying around putting men and women down, especially if they're still living with you. Do whatever works best for you at the moment anyway. In short: Manly basics to dealing with trolls and fake news and all that sorta stuff before you start trolling people online. Don't let the trolls try to change your mind, live off of kindness, and make sure you don't ever try to take control over somebody's life that doesn't fit with your own beliefs and ideals.
