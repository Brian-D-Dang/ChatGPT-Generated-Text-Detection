To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For clarity, can you explain why the arguments you would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void? It would help me understand the context of your statement and provide a more informed response.
