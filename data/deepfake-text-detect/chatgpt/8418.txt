Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make people like me pay for their kids' college education but let's say you're not a welfare mom or anything (I'm going assume here). Let's just talk hypothetically how things would be if we didn't have historical levels government spending on our higher educational institutions today... Shorter version: How much more money does someone need before it is worth giving them some kind sorta free-market type options? Donate your labor AND buybuild capital equipment OR donating other peoples LESS CAPITALized goods; both with no guarantees that either will work out better than simply saving up cash until retirement age while using said savings toward investments elsewhere later down life course - which can then yield an even greater return over time by investing into assets such stocks real estate rather via periodical 401k contributions etc....Or do what my parents did invest lump sums at periodic intervals during working careers after taxes are paid so they never really had any debt except student loans...but those were manageable because one could put off making payments due all relative circumstances being equal per consumerist mentality carte blanche mindset right? So why should anyone feel guilty having accumulated wealth through regular wages instead letting govt handouts steer us further astray along current path towards totalitarianism where only state sanctioned fiat currency profit seeking agents benefit??? Why isn 't there something akin "Amerika" without ongoing war propaganda machine luring young American talent away everywhere else based upon intoxication induced delusions thinking America has always been great since its founding when history tells another story altogether??!?!
