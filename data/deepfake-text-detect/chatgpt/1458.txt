I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other similar places for inspiration, then fill in what you want with whatever colors go where! It's not going to be perfect but that's okay because what matters is if YOU are happy when you see yourself:) Thank you!! I'm definitely getting my own style down first before I get any tattoos though:D
