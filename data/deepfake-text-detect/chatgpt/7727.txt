While it's important to acknowledge that female rape victims have historically been subject to a greater degree of stigma and lack of support, it's important to recognize that any form of sexual assault is a grave injustice. Gender doesn't dictate a person's right to live free from harm or eliminate the profound effects of sexual trauma. We should work to create a culture of compassion and sensitivity towards all sexual assault and provide equal resources aiming towards recovery and healing.
