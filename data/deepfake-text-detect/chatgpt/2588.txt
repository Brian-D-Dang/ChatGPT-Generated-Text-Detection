So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern social issues are a result of those changes in technology and society that we notice today. What about slavery? Slavery was around long before "modern" politics existed (not sure how long you define as "current," though).
