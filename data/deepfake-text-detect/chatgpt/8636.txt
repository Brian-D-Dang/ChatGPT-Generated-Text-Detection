tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to the NFL, I'm usually more into the big plays and the footballs than anything else. I still love the Bears because they have great player who is passionate about the game, and just plain fun people to be around. I also enjoy hawkshawks basketball
