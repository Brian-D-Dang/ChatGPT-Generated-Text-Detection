There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is to ensure that elections are fair, free, and democratic, and that the will of the people is not compromised or corrupted by bribery or coercion. By prohibiting the buying or selling of votes, the law seeks to protect the integrity of the democratic process and maintain public confidence in the outcome of elections. The law also promotes the idea that every citizen has an equal say in the governance of their country, and that no individual or group should be able to use money or other incentives to influence election results.
