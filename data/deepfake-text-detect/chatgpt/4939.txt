Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women amongst scientists and engineers? The answer is yes, but they don't want to increase the number of women working for them because they can just hire more men who are willing to lose their jobs if this will improve their chances at advancement opportunities. Women make up 14 of the population on the planet's land surface (population 8 billion). There aren't enough female researchers and engineers to cover all these hundreds of millions of girls and women worldwide. If anyone has any idea what percentage it takes, please don't hesitate to call the National Institutes of Health (NIH) HR Director Dr. Manfred Weber, who interviewed yesterday's meeting with the president. Ladies and gentlemen, we need your help! We have a new project that asks hard questions: Women Are Human. It involves using video conferences between scientists from around the world discussing issues related specifically to gender diversity and better understanding how women participate in scientific innovation projects as well as increasing male participation among universities globally by bringing together female scientists wanting to engage in research collaboration improving academic access through advanced technology collaborations based upon innovative approaches such as peer-reviewed publications instead of traditional research papers and journals reviewed exclusively via the internet. It also builds upon our existing partnership with the University of Washington to offer female students biometric information sharing programs across campuses and partnerships with universities throughout the nation focusing on building relationships where appropriate.
