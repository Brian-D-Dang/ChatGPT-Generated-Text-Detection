I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. It seems like a classic example as to why lawsuits exist - and they should be used only for people who have been wronged by someone else (and not just anyone!). But you know what? That isn't good enough! Because if we were all sued every time that something bad happened due simply because there is always blame somewhere...then no one would ever do anything at work again without first checking with their lawyer whether doing so might make them liable later on downthe line when those lawyers are looking over things several years after an event has occurred from which money could now potentially flow into everyone involveds' pockets....that doesn't sound right does-it?!
