I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately after they were attacked by their own supporters. So it's only because I read the article where she says she may have been taken advantage of for years before turning her back on them. It's not like she didn't deserve a degree or something, right? I don't know if Jenner got any "cheerings," but what did she do with them anyway? She had no real motivation to keep going down this path. It seems like Caitlin had a lot more reason to hate these people than just some weird f-eater who wanted to make money out of the scandals she had uncovered. Even if we all agree that it's never okay - even when you consider why it happened - the fact that Caitlin put herself at risk is a bit too much for me to handle. The '1620s that followed were pretty good times, but now what is happening in our country today? How bad have things gotten when it comes to women breaking into our homes to steal sex from women who are paid well enough to live off of the backs of other men? Much like how when the first black man was killed in Illinois, not one woman made it to the top of the state. There was still plenty of evidence pointing towards that, but it turned out that the same exact behavior was occurring everywhere else in America. Less than five years later, Facebook has been accused of sexual harassment against hundreds of girls and boys, which it denies being part of. The companies have also faced scrutiny over misinformation about disgusting images posted online. It really doesn't take long for us politicians to start putting the whole thing behind us. Last night I saw a video on CNN that shows an alleged rape victim being assaulted outside of a coffee shop a few weeks ago. There's another one at a Starbucks near my house, and while it looks like something very serious is going on, it actually sounds like someone is trying to get away with it. And as far as we can tell, it still wasn't something very serious, even though there were numerous photos posted on the internet showing the attacker getting his victim's blood poured onto him (which he reportedly did). There's always room for improvement here, folks. We should be doing better when it comes to criminal justice reform. But even since I started writing this piece, I've come across several stories popping up around the world that claim or suggest that a number of young girls were raped during high school. One story claims to show that a male classmate told students that there was a pool party held inside a bar called "The Ballroom," in which around 100 female players played together. According to the boy's father, the assault took place approximately two months earlier. Another story claims that a Nigerian student said that a couple of days prior, a teenage girl approached her and pulled out a knife. While both of those accounts seem plausible, it's hard to ignore the fact that such acts happen often throughout college campuses. None of these incidents occurred anywhere in America. If this seems like anyone in power isn't taking seriously that it might be time for us to stop blaming politics and instead focus on helping victims wherever possible, it makes me wonder if there will ever be a day when we won't see that story coming through.
