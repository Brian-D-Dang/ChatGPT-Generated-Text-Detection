So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern day conservatives believe in what I call 'The Conservative Code', and being a part of it myself - which includes not believing I should pay more tax than anyone else (which we all know is true), or that my hard earned money should go towards giving someone else a house they can't afford etc. I'm sorry if you get offended by anything i've said here as it's been with good intentions...but there are too many people jumping down each others throats over nothing these days!
