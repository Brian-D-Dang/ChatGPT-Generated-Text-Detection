Disclaimer: this talk of secession may not be present everywhere in the United States, but it is more than prevalent where I live, so I'm going off that. To me, secession means the opposite - both secessionists and people who are frustrated with their government's actions would like to see us come together as a country as soon as possible. But there's always a chance there could be worse possibilities, which is why it's very important for the commonwealth to make changes that will help you and your state stay competitive when all those potential tools are out there in the open."
