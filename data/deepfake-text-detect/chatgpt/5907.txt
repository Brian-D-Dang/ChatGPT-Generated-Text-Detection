Edit: I've been fairly convinced it's not sexist. Still maintain invasive as all heck. Carry on, thanks for getting passionate about it! Edit 2: 7 hours and only a few comments? I feel sad: (That is not a whole lot of people commenting. A lot of people would have been put off by the negative connotations in the title, but it's definitely an important discussion. Yeah, sorry for the "thread bomb" lol. I'm new to the site and didn't know what the proper etiquette was. I've seen too many threads get locked for seemingly no reason, so I'm a bit gun shy. Hi, I'm new to the forums so I'm not sure what the etiquette is either! I'm pretty sure we used to have threads locked for being too "political" but I guess that's been relaxed now? Anyway, great thread btw! Yeah, I've seen a lot of locked threads in the past for being too political or off-topic. Not a bad thing, but it is an etiquette thing. I was referring to "political" as in a discussion that is more about opinion than fact. I personally don't have a problem with people sharing their opinion on whether a game is sexist or not, but I do have a problem with people making claims that are clearly false. The most recent example I've seen is the last few pages of this thread, where people are saying that the titular character of Okami is not a sexualised character because "she's not wearing anything." This is factually incorrect. I've also seen people say that women in games are "sexualised" because "they are wearing make-up" and "have nice hair." This is also factually incorrect. I'm not trying to have a go at anyone in particular here. The fact is that many of the comments in this thread are actually examples of false claims and opinion. They are not facts. This is an interesting topic for discussion, and I'm glad that you posted this thread. I just think that it needs to be done respectfully, and factually. I think the problem here is that you're defining "sexualisation" as a bad thing, without actually clarifying what you think that means. I'm not sure what this thread is supposed to achieve? The way I understand it, the issue is that people have very different definitions of what "sexualised" means and that results in people being attacked for their opinions. For me, "sexualised" simply means that the charactercharacter design is meant to be attractive to the opposite sex. In my experience, people who don't want characters to be "sexualised" are usually uncomfortable with the idea of women being attractive to men. It's not necessarily a bad thing for a character to be attractive to the opposite sex. That's just how it is. For example, if I was a woman I would want to be attracted to men. The point I was trying to make in my previous post is that the issue is that the word "sexualised" has many different definitions. It's difficult to have a discussion about this without first defining what you think it means. The current definition of the word is that it's a negative thing. It's hard to have a discussion about whether or not a thing is a negative thing if we don't know what that thing is. I think the problem here is that you're defining "sexualised" as a bad thing, without actually clarifying what you think that means I do think it's a bad thing. And if you have a problem with that, please let me know why it's a bad thing. I'm not sure what this thread is supposed to achieve? To create a forum where people can discuss whether a game is sexist or not. The current definition of the word is that it's a negative thing. It's hard to have a discussion about whether or not a thing is a negative thing if we don't know what that thing is. I think that this thread has already achieved that, but I agree that it could be improved by some clarification of terms. For me, "sexualised" simply means that the charactercharacter design is meant to be attractive to the opposite sex. That's just how it is. When I use the term, I mean "made to be sexualised" or "made to look sexual." In my experience, people who don't want characters to be "sexualised" are usually uncomfortable with
