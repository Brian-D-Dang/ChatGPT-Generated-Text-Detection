They've been saying this since the 30s. Keynes predicted that as technology increased and our material needs would be met, we would only need to work 15 hours a week, but somehow our modern society has managed to accumulate all sorts of bullshit that suggests otherwise. That's what I was going for with my title. My point is not about how much you actually make as much as it was in the past, obviously that matters too, but rather why do people keep getting butthurt when they hear someone talk about how if "the goods are cheap enough" then there isn't any reason to stop working. The amount of time spent on your job is directly proportional to your pay though so unless your life is completely fucking miserable...
