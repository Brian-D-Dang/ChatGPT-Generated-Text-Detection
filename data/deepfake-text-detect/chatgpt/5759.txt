Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can help us. Tell me again why Batman isn't an amazing superhero. Batman only has so much time to rescue the people of Gotham City, but at least he has a camera drone. Batman has never killed anyone. In fact, he's been instrumental in saving countless lives by stopping a crime before it ever happens. Also, this is a great representation of the United States as a whole. Lana Del Rey is Batman's biggest fan, and it's awesome. I'm not saying that Batman shouldn't kill, but it would be nice if he could multitask. No one can defeat Batman, including his nemeses. Even the cops admire him. This is the definition of a win-win situation. Batman is a better dad than you. Normally, I'm all for Batman's no-killing policy, but I'm not above a little collateral damage. Batman understands the importance of teamwork. Batman is a better friend than you. No one is as cool as Batman. Batman's no-killing policy is like a really strict diet. He's the perfect balance of lethal and lovable. Batman is the most uncooperative superhero of all time. That's the only way to get to the bottom of this. Batman has always been a voice for the powerless. Batman's no-killing policy is one of the reasons he's so awesome. Batman is the perfect combination of smart and sweet. Batman is a better dad than me. Batman is a better friend than you. Batman is the perfect balance of lethal and lovable. Batman is the most uncooperative superhero of all time. Batman is the perfect combination of smart and sweet. Batman is a better friend than you.
