First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces the comment to be read by other redditors so that it can get counted as votes for your submission and not brigaded This way you dont have people upvoting their own posts just because they want karma It doesn't work like that on reddit though?
