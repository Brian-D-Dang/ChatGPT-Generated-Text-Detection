I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually of a higher socio-economic status, and they get all kinds of extra curricular activities which you don't see in public schooling (like drama). Indeed! It's an issue that society needs to address more deeply than just saying parents need to be better informed about education options for their children
