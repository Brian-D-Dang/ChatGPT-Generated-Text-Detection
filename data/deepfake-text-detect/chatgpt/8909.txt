Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved in the act of intercourse and their partner (the other person). This does not mean that consent is good enough. It only means it requires some effort. Some people might take a longer time before they are ready to give up on their sexual relationship than others. In this case, my wife asked me if it was ok to just accept her and keep our secret from him, then trust him until he came home with his decision. No matter how much he goes down on himself, it will never happen again. But my question is: How do you handle being made aware of your situation? I don't know about you but I am having trouble getting myself together to start talking to my parents and telling them what we want to talk about. They have no idea who I am or where I come from. They still haven't really let go of the fact that she has been living with us since 2012 so it is completely understandable why they would feel like they should tell me about all their problems... As you mentioned above, I feel as though I need to figure out what I want to say, even though I may not be able to at the moment. This is because I am starting to get overwhelmed by my feelings towards my partner. He hasn't shared with me any details about his problems - just that what I wanted to discuss was when I would get back into bed, putting the issue aside. I don't want to hurt him on any level anymore. For example, we both work full-time and having time off every week doesn't make sense for me now. In the meantime, I'm trying to avoid taking anything serious, and be more open with my sexuality. Talking openly to each other isn't going to help. My ex or my family remember my name and I'll always remember who I used to be. I guess I have to try harder to understand how we got here instead of just asking questions.
