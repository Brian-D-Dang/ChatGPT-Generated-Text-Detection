Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 4k songs, and given that a lot of them are discovered by their audience themselves through our playlists or recommendations. This article tries to show you some alternatives so you can get more out of your favourite streaming service. Maybe you'll come up with something better than what we use now. You never know until you try! Spotify Alternative: Grooveshark The very first time I tried GrooveShark was while listening to Daft Punk on Pandora. The reason why I used it instead of other discovery services at that point in time (Flixster) was because they had tracks from artists such as Daft Punk. Spotify doesn't let you search inside an artist's catalogue even if you're signed into their account, only within one particular playlist. Flixster and LastFm were not really interesting either due to lack of support, since back then Last FM wasn't cool yet. It took us about 5 years before we finally gave up trying to discover new stuff using these apps and went straight to YouTube or listened on SoundCloud. But those days are over! Nowadays all three of them offer plenty of groovy features. Apart from being able to browse and listen to tunes generated based on your moods and interests, we also got the ability to add videos in order to explain how each song sounds or give you info regarding it. And last but certainly not least, Internet connection required is no longer a problem anymore thanks to Shoutcast Radio, which lets you stream internet radios directly from any browser without needing external media players installed. Grooveshark has been recommended several times here, and rightfully so. Aside from having clean design guidelines and keeping things simple, it offers decent amount of customization options, especially when compared to its competitors, and it boasts almost infinite offline storage available for free users. Finally, it comes pre-installed on most Android phones nowadays, making it much easier to access online radio stations right away. To take advantage of this awesome app, make sure you do have both an active subscription and an API key with you. Alternative 2: MOG Music Player MOG is another great recommendation coming from eMusic.com - "the leading independent digital entertainment destination." Basically, it's just MojoRadio for Android plus ID3 tags support, mixed in with socialising capabilities and user ratings system similar to Apple's iTunes Connect. Don't worry though; unlike iTunes Connect, where everyone gets equal chance to be featured in movies brochurescover art etc., our version really gives preference to top rated uploaders first. So feel free to submit yours! With enough imagination, however, we don't see that happening too often. Having said that, you will still get credit for every track ever posted. It might seem unfair sometimes, yes. Oh well, tough luck! Basically, it works the same way as Google Play Store does. When you start downloading a file, MOG shows an option allowing you to rate it. Once rating takes place, it immediately appears in "Top Rated" section alongside others' creations. Since MOG's server compares our data against existing files and ranks them accordingly, keep uploading and tagging your own work. There's always someone checking these rankings anyway, so nobody's going to steal anything from anyone else. If you want to expand your library further, you could consider giving MusicalBrainz a go. This website indexes CDDB database after you log in, thus providing an unlimited source of soundtracks. While the information provided may vary slightly between countries and languages, it should suffice whatever country you live in. However, since quality control varies greatly across different sites (Google vs. LastFM, Amazon vs. Youtube), this might depend upon the level of interest you put towards it. For example, I heard many Japanese complain how rarely CDs end up appearing in their region despite Japan being considered relatively popular overall. If you're looking forward to deep catalogues, the highly familiarized taste segmentation feature would help filter down results based upon genre, artist and album release date, among others, according to your liking. As long as you're willing to dig around in HTML code and figure out how to manipulate it properly, there's absolutely zero limit to what you'd be able to achieve. In fact, there are already unofficial libraries containing thousands of albums that are simply stored under.zip archives as plain text files on web servers. To get started, you'll need PHP and MySQL running along with modrewrite apache module enabled in Apache settings. In case you wanted to change metadata manually rather than relying solely on automatic retrieval, basic knowledge of XML document structure would be needed. Of course, mastering music theory might prove essential for advanced users, otherwise learning how to handle databases becomes quite tedious due to limited water resources common to ask for future record-they show no snowballs are invited to leave necessary to spend half a tonnal balance
