I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with that opinion, they shouldn't be forced to shut up just because I think forks are swell and the community should accept them as such." Yeah but it is also true that some opinions can cause harm to people. So while we may think that telling everyone not to kill might be wrong, perhaps there would come a time when this belief caused more damage than benefit for the group of us who believed in freedom from murder.
