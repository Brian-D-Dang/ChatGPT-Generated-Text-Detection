While it is true that the argument for legalizing gay marriage has been based on principles of equality and freedom of choice, the same cannot be said for incestuous marriage. Incestuous relationships are typically characterized by a power dynamic between family members, such as parent and child or sibling relationships, which can lead to emotional and psychological harm. There are also concerns regarding potential genetic abnormalities in children born from incestuous relationships. These factors present unique legal and moral considerations that are not present in same-sex marriages. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that the arguments against incestuous marriage have been thrown away in pursuit of gay marriage.
