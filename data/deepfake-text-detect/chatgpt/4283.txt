First of all, I want to first express how happy I am with this subreddit. It has always been a hub for civilized discussion on complicated and difficult topics. I can't think of anything else that would be more appropriate than to spread the word about rscience and its awesome people! So yeah, thanks for being so good at this! I appreciate your positive feedback and support, as well as everyone's efforts in making it the best science-related sub reddit out there.
