There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man who walks up to you with his penis hanging out?). Forcing women into wearing something they are against does not make them any safer or more free than if the woman had full control over what she is wearing. If anything, forcing her into it increases the likelihood that she will wear less clothing just to spite those trying to stop people from seeing their bodies. A good example would be how some men dress when they think no one can see them: jeans so tight their balls hang out, boxers with holes cut all the way through for maximum exposure, etc.. These things don't help women's safety very much at all; quite the opposite. And yet we're told we must do this. The only thing worse I've seen was on 911 when everyone started taking off their clothes as soon as planes hit buildings. If there were consenting adults involved then hey go ahead but please respect other peoples' boundaries! It doesn't matter why they want us covered up anyway. They'll always find something. Just like New York City has recently made it illegal for men to sit down next to women unless its on public transportation because they feel uncomfortable by having "their" seat taken away from them. Sexually repressed societies need an excuse to persecute harmless behaviour. I agree. People have been doing many lewd acts throughout history anywhere where someone could witness them. Men exposing themselves, nudity being displayed during religious services. Not even close to covering up half of our bodies deters these occurrences. Some cultures may view it differently, but regardless of gender, individuals should have bodily autonomy over their own body-freezing prison attire or otherwise. Nobody knows exactly what happened between Turpin and Hernandez before he said 'Yes'. We know it wasn't rape though since Turpin didn't force him onto the bed. Why? Because Hernandez was aware enough to say No when Turpin put his hand behind hime back, Walked forward, sat down and took off his pants. Even when Hernandez kept saying NO after Turpin put his hands under his shirt, Turpin did NOT forcefully place his hand inside Hernandez' vest, which again points towards consensual sex. This is also backed my the fact that neither party went to the police afterwards either claiming sexual assault or harassment. So whether we believe that Turpin was guilty of molesting Hernandez while keeping his arm around him using deadly force as the victim claims, or whether we believe Turpin was innocent and humiliated without cause due to media hype, it appears unlikely both parties came to court together agreeing that Turpin touched Hernandez inappropriately. Either way the Judge and jury saw enough evidence to decide unanimously that Turpin acted legally within Georgia law during his arrest and trial despite the facts stated above.
