To get this out of the way early: This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk. An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation. I'm sure there are some folks here who will have issues with various parts or all aspects that make up my argument (as well as those making similar arguments elsewhere), but if you don't like it and think its wrongheaded at least try presenting an alternative view preferably one backed by reasons rather than personal opinion only! I am NOT saying "PC Games suck," merely stating facts about why they do so in comparison against their console counterparts - It's interesting how many people seem reluctant even just hearing me state such things without getting defensive straight away...
