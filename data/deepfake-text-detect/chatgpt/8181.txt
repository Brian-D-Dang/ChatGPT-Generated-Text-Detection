Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of having unvaccinated children around me it's starting to get pretty common in Australia (I see a lot more people like them). My wife is also very into natural living - we don't use pesticides or chemical fertilisers on our property at all because that's not allowed here for environmental reasons - she wants usour future kid (ren) too live better than they did before coming along! We're both happy with being together regardless if either one has had vaccines but no longer do so ourselves as adults; once again another reason why global vaccination rates aren't high enough a" there could be some serious consequences from lowered immunity levels across society due poor vaccine uptake by young mums who then go onto spread illness through birth touch contact etc...
