I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several dogs and they all know how to sit, shake hands (and paws), come when called with their names in English (not German!), stay on the ground while everyone around is standing up - they can go through doors, etc., but there's no way I could trust one of those big ones to not jump into bed off counters late at night as soon as its dark enough! It has nothing do w being aggressive; it results from a lack of socialization. That said, if you want to play rough with your puppy, keep him away from anyone who matters unless he comes back exuberantly and follows directions very well... Most puppies don't need that much correction early on anyway due to their natural fear response getting suppressed by their parents' training efforts. They may still show signs even now, though usually only "barking" instead of growling like adult wolves. You will just lose some sleep over it until eventually someone catches on and trains her accordingly...
