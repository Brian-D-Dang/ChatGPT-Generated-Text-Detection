I'm Korean-American and I have family in Korea. I disagree with many of those I encounter who usually tend to also be of Korean descent when I don't get all the criticism that may come from not looking Asian at times or being mistaken for Japanese, Chinese etc... This is a good point - although it's still complicated since there are multiple ways "Asian" can apply (Korean people could view themselves as East Asians but then look more Caucasian while NorthSouth Koreans might identify more closely).
