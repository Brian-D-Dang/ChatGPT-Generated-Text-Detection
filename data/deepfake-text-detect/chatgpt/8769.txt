I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for a violent crime, they need to be able to put it behind them from then on out. I think that's an interesting idea and I hope we can bring some justice to this problem here in Texas. ALSO READ: Technology Is Making It More Violent In Texas - But What Are The Benefits?
