First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are scarce - with the exception of fishseafood, there has been no shortage of oil or water over the past million years (not to mention other forms of food). I'm just going out on a limb here... If humanity really does go extinct this century nothing will survive for millions of years anyways since many fossil fuels are depleted and much of what remains is poisoned by carbon dioxide gas from passing vehicles and coal-fired power plants resulting in global warming (and acidification) which could destroy our oceans if it continues unabated. Some say things get better after extinction because new variations evolve but then again there's always some variation around as humans discovered. So my question is: What do you all think about "letting" pandas live? Do you feel bad watching them suffer or would you be fine making an example of one that was causing harm? Would you even notice considering the human race had already gone extinct?!
