I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer get shot? How could this be prevented from happening again to another one of them? If you don't know what's going on in that situation it can look like an ambush when there is no threat present
