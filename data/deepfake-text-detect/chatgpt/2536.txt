This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in our universe, then you are close-minded to what might be out there. Many people do see it that way and certainly for some who have never left planet Earth this can seem a very sensible position. But how likely would such an attitude actually be? What about those with whom we constantly come into contact - fellow human beings from all over the world whose lives seem so different from ours; those who live on other planets? We know they exist because we've seen them! They couldn't possibly be the result of evolution as Darwin thought but must surely require intelligent design; therefore God has created them too. Why else would He create so many worlds like ours when He could only have made one exactly suited to His own requirements? The answer seems self-evident doesn't it? Because unlike us Aliens have souls! This belief does not sit well with scientists however. Many famous astronomers including Fred Hoyle (who predicted the existence of Black Holes) argue passionately against this idea. In his book 'There Are No Martians' he writes compellingly against the concept that extra terrestrial life forms may have their origins here on earth. On page 102 he states "What sort of evidence should compel me to change my mind?" Well let's look at some possible points of objection. First and foremost any creationist argument needs something for which it is directly observable. This means it cannot simply consist of hearsay or vague statements based on gut feelings or personal beliefs. We need hard facts backed up by proper scientific investigation. Here is where science comes into its own. One obvious problem facing anyone claiming extraterrestrial intelligent life will turn out to be if said species contains DNA (as ours does). Even though today we're able to synthesise lots of new versions of chemicals using advanced biotechnology, the reality is these are still just molecules composed of four basic elements; carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. These are fundamental building blocks of life as we know it; so why haven't any of our efforts produced anything more complex than single celled organisms?! Scientists claim that no matter the conditions of the Universe - maybe even extreme temperatures - forming RNADNA type structures requires far too much energy without having previously formed these things somewhere first. So either Intelligent Design isn't true before the appearance of Man according to most Religious thinkers, or we won't ever find it anywhere in space except right here on Earth! You'd probably agree that's pretty unlikely wouldn't you? If that was indeed true then any alien race found visiting us would almost inevitably be humanoid in nature and if they were vastly superior to humans technologically then chances are they'll be non-humanoid. Therefore we aren't looking for an example of every form of intelligent life out there! Nor is the origin of this kind of being important anyway since once we discover self replicating entities like cells with organised functions we expect them everywhere and thus are bound to evolve naturally through natural selection towards intelligence anyway. Maybe the same goes for any other sentient lifeform throughout the Universe causing Atheists completely dismiss claims regarding Extra-terrestrials or extra dimensional intelligences. After all intelligent designers are also often associated with Gods and are therefore unnecessary concepts altogether. So perhaps Creationism isn't logical after all since we're looking for evidence to support theories rather than disprove others. Perhaps the Creator isn't necessarily malevolent or extremely powerful. He may actually be quite humble. And as we've established above, there are obstacles preventing us from finding evidence to prove or disprove various possibilities surrounding Aliens. However recent research conducted by SETI (Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team suggests the possibility of another kind of Alien. Researchers proposed that due to the sheer size of the Universe and the fact that current estimates suggest there should be around 100 billion galaxies each containing billions upon billions of stars, there are potentially hundreds of millions of solar systems within our Galaxy alone. The vast majority of these are uninhabited and undiscovered leaving enormous numbers of potential homes for Proteus aurorae-like creatures. If so then it becomes reasonable to suppose that they hold great interest to any aliens who might visit us. To quote a NASA scientist speaking about the subject recently "The interesting thing now is...not to speculate about who [aliens] might be, but instead to consider the kinds of places they might want to go." That sounds oddly familiar doesn't it?
