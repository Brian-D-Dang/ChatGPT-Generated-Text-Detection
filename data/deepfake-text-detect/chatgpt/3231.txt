After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific sense. While many people might feel like they are making their own choices and decisions, all of their actions are actually just a result of neurons firing in their brains. This means that everything that they do and everything they've ever done was really just predetermined by the laws of physics. It is difficult for some people to accept this idea of absolute determinism because it challenges their sense of individuality and autonomy. But it is important to keep in mind that deterministic ideas do not necessarily mean that people cannot live fulfilling and meaningful lives. People can still strive to make the most of their lives and to make positive changes in the world, even if their actions were predetermined. Ultimately, whether or not free will exists is still a matter of philosophical debate, but it is important to recognize that many scientists and philosophers do not see it as a valid scientific concept.
