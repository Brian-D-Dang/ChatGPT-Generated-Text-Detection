While it is true that our society perpetuates the ideas of gender and heteronormativity, it is not fair to claim that the idea of being transgender perpetuates this framework. In fact, the concept of being transgender challenges and breaks down societal norms and beliefs about gender. Additionally, the statement that less people would identify as transgender if we did not have gender restrictions is problematic because it assumes that transgender identity is a choice or a result of societal pressure, rather than an inherent aspect of one's identity. It is important to acknowledge and respect each individual's right to self-identify and to focus on creating a society that accepts and embraces diversity in all its forms, including gender identity.
