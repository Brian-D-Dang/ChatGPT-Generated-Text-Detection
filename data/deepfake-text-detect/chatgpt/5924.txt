The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as a suit) or a tattoo which can be concealed by clothing. However, I think it is perfectly reasonable to prevent tattoos which would be visible in formal clothing (a suit). I also think it is perfectly reasonable to allow a tattoo which can be concealed by clothing. In my opinion, both of these policies are consistent with a pluralistic workplace and I would be surprised if the Supreme Court would rule otherwise. As for the second part of your question, I think the best answer lies in your next sentence: "It seems to me that the best solution would be to prohibit visible tattoos for employees but permit concealable tattoos." I have no idea why this is not in the company's policy already. My company policy is 1.5 inches on the forearm and below, but we are not allowed to have tattoos on our face, neck or hands. I am assuming this policy is ok, but I am getting older and I want a tattoo to cover the one I currently have. It is on my right hand and I would like to have something on my left hand. I am not opposed to getting something on my right hand, but I am concerned that since my company policy does not allow for this, they will be upset with me. I also want to make sure that I would not be in violation of the company policy before I spend the money on the tattoo. I think your company policy is perfectly reasonable. If your company has a policy which prohibits tattoos on the face, neck or hands and you want to get a tattoo on the back of your hand, I would not expect any problems as long as the tattoo meets the 1.5 inches on the forearm and below requirement. The only thing that might be a problem is if you are an artist and this tattoo is in a location where other artists would see it. I am not sure what the typical reaction would be to that, but I would not be surprised if some people in your profession would criticize you for having a visible tattoo. If I were you, I would try to conceal the tattoo in clothing or cover it with a bandage if it is not visible. I think you have a lot of company when it comes to having a "mom" or "dad" tattoo. I have seen many people who have their mom or dad's name tattooed somewhere on their body, including a tattoo on the forearm. There are many reasons why people get "mom" and "dad" tattoos. The most common reason is that their mom or dad passed away and they want to commemorate that person forever. A less common reason is that they want to commemorate their mom or dad in a different way than just having a tattoo. For example, one of my brothers has a tattoo of his grandfather's military rank on his arm, which represents his grandfather's service to our country. Some people like to get "mom" and "dad" tattoos because they want a way to express their love for their mom and dad. A small number of people get "mom" and "dad" tattoos because they are trying to honor their mom or dad in a unique way. As an example, I have a friend who has "mom" tattooed on the back of his neck because he wanted his mom to always be with him and he wanted to represent that in a permanent way. I think your tattoo is fine, but you will have a much better chance of getting a job with a smaller company if you have a smaller tattoo or no tattoo at all. I think it would be fine to have a small tattoo on the forearm. However, if you are hoping to get a job as a chef in a high-end restaurant, you might want to consider removing the tattoo or keeping it on a less visible part of your body (like your shoulder, back or foot). I think that tattoos are a great way to show your individuality and I think that they are a great way to express yourself. However, I also think that a lot of employers may have a negative perception of tattoos because some people get tattoos for the wrong reasons. I also think that a lot of people may be more likely to get a tattoo if they are not working. Once you have a job, you may have less free time to get a
