Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 500 songs on their computer. I think it's great if you are just starting out or don't have a big music library, but for those who already have music, it may be cost prohibitive to switch over to Spotify. There are other streaming services like Apple Music and Google Play that offer similar features, so it may be worth looking into them as well.
