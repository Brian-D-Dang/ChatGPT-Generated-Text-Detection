You can spell X, but not Y. 3. Everyone knows what X is. Nobody knows what Y is. 4. X is a real thing. Y is not. 5. X is a real thing. Y is not. 6. X does not have an evil twin, but Y does. 7. X is in a great song by Stereophonics. This is a very good argument, in fact the best. katew: Except it's not a good argument. Yes, the use of 'clearly' is a giveaway. It's not.
