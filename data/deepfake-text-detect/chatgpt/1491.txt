First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" does. But to be clear: feminism isn't an ideology, or a philosophy (unless you count radical environmentalist - esque philosophies as such). It's just one particular lens through which we see society and women in particular. I think there are many feminists out there who do not subscribe to all aspects of egalitarianism but they are fighting for EQUALITY! And yes, I realize my original post was rather lengthy on this topic... here goes again: First, let me say things like, "please stop calling me 'Your Honor,' it sounds so formal," etc., because, obviously, I am not a judge... then, at the end, thank YOU (or anyone else) for reading and sharing your thoughts with me about these issues. Thank you, ladies, for having us around and giving us hope for our future; please keep up the good work. This really boils down to two main themes over and above everything else I learned while doing research for this piece: 1.) Have fun being activists. There were times when I didn't want to go, several days weeks even months went by where I did NOT WANT TO GO, yet somehow found myself dragging feet behind me into the next group meeting. And more often than not, once those meetings ended, I felt renewed energy and motivation to actually get something done NOW, since most likely, no matter how much I knew beforehand about any specific issue, new information would certainly come along later on during whatever event I had decided to attend.... 2.) Learn from other activists' mistakes. After learning some important lessons after attending too many activist events in 2006 2007, especially regarding dealing with public perception via interviews and press coverage, I realized that I needed to give others plenty of time before bringing up certain topics publicly, and also learn to take care of the aftermath if someone else brought them up first. For example, speaking up against sexism can sometimes make men furious oh well. Take it under consideration and deal with it appropriately later instead of letting it sink its claws into you right away, regardless of whether or not you may consider yourself sexist yourself. On another note, making sure to respond respectfully to the media definitely helped me gain credibility among the feminist Posted by Okay, okay, maybe I'm getting carried away in thinking that I've heard every song band ever recorded, but I swear I remember watching TV shows or movies where an old person looked uncomfortable playing Rock Band games on their Xbox 360s. No, seriously whenever I saw elderly friends showing off their latest portable purchase, I got reminded of that same feeling I used to feel awhile back when seeing older folks play video games online, and couldn't believe that younger generations wouldn't be able to pick up on simple controls commands instantly without saying anything. Well, guess what? That feeling has gone away completely now thanks to the power of technology. With the advent of Microsoft Kinect, virtually everyone should be able to use his or her hands fairly easily to control various items within the game console itself including picking up controllers instruments and leaning forward backward using the controller. Although it might seem strange to young gamers to hold the controller in the left hand and lean slightly backwards toward a virtual instrument, eventually, I imagine, you will master the skill quickly enough that you won't need to push buttons so hard anymore, either! If you're interested, check out Microsoft's website to find out additional details about Kinect: http: www. microsoft. com kinect AboutKineticIn addition, it appears that Windows 8 (a forthcoming operating system!) includes some built - in software designed specifically for spatial awareness tasks, although I haven't seen evidence of this anywhere at present. In short, gaming consoles made today are almost impossible to confuse with ones from prior decades due to advanced tunable cameras installed inside of each one, allowing both the user interface and content displayed within the screen to change dynamically according to your movements. You won't look like a fool holding that guitar upside down anymore!! It occurred to me recently that perhaps I shouldn't talk negatively about video games since most of the world plays them nowadays anyway.. only problem: Most of those games aren't exactly healthy visually, physically, mentally and emotionally. While it seems logical to assume that exercising and eating better food leads to healthier babies, as opposed to fattening children because parents buy extremely unhealthy foods, why do parents continue buying ultra - processed junk food??? Why do kids play violent games?? Is the World Series of Poker considered bad for the developing mind?! I suppose the answer lies somewhere between addiction and education, but still, it's nice to hear parents talking openly about things like violence and confusion surrounding sex I wonder if there could be more parent conversations like that happening overall?
