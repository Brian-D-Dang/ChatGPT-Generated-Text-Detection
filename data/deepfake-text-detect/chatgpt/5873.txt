Hello everyone, with all the media coverage lately regrading transgender individuals I find myself uneducated on the particular subject and would love to be enlightened on the topic. I support gender equality, and I do not support discrimination of any kind. I am asking for someone to educate me in an intelligent manner. This is not a rant or a debate, I want to know more and learn from someone who knows what they are talking about, not someone who has an opinion on the topic. I am curious, not hostile. I am open to any information on this topic you would like to share, and I am hoping this thread can be used to get everyone's input. I also want to know if this should be a separate thread or if it is covered on another thread. You're opening up a can of worms here. This thread should be split and a new thread started. I'll give you some basic info. If you want to see what a transgender person looks like, go here. A person's gender is not just the clothes they wear or the fact that they have a penis or vagina. Transgender people are biologically men or women but the gender they identify as is not what they were born as. Society has this idea that a man should have a penis and a vagina and a woman should have a vagina and a uterus but this is not always the case. They are not the same thing. A transgender person is not just a crossdresser. There is no such thing as "normal" or "right" for that matter. There is only normal for that person. I hope that helps. I'll do some more research and write a more detailed post about it later. I don't have an issue with transgender people, I just don't have a lot of knowledge about them. I am trying to learn more about it as I have never been around a transgender person in my life, but I know a few people who are. Honestly I think the only way to get over any issue is to try to put yourself in the other person's shoes and try to understand the situation from their perspective. I think that is the best way to learn about a subject that is not your own. You are asking for a lot of information in a short space of time. I personally would want to go to a site that specializes in this type of information. I'm sure there are some well written articles, as well as videos on the web. I don't have a lot of knowledge about this either. I have one transgender friend. I'm not going to pretend to know everything about the subject, but I'm more than happy to share the information I have. The fact is, I don't know much about it. I think it would be a great idea to get some resources on the subject, and you would be more than welcome to do so. I don't have anything to add to it. I do agree that people should be educated on the topic though. It's not something that you should be ignorant about. It's a personal issue, and I think people shouldn't have a problem with it unless they are being discriminated against. I don't think it's a mental disorder. Transgender people are living a very difficult life, and they are suffering because of ignorance. I can't imagine how hard it must be to be a transgender person. I'm not a man, and I can't understand how it must feel to be a man. I am just not built that way. I can't imagine how hard it must be to be a woman either. I don't have a lot of knowledge about it. I think it would be a great idea to get some resources on the subject, and you would be more than welcome to do so. I don't have anything to add to it.

Transgender people are living a very difficult life, and they are suffering because of ignorance. I think this is a great question and a great starting point to being educated. I have a friend that I have been close with for a long time now. She has always been a big supporter of mine. She has also come out to me as a transgender woman. She has been very open and honest about her struggles with her transition
