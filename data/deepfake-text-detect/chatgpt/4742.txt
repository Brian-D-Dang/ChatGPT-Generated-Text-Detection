Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. If the world wasn't so busy fighting each other over who has a bigger penis and how to blow up the planet than looking out for asteroids we would never even notice them... The only thing you can do if an asteroid hits earth is move So my question is what does humanity accomplish by trying to stop these damn things from hitting us? If it's not too much trouble could someone explain this to me please.... I'm having a hard time finding info on google related to this topic but maybe there is some great information out there somewhere......
