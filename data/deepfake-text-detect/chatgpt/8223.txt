Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as the world only grows increasingly connected by modern means in tradetechnology etc., a nation's culture is made into an international commodity - that can be traded for money or power if needbe... A 'democratic' government would do best using its laws time-tested customs so not erode any national identity; however we are left without such options due too many subversive elements doing their job pretty well these days: rewriting history books through education systems while promoting multiculturalism which has now become mainstreamed at school level along side required nationalism courses where kids learn about how great Hungary was just 30 years ago... blah....blah..... There must have been some kind order placed on earth when things started going wrong from day 1 since our current era lacks wisdom anymore: (It makes me sick reading comments like "love thy neighbor" instead oiks who seemingly want everyone equal except themselves lol:D Anyway thanks again adekaiosophical universe!! Love you guys;)
