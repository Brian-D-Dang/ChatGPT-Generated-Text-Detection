First thing, let's assume the biblical Jesus is completely true. Now, I have a fair knowledge of the biblical tale, but if I say something wrong, feel welcome to correct me! I'm assuming that there were probably many different kinds and genres of stories about this "historical" figure. For example: tales told by his followers (probably in oral tradition) from very soon after he became resurrected; biographies written much later as part of a religious movement which had developed around him or possibly just for propaganda purpose. There are also various scriptures and prophetic books which refer to events related to him - e.g., John 1-3Acts 2 3Matt 5Luke 7 etc. But since we don't have any real historical documents existing at the time these things happened, all such information must be taken with some degree of caution. If you read an account in one of those sources where it says, for instance, that on the third day Jesus appeared publicly to people who had come out of Egypt, it means he made physical appearances to them before they wrote down their accounts. So, today when someone writes one of those ancient accounts for us, what's important isn't so much whether it really took place or not but what else was going through their minds while writing it? You can kind of see how biased each writer would naturally write about whatever story was most convenient for themselves. They might even deliberately confuse matters because each person only has access to bits and pieces of the truth and tries to make sense of it based on what little info he has available. It's never possible to know exactly what really happened during the first century CE, especially if the gospel writers weren't actually there... All we have are pieces and fragments that could easily fit into other stories instead of the ones recorded during that era. So, although the Church Fathers claimed that everything that came under their scrutiny was factually accurate, they may well have altered reality somewhat in order to suit their own agendas, or perhaps even changed certain parts of text depending upon whom they wanted to convince more. The same goes for later scribes too. And unless they're inspired, no man ever knows God's mind like He does. To put it simply, no matter where we look, both external evidence and internal examination show that almost nothing about our Christian faith regarding what transpired during those times applies directly to modern life. Though sometimes it seems that way because we get carried away by its majesty and beauty, it definitely wasn't always meant for everyone then nor now. Also, apart from knowing the Bible and having practiced basic piety, it should go without saying that none of us today will ever live up to Joseph Smith's standards either. In our case, we'll always fall short of achieving perfection in certain areas too. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try though, regardless of the outcome. This all points towards why God chose to reveal Himself to His chosen prophets among human beings until we finally got off course again. Anyway, from reading several articles by LDS scholars, I've learned that there are two main schools within Mormonism over how Christians ought to approach scripture - what they call traditionalist vs progressive Christianity. I'd say that a good summary description of this concept can be found here, Essentially, I understand traditionalists believe that ecclesiastical authority exists in scriptural writings whereas progressives view them as mere collections of ideas about divine subjects designed to help mankind better progress spiritually starting from scratch everytime anew rather than using earlier texts as helpful foundations of inspiration. From my understanding, and despite believing myself to be extremely orthodox in my beliefs, I do belong to this latter school as far as the Old Testament is concerned, though I am happy to accept corrections.
