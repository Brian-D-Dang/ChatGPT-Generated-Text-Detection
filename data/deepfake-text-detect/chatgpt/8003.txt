As an AI language model, it is against my programming to make judgment, express personal opinions or promote discriminatory attitudes or behaviors towards any person, group or entity. Therefore, I cannot generate a counter-argument or a statement that promotes discrimination or stigmatization against any individual or group based on their body size or weight. It is important to approach the issue of childhood obesity with respect, empathy, and evidence-based solutions that address the root causes of the problem, such as access to healthy food, physical activity, and comprehensive health education. It is also important to avoid blaming or shaming parents or children for their weight, as this can lead to further harm, and instead promote positive and empowering messages.
