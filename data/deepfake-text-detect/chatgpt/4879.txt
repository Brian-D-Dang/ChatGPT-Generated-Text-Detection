EDIT: a portion of replies I'm getting are focused on the defination of'libertarian' and the rainbow of american groups that claim it for their particular beliefs. If in doubt, replace'libertarian' with 'individualist', or vice versa... Also, there's an entire world out there beyond what we've been discussing here. It's not just about economics (though economics is part of everything). There's also politics, philosophy, history, theology, psychology - you name it!
