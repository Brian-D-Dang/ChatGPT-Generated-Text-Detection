This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is that the slope is not slippery; the slope is there and is inevitable. A slippery slope argument is an argument that is valid only if a premise is true. Slippery slope arguments are invalid when that premise is false. So if a slippery slope argument is invalid in one case, then it is also invalid in all cases. If you are Y, then you are X. Y is a common occurrence. Therefore, X is a common occurrence. Premise 1 is true, but premise 2 is false. Therefore, the argument is invalid. Because the argument is invalid, we can not use it to draw any conclusions about X. Premise 1 is false, but premise 2 is true. Therefore, the argument is valid. Therefore, we can use the argument to draw conclusions about X. The reason we can use the argument to draw conclusions about X is because we are assuming that the slippery slope is inevitable. If the slope is not inevitable, then the slippery slope argument is invalid. That means that the argument is valid. Therefore, we can draw conclusions about X from the argument. That means that the argument is invalid. If the slippery slope is not inevitable, then there is no basis to draw any conclusions about X.
