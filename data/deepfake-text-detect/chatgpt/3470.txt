Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to Space debris, also known as space junk, is actually a real issue that poses risks to both manned and unmanned spacecraft. There are thousands of objects floating in space, including leftover rocket stages, broken satellites, and other objects, that can collide with operational satellites and spacecraft. These collisions can cause significant damage or even result in the loss of lives. Additionally, space debris is a barrier to future space exploration and scientific research. Space agencies and governments around the world are working to develop solutions to mitigate the effects of space debris, such as cleaning up current debris and creating guidelines for responsible space operations to prevent future debris from being created. It might not be an issue that affects people every day, but it is a real problem that requires attention and action to ensure safe and sustainable space activity.
