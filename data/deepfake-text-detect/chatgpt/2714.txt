Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 15,000 songs on their phone or laptop from iTunes purchases alone. Even if you buy all your stuff (which i dont) its still cheaper than getting everything through Spotify Spotify isn't more expensive once you factor in the cost of a mobile device that can play those tracks anywhere you want as well.
