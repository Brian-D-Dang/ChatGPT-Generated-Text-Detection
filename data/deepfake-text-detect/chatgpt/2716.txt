I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before the Wright brothers and after General Motors bought out their company. But being 'a scientist' meant much less in the early 1900s than it does today... when journalists are asking to speak with scientists on behalf of major corporations. Science was not even an academic discipline until the 20th century (and then it took hundreds of years of effort). This may be why we don't see many pre-1900s scientists referenced as "celebrities" or considered important people who should have quotes published about them. I'm sure there were some notable scientist celebrities from that time period, but they did not leave enough evidence behind that historians could reference and enshrine in books like they do now.
