This boggles my mind. I know that some airlines are different like Southwest because they do not have assigned seats. But why don't people relax until their seating zonegroup is called out? People want to be in a specific place or window seat and if you're taking your time getting bags, etc., it will piss off someone behind who wants the sure thing of an open aisle onto which he can stow his carryons for take-offlanding.
