I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was shocked to discover that Benedict Cumberbatch had been nominated for an Oscar in the Best Actor category! There were numerous other nominations all over the place with some of them going to people who should not have won (i.e., Eddie Redmayne) or even gone home empty handed without any further awards such as Daniel Day-Lewis or Leonardo DiCaprio. It is interesting how much money these movies make but what they will mean in terms of being able to vote. Did anyone else notice this? If so, let me know because I really want someone to say "yes" on my behalf when next we go to the voting booth.
