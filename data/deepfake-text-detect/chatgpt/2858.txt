1. Military industry keeps some of the very few manufacturing jobs in US, this industry's survival critically depends on US's defence policies and government orders, without US spending sizeable chunk at military industrial complex's factories, there wouldn't be any job for anyone except top management. 2. Military industry is highly subsidized with billions of dollars, these subsidies keep their costs down to minimum level which means that they could sell their products cheaper than foreign competitors - this benefit is primarily directed against RussiaChina as well as other poor countries - it also guarantees them competitive prices both domestically and internationally. With such cheap pricing scheme they would be able to outcompete all possible international rivals even if they are better quality or more advanced technically. It goes like: "I'm not putting my money into your pocket but rather into those industries that produce weapons" (e.g.: Boeing vs Airbus). 3. The salesexport market share is a major measure when talking about how strong an American company is considered by financial analysts. Most deals depend directly or indirectly on Pentagon purchasing contracts whereas most other governments aren't buying much from America and no one else can afford it anyway so all companies' shares drop significantly every time news comes up of another arms deal involving USA. As can be seen here: Lockheed Martin has just signed contract worth 35 billion with Saudi Arabia... URL0. So all stocks in aerospace sector dropped yesterday after news came up that SA ordered 70 F-15EX fighters; the reason was obvious enough for everyone: less business bad results! In case you want to make sure what I mean: look at last year's data: Lockheed Martin had revenue of almost 48 Bn while GE Aviation only made around 10Bn in 2017 URL1 4. Last point: US imports tons of civilian goods from China because Chinese products have lower production cost despite being produced under worse labour conditions due to lack of regulations - now imagine if these imported parts were used to build nuclear reactors, aircraft carriers etc., then you might understand why we should care about type of influence our country wields over others. We import gazillions of things that will soon become part of heavy machinery required for making certain weapons systems in order to satisfy the needs of the Pentagon and thus our allies who are cozying up to Washington regardless of the fact whether it serves their best interests. When we buy something from someone else we're actually helping them achieve their goals whatever they may be initially.
