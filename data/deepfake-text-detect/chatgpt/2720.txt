After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read an exorbitant amount of both kinds of books in my life but for some reason it's really easy to sit down with a book about how to make your husband happy or health tips from a celebrity over spending actual time doing something. I agree! There are so many people who say they just don't have time to do things like exercise. But there's also plenty of free online info available on exercise if you're interested - this applies to most other activities (cooking lessonsrecipes etc).
