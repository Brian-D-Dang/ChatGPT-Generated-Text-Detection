This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special status because they have no legal recourse and therefore it's easier for them to get away with things (i.e., a certain level of 'dealing in minors. However-considering the fact that these kids do eventually grow up and become adults; we should start treating our younger generation as responsible citizens who will one day be considered under the law of the land (and so on...), rather than handing out "special treatment" due to their age. I agree with some points stated above - being let off the hook too easily, as juveniles don't always know right from wrong. However, when dealing with full grown adult criminalsmurderers etc (adult murderers) there seems to me a need for removing all doubt (whether or not they knew right from wrong at time of offence) where possible. For instance: An 18 year old boy goes into his workplace and shoots dead two colleagues, killing 3 others before he shot himself through the head. Would this gunman fall within the categories of "he didn't know what he was doing was illegal? If you look at the circumstances, would anyone really argue he did NOT know what he was doing was wrong; here maybe the argument could be made it wasn't technically murder as he killed three people without malice aforethought - basically coming down to manslaughter - but such arguments often go against us simply by way of common sense. And if you then ask yourself whether someone knowing what they were doing was wrong would still do it anyway despite having other options available. The answer is most definitely yes, but why? Because such individuals either choose to ignore the consequences or refuse to acknowledge responsibility for said actions. Are these grounds reasons enough to give someone like this man the benefit of leniency? No. But does that mean society doesn't condone such conduct? Of course not. This case may well serve as a prime example of why juvenile justice systems are counter productive. Yes, the offender has admitted guilt, but prior to sentencing which gave him NO DOUBT he had committed the crime, yet has been allowed to walk free after serving only four years imprisonment. Instead of getting angry with those making judgements based purely on emotion, lets work together to improve upon current methods of criminal jurisprudence. Maybe the system needs changing, but until more thought provoking discussion can take place, I suspect many of us will continue ranting over a topic we clearly find very relevant, whilst ironically seeing ourselves labelled as ill informed, ignorant, or even just plain ol stupid. Well thats my ramble for now...;) In March 2016, Jake Patterson raped and murdered Jill Meagher while she walked home alone from her night shift job. He then took pictures of his own body bearing similar injuries and photos of her naked corpse in various states of decomposition, including one showing the corpse's face mutilated beyond recognition. His violent attack left Meager's family unable to identify her remains. When police finally found her remains buried in Brunswick East cemetery, her family blamed themselves for believing she hadn't gone missing. They hope the verdict will help keep other women safe. "We've lost our mum," her son Nicholas told reporters outside court. It took nearly eight months until Patterson pleaded guilty to murdering Ms Meagher, 21, at Kings Domain Reserve near St Albans in Melbourne's north west, between 6am and 7pm on October 16 last year. In a victim impact statement read to Magistrate Mary Nolan during Patterson's plea hearing, Ms Meagher described how she felt trapped inside herself since meeting the former storeman 20 years earlier. She spoke of feeling sick whenever home security cameras recorded images of her walking home late at night and watching footage of her brutal assault online almost daily. A jury later convicted Patterson of rape, burglary, stalking, aggravated sexual penetration causing bodily harm and unlawful carnal knowledge of a female person aged 14-15 following a five-week trial. Judge Peter Kidd sentenced him to life behind bars with a minimum non-parole period of 26 years. You mention the word 'juvenile'. That brings back memories of a friend of mine, sister of friends who used to hang around me. We'll call him Y. At least 5 times per week he'd come round to play. Some days he'd never leave with clear plans of returning the next morning. Some weeks he'd stay for lunch, sleepover, whatever. Over 4 years of weekly visits, he became part of the furniture, lived across town with his latest girlfriend and spent endless hours each weekend playing darts, football or working on computers games alongside the rest of us. One Saturday afternoon I asked my brother in law if he was OK, you know... going without saying anything much. My husband gathered me aside as I went upstairs to pack bags. I think some of his behaviour began to change towards the end of youth, and overall sickness shame, which, still, reasonable track (not) So,with seriousness, happens) One. } Allowing
