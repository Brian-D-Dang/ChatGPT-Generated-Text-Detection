While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to defeat the GOP or even win in Neo-Con country. What is needed right now, is someone who doesn't have any shame about being a neo-con, donates heavily to their campaign, and will outright confess to support for torture and warrantless wiretapping when asked. Anything less just makes us look weak, which we certainly aren't at this point in time. And if you want to make yourself look like a doofus? Go ahead and say that open borders are good policy, but won't put your name behind them at all costs. That's pretty lame too (and probably deluded). So many people were really pissed off at that comment by Andy Levin last night. It was taken out way too fast, so much so that he couldn't get back into his chair to explain himself. He did claim no knowledge of Ben Stein's politics though. Maybe thats why he didn't know what "Neo" meant! This could be indicative of anything from incompetence to religion based bigotry...who knows....I'm sure these things come up when doing daily editorial reviews. For those of you wondering how well people voted on each issue: (voters cast votes that came closest to their position) 12 - 23 of voters supported banning gay marriage. A rethinking of traditional moral values can only help liberals. The other 34th of voters supported the bans. Is there anyone here truly surprised by this result? There is nothing liberal about supporting placing limits on people based upon their sexual orientation, especially since gays making legitimate marriages is hardly an infringement of religious liberties. Those opposed to gay civil rights should keep themselves quiet until after the election, because they're toast once Obama gets elected. As long as you've got a Republican running against one, you'll never lose again unless your party has completely lost its mind. We need to stop worrying about national standards of morality. Our children deserve better than having their entire lives governed by whatever crazy thoughts our current crop of politicians think up. They should decide early on whether or not they want kids to grow up hearing over and over again about God, family, society, and government interfering in peoples' personal relationships. If you refuse to accept that some parents may opt to raise their child differently than others, fine, but don't force other families to conform to your ideas. I am totally pro gay marriage; however, I believe strongly that adults ought to have the right to marry whomsoever they choose. Parents have every right to change their minds about "traditional morals." My mom raised me Catholic, but she always said I had free will and could ignore her teachings whenever I wanted. Why shouldn't adults have the same freedom? Gay couples produce healthy babies all the time, while most straight ones don't. How is that fair for straights to go around making such claims without ever needing to prove theirs validity? Yet nearly half of America supports denying basic equality to homosexuals just because they don't happen to be heterosexuals. If gays aren't allowed equal marriage status, then neither should lesbians or transsexuals, nor men marrying women (or vice versa), or transgendered individuals, etc. What kind of backwards thinking is that?! Bottom line: it scares the shit outta me when I hear about how some states outlaw certain types of unions between consenting adult citizens. Can anyone tell me where it might have originated?? For those concerned about marriage changing American education systems, please consider that already, schools teach about sex ed before kindergartners arrive on campus. Even elementary schoolers learn about birth control methods and abstinence programs in order to avoid unwanted pregnancies during middle school. Most importantly, highschool students have learned about AIDS for years now. Do you honestly believe that introducing homosexual behavior alongside normal heterosexually oriented relationships isn't going to cause problems along the lines of drug use, teen pregnancy, promiscuity, and STDs? Really, i ask this question seriously.....do you realize how much potential damage homosexuality poses towards establishing proper conservative morals? Don't listen to the Popeye comics of 50 plus years ago. When I was growing up, there wasn't any mention of safe sex, or condoms, or abortion clinics, or STD testing centers, etc. All attention focused solely on sticking it up girls asses. Nowadays, nobody wants to talk about it anymore. In fact, it seems the older generation keeps telling everyone about all these dangers to health. People must be getting sicker. Something changed. Are you really willing to risk undoing all the progress made today due to fear mongering? Please take some responsibility yourselves. You reading this forum surely understand how hard work leads to success. Without respect for self discipline, the environment suffers. People need to start demanding respect for themselves first. Let professionals worry about educating young people, while treating them humanely rather than indoctrinating them with dangerous nonsense.
