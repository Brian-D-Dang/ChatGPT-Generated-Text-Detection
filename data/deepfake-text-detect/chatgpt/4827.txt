The implementation of Judicial Review from the Marbury v. Madison case from the precedent of the Judiciary Act of 1789 allows for the Supreme court to be to judge over Acts passed by Congress or the president, a check on both branches of government that has been missing since the colonists were separated from England in 1683 and given rights and freedoms not found in the British constitution. Background: In The famous 1803 decision of Marshall vs. Baltimore (the case where Chief justice John Marshall issued his opinion) he stated .."No legislature can delegate its power..." meaning no branch of the federal government is allowed to make laws without some sort of judicial review. He went on to say "It would seem that it could never have been intended that such an important trust should be confided to any other body than this Court. It certainly must imply at least equal authority with the Courts of Westminster Hall, as being vested equally with them all, every one of whom may correct the errors of another." This was done before the founding of our country when there wasn't much separation of powers between the executive branch, legislative branch (Congress), and judiciary branch within each state. With many states having their own supreme courts, these three bodies became increasingly dependent upon protecting their own interests against the others. Another interpretation says that the final word goes back even further into history because Justice James Iredell said "I am bound to declare myself unanimously of opinion against your law; if my brethren are otherwise disposed," referring to the Virginia Resolutions which came after the Glorious Revolution. And finally, often cited as more recent but also regarding the Judicial Branch is the words of Chief Justice Warren Burger who ruled in Bowsher Vs Merit Systems Protection Board ruling that the Federal Administrative Agency had too much control over the Executive Branch. He said "Judicial review is especially appropriate here. A great deal rests in part on how well we understand what Congress does and why it does it. No agency head would dream today of announcing that a new regulation, supported by current policy analysis, will become effective next week...If no such guidance seems likely in coming weeks, agencies might find themselves left only with wearying rounds of procedural challenges-to agency rules followed up by yet more suits challenging individual actions taken under those rules." What happens now? Nowadays most people think that checks and balances are enough to keep things running smoothly and that judges are not involved in making decisions about everyday life. But in reality they have always played an integral role in deciding on cases brought to them. While the Constitution gives powers to act for Congress and the President they do not give either branch complete immunity from going through the process of judicial review - just like with eminent domain, the Supreme Court decided last year that existing protections for property owners weren't strong enough. Most importantly, Congressional efforts to bypass Constitutional limitations and use already granted authority in order to pass legislation that infringes on personal liberty has been struck down repeatedly in popular referendums whenever voters get a chance to weigh in on issues. People feel differently about whether particular methods used lie within established legal lines. For example something the Tea Party protestors did during the debt limit debate was actually illegal according to the OMB and yet most Americans still saw it as reasonable, expressing concern about raising taxes instead of reducing spending. So while the public may not agree with Congressional acts, it won't challenge the legality of same unless it feels someone else is trying to take away its rights. If you want to know who gets challenged though less so for political reasons, ask yourself if corporations or unions paid money towards campaigns in support of or opposition to certain bills. That's usually who pushes litigation, although just look at the recent controversy surrounding Citizens United movie influencing or suing legislators and see how quickly lawsuits happen. When Congress passes a bill allowing companies with foreign ties access to U.S. markets without enforcing reciprocity, except in special circumstances, be prepared for outrage. Only once consumers have complained will businesses push legislation to resolve the issue. Whether or not the end product matches expectations depends on some amount of compromise among different groups whose agendas aren't necessarily aligned. There are tools available to help make sure the final product meets consumer needs, however you need to recognize that democracy requires that everyone plays on an even field. Without oversight from elected officials acting responsibly, the system becomes dominated by lobbyists and interest groups. We're seeing exactly the opposite right now, weakening our democratic institutions, with groups lobbying for different sides to win debates rather than improving the quality of citizenship. Not everything goes through the proper channels, so if you want lawmakers to focus on a series of amendments or improvements designed to benefit citizens instead of taking advantage of loopholes created by industry pressure, then allow them to hear it directly from constituents. Make it clear to politicians that anything approved cannot go unchallenged. What is happening currently isn't representative of real change it's simply shifting responsibilities around. One way of fixing the problem lies not in changing the distribution of power but observing the democratically selected representatives' behavior. If you don't believe candidates are trustworthy or leaders are motivated by becoming irresponsible, then you'll never hear it!
