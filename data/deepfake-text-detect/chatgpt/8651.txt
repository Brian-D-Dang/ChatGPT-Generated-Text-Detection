I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit card debt get away with this practice. Even if the user had a legitimate reason for using this method with interest-free notes or debit cards present, it would still be an illegal activity and potentially even illegal under US law. The simple fact of the matter is, this type of service can only serve one purpose - interest-free credit cards, which are safe enough to use at any time without having the risk of being robbed by hackers. The people who pay for these services have no right to know that they could easily fail to maintain their ATM transactions, or even keep them, if they were going to do so, as availing this system means borrowing money from someone else, even though they may never actually need to borrow anything against the obligation. Every person who pays for this service has every right to know what it cost the bank in order to obtain their own account information. It is a real shame that many of us don't pick up on this reality. The truth however is that most people will forget about their debts until some kind of fraud occurs while paying for the services that they enjoy. This isn't happening because there is too much cash around, that leads to cheaper loans. Just look at how banks today are treated, when you think of the abuse that they have perpetrated - people get mad about having money in your pocket instead of the ones they carry out. When people steal money from others, they put in 'only' something like 10 worth of cash into their accounts and then immediately give up money - money they borrowed from someone else. A person who steals money from a stranger can easily afford to lose it all, even if he didn't really need it.
