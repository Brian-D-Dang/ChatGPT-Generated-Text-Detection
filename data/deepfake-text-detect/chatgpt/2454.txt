Posting on my secondary for obvious reasons I grew up in a extremely abusive house. I dreaded coming home and the site of my mom made my heart skip a beat. My dad was always drunk verbally abusing me. He would say things like "if you were better than this car wouldn't have hit u" or he'd threaten to run over us with his truck whenever we did something wrong. There are more but that's all i can think off atm. I'm sorry, man... This is why people who express those opinions should be put down as soon as possible so they don't harm others....
