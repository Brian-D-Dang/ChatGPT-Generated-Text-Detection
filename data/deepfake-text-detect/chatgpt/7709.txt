While it's true that the history of Europe might have played out differently if Napoleon had won at Waterloo, it's not necessarily accurate to say that we'd be better off. A victory for Napoleon would have likely resulted in continued warfare and instability across the continent. It's important to remember that Napoleon was a dictator who had already caused significant suffering through his military campaigns and political regime. Additionally, his victory at Waterloo could have caused a shift in the balance of power that may have led to future conflicts and power struggles. Ultimately, while the outcome of Waterloo may have been different under different circumstances, it's impossible to say for sure whether this would have led to a better outcome for Europe as a whole.
