Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or kidnap another criminal who has no obvious intent, then they must be viewed as criminals too." The FBI and police said in a press release Saturday morning that they were alerted by the FBI after receiving anonymous tips about the attack on Thursday evening at an apartment complex near Sunnyvale and Orange Grove, Calif., which involved two men talking loudly while performing a prank called "Trash Week," where they tied up a woman with a belt handle before dragging her naked body into a nearby parking lot. Police are investigating further surveillance footage showing the suspects smashing windows and attacking a parked car window decorating the driveway across from the apartment building. The arrests appear unrelated to the incident but were made possible because the suspects used a stolen car when they robbed the victim's car to leave a money chip inside, and authorities believe the victims had contact with strangers prior to the robbery.

"Our commitment remains unchanged: we will hunt these individuals down and bring them accountable for their crimes against our community."
