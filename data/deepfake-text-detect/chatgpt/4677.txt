Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a little bit like "yuh." Plus the fact that pinyin sounds even cooler when you say it in Chinese (I'm not sure if this applies to Japanese or Korean though). 2. Accentuation. If your natural accentation would be on consonants andor vowels, then putting emphasis on one side of them makes an already strong pronunciation all the better. Putting stress on certain syllables gives accents away. It's harder to do with Chinese characters but I think people have been doing well with learning how to use the tones to their advantage lately.
