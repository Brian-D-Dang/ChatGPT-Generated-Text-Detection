I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal products. Do you know of any vegan restaurants near you? I am curious if anyone has actually tried vegan burgers there before or ever watched the show. Also if you want please let me know your opinions on veganism!
