I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the top 10. For me, it's a lot of fun to watch, and maybe that's it. Not much of a list this year, but glad to see The Little Mermaid make it. I'm not surprised about The Lion King. I'm really surprised to see the Academy think The Wizard of Oz is better than The Adventures of Robin Hood. You're not alone. I don't get it either. I don't think any of the Best Animated Feature winners are bad. It is a hard award to hand out because there are so many great animated films. I think it's an award that is more subjective. My opinion is that Spirited Away is 1 and I'm glad it's there. I'm also glad to see The Little Mermaid on there. I also think that The Lion King should be there. I'm also glad that Chicken Run is on there. And I'm glad that The Adventures of Robin Hood is there. Yeah, I'm glad to see The Adventures of Robin Hood on there too. I'm not surprised about The Lion King either. I think it's a combination of: 1) The Academy thinks that The Lion King is a better movie than The Adventures of Robin Hood. 2) People love The Lion King. It was a very popular movie and was nominated for Best Picture. The Academy likes to honor the popular movies sometimes. In recent years, the popular movies nominated for Best Picture have been Big, Titanic, Forrest Gump, Chicago, and Slumdog Millionaire. Yeah, I agree. It is a subjective award. It's also one of the few categories that is divided between Best Animated Feature and Best Animated Short Film. I'm glad that the animated feature is a separate category. There are too many great animated films that I want to see and I don't have enough time to see all of them. I'm glad to see The Adventures of Robin Hood on the list. I'm also glad to see Chicken Run and The Lion King on there. Sad to see Rango or The Secret of Kells on the list. What are the criteria for the Academy to nominate an animated feature? Is it just a film with a certain amount of animated footage or is it more than that? It is a film with a certain amount of animated footage and it has to have a story with characters. It's not a category that is easily broken into. A lot of people have tried and failed to break into it. I think that the Academy has put together a very good list of animated films. Good list of animated films. I'm glad to see so many classics on there. I'm surprised about The Wizard of Oz though. I think that The Adventures of Robin Hood is a better film. I'm not surprised by any of the nominees. I don't think that there is a bad film on the list. If I were a voter, I would vote for The Adventures of Robin Hood. The Adventures of Robin Hood has a better story and is directed better than The Wizard of Oz. The Wizard of Oz is a very popular film and I think that the Academy would rather nominate The Wizard of Oz than a lesser-known film. Last edited by Drtooth; 02-06-2013 at 02:09 AM. Reason: edit I don't think that The Wizard of Oz is better than The Adventures of Robin Hood. And The Adventures of Robin Hood is in my top 50 favorite movies of all time list. I like The Wizard of Oz, but it isn't one of my favorite movies. It is one of my favorite songs though. And I also think that The Adventures of Robin Hood is a better film than The Wizard of Oz.
