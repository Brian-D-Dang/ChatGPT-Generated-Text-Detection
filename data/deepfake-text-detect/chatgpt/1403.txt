I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually already wealthy, so you don't get those kids in public schools creating a divide that's hard for the poor students and teachers at public schools to overcome That's not true. I know lots of middle class people with no education or credentials going into jobs they shouldn't be doing all because their parents made money when they were young by pushing them out on their own rather than raising them properly like most families would do.
