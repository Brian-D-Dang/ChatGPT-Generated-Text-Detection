For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to the events surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination and his accuser Dr Christine Blasey Ford coming forward with her story regarding him sexually assaulting her when he was 17 years old (she is now 51). I really am not trying to start some kind of debate or argument about these issues but instead just seeking answers from other people my age as well as older individuals who live on their ownfreely make decisions for themselves what they want to do without being forced under threat of law enforcement action into doing something against your will.) If you have any input at all please feel free to comment below! Thanks everyone!!:)
