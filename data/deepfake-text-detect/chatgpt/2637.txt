I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually rich so they get a leg up in their education and life because all of their friends went there too, meanwhile the ones that didn't just feel like shit for being poor (and probably had worse teachers) Yep I agree with this
