Variable tax, or at least they way the US does it, is poorly done, inasmuch as it often discourages extra labour from people who may very well need the extra work. If you're going to have a flat rate of 25hour for tech support and someone calls up demanding help fixing her PC (of course she's using Windows), I think that case would be best handled by saying "No, this isn't something we can do right now." If the person calling gets mad about being turned down (which you probably shouldn't offer anyway) then deal with it later when you've got time. You'll get better results if your employees are happy.
