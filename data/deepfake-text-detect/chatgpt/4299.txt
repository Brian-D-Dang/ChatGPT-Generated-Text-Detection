EDIT: Lots of very well rounded, interesting points. Thanks! Really helped with my perspective. EDIT 2: I've been awarding deltas to people whom have been making some very good, solid comments (like you ujayblu). You may want to check back here in a few days and see if your comment has been awarded one or more delts by me:) Thank you for the kind words and thanks for giving them out! Edit: All thanks goes to uJayBlu as he is the only person who made any effort to make this group a better place.
