Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my friends have brought up the argument that by being a vegetarian or vegan, I am not doing enough to combat the meat industry's impact on the environment. They argue that I should be advocating for a complete overhaul of the agricultural system and promoting meat alternatives like lab-grown meat. I appreciate their concern for environmental issues, but I feel like my dietary choices are a personal decision and that I am doing my part in reducing my impact on the environment. Can you help me understand their perspective better and whether there is any merit to their argument?
