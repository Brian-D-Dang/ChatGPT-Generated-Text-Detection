First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are going to waste because of the expense in trying to save them. As well as it being costly for us (tax payers), there have been many cases where zoos or people who privately own pandas neglect their needs just so they can make some extra money. This has caused a lot of harm within these endangered animals lives! Also...the Chinese Government does not help at all when it comes down to conservation efforts with Pandas solely due to profit gain from selling panda parts such as: fur coats (I will admit this is probably one reason why China cares about its Panda population) for high prices (1 million dollars per coat!), body organ sales for transplants, etcetera....all are human-made problems which could be avoided if only humans would stop exploiting nature by taking away any chance of survival an animal may ever get!!!
