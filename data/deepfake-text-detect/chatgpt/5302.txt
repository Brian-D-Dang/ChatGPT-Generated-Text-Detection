Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better. If that is so, what is the problem? I'm sure you can see why we need each others perspective on this though, there's lots more truth to it than just "the main stream media." It seems like the website they've got here has grown up with their own ideas about things and needs a lot of work from them too but lets get real people involved in dynamic discussions on these topics rather than giving them a handout which helps produce fake news headlines because it doesn't seem logical enough for them anyway
