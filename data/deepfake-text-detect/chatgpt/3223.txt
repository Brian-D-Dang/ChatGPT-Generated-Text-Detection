The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to understand. Additionally, some amendments may no longer apply to modern times or may not be relevant for current issues. Attempts have been made to update the language in constitutional amendments without changing the meaning, but there has been resistance to altering the original wording of the document. Nonetheless, the constitution remains an important and foundational document for the United States government and serves as a guide for democracy around the world.
