I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. Add to that is this classic bit - "The only thing colder than a Michael Jordan free throw attempt?" My brother swears its from an Outkast song and will not change his mind on either point (although he did pull out The Simpsons by saying they had one too). However if someone could find me proof for both points then we'd have something!
