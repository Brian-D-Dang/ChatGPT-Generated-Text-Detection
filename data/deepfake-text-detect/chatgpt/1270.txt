Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the only cars with more than 2 or 3 disabled people in them is a Tesla, and they even have 2 of those! I'd be shocked if that was true anywhere in California (or any other major metropolitan area). In fact it would surprise me if you could find an entire state like this one.
