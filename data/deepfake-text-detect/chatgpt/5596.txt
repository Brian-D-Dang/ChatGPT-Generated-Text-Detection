Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, says that it is best to purchase a car with cash. This may be a good plan, but you will have to reconsider the longer term as nicely.

This could be the smartest thing you may do with your money, but you may also use that 200 per month to go out to dinner once per week.
