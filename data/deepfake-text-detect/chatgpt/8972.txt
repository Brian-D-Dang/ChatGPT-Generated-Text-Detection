Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions, but they seem far from being very effective on what they are trying to achieve. In my opinion, the "cancel culture" movement is a man-made phenomenon of the 1950s-1960s. It's not fun or productive, and there is no cure for it yet. The only way to treat it is to try to undo its effects quickly, be very positive about it, and get rid of some of the cause-and-effect arguments. This makes us more compassionate towards those who simply disagree with us and encourage others to do the same as we do them. However, all of these ideas can easily lead to destructive consequences, even if they aren't harmful, because they don't work in the long run. A decent replacement for such an idea would come in the form of making sure people like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., despite his supporters doubting him, end up losing the election, and then re-electing him over the next decade or so. So far, however, many anti-science activists and conservatives have been convincing themselves that any attempt at rational discourse will never succeed. And now they want their own party to win the electoral college, so they create a new problem: the right has to take control of everything - ever! We're going back to the old days when liberals had thought that Republicans were just attempting to counter opposition parties; we've grown tired of the Democrats looking to exploit our social norms, the limits of government, and the limitations of personal choice. Now, liberals near and dear to the heart of the "right" see that they need to make it clear how bad things really are, and they want to protect their brand of politics from anyone who tries to bully them politically out of opposing viewpoints. The result? They're getting caught up in some sort of universal liberal tradition of thinking. For example, I'm new to this hipster movement, especially when it comes to politics. But after reading this article (that I also recently read), I realized that a lot of our society relies heavily on politics to keep us safe. We're stuck in an idiotic cultural relativism with no real purpose beyond protecting ourselves against dangerous dangers. Even though we believe that we have all the answers, we still lack respect for other humanity's needs, feelings, and values. In America, we'd rather protect ourselves than our fellow citizens. If you study American history, you'll find yourself paying attention to a little less than fifty years of speech by Donald Trump. He supports gun control and a ban on assault weapons. He wants to kill Americans if he doesn't understand why they should vote for him. To paraphrase George Orwell, children ought to learn to love each other without fear, and the children of today know a lesson. Not too long ago, Hitler was to blame for his forces' defeat in World War II. Now, almost a century later, the Nazis are not responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent civilians. Their actions were part of a global strategy that led to the creation of the Second Reich. This kind of thinking ignores the fact that we're currently living even worse off under Hitler. Germany suffered major economic losses during the Great Depression, and successive Great Awakening periods brought even worse suffering for the whole world economy. This leads to a problem that could turn into something serious. What happens when social leaders decide to try to influence public opinion while simultaneously causing massive economic damage to ordinary citizens and businesses? Will they eventually lose their jobs, homes, businesses, and lives? Or will they face severe backlash from corporations? As long as politicians continue to associate such sentiments with political correctness, traditionalists won't hold the audience hostage. But what happens if governments try to stop the destruction of human life through legislation to prevent the destruction of civilization itself? The answer is now obvious: governments are in deep trouble. You might say that the Lost Cause movement is actually a victim of social justice, although it appears to have failed miserably. According to Trump's campaign, the White House is expected to announce action soon. That would certainly render the whole situation totally implausible. But are we supposed to expect change overnight? Are we supposed to expect it until the whole population is sold out? After that, will social media manage to recreate a lost generation? Or will we go even further than that? These questions remain unanswered. The logical conclusion is that the question isn't whether we're genetically superior, we're just a bunch who never tried - even if we did. When it comes down to it, we can't always appreciate anything they say and do. All that effort to solve something we didn't think of is merely solving it. Even supposing the questions were answered, it wouldn't necessarily mean that we could actually solve anything. There are no easy solutions, either.
