I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to determine whether an element has five electrons in its nucleus, for example. What if there is something "weird" about them? The first one sounds like it could be half of sphalerite (phosphorous aluminum) with a missing electron, which would make zirconium 4p5e32 rather than 2p6d42. The second one just looks really weird because it doesn't have any protons...
