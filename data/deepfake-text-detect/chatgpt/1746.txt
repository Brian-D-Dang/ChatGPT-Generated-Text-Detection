I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past wars, we know that if a country has nuclear weaponry, there will be war eventually between its people and any other countries with those same weapons or even without them (read: Israel). In my opinion, it would take a blow-back situation before more nations would choose not to possess nuclear arms because they are afraid someone else may do so first. The US government already handles all aspects of our defense internally; I am sure their desire to maintain control over our military arsenal goes beyond just wanting us safe from terrorists - it also probably involves trying to keep up with what China and Russia are doing! It's a very scary thought indeed when you consider how much progress each country makes on creating new technologies daily. One thing's clear though: no one person can handle both the economy and security needs at once. That is why small businesses should always look into outsourcing services wherever possible as well as considering hiring employees who speak multiple languages fluently - that way everyone is protected abroad, inside America, AND here domestically!
