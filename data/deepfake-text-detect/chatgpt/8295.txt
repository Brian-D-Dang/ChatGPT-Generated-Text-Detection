I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is one show you shouldn't miss out on. What about it has been attracting all those viewers over several generations? It's both entertaining (if not for anything else than at least its battle sequences) AND well written with vast amounts potential in terms more content from this series or sequel shows down thoses lines such like SAO-WoT, Aincrad:fillers etc.. And there are some nice characters too! Who can forget Kayaba sacrificing himself so Kiritoo friends could escape......or Asuna dying tragically..... In short they're very enjoyable pieces which will most likely catch your attention within few minutes when watching them... The story itself however....well how much did i say above concerning quality issues regarding lengthamounts thus far? Well let me tell ya' what sorta problems we face: first off since S1 ended around May 2010 -end 2012 according my count (although many other fans might disagree), then came 4 years without any news whatsoever even after committees were set up by studios involved including Aniplex who produced original manga but no progress seemed made until April 2013 where an info leak showed screenshots featuring new character designs along side mentions towards their WIT studio branch announcing plans toward another TV season sometime next year except now things look different thanks mostly due "accidentally" leaking animated footage showing NISA developing two brand novelties called Shin Sekai Saikyou Densetsu Final Fantasy XV From Far AwayShin Sakura Taisen. Information was released via twitter early July 11th 2014 before taking place later during fan meets held earlier August 9ththis same month! So either way don'ts waste anymore precious Sunday waiting hours upon hour unless otherwise seeing information discussed online anywhere making sure nothing gets spoiled while also being updated often enough should something be mentioned among related posts here.Ranimer Image courtesy AniFamJP This said post seems especially important because 1st ever official debut teaser trailer confirmed finalized cast list development staff included exclusively chosen voice actors plus producers behind screenplays similar if memory serves correctly. After initially signing onto Season 2 empty handedly just prior launching Summer 2015 event campaign last December 17 0f course these concerns turned into fears soon thereafter March 3rd 2016when noted actress Rina Hidaka announced her departure allowing us further fear turns turning worries heading straight back downhill once again right away following June 23 6hrs ago ready knowing fullness she'll make comebacks eventually... Still though nonsense aside lets hope JC Staff dedicate themselves fully realizing our hopes through better communication across multiple platforms given needy nature surrounding volume contents versus limited QA process currently underway months ahead launch date.... Pre order copies received today reveal plenty volumes between 25pg B5 size chapters per title adding together roughly 100 numerical pages each forgive mistakes spelling errors typos.. btw real names used
