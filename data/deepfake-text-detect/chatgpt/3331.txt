I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say "entertainment," but I think it's more than just that. Most works of literature go beyond just providing entertainment and have a significant impact on our society. Through literature, we are able to gain insights into different cultures, time periods, and experiences. People can use literature to learn about human behavior and emotions, explore new ideas, and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. Moreover, literature helps people develop empathy, as they can gain a unique perspective into the experiences of others. By exploring unfamiliar situations through literature, people learn what it's like to walk in someone else's shoes, which can ultimately shape their worldview. In addition to that, literature has the power to inspire people and motivate them to bring change to the world. Many works of literature have had a profound impact on history, such as the abolitionist movement with works like "Uncle Tom's Cabin" by Harriet Beecher Stowe, or "The Communist Manifesto" by Karl Marx. Overall, literature has the potential to be a force for good in our society by teaching us about ourselves and the world around us, helping to develop empathy, and even inspiring us to take action for positive change.
