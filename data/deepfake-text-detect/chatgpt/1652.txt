First of all, I do not like to believe this because I've been told over and over and over that it isn't true, but I keep seeing more and more evidence against me. As my husband has pointed out, I am a total optimist who sees the best in everyone so maybe there really is some truth to what he's saying or at least an explanation as to why these things are happening. Second... Since we have taken steps toward getting rid of our debt (we were down to 20k last year - woohoo!), we haven't had many opportunities for fun vacations.
