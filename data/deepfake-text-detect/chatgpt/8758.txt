This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced with a disclaimer. I had a chance to talk with the author of the book, and she said the following about this subject: "If you read The Silence of the Lambs or The Addams Family, they tell us how important it is not just for men to have sex in relationships. Men aren't supposed to do that unless need be, especially since sex isn't really 'the man's idea of love,' which is exactly what we are all talking about here. Men don't want all kinds of sexual activity going on because women aren't interested (or they can't get enough). They don't want to go to the gym. They want to spend time together instead of being alone. But why? Because men think that love is more than just physical attraction, which isn't true at all. Indeed, if you ask most men outside of their family, it's almost impossible to imagine anyone paying any attention to anything else. And yet, most of them are doing it with only a handful of guys and girls who actually care about each other very much." What? Why would those men want to be friends with a bunch of strangers? Yes, they seem like very happy, ever-loving, lovers, but there was some evidence that wasn't even hinted at by Ms. McKenna. When she said something about how they were like having sex with "others," I thought that sounded strange - so odd. To me, when I see someone tearing up, I know that I'm paying attention to the mind behind their happiness, while I wonder if they actually want to make love to another person. The question doesn't really matter - there is no point in hurting our feelings for the sake of spending time together, right? My answer, though, is complicated - if my partner has always wanted to be a romantic partner with my girlfriends, then he should know that there is never a bad time for sex, right? Of course, if I did think of myself as a beautiful person, why wouldn't I want to have sex with people that I love? Many different things are possible, but one thing I find particularly interesting is that I am attracted to women whose hearts are in the right place, despite their personal reasons for allowing themselves to become lonely and intimate with others. If you want someone to change your heart for you, you must put yourself out into the world and let people call you a prostitute; however, if you are attracted to the desire and enthusiasm of people who have feelings for you, that may give you an advantage over yourself. It seems obvious that all these feelings that attract males may also attract females, who might simply lose interest in mating with whom they share a similar affection. So, if you can understand why I choose not to date someone who loves me, you can definitely understand why I end up preferring them.
