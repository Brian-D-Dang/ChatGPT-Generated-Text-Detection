The word 'natural' implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless you see the world as created by man (which many creationists do not), then how can it be unnatural for gods to exist or naturalunnatural things such that god exists?! What exactly does "Natural" mean in English language especially when we use those words often but also confuse them with other meanings depending on context because our languages aren't precise yet (as far I know)? Is Natural only an adjective modifying thing which has some relation mostly accidentally between itself its environment like most organic products have so they fit into their surroundings without any particular effort put forth while others may require substantial efforts towards coming up close enough resembling what's around already...or am i missing out using partial definitions wrongly here?! - Thank You!:)
