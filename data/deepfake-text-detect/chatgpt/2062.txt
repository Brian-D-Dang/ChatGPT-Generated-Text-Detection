Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of hearing from friends they all got vaccinated as soon as possible after me That's so strange to hear! Every one ive ever met is the opposite (born in Canada) it blows peoples minds that i would refuse vaccines for myself or children...
