New here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong. Before I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal experience (which has been mostly negative). In other words: This is not how you should be playing the game as a new player or someone who hasn't owned it in a while! I've just picked up my copy from gamestop. The only thing i have left to play through is the campaign since there isn't much else multiplayer wise. I'm using mouse and keyboard on PC though because most shooters feel better with them. Anyways back on topic, what are some good gunsclasses for beginners?
