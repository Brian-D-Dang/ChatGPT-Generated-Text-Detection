Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view I hold. My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any concerns about the recent developments in the world of governance within the stock market over time before making predictions for what happened when people are expecting things to pick up elsewhere too soon because of the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus outbreak. This week saw the largest share price increase since January 25th 2019 despite being just weeks away from Christmas Eve. That's no small feat considering the markets were initially falling precipitously due to fears that stocks would fall dramatically during the pandemic lockdown period. While stocks may have been undervalued by historical standards earlier this year investors need not worry today they're holding steady against such volatility and nothing has changed yet. With stocks trading at all times highs it should be safe enough given some fundamental changes happening around global economic activity which gives investors less reason to rethink their investment decisions now. The likelihood of further liquidity flooding into the sector remains high with the US Federal Reserve adding another 11 trillion worth of quantitative easing stimulus and the Federal Open Market Committee increasing interest rate cuts early next month thanks to evidence of increased inflationary pressures locally after recent negative rates having led to rising prices across major economies including Europe. The QE3 announcement was followed by a flurry of positive news overnight from China where the country announced plans for a snap capital outflow relief fund giving relief to businesses hit hard by the pandemic-driven slowdown caused by lockdowns imposed nationwide last year. However there appears little chance at least part of this optimism will translate into any improvement later this week unless political turmoil persists between major countries like China. And in order for the US economy to reopen quickly, international markets must remain stable even though we've seen significant cases above 100k worldwide recently ahead of Christmas holidays. Most analysts expect global growth momentum to slow down significantly post Christmas although it seems unlikely that these measures could materially impact growth beyond 2019 levels currently forecasted depending on the duration of the crisis.
