When the german leaders were put on trial after WWII, They claimed they were just following orders but it was decided that this was not good enough. Hitler could have been brainwashed or just a very sick man and so he should be held accountable for his actions. The same can most likely be said about Stalin in Russia - He also had some serious mental issues and while I'm sure there's more to both of their cases than we'll ever know, perhaps We need special courts like these where criminal trials are based off what you did instead of who your parents are? I think part of the problem is our government itself has become corrupt (and the people running them not even interested in prosecuting those higher level criminals). I don't see anyone from Obama's administration going up against himherself with any kind of passion - and that's sad because when someone breaks laws, no matter how good their intentions may seem at first glance, if they're breaking the law then something needs to change. If nothing does, maybe we're really doomed as a nation...
