For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system whereby people are allowed to work and have personal freedom in each household but no one else has any right to do so... I'm not sure what you're talking about. There's no way for every person to own more than 2 things at once (or even 1 thing at random), or even does it really matter? No need to be a douchebag on social media just because someone disagrees with your opinion. Just like if you disagree with me on politics, that doesn't make me less of an asshole.
