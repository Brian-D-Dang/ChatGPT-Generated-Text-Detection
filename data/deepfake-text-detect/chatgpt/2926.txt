If movies and video games are subject to regulation and censorship, then books should be too. In many places, especially in western cultures, the censorship of books is looked down upon as a violation of free speech. It may seem like an exaggeration but some go so far as saying that book banningcensorship equates with a form of Holocaust denial for Jews who were forced into hiding during World War II (Source: "Who Censors The Internet?" by Noreen Malone). As you probably know already, over half of all new published books contain at least one instance of questionable content. For example, there have been thousands of children's books released each year containing racist depictions or violent themes such as animal cruelty towards humans (source: "Everyday Racism" by Kate Smurthwaite; a href. With this being said if we look back on history it would appear that most censoring bodies have taken extreme measures against any type of literature deemed threatening. Whether it was due to war time atrocities or other societal issues, government officials always had the option of deleting certain publications from the public domain to prevent the spread of ideas they didn't approve of. We can see examples of this happening today when Nazi propaganda films and works written by white supremacists still circulate freely among viewers despite their best efforts to remove them (Source: "The Third Reich's Greatest Hits" by Mark Mazerolle). If these groups could censor books why not current day governments? Although I personally find it unlikely that our future leaders will outright ban books just yet, I think it would be wise to consider how much power they do possess. Because even though its name might contradict what you expect, censuring does not equal restricting free speech. Instead, censure simply means to restrain oneself, meaning something along the lines of,"Don't say anything stupid."
