While some people may view political correctness and the Social Justice movement as excessive, it is important to consider the underlying reasons why these movements exist. They aim to promote respect, equality, and fairness towards marginalized communities who have historically been oppressed and discriminated against. To dismiss these movements as going "overboard" overlooks the systemic inequalities that continue to exist in society and the harm they inflict on individuals. Moreover, the fact that these movements have gained significant momentum indicates that many people understand the importance of addressing these issues and creating a more just society. In other words, instead of resisting these movements, we should continue to engage with them and work towards creating a world where everyone is treated with respect and dignity.
