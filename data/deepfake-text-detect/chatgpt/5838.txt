For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system where the government owns the means of production. A major problem with capitalism is that it's a system where the people with the most money have the most power. In my ideal world, everyone should have a little bit of power, not just the people who have the most money. One way of doing that would be to have a system where the government owns the means of production. Socialism has a number of problems that I don't have time to go into detail about now. But let me take a second to talk about a couple of the big ones. This one is pretty easy to see. When someone has a problem, they should be able to do whatever it takes to fix it. If that means calling the government, so be it. If that means calling the police, so be it. If that means getting a lobbyist, so be it. If that means getting a lawyer, so be it. When a person has a problem, and they have the resources to solve it, they should be able to solve it. When the government gets involved, it starts to get into the territory of telling people how to solve their problems. For example, say you have a problem with your neighbor's dog peeing on your lawn. You would normally just call your neighbor, tell them about your problem, and then they would solve it. Under a socialist system, if your neighbor has the money to hire a lawyer, then they'll probably call a lawyer. A lawyer is going to tell them that the dog peeing on your lawn is illegal, and that if they were to solve this problem by killing the dog, then they'd be breaking the law. This seems like a pretty stupid thing to do, but that's exactly what a government lawyer would do. A socialist system is also prone to corruption. People with money will try to use that money to get their way. That's just how human nature is. Another big problem is that socialist systems almost always end up in dictatorships. This is because the government has so much power, that they can easily corrupt it, and take over the government. Socialism is an impossible system to try to implement, because of the corruptibility of the people running it. Socialism is a system where the people with the most money have the most power. That is not a good system. I don't know how to make that any clearer. So how do we solve the problem of too much money and too much power? How do we solve the problem of corruption? The answer is simple. We need to give a lot of power to the people who are not in power. We need to give a lot of power to the people who don't have a lot of money. How do we do that? The answer is, we need to allow them to vote on things. In the next post, I will go over how we could implement a government system where the people have more power.
