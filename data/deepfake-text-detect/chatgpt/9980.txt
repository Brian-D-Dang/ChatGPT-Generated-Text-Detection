I'd like to preface this by saying that parts of my post may sound like they're bragging, but they're not trying to come across that way. Also, I'm using a lot of generalizations and my opinions may not be held by everyone. I think that having a college degree is something to be proud of. It's an accomplishment that shows that you have worked hard, persevered, and have gained valuable knowledge and experience in the process. It also gives you access to opportunities that you wouldn't have otherwise. For example, having a college degree can open the door to higher-paying jobs, more professional networking opportunities, and the ability to pursue further education if desired. I believe that having a college degree is something that should be celebrated, and that those who have earned one should feel proud of their achievement.
