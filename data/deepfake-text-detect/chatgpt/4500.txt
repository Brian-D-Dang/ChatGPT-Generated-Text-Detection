WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in life are introverts and some have challenged me on this one time or another but I feel like my opinion is justified so we will just go along with it. The first thing about creative writing that bothers me is that i don't think there should be a specific term for it because whenever you write something good it is always classed as "creative writing" even when its not! Now if it was an English Literature course then okay but in all honesty what do they achieve? The only reason why this caught on now is due to Adobe forcing students into doing Creative Writing courses. If you were to ask any literature student who has taken at least two exams (at A level) heshe would know that most essay questions come towards the end of the exam which could be anything from Shakespeare to Rona Munro novels - no way can anyone say that those essays are written by creative writers!! They are usually very confusing and hard to answer due to being full of content meaning they rarely receive marks out-of-ten. In comparison to these essays you get your marking done much quicker in other subjects such as Maths, Physics etc where you are given multiple choice question, fill in number boxes and tick lists (which actually makes sure that everyone knows how to mark). Once again this becomes more valid than having the word 'Creative' when talking about books or movies as the aforementioned explains itself fine. This might sound rather negative however I am glad that things seem to be getting better now thanks to Google creating their own academy to teach us kids all kinds of things instead of our teachers teaching us basic stuff that we learn anyway online nowadays. To sum everything up, so long live the internet since every single day we spend learning new words through YouTube tutorials, downloading music via Spotify etc. (I am going off track here) Question 2; How does creativity fit within society today? For example, do you see art influencing social change? Or are artists using art primarily as a means of self expression? Do visual representations influence societies views of certain issues? There are probably many different answers to each question depending on whom you ask, but I believe that the majority view that creative work influences society positively and socially mainly comes down to the fact that artistic works inspire others outside of the artist themselves. Artistic works are typically seen as beautiful pieces by the general public regardless of whether someone else created them or not. Therefore, the popularity of such works cause people around the world to value artistic creations as valuable parts of culture and intellectual progress in human history. It simply fuels the belief system among large amounts of humans across cultures and numerous religions and beliefs in order to create a positive effect on society. Visual arts are mainly used for advertising purposes although individual artists still express themselves creatively by developing ideas into paintings, drawings, sculptures etc. However, artists who take inspiration from societal changes may use abstract imagery, incorporate symbolism or even break free of traditional conventions of painting. There are countless different ways in which an artist expresses his feelings in relation to current events and political situations and therefore the meanings behind images remain ambiguous until interpretations are made by the viewer himself. Furthermore, individuals taking part actively in politics often have the intention of bringing forth real social change and equality upon the population. As a result, the act of expressing oneself through various forms of arts creates a huge impact on both sides of civil discussion whilst further aiding cultural advancement in respect to international relations between nations. Unfortunately our education system focuses solely on academic studies leaving little room for debate regarding contemporary topics so hopefully soon enough students will start studying creative writing alongside core curriculum subjects hence allowing for all types of discussions to arise amongst myself and future generations. Please comment below if you agree or disagree. My final question is: What type of writer do you want to become? Some days ago I was watching a video called An Introvert's Guide to Being Yourself On Youtube involving Tana Lea Hillis. She explained how she felt differently inside compared to her friends and family members in reference to how outgoing and extroverted they seemed. So naturally after finding out this information I started thinking about my personality and wondering whether I perceived myself as similar to her. Fast forward three months later and I finally decided to watch the video once again. I sat back with curiosity, what did she mean? We all possess varying levels of extroversion and introversion based on our upbringing, genetics, environment and experiences throughout life. Whether extreme extroverts or complete loners there is likely a section in your make up somewhere in the middle where you belong. When attempting to classify yourself as an extrovert or an intorvte it isn't difficult to notice where exactly you fall on a spectrum. Some points are obvious while others require a bit of thought which is probably why the matter of classification remains controversial especially considering the possible alterations the mind undergoes during adolescence (the same point must then patterning messages sentin, a jumped to send letters the message men with the letter being tossed to setting off contrasts slow to talkie goal
