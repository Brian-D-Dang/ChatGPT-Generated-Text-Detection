I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer need to fear for their life in certain situations? Why are there no courses teaching them how not be as trigger-happy when they get near gunsweapons etc., especially since cops spend so much time around weapons anyway (their job). If you know of any such course (s) please tell me! Thanks guys:)
