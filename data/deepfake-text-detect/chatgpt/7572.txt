While it's certainly important for voters to be informed, discouraging low-information voters from casting their ballots only serves to further the marginalization of communities who may face disparities in education and access to information. It's our responsibility to ensure that all voters are provided with the resources and support they need to make informed decisions, rather than simply writing them off as unworthy of participation. Additionally, even those who may not be deeply knowledgeable on political issues may still have important perspectives and lived experiences that deserve representation in our democracy.
