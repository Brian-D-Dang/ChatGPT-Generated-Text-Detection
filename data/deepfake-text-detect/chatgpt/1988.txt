So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion. The way you guys talk about how much money esports will be worth and compare regular sports with it makes me feel like most of us are blind here! Also a little offtopic question: You think franchising will come one day? I don't know if we'll ever get franchise mode at least right now there's still plenty of room on rosters so why would they need that
