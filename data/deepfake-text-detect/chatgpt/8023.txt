One could argue that the right to be Pro-Choice and the right to decline fatherhood are two fundamentally different concepts. The right to be Pro-Choice recognizes a woman's right to make decisions about her own body and health. On the other hand, declining fatherhood means a man is choosing not to take responsibility for a child he helped create. Fatherhood is not just a biological event but it also comes with legal and financial responsibilities. If a man has sex with a woman, there is always a possibility of pregnancy. By engaging in sexual activity, the man is also accepting the risk of fatherhood. If a woman decides to have an abortion, she is taking responsibility for her own body and health. However, if a man chooses to decline fatherhood, he is shifting the responsibility and consequences of his actions solely onto the woman and the child. Therefore, while women have the right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term or not, men do not have the same right to choose to decline fatherhood as it is their moral and legal responsibility to take care of the child they helped create.
