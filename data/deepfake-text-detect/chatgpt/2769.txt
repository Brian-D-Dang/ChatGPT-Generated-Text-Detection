It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing I find interesting in this discussion is how little attention has been paid to what might be called "cultural power" or more accurately, cultural capital - something which played an important role during World War II but became much less important within capitalism after 1945. China may have risen economically over the last few decades, increasing its GDP by 8 per year (or close) from ; however, it lacks the military capacity for serious battle with the US today. In fact, its army numbers only 250,000 men compared with 1 million each at Russia and the United States, while 16th of South Korea's population serves in its armed forces. Even if we were to accept such arguments against increased Chinese power (such as mismatched geography), why should we think that culture would not play even more significant roles? After all, many see cultural differences between Europe and North America as being greater than those between East Asia and the West. Furthermore, Chinese intellectuals themselves tend to believe that their own country possesses superior ideas on subjects like economics and science. And perhaps most importantly for our purposes here, the nature of globalization itself seems bound up with particular cultural traditions. For example, modernism was defined partly by Nietzschean nihilist skepticism toward traditional modes of thought about the world, and though he saw nothing wrong with progress, did Nietzsche imagine himself living under a capitalist system where innovation could happen without challenging the status quo? If so, his philosophy would never come into existence. As Michael Hardt writes: The nation state no longer exists... the center cannot hold because society as whole becomes too complex. The individual can no longer bear responsibility outside the realm of his immediate imagination, since he possesses neither the knowledge nor the means to do otherwise.... The social contract disintegrates through transnational flows of financial speculation, whereby money ceases to become the common measure of value - which leads us directly back to the problem of meaning. A new sense of alienation arises just as the old forms are breaking down around us. No wonder there is a crisis of faith! There is simply nowhere left to turn.[1] Hardt's book is about terrorism rather than geopolitics, but nonetheless his observations seem relevant insofar as technology allows individuals to act independently of conventional structures. Indeed, the Internet makes communication possible across vast distances often previously unattainable, thus opening up possibilities beyond anything imaginable mere centuries ago. Thus capitalistic systems do not necessarily lead humanity forward, particularly given the tendency of technological ingenuity towards monopolies and centralization, but rather allow certain types of innovations (those whose costs benefit greatly from economies of scale). Mass production becomes feasible as the labor necessary to produce goods falls off dramatically. Therefore, any positive developments brought about by capitalism in general will also depend upon specific characteristics associated with Western civilization. This does not mean that other parts of the world must adopt these same attributes for their societies to develop, yet it does suggest that nations who want to succeed in open markets need to adopt some of them. In contrast, as Craig Calhoun points out, the Arab Spring showed that traditional elements of Islamic societies remain alive and well throughout the Middle East despite modernization efforts made in recent decades. At the same time, the American government has had difficulty understanding the motivations behind terrorist attacks committed inside the US by groups operating as fronts for Al Qaeda. These factors show that culture plays a larger role than is generally assumed. To use another example, consider the way Yugoslavia fell apart following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Eastern European countries remained tied together culturally due to communist ties forged during WW2, whereas Bosnia and Serbia broke away and formed rival alliances precisely because Balkan nationalism appealed to local sentiments regarding ethnicity and language. Of course, other factors enabled ethno-linguistic divisions among Yugoslavians, with Croatia and Slovenia receiving disproportionate amounts of aid from the West in order to prevent further bloodshed. But the point remains that ideology alone did not account for everything. To my mind then, it is very difficult indeed for anyone to say that China really matters now or will matter down the road solely based upon economic or military prowess. It is obvious that much of the rest of the world contains far more cultural diversity than the industrial core of either the EU or USA. Moreover, China has already seen several regional wars in Tibet and Xinjiang amidst religious tensions, violence sparked by ethnic disparity, etc., and it is likely that deep internecine conflicts will arise once again whenever Beijing takes steps to promote economic growth in regions which lack sufficient infrastructure and opportunities. Demographic pressures due to its low birthrate will heighten internal tension unless the regime can stimulate development elsewhere in its territory, so that it will get enough young workers ready to work in factories. Such inequalities create fertile ground for separatist movements seeking independence, warlords competing for control, terrorists attacking urban centers, or mass migrations sparking conflict wherever borders clash. Perhaps conflict erupting from. A The The...... M..
