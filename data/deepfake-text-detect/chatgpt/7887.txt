While it's true that white people do not have the same lived experiences as minorities, this does not mean that they cannot be empathetic and understanding of the struggles that minorities face. Additionally, criticizing someone's actions does not necessarily require one to fully understand their perspective. They can simply evaluate the outcome of those actions and their impact on others. Likewise, minority individuals can also make mistakes or act in ways that harm others, and it is important for everyone to be held accountable for their actions regardless of their background. It is necessary to work towards a society where everyone is treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their race or ethnicity, and it requires collaboration and understanding from people on all sides.
