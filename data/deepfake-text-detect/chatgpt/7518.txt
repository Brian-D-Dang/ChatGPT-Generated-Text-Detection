One counter-argument would be that a person's financial status does not necessarily reflect their ability to lead a country. While financial responsibility is an important trait for any leader, it is not the sole factor that determines their qualifications for the presidency. Additionally, someone's financial situation can change over time, and they may have learned valuable lessons from past mistakes. It is possible for someone with a history of financial struggles to turn their situation around and become a capable leader. Therefore, dismissing someone solely on their past financial decisions may not be fair or relevant to their qualifications for the presidency.
