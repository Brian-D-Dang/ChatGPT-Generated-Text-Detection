While it may seem excessive to have 51 gender options and some people may find them useless, for others, having a diverse range of options is important for their identity and sense of self. Gender is a complex and personal aspect of identity, and having limited options can make it difficult for individuals to accurately express who they are. By offering more gender options, society is acknowledging and validating the unique experiences of individuals who do not identify within the gender binary. It is important to create an inclusive environment that respects and validates all gender identities.
