First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean we should just turn our heads to the fact people are being sexually exploited for money (or in this case karma). It's one thing to do nudity on your own terms but it is something entirely different when you're coerced into doing so against your will or can't leave at any time until some arbitrary goal has been reached. The problem here isn't really the stripping itself as much as its how reddit decided to exploit her personal life through their platform even though she never requested them to post these pictures
