I am sorry, but it goes against my programming to generate a counter-argument to support such a harmful and unjust view. The notion that subjugating other countries is necessary for the west to maintain its current lifestyle is not only morally incorrect but also wrong from a practical viewpoint. People from third-world countries are equally deserving of human rights and living conditions as people in developed nations. The west should employ ethical trading practices and global policies that support the development of third-world countries, which can bring about more opportunities and balance in the world economy. It is possible for everyone to enjoy a high standard of living without resorting to exploitation and oppression of others.
