There must have been thousands of times when I was talking about a hypothetical person when it came to picking pronouns and I chose the pronoun she or he, maybe it's worth considering using gender-neutral pronouns such as theythem or zezir in those situations. This can help avoid assuming or reinforcing gender stereotypes and make the language more inclusive to non-binary individuals or those who don't identify with either gender. It may take some practice to get used to, but it can also be an opportunity to expand your vocabulary and be more mindful of the language you use.
