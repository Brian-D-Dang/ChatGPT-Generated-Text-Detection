Let me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers for not updating the experience with online play, as doing so would be a tremendous undertaking even if only considering current-generation consoles; any game from 1997 to 2017 is going to require some serious work (and money) just to get up to speed on today's platforms. What surprised me was how similar everything felt when playing online compared to what my friends experienced 20 years ago - nobody had trouble finding matches or connecting to one another. What we've seen of Fortnite Battle Royale shows its similarities to PUBG too: You drop into an arena where you search for weapons while also trying to avoid getting killed by other players at all costs. When someone gets shot down, however, they're eliminated entirely until there are only two people remaining, likely because whoever remains has won their respective match. The twist here being that instead of simply moving across a map like most games do these days, your movements very much remain tethered within whatever arena you choose and can never leave without dying first. That makes positioning more important than ever since every move could end up being used against you later on. As such, it sounds incredibly stressful but extremely rewarding once you manage to win despite knowing full well others were working hard behind enemy lines to take you out early. And best part? It should launch sometime next year.
