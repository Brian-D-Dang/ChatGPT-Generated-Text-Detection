Cigarettes are the leading cause of preventable death, responsible for roughly 480,000 deaths per year in the US. 41,000 of those deaths aren't even those of users they are the friends and family members who die as a result of second-hand smoke exposure.[bib0001] The average adult smokes around 20 cigarettes each day. With smoking cessation programs, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and other treatments including weight loss support groups, many smokers have been able to quit successfully Figure 1] (fig0001) {ref-type"fig.[bib0002],[bib0003] These methods work well when utilized together; however, there is no guarantee that any one technique alone will be sufficient enough on its own to aid with quitting. The Centers for Disease Control predicts over 26 million Americans will try e-cigarettes this year.[bib0014] "Quitlines" are available nationwide through state health departments or via online websites such as . These resources allow people in need of help quitting to access treatment without having to make an appointment at their local hospital or clinic. Quitting lines vary by region but provide free counseling from trained counselors about tobacco use prevention, reduction, and cessation techniques ranging from cognitive behavioral interventions, hypnosis, nutritional guidance, social support, etc. Additionally, these centers also offer bupropion (Zyban) up to 150 mgday or varenicline (Chantix) 0.5mg twice daily free of charge if needed along with referrals to further care after 12 weeks.Figures 11A: Average cigarette consumption among current smokers, n639[bib0012]. 1B: Percentage change between baseline measures and follow-up month 3 measures, n99.[bib0013] Data taken directly or indirectly from published articles used in preparation of manuscript.Fig 1 Despite efforts aimed at increasing awareness regarding the benefits of stopping using tobacco products long term abstinence rates remain low across all demographics despite significant increases in public education campaigns and widespread availability of NRT based medications like Chantix and Zyban. A study conducted by Bhatia et al. examined demographic differences in motivation and ability to stop smoking amongst 654 participants surveyed throughout California using both self-efficacy measures (e.g., confidence in ability to maintain a non-smoking lifestyle) and depression survey items (depression was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 9) [bib0010], [bib0011] Furthermore, it has been shown that more than half of children exposed to environmental factors like passive and second hand smoke can develop serious diseases later in life.[bib0015] Thus, there remains a considerable risk of disease resulting from continued smoking habits not only for those within our community, but worldwide. We sought to examine data collected during the National Youth Tobacco Survey administered by the United States Department of Agriculture's Center for Nutrition Policy Promotion which would potentially assist researchers and clinicians alike gain insight into important information concerning first time attempts at quitting related to age, gender, ethnicity, alcohol and drug abuse history, parental educational level, school performance and academic attendance. We hypothesized that since most youth report experimentation with cigarettes prior to high school completion,[bib0016] we should expect higher rates of difficulty making quitting attempts compared to adults due to fewer previous experiences and familiarity with substances commonly found in tobacco smoke. Further, we expected that women may be less likely to attempt quitting given traditional gender roles associated with cessation behaviors such as being the primary caregiver for young children or wives depending upon socioeconomic status. Because adolescents often engage in risky behavior, particularly substance abuse, combined with poor decision making skills, we predicted that failure outcomes would increase dramatically post 16 years old. Finally, we were interested in learning how county residents fared overall compared to national numbers reported previously by the same organization.[bib0017],[bib0018] Methods {sec0001} Data collection {sec0002} It is estimated that approximately 40 of current smokers start before 21 years of age.[bib0019],[bib0020] To ensure a representative sample, different regions of the country were targeted based on findings from past surveys where individuals living in rural areas had lower success rates compared to urban populations attempting to curb their addiction.[bib0021],[bib0022] All participating counties have at least 400,000 inhabitants, representing a total population of 174 million according to 2015 estimates. Twenty-one states were included in this analysis with 2200 completed questionnaires distributed electronically via email invitation sent out nationally reaching potential respondents through key contacts. Complete responses were received from 544 participants beyond what was anticipated taking place at a regional meeting sponsored by state authorities held in October 2017. Participants ranged widely across the spectrum of ages with 43 aged 1419 years, 39 18 19 years, 29ia sojatapttati asks questions whether: Before business takes too much business for its job testing a positive arblick example melloosepoch-me
