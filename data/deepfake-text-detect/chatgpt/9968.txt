So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor other features because they do not have the same level of power that white people have? Yes, that is correct. The idea of reverse racism does not exist because racism is a system of power and privilege in which those with more power, usually white people, are able to use their power to oppress and marginalize those with less power, usually people of color. Therefore, it is not possible for people of color to "reverse" this system since they don't have the same level of power or privilege as white people. Moreover, ethnic minorities cannot appropriate white supremacy, because white supremacy is an oppressive system that has been used to subjugate people of color and deny them their rights.
