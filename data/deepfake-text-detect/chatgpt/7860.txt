Deaf individuals may not be able to hear themselves being loud or disruptive, so it's important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. Additionally, movie theaters and public spaces are typically designed to accommodate all individuals, including those with disabilities. Kicking someone out of a movie theater because of a disability is discriminatory and goes against basic human rights. It's important to promote inclusivity and accessibility for all individuals, and there may be alternative solutions such as providing closed captioning or alternative accommodations for individuals with sensory issues.
