With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more transparency. Perhaps they can have cameras in police cars but only if the officer has received proper training to record everything properly, his body worn camera would also record what he sees on the street while driving around which is another alternative Police officers need to be aware when dealing with someone who's mentally unstable or intoxicated because you never know when things could go south very quickly. If an individual was arrested for something minor years ago it shouldn't affect their ability to own firearms today just like how an incident during military service doesn't stop them from getting hired as a cop
