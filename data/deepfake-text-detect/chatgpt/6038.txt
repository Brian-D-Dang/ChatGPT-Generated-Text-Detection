If every nation had a large nuclear arsenal, and was willing to use it if they were invaded, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction. But then you still have the problem of some nation invading some other nation. So, if every nation had a large nuclear arsenal and was willing to use it if they were invaded, than every nation would have a large nuclear arsenal and would be willing to use it if they were invaded, and no nation would be willing to invade another nation. But the question is whether or not the first assumption is true. If the first assumption is true, then the second assumption is also true. If the second assumption is true, then the first assumption is true. However, if the first assumption is true, then the second assumption is false. Therefore, the second assumption is false. Therefore, the first assumption is false. But then the second assumption is true. Therefore, every nation would have a large nuclear arsenal and be willing to use it if they were invaded, and no nation would be willing to invade another nation. The larger the arsenal, the more likely it would be that a nation would be attacked and be willing to attack first, before it was attacked. The larger the arsenal, the more likely it would be that a nation would be attacked. Therefore, the larger the arsenal, the more likely it would be that a nation would be attacked.
