For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system in which non-capitalistic government control of the means of production is established along with state ownership of many other critical elements of economic life. The two terms are used interchangeably to describe different economic systems that employ very similar methods and goals when it comes to the allocation of resources for use within an economy. Both sort of socialism have been proposed by different thinkers over time and come with varying degrees of support from people of various political persuasions. The key difference between these ideas are their degree of acceptance by the general population; although they may be opposed by those who hold ideologies aligned with capitalism or socialism. I will assume you know about socialism if not, let me say that its a form of socialism where there is no capitalist controlled economy but instead the means of production belongs to the workers themselves (communists). Under communism the owners would just sit on the money accruing from the sale of goods, but under socialism the means of production belong to the worker's union so the owner cannot get any money out of them at all! There would also be no profit motive like capitalists do. If you want more information on what makes socialism great read up here: Capitalism is a fairly new concept but has already had several attempts made at implementing it throughout history. It was first introduced in 1776 during the American Revolution through the Massachusetts Bay Colony. This small colony was one of the most influential colonies in the world during this period due to its mercantile capitalism. By refusing to engage in slave trade, the colonists were successful in creating high standard of living for their citizens without paying taxes (like other colonies did.) That is why we see the rise of socialism today even though America and most industrialized countries decided against socializing capital within the last century or two. Socialism then became popularized after WWII by communist leaders such as Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, Friedrich Engels and Martin Luther King Jr. These leaders advocated for complete abolition of private property and called for socialist governments to take control of all aspects of society including the means of production. They believed that the majority of nation states should work towards abolishing private ownership of industry so as to foster democracy rather than exploitation from foreign powers. Capitalism is still a powerful force despite being nearly 200 years old and has gained popularity since then. Some political movements, such as Marxism-Leninism and Maoist Communism, have far less success compared to Capitalism. Capitalism requires functioning markets while communism doesn't. In fact both types of socialism combine to create failed systems marked by horrors like World War II and the Great Depression. Now this brings us to capitalism vs socialism. Capitalism is quite popularly accepted because it has held power throughout human existence and has done well enough for itself to become mainstream. However, many associate socialism with negative things such as communism and anarchism, as seen with Jeremy Corbyn, Bernie Sanders etc. This association can lead some into believing that socialism is messy and chaotic whereas capitalism provides stability, safety, security and plenty of opportunities for growth. While true the reality is that both socialism and capitalism need to go through a process of change and improvement before they make significant headway into actualising their ideals. To sum it off, depending on your opinion, socialism is either better than capitalism or worse than capitalism. So how does this affect the game? First of all, we must understand that capitalism needs to grow naturally in order to survive and expand outside of our current environment. Allowing a single type of system to dominate the whole world would simply destroy everything else around it even when it grows slowly and organically. Every attempt at adapting capitalism to another setting fails and leads to stagnation and decline. Also capitalism is generally viewed negatively among the general public due to the way it operates and how it affects other people and natural resources alike. Therefore it helps to think of it as a system operating according to certain principles and worrying little about whether or not everyone accepts it or hates it. As long as the rules are clear and fair then you don't really have to worry much about whether or not someone likes or dislikes capitalism. You just have to make sure they aren't exploiting others. Now players have autonomy to choose what to build next, but only when all components of the system are viable. This system allows for more freedom but makes building structures quite costly since you likely won't always find available space to construct anything useful. With land becoming scarce and the number of buildings increasing, construction costs continue to increase making a large part of the player base unable to afford rent-free housing.
