Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as possible, and investing in low-cost index funds for long-term growth. They also mentioned the importance of tracking expenses and developing a budget. Do you have any thoughts on this topic?
