I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too great between city life and ruralsuburban living for me at least to enjoy both (I'm pretty extreme when it comes to enjoying my own space). I lived in the suburbs most my adult years as an emigrant from Hong Kong... but after 10 years, we bought a house on 200 acres that is surrounded by farms. We have chickens, cows, sheep.... Its very peaceful!
