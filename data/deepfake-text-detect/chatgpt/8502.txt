Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or in your case (as you like) any other weapon they can get their hands on...the only thing left for them after doing so will be suicide! You did not deserve jail time by my standard but what happened was out there and may have been self defense at some point I'm sure Rocky Balboa would agree "It ain't about how hard ya hit....it's About How Hard YOU Can Get Hit And Keep Moving Forward." That means using an otherwise good life experience as motivation which has served me well over these years; hopefully it does something equally positive when passing along:) We all make mistakes - even people who look up too much data before making decisions are just going through normal growth pains according Accenture..here' s hoping we don't wait twenty five more (or less) years until our next mistake though!! It really doesn' t matter wherewhen Life hits us - because no amount breaths taken away etc., could outweigh those missed today!! My mom always usedto remind her sons "Real men ride dinosaurs..."and now she'd also caution: Real women aren 'tbold enough-even knowing better than most others all things consideredthat sometimes walking soft actually helps avoid stepping into trouble...in every sense;) Thanks again RYAN WRIGHT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AT YOUR NEXT EVENT!!!! Peace In God,Noah
