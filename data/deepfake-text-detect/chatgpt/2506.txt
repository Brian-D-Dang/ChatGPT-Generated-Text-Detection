In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing for or against either as this isn't a debate forum but can anyone give me an example of where polygamy has been usedexisted? I remember reading somewhere, perhaps Cracked?, about how there were several British colonies (or maybe states) that allowed women to have more than one husband at any given time, and I was wondering if this is true.
