Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: one for each participant as a gesture of appreciation, because that's what we do around here:) You're not wrong about the content being decent; however, your tone and attitude is kind of shitty in most of these comments.
