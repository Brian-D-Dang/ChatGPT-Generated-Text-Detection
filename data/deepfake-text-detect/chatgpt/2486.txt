There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is that you can't buy votes through money (or favors) but there are ways around it like "free" medical services paid by the government - not as easily defined as cash payment so more difficult to enforce.) The idea behind laws against bribingpaying people that have special access and influence isn't about stopping simple bribery attempts because those almost never happen in our political system anyway; its mostly intended to prevent corruption where some politician might be willing to do things they wouldn't otherwise if being bought off...usually by lobbyists who want specific legislation passed etc.
