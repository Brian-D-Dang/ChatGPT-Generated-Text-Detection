I have had friendships with various males, and only one of them has not tried to at one point in time, make it sexual. This was not a big deal because I still enjoyed spending quality time with him as friends (and he did the same). However we are both adults that enjoy each other's company without sex being on our minds all day long! If you don't like people trying things out sexually when they're drunk then drink less or find another group who doesn't act this way?
