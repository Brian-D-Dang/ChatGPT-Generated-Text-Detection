I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with you, and points out that forks are a tool used by humans to obtain food, and that they also keep food from getting on your shirt, and that they're good for eating, and that forks make food go down easier, and that if you didn't have a fork you'd probably starve to death, or at least would have to eat your food with your hands, and that they're a better way to eat than using your hands, and that some people even like using forks to eat with, and that forks have been used by humanity for thousands of years and are a fine invention and you're an idiot if you don't like forks, then that person has the right to say that to you, and you have the right to respond to it. And if you said, "Forks are a blight upon society," and they said to you "You're wrong," and you said, "You're wrong because you're an idiot who doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about," then you were being an asshole. However, if you said, "Forks are a blight upon society," and they said, "You're wrong because forks are a blight upon society," then you are both correct. In fact, I think this is a good metaphor for a lot of the things we debate here.

And this is important because...? Posted by: Trin September 07, 2007 at 02:12 PM Just curious, Matt, how would you feel if, after you had made your argument that forks are a blight upon society, someone came up to you and said, "You're wrong because you're an idiot who doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about"? Posted by: J. C. Whitehead September 07, 2007 at 02:12 PM If someone said, "Forks are a blight upon society," and I thought that was stupid, then I'd probably ignore them, or respond in kind. If someone said, "Forks are a blight upon society," and I thought they were wrong, then I'd say that I thought they were wrong. I'm not sure what the "you're an idiot if you don't like forks" thing is supposed to mean. I just thought of a better metaphor. Let's say we have a big party, and we get our friends to come over and we all sit around and have fun and talk, and at the end of the night someone says, "Let's not talk about religion and politics, because that always causes problems." Now, let's say someone comes along and says, "I don't like religion, so I'm not going to talk about it at all." Let's also say someone comes along and says, "I don't like religion, so I'm not going to talk about it, but I will defend anyone who wants to talk about it." Let's also say someone comes along and says, "I like religion, but it can be a dangerous subject, so I'm not going to talk about it, and I'm not going to defend anyone who wants to talk about it." In the last case, I would think that was a reasonable position to take. Matt, you realize that your metaphor is flawed, right? If you take the absolute position that "forks are a blight upon society" then it's actually impossible for you to be wrong. There's no possible way to be right about a statement that's so broad. Your metaphor would be a lot better if the absolute position was "forks are good." But that's not the absolute position. The absolute position is that "forks are good," and the argument that "forks are bad" is what's wrong. So... let's say you say, "Forks are a blight upon society." And someone says, "No, forks are good." And then you say
