I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry people online make it out to be. Everyone has a right to practice their religion and beliefs, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.
