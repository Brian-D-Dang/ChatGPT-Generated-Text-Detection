So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training It's certainly true that volunteer firefighters form an integral part of many communities' firefighting capabilities. While it may seem surprising that volunteers are relied upon to help keep people safe from fires, there are a number of reasons why this is the case. First of all, in many smaller communities, there simply aren't enough full-time firefighters to staff every station or respond to every incident. Volunteer firefighters are often called upon to fill in the gaps. Secondly, volunteer firefighters are typically well-trained and well-prepared for their role. Many have undergone extensive training and certification procedures in order to be qualified to fight fires and respond to other types of emergencies. They are also often deeply committed to their community and take pride in their work. Overall, while relying on volunteers to help fight fires may not be a perfect solution, it is often an effective one. Many communities have successfully relied on volunteer firefighters for many years, and these brave men and women have helped to save countless lives and properties over the years.
