I'm referring to this news story about the incident at the community pool in McKinney TX. You can reference it here, the video is down the page and is approximately 9 minutes long. I think that it is a good example of both social dynamics and communication that need to be addressed in the training of LEO and firefighterEMT. There's a lot to be said for communicating clearly. There's also a lot to be said for being courteous to other people, even those who are disrespectful to you. I don't think that the community pool police or the police officer could have handled this situation any better. 1. There's a lot of conflicting information in the video and the articles I've read about this incident. 2. There's not a whole lot of physical evidence on the video. The lack of this physical evidence makes it difficult for me to say who did what first. 3. The narrative presented is often unreliable. So the way I see it is that there are three people who are at fault for this incident, none of whom are wearing a uniform. 1. The unidentified girl who disrespected the community pool police officer. 2. The unidentified girl who went to the car and grabbed her phone to record the incident. 3. The unidentified boy who struck the police officer. One of the problems with this incident is the lack of clear communication and the lack of tact. 1. "Put your phone away. You're not going to record this." 2. "Stand down until you've calmed down." 3. "Stand up. Arms behind your back." 4. "I'm going to cuff your hands behind your back. Do not attempt to resist." 5. "You're under arrest." 6. "Take a deep breath and calm down." 1. "You are under arrest for assaulting a police officer." 2. "I'm going to cuff your hands behind your back. Do not attempt to resist." 3. "Put your phone down." 4. "I'm going to cuff your hands behind your back." 5. "Take a deep breath and calm down." 6. "You are under arrest for assaulting a police officer." If the police officer had done this in a non-emergency situation, then there would be no issue. There would be no physical evidence of the assault on the officer, so there would be no charges, and no one would be upset. There is a video of a police officer cuffing a young woman and then the young woman goes over to her boyfriend and slaps him upside the head. The officer then asks the young woman to put her hands behind her back and the young woman resists. He then cuffs her hands behind her back, and her boyfriend starts punching the officer, and the officer then takes his baton and strikes the young man in the back. The young woman in this video was also arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer. I'm not a fan of the video, but if the police officer had been able to communicate clearly and concisely, then it would have gone down much differently. On the other hand, if the police officer had struck the young man in the face, or shot him, or killed him, then the young woman wouldn't be the one who gets charged with assaulting a police officer. I don't think that the community pool police officer did anything wrong, but I think that he could have handled the situation better. I think that the police officer should have communicated clearly and concisely, and I think that he should have immediately arrested the young man who struck him, and then he should have taken the young woman into custody as well. I think that if the community pool police officer had taken the young man and the young woman into custody at the same time, then the young man would have stopped hitting the police officer when he was ordered to do so. I think that the young man would have had a better understanding of the situation if the police officer had told him to put his hands behind his back, and then took him into custody. I don't think that the police officer should have struck the young man in the back, or that he should have told the young woman to put her hands behind her back. I think that he could have done that after the young man was in custody. I think that the young woman and the young man could have been arrested, and charged with resisting arrest, for their behavior prior to the police officer cuffing the young woman. I think that if the police officer had been able to communicate clearly and concisely, then none
