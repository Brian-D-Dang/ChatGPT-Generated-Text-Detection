First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are only available to humans because the humans have chosen them! I'm not sure if they're worth cloning now, but rather than worry about domesticated Pit Bulls or other animals being able say "Hello" to their new owner (or even better yet, their owners!).
