Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as news, it would be less egregious. I myself am not subscribed to buzzfeed because why even bother with having clickbait on your website?
