Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I think this is nonsense; it's just a different way for the gray areas between redblue (reddish brown) yellow-orange (greeny yellow), etc., which we already have names with every day language anyway! If you're looking at color wavelengths as "colors" in themselves - well then they'd actually be called hues... although even there many people would call them 'tones' instead:)
