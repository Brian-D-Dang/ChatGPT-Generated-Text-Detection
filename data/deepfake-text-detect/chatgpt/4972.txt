Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the rules of the law, such blatant lying on behalf of government officials will result in disqualification from serving as a federal official and punishment for political purposes if it happens twice over 20 times, with possible arrest warrants issued by any federal court upon conviction. If convicted, the penalty includes a fine or imprisonment. Other than this, it does not appear that there are any crimes committed against federal officers who commit perjury, corruption offenses punishable under the law even when they fail to disclose information required for prosecution due to their employment status, or willfully ignore official documents like the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting System or FBI's Uniform Crime Report system. In fact, there were several instances where federal employees failed to report misconduct resulting from wrongdoing. The largest scandal involving these violations occurred during the Obama administration, when a CIA agent was accused of submitting false testimony about his involvement in an assassination attempt that prompted federal authorities investigating the assassination plotters to seize his assets. The American Civil Liberties Union also noted that federal investigators could face civil penalties under US law for leaking information about illegal activities, but they did not find evidence of wrongdoing until January 2015, after FBI agents seized documents related to the attempted assassination conspiracy case against Omar Mateen (pictured above). In addition to the criminal charges, federal defendants have been prosecuted multiple times before the courts including conspiracy convictions stemming from the 1998 murder of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who murdered 12 people. This has led to numerous lawsuits alleging federal prosecutors misused their authority to double standards regarding crimes committed while denying accountability to federal law enforcement agencies involved. In fact, the FBI received many requests from international organizations seeking help identifying illegal activities conducted abroad associated with the Afghan Taliban terrorist group. Federal prosecutors operate within the meritless confines of the law and must be held accountable according to federal statutes applicable to them. Federal officials should be held accountable whenever they violate the law based solely because they believed they had done so inadvertently rather than intentionally.
