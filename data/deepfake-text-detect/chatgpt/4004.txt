I mean all jobs, such as police officers, military personnel, CIA operatives, security clearance applications, teachers, lawyers, and doctors. Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if you have a criminal record or not. Thank you! Do you know if there is any particular reason why some states might require this? I'm in Texas but my parents are from Ohio so they said that when I was born (they're 61) it doesn't matter where I live. But that's what I've heard about everything.
