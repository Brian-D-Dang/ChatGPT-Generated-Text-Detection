I think the real reason people punish others for transgressions is not so much to discourage the behavior, but rather to channel humanity's inherently predatory nature in a way that's more acceptable. If man wants to be civilized and refrain from being predators then he needs rules to discourage and guide his natural inclinations toward predation. One such rule for almost all cultures has been: Don't eat your friends! This means that we must recognize that human beings are by nature strongly inclined to treat each other as prey, and this tendency will grow stronger if it remains unchecked, especially in large groups of strangers. This "natural inclination" (which I prefer calling a psychological predisposition) is intensified when there is no recourse for punishing or correcting wrongdoers, because only in these circumstances do they feel free to act with impunity. The use of punishment is therefore an effort to re-establish some semblance of civilization, however flawed. It may seem paradoxical that humans need laws for their own survival; I believe at least part of our propensity towards civilizing ourselves comes out of fear of wild animals. It isn't some kind of strange dog-eat-dog society that would never last long, it's just that most civilizations don't survive past about 10 generations before turning into something completely different - say, Egypt becomes Rome... unless one can create a new government which doesn't look like everything else around them. But even there corruption tends to set in pretty quickly until they find themselves invaded again or start experiencing earthquakes every day while all the pyramid buildings collapse on top of you. In fact, sometimes the same thing happens twice within a few hundred years... So i think we're stuck with governments and punishments, although how well they actually work over time seems to vary depending on who is doing the punishing too. One could make the case that strict social control via the law was necessary to stave off anarchy and reduce violence between individuals due to selfishness and personal gain. Although, we have seen violent situations arise where there is limited enforcement of certain aspects of law...primarily drugs and prostitution, but also more recently gamblinglottery and online gaming. These forms of lawlessness tend to exist in times without sufficient otherwise coping mechanisms for safety and protection. As in riots, etc. From my perspective, difficult questions concerning individual rights would probably come down to whether man should obey God as written - the general public opinion, or break away to pursue whatever life decisions one pleases? And what exactly does 'God' mean anyway, in terms of the Bible? My first answer would be that breaking away from God would lead to chaos since divinely appointed sinfulness would bind us together as Adam Eve did originally through disobedience. However, if we had gone back to Eden instead of allowing Satan's influence to corrupt it all those many millennia ago, perhaps things wouldn't have turned out quite as badly as they did... But let me get back to thread topic here... Since apparently God hasn't made up his mind yet either, and He probably won't have definite answers ready for quite awhile considering His infinite wisdom, shouldn't we still take advantage of the knowledge we already possess regarding what works best for folks today? We know people respond better to punishment than rewards. Society could benefit greatly from more harsh penalties for wrongdoing. In addition, less fortunate members of society might actually appreciate having their lives saved after being beaten to death for stealing bread or water. Alligators love eating people but rarely lay eggs because raising offspring requires great care and expense and often involves sacrificing oneself!!! To put a slight logic twist to my thoughts... A person lacking food to eat typically eats dirt or grass in order to stay alive. Would this represent true charity? No. Why? Because someone underfed might end up growing very sick and eventually die within days or weeks of ingesting fecesgrass, whereas if given proper nourishment, he'd likely live longer - possibly indefinitely. Now consider the fact that an adult woman giving birth once consumed approximately 800 calories per day! Sounds extreme, but imagine trying to conceive child 1 while fed little more than 400 calories daily while working fulltime outside. Examine the whole picture! Also, studies show that 70 or higher of prison inmates are illiterate prior to entering jail. Imagine if we removed guns from regular citizens and provided prisoners with cell phones and Internet access inside prisons. How effective would that be? Especially if education were included among the services offered? Therein lies another lesson to learn: A 50 computer monitor coupled with good English lessons might help instill respect and responsibility in kids previously living on cinderblocks and cardboard boxes on street corners while getting high on weed and booze. Kids whose mothers worked double shifts taking home minimum wage weren't able to provide basic necessities and needed government welfare benefits to keep body and soul alive in spite of both parents pleading poverty, thus creating a cycle of poverty leading young adults into drug addiction, crime, gangs, gang wars, murder. Let's face facts boys and girls. People simply cannot cope successfully facing adversity, volunteering, using words "spcofTookies like senceprid 5Richard'sTheodore We inviteto conferd
