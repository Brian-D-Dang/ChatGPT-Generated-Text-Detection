Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that I have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. However, opositing people's opinions on gaming is pretty hurtful when you only got around to playing it for a few hours and then "loved" it, and now are saying it was so badflat out crap that they can't play any more. But this way of viewing things even if its not your personal favorite is hilarious. Dont get me wrong i love all forms of games, but i dont think its worth putting up with this bullshit from some random n00b
