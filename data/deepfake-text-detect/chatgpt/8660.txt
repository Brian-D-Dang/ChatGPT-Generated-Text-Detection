People talk about'natural' or'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like "free speech" or "free association" are'inalienable','natural', or'God-given', how come so many people don't have the same idea of what 'natural' is? Reader's Question: I'll certainly vote for this. I'm concerned that this might even lead to countries such as North Korea, Libya and Iran losing their sovereignty over the globe. However, in South Africa we already have a strong relationship with China, Russia, India etc - and today I wonder if that will change because they are also developing nuclear weapons capable of hitting us directly within our borders. This is a chance to express our thanks in North Korea in front of South Koreans. The question would only be posed whether this region will become an "honoured area." Mark
