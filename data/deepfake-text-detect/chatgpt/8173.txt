As a gay man, I can be extremely wary of other people for my own protection. I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate something "different." The trick in dealing with this condition (I don't want someone else's attitude towards me affecting how much fun or love they have) seems not only impossible but also unfair: we're all born into it and there doesn't seem like any real way out besides finding some clever new type difference between us so everyone won' t freak because one group isn'nt being discriminated against anymore! In short; what do you call those who are afraid - consciously aware at least -of their fear? And when does concern about negative attitudes become paranoia if unattended by these others concerns?
