There are a few counter-arguments that can be made in response to this opinion: 1. Bernie Sanders has already come very close to winning the nomination in the past. In 2016, he won 23 primaries and caucuses and garnered over 13 million votes. While he ultimately lost the nomination to Hillary Clinton, he demonstrated a significant amount of support and momentum in the party. It would be premature to discount his chances entirely this time around. 2. Many political analysts and pundits have noted that Bernie Sanders has actually had a positive impact on the Democratic Party, even if he never becomes president. His progressive policies and passionate commitment to social justice have pushed the party to embrace policies like Medicare for All and a 15 minimum wage. Even if he doesn't ultimately win the nomination, his influence can still be felt in the party's platform and priorities. 3. It is dangerous to assume that any candidate is inherently unelectable - especially in a political climate as unpredictable as this one. Donald Trump's victory in 2016 was a major upset that defied conventional wisdom and polling, and many factors are still at play that could determine the outcome of the 2020 election. While Sanders may face challenges, such as opposition from centrist Democrats or attacks from Republicans, it is impossible to say for certain that he can never win the presidency.
