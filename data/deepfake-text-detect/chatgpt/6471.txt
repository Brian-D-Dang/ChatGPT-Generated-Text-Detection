Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and if you're really a male then you're gay. I'm a male which means I'm 18 and I am male. I'm an Asian but I don't know what it is. I'm white. I'm born in Africa. I'm a white man. I'm not a white man. I don't think I'm a male or white man. But I'm from a family of African descent. I'm from the south. It's a pretty good community. If you need me, you can just drop by and say hello.
