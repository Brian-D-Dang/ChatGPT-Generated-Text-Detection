Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not paper but I will never forget the way a tip was always a good idea for me. I got my first job in the service industry as a waitress and I loved it. I always felt like I had a good job because of the tips. It's a shame that so many restaurants and pubs have made it so customary to leave a tip. It's a shame because it depends on the person. It's a shame that when you do get a tip you feel less like an employee and more like a customer. I understand that there are certain places where a tip is not necessary but when it becomes a common practice I feel it should be re-evaluated or at least reconsidered.
