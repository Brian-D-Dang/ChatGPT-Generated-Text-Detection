This boggles my mind. I know that some airlines are different like Southwest because they do not have assigned seats. But why don't people relax until their seating zonegroup is called? I am really tired of checking in by the time we get to our gate and searching for an open seat. People should just chill out until they see that all available zones are taken up or their own zone group assignment has been made. It's silly! This year, it was so bad at one airport where there were only two flights leaving the same day, you would expect a line around the building when everyone tries to find something, but no...everyone just walked right on through before any checked in ticket had even been scanned. What? Do you think this happens every week??? Stop being lazy! The check-in counter would be almost empty if everyone followed and waited until their flight times came up instead of running ahead to nab whatever cheap seats could possibly still be left unless my experience at O'Hare hasn't improved much since last summer (and during peak travel season). And what about those who want aislewindow seats?? Doesn't anyone care about them anymore? Even though most airports now allow these kind of tickets, many airline agents still tell me when I buy them, "We can never give away window seats." Why not? Are they already sold off or reserved for special few? Or is the fact that these seats sell quickly enough that they make more money by selling as early as possible? Yes, yes they are...they're making money off your money here! People need to realize that sometimes things aren't always going to go smoothly. Sometimes those lines will end up snaking well into baggage claim and turn into a mob scene with dozens of irate passengers pushing their way onto planes while standing behind other waiting travelers. Then again, how often does that happen nowadays compared to years past? Those days may be coming back soon if recent incidents keep happening. So just stop beating yourself over the head trying to avoid getting stuck somewhere...be patient and let someone else take control of the situation. If nothing else, maybe then you'll actually enjoy travelling once in awhile without all the drama involved. He continues: "And finally, please remember that flying isn't free; an airfare costs hundreds of dollars each time, which means there are also plenty of nonprofessional travellers who pay top dollar each trip, especially considering the uncertainty with the economy. You owe it to yourselves to act professionally and stay calm, follow rules at the checkpoint and ensure security personnel understand your surroundings - and best of luck to us all." For all the hubbub surrounding TSA body scanners and patdowns, nobody seems to notice the obvious side effect of these procedures namely, their ability to degrade human dignity. For example, imagine being forced to strip naked and stand in front of strangers even male ones for minutes, simply because federal officials say it makes everybody safer. That might seem reasonable inside Guantanamo Bay but doesn't sound quite as plausible anywhere else.

Source (CNN) - An American woman had her breasts groped by a female immigration officer at Heathrow Airport after she complained about the conduct of another official participating in a pat down search. A British passenger said Americans cannot fully appreciate that women feel uncomfortable having private parts touched by members of the opposite sex. Visiting Los Angles resident Kim Paffenroth, 56, told MSNBC: 'She [the agent] went straight for my boobs, plopped herself down on them and tried to pull off my bra.' She added: 'It wasn't sexual harassment, really... It didn't bother me too much because he seemed so bored. There was nothing overtly inappropriate. There was nothing threatening.'
