I am a 23 year old male Indian American male. I have never held hands with a girl, been kissed, or obviously had sex. I have never even asked someone out. I have had crushes on people, but never acted upon them. That's totally okay! Everyone has their own timeline when it comes to relationships and intimacy. Don't feel like you have to rush into anything if you're not ready yet. It can be intimidating to take the first step and ask someone out or even just start talking to someone that you like, but there are plenty of ways to practice talking to people and getting more comfortable with those kinds of situations. You could start by getting to know the person better through conversations, then gradually work up to things like holding hands or kissing. It may take some time and effort, but in the end it'll be worth it when you find someone who appreciates you for who you are and makes you feel confident about your relationship with them.
