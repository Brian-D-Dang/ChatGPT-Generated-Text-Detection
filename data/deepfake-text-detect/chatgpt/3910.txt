This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) appears to be influenced by the politics and other social trends in modern society; particularly in the United States. I think that it is time we stopped treating Christianity like some anti-social, backward religion. It should not be seen with such prejudice because of its history in America - but because if it isn't there now, then what will happen once our nation's values change? What would become of Christianity then? Will everyone who wants one start worshipping at a mosque or temple instead of having their own Christian church service? There are many reasons for this. For example: In America (and Britain too), Christians make up a good portion of the population. If you want your kids to be around people they can identify with, then you need to create something like their church. And it wouldn't work out well if you did choose the wrong place for them to go to school or church. There aren't very many places for children to worship these days, especially non-religious or atheist ones. You'd find most churches designed for religious activities usually have a few hundred members or less. Most churches won't even allow atheists in. As religions change over time, so does how much acceptance those different faiths receive from people outside their groups. So things like a "polytheistic" religion or any religion that doesn't require a membership fee tends to attract more opposition than an organization whose purpose is to provide services exclusively for Christians. Many of us don't feel comfortable associating with lots of people we don't know. We all love to be alone! We also hate being confronted with the crazies who attendorganized religion meetings. So why do we have to get involved in it? The answer to this question lies within the reason I said above. Society has changed very significantly since the founding fathers started thinking about religion. People used to think that religion was a private matter between God and his chosen people - only he knew what was right and wrong, and thus needed no input from anyone else. That mentality has been gone through several phases during which the role of government expanded dramatically on almost every aspect of life. Today, however, most Americans still believe in divine intervention when it comes to everything from weather patterns to world events. This means that sometimes "church" may not even exist anymore. All that remains is a public gathering where believers gather to pray, sing songs and scream at each other while someone holds the Bible aloft and the pastor gives sermons extolling the virtues of Jesus Christ. So just because Christians are becoming fewer and fewer in number, shouldn't we stop making fun of them? Yes, and here is my reasoning behind this statement: Whenever you take away something that makes people happy, there will always be somebody who feels jealous. When American citizens were free to practice whatever religion they wanted to back in 1776 (or perhaps earlier), everybody felt obliged to respect others' beliefs. But eventually this attitude began changing. Nobody cares about your personal beliefs anymore. Religion became a distraction to people's lives and they didn't bother to give it another thought until years later after they faced severe economic problems and had nothing left to lose. Nowadays, nobody goes to church unless forced into it by law or another emergency situation. And obviously even if they went to Church, they might not agree with those things preached every Sunday morning. They could argue that all religions are equal in being harmful to humankind and that it doesn't really matter whether you pray or don't pray. Or maybe they'll mention how important being politically correct has become and compare the whole thing to today's art scene. Either way, the same applies to Christianity. It seems strange that we still care so much about yours. Why would we care about Jesus' opinion on homosexuality anyway, if we don't believe in him? Does he actually matter to anybody except us?!
