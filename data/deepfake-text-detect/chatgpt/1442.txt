Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as possible. My question is this: Do you have any tips on how to get started? Any good books or websites that can help me out with anything like these topics? Or point us towards some pros and cons for starting them early (i'm not talking about getting your finances together but just learning why it's so worthwhile)? The only reason I know my boyfriends parents didn't do much when he got his tax return (a couple grand) because they never taught him how to use Excel etc
