I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. In a perfect world, I would want a president who would be able to do all of the following: 1. Support the LGBT community 2. Promote safe and accessible birth control 3. Lower the unemployment rate 4. Decrease the deficit 5. Strengthen our educational system 6. Encourage scientific research 7. Work to heal the racial divide 8. Support our troops I find it incredibly difficult to even believe that any candidate would have the ability to be able to do all of the above. I certainly wouldn't vote for someone who is a staunch conservative, because they don't support my beliefs or the well being of this country in the ways I've mentioned. But I would never vote for someone who was a Democrat, because I feel like we'd lose so many of the freedoms that we have as Americans. I'm really not sure what to do. I've never been so incredibly disillusioned by a political party before. So, to all my fellow Millenials and other disillusioned voters out there, what do you think? Should I vote for someone who supports my views, or someone who supports America? chelsy, I think you should vote for someone who supports your views. It's not really in the best interest of the country to vote for someone who supports America, because you have no idea what your views are. Voting for someone who supports your views means you're voting for someone who actually represents you, which is better than voting for someone who represents an abstract idea like "America." The other thing I'd like to say is that if you don't believe in God, then I don't see how the GOP's stances on social issues are appalling to you. The GOP is the party of Jesus, and the party of Jesus is the party of God. If you don't believe in God, then I don't see why you should care about the social issues the GOP supports. I don't care about the social issues the GOP supports either, but that's because I believe in God, and the GOP is the party of God. I also believe that a woman's place is in the home, but that's because I believe in God, and the GOP is the party of God. If you're a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God, then you're an unemployed liberal feminist, and you're part of the problem.
