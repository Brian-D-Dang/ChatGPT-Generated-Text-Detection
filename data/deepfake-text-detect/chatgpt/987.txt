It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math The College Board is considering removing trigonometry from the SAT, saying it is unnecessary for students to learn and is not used for admissions purposes. The College Board announced the decision in a letter to the College Board, saying that it was reviewing its "calculation process" and would "make a final decision in the coming months." It said it was also seeking an explanation from the College Board as to why trigonometry is being included in the math section of the SAT. Trigonometry, a branch of mathematics, involves finding the value of a line segment using trigonometry. This involves finding the value of a line segment in the form of two points on a graph. The tests require a student to know trigonometry to answer some questions. Most colleges do not require students to take a trigonometry course.
