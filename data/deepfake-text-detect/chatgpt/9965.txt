Now in the spirit of fairness - I believe this to be true for all governments, but in this case I'll touch upon the U.S. gov. First of all [Lusatania] The U.S. government is supposed to represent the will of the people. This means that it should be responsive to the needs and desires of its citizens. The Constitution and Bill of Rights serve as the foundation for how the government should operate, and the laws of the land are passed by elected officials who are directly accountable to the American public. In addition, the government has an obligation to uphold the principles of justice, equality, and fairness. It must also ensure that all citizens have access to basic rights, such as freedom of speech and religious liberty. Finally, the government must protect its citizens from harm and ensure their safety.
