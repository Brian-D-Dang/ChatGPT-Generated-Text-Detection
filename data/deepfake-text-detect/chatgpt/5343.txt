I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with that statement, then shut up about it until you're finished talking about it for the next three hours or so - you'll hear nothing back from them unless they demand to know why you've listened intently enough. If you suggest that there may be more grounds than meets the eye (which doesn't happen often), you're presenting yourself as being an angry bigot who wants to hate.
