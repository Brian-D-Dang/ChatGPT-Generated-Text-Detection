I think the real reason people punish others for transgressions is not so much to discourage the behavior, but rather to channel humanity's inherently predatory nature in a way that's more socially acceptable. Punishment serves two primary purposes: deterrence and retribution. Deterrence aims to prevent others from committing similar transgressions by making an example out of the wrongdoer. Retribution serves as a form of justice, which aims to satisfy a sense of moral or ethical balance by making the wrongdoer suffer in some way. However, punishment doesn't necessarily discourage bad behavior completely. People still engage in transgressions despite potential consequences, indicating that other factors such as the potential gain or perceived likelihood of being caught and punished may also play a role in making decisions. Ultimately, punishment is a complex topic with various psychological, social, and cultural factors at play. While it may not eliminate all negative behavior, it can still serve a useful purpose in maintaining social order and providing a sense of justice.
