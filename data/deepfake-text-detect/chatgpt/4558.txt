Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: "how does it come about that this right is inherent?" What makes this right a natural or God given one? It's not because we have no other rights. We do! In fact, many (not all) people in England are disarmed under their own laws and still live free from tyranny. We're armed here but some would say we're less than safe... I don't think so - our police officers seem rather more competent that those in countries with handgun bans as well as far fewer murders per capita. Even if they weren't one might argue there aren't any handguns around anyway. How have your states handled the question of whether private citizens should be allowed to carry concealed weapons? In Texas, for example, where I am, that decision has been delegated to local law enforcement officials who act on behalf of voters to decide what kind of guns to allow them to keep in their homes andor businesses. The assumption being made by most citizens was that only criminals need guns so everyone else can get along just fine without having access. But lo and behold, when violent crime started going up in earnest after 911 particularly homicides Texans realized they'd better give themselves an option to defend against home invaders. Some of us now ask ourselves why we didn't realize that before then. Most seemed willing to put up with inconvenience and cost for public service protection until someone actually got killed or injured before deciding to make the change. Once it became clear that something needed to be done, it took time to reach consensus among gun owners and non-gun owner alike because opinions ran both ways. Today in Texas, I'm glad to see open carrying again since as long as it stays legal, at least the good guys will know which ones outnumber them (and vice versa). And yes, the baddies may fear confrontation even though we'll never completely eliminate them; however, knowing they fear me helps serve notice that I won't tolerate criminal behavior. Put another way, just like every other right listed above, the first step towards losing a constitutional right is ignoring its existence. You go through life thinking everything that happens to you must be due solely to chance, luck, fate, whatever, yet when the government arbitrarily takes away your constitutionally guaranteed liberty, suddenly things happen because 'they' want 'them'. That isn't justice, it's tyranny, pure and simple, plain and simple. The 2nd Amendment protects our unalienable right to self defense...period. As long as money talks, meaning enough people care about keeping their money from becoming fiat currency - like paper dollars or greenbacks - then the right to purchase firearms will remain intact. However, once governments become able to control the issuance of money with the stroke of a pen, remember Osama bin Laden, then the 2nd amendment becomes null void. Case in point: FDR did exactly that during WW2, and he later admitted it. If our Founders hadn't protected us from such a move, imagine how much worse off we'd be today. Right now, our money supply is controlled via banks instead of Congress and the Federal Reserve Board; hence, Congress is the authority responsible ultimately protecting the individual citizenry from government abuse. Without that check, the Executive branch has unlimited power. This includes the President and his Presidential Powers, etc. I know this is late in coming, but I hope others will respond to my comment just because I wanted to clarify what I meant by inheriting this right, what causes it, and how freedom works in society. My intention had nothing to do with ownership issues or shoulds of any type. Quote:A lot of folks associate the 2nd Amendment Protection with owning fire arms, thus denying anyone else's ability "to take away their property." Wasn't the founding fathers determined never to permit legislative infringement on the Second Amendment Rights? They were explicit in including these words:"the right of the People to keep Arms shall NOT BE INFRINGED" (emphasis mine.) I refer to the following quotes regarding the fully ratified Bill Of Rights and Regulations enacted pursuant thereto, pertaining specifically to the Second Amendment stating:"Sec. 8A. RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLEvery person in Maryland whose name remains enrolled upon the books of electors shall be deemed to have exercised the elective franchise"Sec. 72B. JURISDICTION OVER FELONS - Criminal offenders convicted within the State of Maryland; No civil disabilities imposed upon felons; Disability removed when satisfied by full payment of fine or restitution." Sec. 92E.
