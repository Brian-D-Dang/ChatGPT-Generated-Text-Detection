Countries need children in order to sustain themselves, without a younger generation the country will not advance and will not be able to sustain itself. Elderly will not be able to work because they can't produce enough offspring for their own needs. This means that each member of society must have 2-3 youngsters under 18 years old at all times or else you are automatically considered an outcast or a traitor and your life is over before it begins (as seen with North Korea). Unless Christians are willing to take responsibility for raising up young people as their God has called them too; then there will never be any new blood entering into this world until Jesus comes back again.. Not because we refuse to raise these kids but rather it will only be done through our prayers and efforts while keeping our eyes on Christ. The Lord tells us "I would have gathered together new things from him...but he said I am getting old already, so here are my last days (Revelation 21:5) " So even though He says 'new things' He still feels like He is dying? If Israel believed their promises were going to come true what do you think he was saying? That no matter when he arrives there wouldn't be anything new coming in his time? You see if these promises didn't happen; how could anyone believe something other than what happened when they first came about? How does someone know what did indeed occur unless it was reported by eyewitnesses? When Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 9:24 "Therefore neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love."He clearly understood that these explanations had occurred before his arrival. In fact he knew the Old Testament word for heart which was ephatesai meaning "thats right!" Couldn't he easily imagine them happening again after he arrived? Do you really want to stand before God one day and say "what?! We don't teach truth anymore? Why wasn't John checking everything we were doing?? Darnit! What kind of leaders are we because we aren't trustworthy? And where are our sheep that follow us closely along side of Him? They weren't close behind Him either....LOL It makes me sick to my stomach thinking about such a thing!! But what is worse is that if they were following closely beside of Him they would be more likely to test His ways and find the way. So if they weren't around Him to witness them they may just end up adopting false doctrine instead. The easiest answer to why I believe this is because I hear it time and time again. These answers usually revolve around the concept that we are living today in a different culture due to growing technology and communication, and therefore its harder to keep everyone connected. For example many believe that being in touch via social media has taken away some form of face-to-face interaction, therefore leading to less conversations between those who live far apart from eachother. Which might sound valid but actually doesn't hold much water whatsoever; especially considering this statement made by Mark Driscoll: "In higher education, when students go to class-they sit in seats 300 yards across from another student sitting 3000 miles across,"Driscoll told listeners during an interview on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition Sunday program. (source) While I certainly agree that distance shouldn't prevent one person from seeing another person but let's look at this logically. Back in Biblical Times, Abraham lived 750 miles south of Sodom. Lot lived 600 miles north of Sodom. Yet in spite of the distance, both men kept talking to god regularly. Moreover, several people from the midwest talked daily to Moses as well. Now compare that number to how often people talk to others nowdays. As soon as we walk outside, within minutes our phone rings whether its a friend or relative asking how school went, sports score, etc. Our phones are located in almost every room of most homes yet we seldom ever pick up the receiver. People are constantly texting friends, family members, strangers, coworkers, and even pets. Emails fly all across the globe and news gets transmitted instantaneously throughout the entire kingdom via tv stations. Are we truly missing out on valuable fellowship by having so little contact with our fellow man? Or should we believe that in ancient Egypt and modern America we are able to connect everyday as Appleseed and Daniel predicted? The reality is that we live in this technological age so therefore its logical to assume that we CANNOT communicate nearly anywhere at anytime as in biblical times. There have been attempts to send messages to Mars using satellite radio (google it), however nowhere near successfully. Just because we cant physically reach eachother doesn't mean that we cannot spiritually approach other people. Its impossible not to interact with humans at least once per hour and probably longer if you count the amount of time spent listening. Its also worth mentioning that Daniel 7 talks about Jerusalem having two kinds of interactions. With the spiritual component and the secular part.
