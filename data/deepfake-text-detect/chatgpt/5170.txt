I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. In other words, the whole thing is the result of the Russia issue being handled by the US government over fears about Russia's involvement in the Ukraine crisis from the beginning - but it was the Russians who absolutely stole the war advantage from America before Russia invaded Ukraine. And the Ukraine situation has been mired in political discord for years now because the Russians lied about what happened there, which they probably did not want Americans knowing anything about!
