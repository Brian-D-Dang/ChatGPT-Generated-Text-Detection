While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes Bernie Sanders is a great guy, but he's not the only one. A number of people agree with me on the fact that he's not the right person for the job. And this goes for both parties. When it comes to choosing a party candidate, I think it's very important to consider the political experience and temperament of the individual. This is not to say that I think Warren is a bad guy. He's just not the right guy to lead the country. I think Romney is a rather good guy. He's a better candidate because he knows how to win. But I think Bernie Sanders has some tough times ahead of him.
