There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring on a student, by his or her teachers as their competent colleague-instructor, of some particular gift that he had acquired. In its modern context it can be seen more opportunistically - especially at private fee paying establishments where there are many parents who see value not only in investing large sums into educational pursuits but also want recognition for the achievement - often also involving payment - which they have invested and continue to invest in their child's education... In our case I spoke with staff from both institutions about what Dylan could achieve academically during this academic year so far. The staff were generous beyond measure in providing me information over the phone although naturally concerned because they too wanted him to do well! Although initially disappointed when informed that my son would not receive any formal certificateaward we agreed nevertheless to hold a small ceremony with just him present given he has worked very hard thus far; and also because other family members will hopefully be able to attend next term. We discussed various options including: announcing all students' achievements via school newsletter, having a special day within class timetable etc. It seemed best however simply to acknowledge completion of each stage individually whilst presenting certificates every half way point through the course ie. once upon admission then again after 6 months and finally 1 yr.. Although Dylan did participate in ceremonial events such as assemblies throughout previous years I felt strongly that whatever happened this year should be solely down to himself despite being aware how much self esteem is affected by external markers of success. Therefore rather than seek help from outside sources I took time off work myself to research ways of doing things without recourse to anything external...this involved talking directly to other parents whose young person (s) might benefit from similar assistance eg local college tutors etc.....The main key ingredient here though was believing firmly..and knowing full well......that 'YOU CAN SHOW YOURSELF HAPPY AND FREE WITHOUT EXTERNAL STIMULATION!!!!!!!...."I spent considerable amounts of my own personal money buying items needed for the event....including name badges; party hats; balloons etc.......Then came finding suitable music, guidance regarding speeches readings plus session timings; sourcing poems using magic words relevant to the subject matter combined with appropriate illustrations depicting the theme i.e.: "Happiness" hence making up greetings cards ahead of time featuring images relating to happiness coupled with messages written inside expressing thanks e.g."Thank you Mrs R for helping us find happiness." Then decorating individual tables bearing names together with pictures representing happy times experienced previously........I ensured everything ran smoothly (with support from friends) from start to finish!!! Where required I requested extra assistance from colleagues at homework if necessary yet never compromising on quality standards..... Naturally enough no one else knew why Dylan deserved celebration apart fro ourselves therefore realized we'd need something concrete as evidence of positive outcomes achieved.........As part of preparations I Googled ideas online searching specifically under topics such as "Celebrations," "Graduations"etc., This led me to several websites offering suggestions eg:- Graduates Gifts Desk etc.; among others. These helped enormously with regards to giving focus to thoughts without further input excepting advice received from just two older uncles who happen to know little English. One uncle expressed admiration over how neatly Dylan went about managing various aspects of planning even going out onto lawn earlier today showing off his newly purchased decorations along with table setting lol.......however still unable to communicate fully verbally due mainly to language barriers!!Thus satisfied somewhat with response feedback obtained from relatives I proceeded to purchase additional items such as banners etc. Next step consisted of writing 5 x 3 inch invitations addressed to guestsfamily explaining details surrounding proposed event spelt right and use capital letters appropriately..."Dylan Thomas Smith Student Of Year 2 At School No1 May 2013..."Sent these off Monday morning requiring a reply back confirming attendance Tuesday afternoon by prior arrangement. Front door placed sign indicating reception area closed until 4 pm before normal opening hours occurred thereafter. Arrived home around 12 noon following house inspection conducted earlier. E.mailed invitation recipients advising them shortly beforehand of arrangements planned for later same evening. Naturally everyone responded positively save those currently residing abroad whom obviously couldn't join. Invitations distributed accordingly between 12noon onwards........Arrived home approx 1130pm ready to take break and get organised for big night. Meantime arrived delivery driver delivering mobile number plates therefore knowing recipient numbers to add to mobile phones for note taking purposes. Spent last hour picking flowers plants available from garden centre nearby now needing fruit platter for fruits kindly donated by neighbour!
