This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this will be a different story. Just curious - what is the best way to do it now? I was thinking that maybe it would look better and more natural, like the camionette of old (can't imagine it's any different than current models) then all you need is a few things that are much less obvious like the camera angle etc.. That being said, I still think the camionettes could work well, since they don't have much going for them.
