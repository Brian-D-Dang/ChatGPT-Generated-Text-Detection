I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg . disgust, nausea) - not just anything that has been deemed 'triggering'. "And what is it about gender identity politics that leads you to believe they are connected?" Do you mean: As in why do we have such strong opinions on both topics? Because they're two sides of the same coin; one side trying to erase the other. They affect each other because of their lack of equality and justice for all people regardless of race, sex or sexuality. And often overlap with social issues like racism, sexism etc.. The moment someone decided to classify themselves as something else than straightcisgender was when society started treating them different. It's rather simple really. You don't need to be a good writer to understand this though, and no amount of trigger warnings will ever change that.
