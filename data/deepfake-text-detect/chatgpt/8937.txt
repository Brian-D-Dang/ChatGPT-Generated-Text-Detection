He's intelligent and wealthy and adaptable apparently. I think the majority of Gotham's problems could've solved with smart investments in social programs and industry and the police force which Bruce has been inept at. That would've never happened, since he was already doing that all along. He just didn't know how to use his time properly. Why you getting downvoted? You're not wrong, but there is no evidence to suggest that Bruce was lying about money or skillsactions to get what he wanted out of Gotham City... He simply did it because he had money. Are you implying this? There aren't any evidence? What evidence are you giving us? It seems like you don't understand why people downvote you for not providing evidence.
