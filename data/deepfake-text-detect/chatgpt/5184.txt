NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but residential rents could decrease until the city can find ways to reduce rent growth in the city center by increasing the number of rental homes available at affordable rates while allowing developers to reinvest more money into developments like apartments designed specifically for those willing to pay an apartment price tag below market rate. This is feasible because housing costs are falling faster than incomes due to stagnant wages, such as the average rate of inflation pushing upward rather than downward. This proposal eliminates rent expansion from the city's equation altogether; it does not eliminate competition between buyers who want their homes priced competitively with out-of-towners or renters wanting a place near transit hubs (the cheapest places to live). It also does nothing to address the issue of excessive rents rising even if prices rise dramatically once the rental economy improves significantly after the pandemic ends - this being a relatively recent phenomenon since cities have been able vastly increased capital spending on infrastructure projects. Residential rents generally fall when economic activity returns after COVID restrictions expire, so any sales tax increase increases will only help stabilize prices further along these lines. Rent regulation, meanwhile, isn't much different compared to what is proposed here except for the direct impact on affordability across the board. This raises concerns about whether the city remains vulnerable toward pricing trends going forward given the city's reliance on industry revenues through a high demand environment following the pandemic's final weeks earlier this year. The proposal is important enough that City Council member John Hennessy sent an email expressing support for it April 9 in response to Mayor Jared Huffman's recommendation that renters receive subsidies starting July 1 under a new program called Unlimited Realty Rebuild. Hennessy suggested prohibiting the city from adopting higher incentives similar to the existing rental assistance programs; he said such actions might limit future growth before the programs kick in next year without jeopardizing tenants' ability to stay in their homes long term. Hennessy also noted how the city would need city taxes to fund its programs beyond this current fiscal year unless private investors achieve stable salaries outside of rent payments during the pandemic crisis. According to Hennessy, this creates uncertainty over potential tax revenue projection. I'm open to hearing ideas on how to build better neighborhoods where residents work, live and play together despite multiple barriers to success versus contracting with individuals whose jobs are typically concentrated within downtown.
