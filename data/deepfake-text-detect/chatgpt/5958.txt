Every election year this is one of the most popular complaints against candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. "So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so and so isn't saying how." I have a different complaint. I'm tired of the policy prescriptions. Part of the problem is that politicians who know about policy are busy doing their day jobs and making policy to be implemented by people like me. (You want to know how realistic that is? Just read Michael Lewis's latest book on the financial crisis for a funny story on the difficulty of getting a policy guy to implement a policy he supports.) If the candidates actually have time to debate policy, they're busy trying to win over the undecided voters instead. Part of the problem is that, since the New Deal, government has been doing so many things that it's hard to know which ones to keep and which ones to cut. The policy prescriptions tend to be the ones that are the most politically convenient to the politicians who are making the prescriptions. Part of the problem is that nobody seems to care much about the details. I've been reading books on the 2008 financial crisis. Much of what was done to save the financial system was done by the Treasury department, and there was no shortage of things Treasury could have done. Some of them are the things the pundits and politicians and voters are complaining about now: bailing out bad bets with taxpayer money, propping up the financial system with public money. (Just because the government is bailing out the financial system doesn't mean the government is bailing out the people who invested in the financial system. Look at the real estate crash of 2008: real estate is mostly owned by the middle class, but a lot of the wealth in real estate is owned by the rich, so they didn't take a big hit. And when the government saves the big banks, it saves the investors and lenders in the big banks. The American middle class has gotten hit a lot of ways by the financial crisis, and they haven't been bailed out nearly as much as the people who could pay for it. And no, a lot of them are not in the financial sector.) In the end, the most important thing is how well the government does its job. Is the government doing enough to keep the economy growing and improving the lives of the people, or is it doing too much or too little? It's not the details of the policy prescriptions that matter; it's the policies themselves. Labels: election, financial crisis, policy, politics As I understand it, Obama had a lot of stuff on his plate before the election. Health care was his top priority, but there was also the financial meltdown, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc.
