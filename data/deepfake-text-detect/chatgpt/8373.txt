I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be considered right and wrong by most of the people in society today (or even a few years ago). So why do you make an argument against "morality" being objectiv? Have we really reached such science-free era when every other words has to have its own definition or else can no longer talk about anything intelligible without using some kind if jargon terms like moral relativism?!??!1!!!11!!elevenoneinfinity!!!!111!!!!!!!!1111
