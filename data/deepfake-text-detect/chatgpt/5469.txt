Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that I have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. Can't comment on tf2 or csgo because you dont even know shit about it yet. For me, if they change valve servers then you can play them without any lag etc... didnt like this rule but i think they need to be punished accordingly so people will stop wasting their time playing these games
