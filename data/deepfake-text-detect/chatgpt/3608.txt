I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience, it is clear that the USA is willing to use extreme measures to protect its own interests and ensure its own survival. Additionally, the USA has a large and advanced military and constantly invests in research and development of new technologies and weapons. This indicates a clear commitment to military superiority. Furthermore, the USA has a long history of military interventions and interventions in other countries, with the goal of spreading democracy and protecting human rights. While some may argue that these interventions are driven by economic or political interests, the USA's stated mission is one of moral obligation. Overall, these factors suggest that the USA is indeed the world's policeman, taking a leading role in maintaining global security and stability.
