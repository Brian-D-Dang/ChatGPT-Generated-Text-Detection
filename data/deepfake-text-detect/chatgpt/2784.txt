This is purely from anecdotal, self researched and experiential knowledge, so feel free to correct me if there are any glaring issues in my position. I believe that some of the alleged problems with feminism (and this goes for both sides) stem simply from a lack of proper communication between people who have ideas they wish to push on each other. I get frustrated when certain topics or ideas can't be debated fairly because it seems like only one side gets their voice heard while the others are shut down. There can never really be "the truth" but we should at least try our best to find common ground where possible.
