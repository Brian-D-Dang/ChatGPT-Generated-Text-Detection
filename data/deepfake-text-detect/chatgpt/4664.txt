I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a used one seems like the best bet. You'll be able to drive them for less than what you pay now for your current vehicle and they won't have any of that depreciation cost (unless they're truly old). You can also perform routine maintenance on these vehicles without having to worry about selling your car later or paying someone else to do it. Whereas if you buy new, all those costs are incurred when you sell (at least at some point) and there's no way around them. Also insurance is cheaper with older models. It would seem surprising though if insurance rates weren't lower just because you use an older car.
