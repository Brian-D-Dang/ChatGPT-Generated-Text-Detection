Before anything else, let me say that I am not, nor have ever been depressed, suicidal or abused in any way shape or form. My life so far has been a joy and every day brings more to look forward too! I just can't help but wonder if there is something I'm missing here? This seems like a serious issue for someone who seemingly thrives on social interaction (which she did with you) at least once per week - perhaps it's the dynamic of your friendship which makes her feel anxious about this situation?
