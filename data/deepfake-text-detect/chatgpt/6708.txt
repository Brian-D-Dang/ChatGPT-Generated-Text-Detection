For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system A system that allows the government to control all the components of the economy, including other components such as the information, knowledge, and communications technologies, and thus control and regulate the economic activities of the state, including government, and the economy itself.
