There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man exposing himself to women? Would that also be civil?). I'm just saying there are lots more things I would rather see you guys change than this one issue on which we agree completely with each other:)
