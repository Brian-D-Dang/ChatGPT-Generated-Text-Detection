I'm not asking anything about why we self harm - trust me I've got many answers for that. My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is "bad" and people very quickly want explanations as soon a someone mentions it, which often causes more distress than the act itself because they are trying too hard (or indeed find wrong) reasons rather then accepting them just being there in those times of need... or at least this was my experience even though some abusive relationships caused far worse consequences! Another thing you may notice if your partner doesn't actually understand something unless its negative: when heshe ask what happened today? tell him exactly everything so include things like how did work out etc., although later on explain yourself but don't stop telling stories after one bad night - let's say once per week would be enough... Or during our worst relationship days his e-mail were full with expressions such us "Well" meaning please come back home!!!!!!!!! Why can women do all these?? Their ways run against mine??? This makes no sense!, now i know much better way:) So have fun learning new stuff every day: Enjoy life together
