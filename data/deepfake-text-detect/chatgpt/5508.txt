I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. That said, we are not defending the British Empire from the threats it has faced throughout history on both sides of the Atlantic. The only thing we have control over is our ability to create conditions conducive to escalation between these countries; if someone pulls out of a war with us then it's because we refused to cooperate or retreat into the arms race. These things should never be discussed by anyone but ourselves. So no worries there: like any good neighbor who takes steps toward building an infinite peacekeeping force against each other without fear of being attacked by someone else, we also need to talk about how we can defeat this threat to ourselves - through diplomacy rather than fighting Iran. And when we try to make progress before it becomes impossible, communication channels such as the UN Security Council must open up for dialogue instead of breaking down fences and trying to prevent each country making further advances towards hegemony.
