One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? Would it be better for students and society to limit access through financial aid or other methods rather than making higher education more accessible by removing price as an impediment? Besides being condescending (the title), utangentcurve doesn't really answer your question... But yes, absolutely limiting access would help!
