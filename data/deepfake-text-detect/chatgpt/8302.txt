I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends . What is it that they are getting? My biggest question about all this: Is there a standardized methodmethodology in these taste tests between individuals and companies, or do people just "decide" what their favorite drink flavor brand name will be based on whatever opinion was set forth at some point from an ad campaign several years ago...???
