I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand that this is a bad habit and I'm trying to break it. But I'm scared to start studying because I feel like once I start, I'll never stop and I'll end up being a nerd. I'm a freshman in high school and I'm just wondering if you have any advice? Yes, you do have to study. The quicker you get it out of the way, the less time you have to worry about it. You've got a lot of growing up to do, and you're going to do it in high school. The best way to do it is to make the most of your time there. You have to learn that if you want to make the most of your time, you'll need to apply yourself in the classroom. As soon as you get a little bit of momentum, you'll be fine. But you've got to get started. Ask your parents to help you get organized. They can keep you on track. They can give you a specific day and time that you will work on your schoolwork. It's not a bad idea to have someone to keep you accountable. I used to think, "My parents are going to kill me if I don't get my schoolwork done." But I did it anyway. I'd go to the kitchen and see them preparing dinner, and I would be so nervous, and I'd say, "Mom, Dad, I have to do my homework." And they would say, "That's fine, go do your homework." Then they would sit down and eat dinner, and I would be sitting there with a sack of homework, trying to do it. But if I didn't do it, I'd feel so guilty, and I would have to come home and do it. So I'd sit there and do it. But I'd often just start the homework and not finish it. And I would think, "I don't even know what to do. I don't know what I'm doing." And I'd call my mother and say, "Mom, I've got this and I don't know what to do." And she would say, "Well, why don't you go work on it a little bit and see how far you can get." So I'd do that, and then I'd call my mom and say, "I'm still not done." And she'd say, "Well, why don't you keep going?" That's a good way to work. Even if you don't finish, you will have gotten a lot of it done. And that's important. You've got to make a habit of doing your homework every day. It's something you'll have to do in college, so you've got to get used to it. The more you do it, the easier it will get, and you'll find you actually start to like it. I know that's hard to believe, but it's true. I've had kids tell me they hated doing homework, but when they got to college, they loved it because they were used to doing it every night. It was actually a good time for them. So yes, you have to do your homework. It's one of the ways you will succeed in life.
