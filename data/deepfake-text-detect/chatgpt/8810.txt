If this is a duplicate post, I apologize, an AutoMod told my my old version was too short and that it was removed. Here's my logic, though: If I get the question right, I can explain how to fix the problem by saying "The motor has crashed." If it crashes, then I'll fix your issue by saying "It will crash later on if you wait longer than 30 minutes before you post again"
