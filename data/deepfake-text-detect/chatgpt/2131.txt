I mean all jobs, such as police officers, military personnel, CIA operatives, security clearance applications, teachers, lawyers, and doctors. Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if you've ever used marijuana in any form at some point within your life - it can be for medical use only or recreational uses; this question is unlawful to discriminate against a person with an answer that they have not taken drugs under the influence (which includes edibles). Now we know why Sessions wants cannabis so bad: people who are incarcerated cannot fill out job apps without their social security number which could potentially lead them back into crime! I guess he forgot about how much money prisons make off of inmates... Maybe jail just isn't profitable enough anymore? Or maybe prison labor has been completely phased-out since slavery was abolished centuries ago because something tells me Jeffy boy would love nothing more than giving black folks chains again... After arresting anyone caught carrying pot now, surely there aren't many left willing to risk becoming slaves once released from confinement right?! Nope, no connection here. Move along.
