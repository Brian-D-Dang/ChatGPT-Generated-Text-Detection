I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry atheists might think. If you disagree with me on this issue then please don't comment about it in any other threads and ignore my posts due to our differences within our community or your ignorance regarding religion. Apart from that there is nothing wrong with accepting atheists who are passionate about helping others and those living differently than us, although we may differ against religion's interpretation of what Christianity means for them. However, this situation here isn't something which shouldn't be discussed between people who share belief systems outside of atheism though. Atheists can agree completely without being offended by your opinions so long as they understand that you respect each other's perspectives.
