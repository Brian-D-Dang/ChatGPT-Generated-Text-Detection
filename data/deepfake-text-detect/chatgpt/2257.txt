I am a cynical man. I don't believe in heroes, and so I'm prepared to change my view on this. THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about the guy makes me more skeptical than ever that he's not just a charlatan with delusions of grandeur." "You're right," Rafe said quietly. "There are lots of people who will never admit it but you have been looking at him through your own blinders for far too long when there was no reason to do anything except see what he really had done over all these years...and here we go againanother come back from Selena Gomez!" He looked up as they heard her voice calling out: "Rafael! Hi!." She came running across the courtyard toward them. As she got nearer, though, Rafael could tell something wasn't quite right; instead of smiling broadly like usual, she seemed subdued and almost sad-looking. The mood continued as soon as she reached their table where she sat down next to Julianne. "What happened?" asked Natalia softly. Rafel knew immediately why his sister looked worried: Rodriguez' eyes were bloodshot, which clearly meant he'd spent another night working late into the morning and hadn't gotten enough sleep; also, if anyone else might be able to detect any signs of alcohol or drugs now, even by smell alone, then Nadia would certainly know because one of those things always made Rodriguez look ill, while helpfully covering other possible emotional problems.-oOo- -oOOO-As they approached the restaurant door, Raul noticed someone standing behind it. When he drew closer, however, he saw only an older woman sitting cross-legged against the wall reading a book. And although the dress she wore appeared comically old-fashioned, nothing indicated foul play she didn't seem particularly dangerous nor did she appear at all suspicious, merely old school eccentricity taken way too seriouslyuntil suddenly both arms shot forward straight out to the sides forming clawsat least six inches wide eachwhich pointed upward menacingly....well, okay, maybe threateningly rather than necessarily menacingly. Just above the tips of the fingers stood two sharpened yellow teeth, nearly a foot apart. Raoul stopped short slightly before walking past her without incident once he realized exactly whose home he was entering ahead of time. On reflection, perhaps common sense should also have told him ten minutes earlier, since after greeting Felipe Perez briefly inside the front foyer and being shown directly upstairs to Luciana's private bedroom under pretense of needing privacy during business meetings (the problem was quickly solved), he almost walked right past the room occupied by Mimi Ramirez without noticing its occupant until she spoke:"Ahhh..a little birdie has told us that Mr. Solano must be expecting company tonight."His appetite momentarily forgotten, Raoul gave a nervous half laugh: "Not much chance of that happening..."Mimi stared meaninglessly around the livingroom area as though contemplating how best to greet guests who weren't expected yet. Finally focusing intently upon him again, she uttered what sounded more like a question:"Just wait till you feel my touch trust me, whatever the randy diety thinks, having sex won't take away hunger pains."Raoul had already decided lately he needed some kind of distraction, especially given the weighty issues currently involved involving a female undercover agent serving aboard Colonia Escobar's military vessel La Estrella de la Muerte disguised as a Mexican prostitute named Luz Del Carmen whom he suspected may well possess information leading to imminent arrests among high level officials responsible for drug trafficking throughout South America...but first let him say hi to his friend Elena Fernandez Torres who lived nearby."Elena? It's good to see you againGood evening, Chief Inspector. Please forgive my appearance; I've been busy preparing dinner.No need to apologize, ma'am. What can I get you to drinkor eatfirst?"She smiled fondly towards him as he moved towards the kitchen cupboard near the entranceway."A glass of champagne please or beer depending on whether Julio still drinks Budweiser tap water."The former dancer retired to make herself comfortable in an armchair close to the window overlooking the street outside. Turning off the TV set beside her, she remarked casually:"Though I suppose most couples nowadays prefer wine instead of beer. Not sure what the big deal is anymore between drinking domestic beers versus imported wines considering everyone knows it takes longer to digest liquids containing hops than spirits or liquors." The sound system began playing Elvis Presley's classic rendition of Blue Suede Shoes and Raoul turned instinctively in response whenever it grew louder within earshot, nodding along cheerily despite his nerves causing tremors throughout his body, tingling sensations rising rapidly amongst certain sensitive areas of skin.....he felt surprisingly energized, primed, perked up beyond his normal state of mind thanks largely due to memories related to his childhood suggested involvement sexually with several young girls including...............Juliet... interior Son others gradeom... brief ton l mobile n dark y jack Mont, player ones has '..."monies system Nun online league players.!...
