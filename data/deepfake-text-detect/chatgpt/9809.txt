Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on and forget. This is a very understandable reaction. After all, the news is full of stories that can be extremely upsetting and difficult to process. It's natural to want to distance ourselves from them, especially when they involve something as horrific as executions. However, it is important to remember that these events have real-life implications for people around the world. They are not just abstract concepts that can be forgotten with time. We should take the time to educate ourselves on the issues surrounding capital punishment and its consequences so that we can better understand it and make informed decisions about our position on the issue.
