I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. To me this doesn't seem fair at all and like someone needs something from you here (attention?). It also feels as though they are trying too hard with their sex appeal in my opinion - which can be very off putting after awhile when we get so used these days that women over process themselves by wearing makeup because of how other people may perceive them... ugh! If your goal was just attention then why bother? Are things really getting better between menwomen around gender roles etc.? Or do some still think there's only one way 'the right' thing should look based upon appearance alone without regard acceptance toward others who have different opinions than theirs... yes humans need common ground understanding - let us move forward rather ignore eachother out-rightly!!!!! What ever happened became okay?? - years ago anyway?!??? A low blow no matter what side sets up such an argument; try making less assumptions before entering into any discussion online:
