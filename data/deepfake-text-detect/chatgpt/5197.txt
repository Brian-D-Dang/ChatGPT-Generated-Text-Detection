Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on that later!). Thanks for the support and actions you guys have taken. I will work hard to help contribute to the cause as much as possible with the effort we are putting into this campaign by making sure everyone understands this is not about me but about the problems within the coalition party, including the relationship between the government and the opposition parties. It's good to see how the coalition partners are willing to engage openly enough so we can better understand each other:)
