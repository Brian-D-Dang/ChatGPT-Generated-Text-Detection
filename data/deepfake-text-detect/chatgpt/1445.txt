There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring on a pupil's parent (s) or guardian by a school headmaster, principalandor teacher that their child had successfully completed pre-set academic milestones. Graduations are also increasingly being performed at home with teachers accompanying parents as they give valedictory speeches accepting responsibilityto their own actions over time as wellas to those of other people involved within education or training. The tradition can be traced back to ancient Greece where some vestiges still exist today: the ancient Greeks began celebrating their youth when they turned 12 years old while later celebrations were held afterthe completion of middle age and generally more formal ones during adulthood.[4] The Greek concept'magenia' defined both age and purity[5], even though there has been no evidence found from archaeological digs in this regard suggesting any sexual involvement between young men and women until the Roman Empire.[6] Some scholars have argued these "purity" rituals may have contained metaphorical references to virginity,[78] but this is speculative. The word hero was used to describe earlier Greek heroes who excelled at sports like archery, horseback riding etc., such as Agamemnon [9]. It seems unlikely it would refer exclusively to virgins - although if so then there could be several interpretations as to what "heroism" meant to these cultures. As well as the individual sport activities described above the Spartans believed that heroism consisted of winning military battles against enemies which included enemy vessels.[10] Sparta itself developed its local mythology into a very elaborate system around militaristic values and culture founded on a strict code of conduct known as epikritiko moralos ethical morality. This culture remains part of contemporary Greek heritage and strength; however many aspects seem alien to modern Western society, including rigid social roles based on hierarchy i.e. male versus female, race versus nationality among others. In addition Spartan warriors experienced physical pain due to certain movements made whilst fighting and since it was considered shameful to show weakness; particularly fear - real or imagined - Spartan fighters sometimes fought without armour but always wore leather shoes to protect them from injury. Various historians believe Spartans might not have enjoyed living a long healthy life span either because they lived in isolated communities rather than cities and constantly defended themselves against attack by neighbouring tribes which wouldn't help to extend their lifespans. Furthermore, most of the Spartan elite took drugs which gave temporary relief from sickness and allowed soldiers to concentrate better under difficult conditions. According to one source, all slaves wore a bracelet containing an aphrodisiac substance called myriochloride which the slave thought would improve his chances of success in battle and increase his status amongst his fellow slave masters. Myrioccholate was said to produce euphoria consisting entirely of pleasure derived especially from sex or orgasms. Slaves did not eat meat nor drink alcohol and many suffered from amnesia caused by excessive use of speed granted them by their master's wife as reward for outstanding performance in combat.[11] A wedding ceremony marks the union of two individuals in marriage. Marriage can take place outside the church, or inside depending upon the religious beliefs of the couple. Typically weddings last about 2 hours, followed by receptions lasting another few hours. Traditionally, the bride wears her wedding dress and the groom is dressed up in his best suit, usually white. Ceremonies include the exchanging rings, which symbolize marital commitment through eternity, prayers and blessings, songs, dancing, eating and drinking before finally the exchange of vows. Most marriages end happily, but occasionally divorce occurs. Many couples choose to renew their vows every 5 or 10 years once the honeymoon period ends.
