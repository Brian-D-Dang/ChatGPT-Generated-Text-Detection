Disclaimer: this talk of secession may not be present everywhere in the United States, but it is more than prevalent where I live, so I'm going off that. To me, it sounds like you are concerned about the talk of secession in your community. This can be a stressful and uncertain topic to navigate. It may be helpful to try to understand why people are discussing secession and what their concerns and motivations are. It is also important to remember that secession is a complex and controversial issue that would involve significant legal and political challenges. If you feel comfortable doing so, you could try having respectful and constructive conversations with people in your community to gain a better understanding of their perspectives. You could also research the potential impacts of secession and what the process would involve. Ultimately, it is up to individuals and communities to decide their own paths forward, but it is important to approach discussions and decision-making with careful consideration and a commitment to respectful dialogue.
