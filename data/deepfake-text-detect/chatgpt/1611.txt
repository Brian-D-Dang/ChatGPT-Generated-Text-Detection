Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. Can someone explain why we should be concerned with it? It's not a major concern but the amount of space junk orbiting earth does pose some risks for those who operate in low Earth orbit (LEO). Low orbits include things like satellites and cameras on robotic missions for science organizations around the world.
