I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was surprised to find out that the character of Alan Turing - portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in this film - actually committed suicide! Now for sure there are many reasons why someone may commit suicide (depression is one which has been well documented), but did he really have no choice? It seems unlikely given what we know now about his situation... A more interesting question might be how much would society change if people could take their own life without anyone being judgemental or questioning them?? Would they all go on killing sprees because everyone else does; make rash decisions based solely upon emotion rather than logic; become selfishly entitled instead of responsibly contributing members of society? Probably not.. But who knows:)
