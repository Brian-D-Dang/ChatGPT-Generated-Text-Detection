Every election year this is one of the most popular complaints against candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. "So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so too many people hate him," said Republican state Rep. Mike Patterson, who represents District 4 in the Legislature because of his opposition to expanding Medicaid insurance coverage for poor seniors." Unlike Trump, Patterson has not been a regular candidate on the ballot since his unsuccessful campaign for governor last fall. But last November when he was first elected that month, he seemed like an unlikely state senator - probably the least likely to be in the race. Patterson appeared as a candidate for governor only weeks before Trump endorsed him over Democrat Jennifer Granholm, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary. Patterson conceded, saying he had no plans to run again next year. Republicans also warned that his positions on the Affordable Care Act would hurt Trump's chances if they're reflected by voters' opinions about him politically. Trump, who does have strong support among conservatives across the political spectrum from Republicans, cites his successes during his first term, which included passing laws restricting abortion rights, raising taxes on tobacco companies and repealing Obamacare while maintaining close ties with the NRA than any previous administration. But he faces stiff competition once Democrats take control of Congress and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointees get power following Senate confirmation hearings set to begin Monday night. Pelosi defends Trump, saying she respects his views despite calling him a "conspiracy theorist" at times. Advertisement Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he supports Trump and sees little downside risk there after Republicans hold majority control of the chamber ahead of midterm elections scheduled Nov. 3. Trump made clear that he wants to make sure voter turnout isn't affected by Democratic nominees being vetted for nomination or judges are appointed early. McConnell says his Republican caucus believes they can win enough votes to defeat Biden in 2022. Republicans will need more than 5, or 74,000 ballots, over four days Sunday to set up their nomineedesktop beginning at 6 p.m., said Nate Silver, senior strategist for Republicans including Harris Chabot and John Bolton. Republicans vote Thursday afternoon and hope to nominate a nominee Friday evening. Seniors should expect votes later Saturday through Sunday, though some party leaders say Democrats may want to wait until after the Sept. 11 attacks. Even without votes from voters, Democrats accuse Republicans of failing to show commitment to social justice issues such as voting rights, immigration reform and climate change under Trump. For Democrats, that includes voting against Trump's proposed delay rule for schools amid pushback from teachers union officials. Democrats complain Democrats backed Trump's divisive policies even after they came into office promising to repeal and replace Obamacare. Conservatives criticize them for using sound money from taxes to fund defense contractors and take away healthcare subsidies. In Washington, McConnell defended GOP senators as attempting to shift responsibility toward Democrats instead of Republicans. "The vast majority doesn't agree with everything Donald Trump stands for. We've got lots of very smart people working tirelessly trying to ensure that we do right thing rather than wrong things, " McConnell told reporters Wednesday morning.
