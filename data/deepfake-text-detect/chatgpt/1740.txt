I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think science works: It is an aggregate process in which hypotheses are tested and discarded until one bears fruit. As such, there will always be multiple ways of looking at the same problem from different angles; sometimes each angle may have advantages over others.
