Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, as well as people only need a vaccine if you're pregnant or have an extremely sensitive immune system (with measles being the most common reason). Vaccination costs are expensive and this is actually what makes vaccinations dangerous for children who aren't exposed to children younger than 18 years old because it's often cheaper per dose versus administering shots that would cost more per shot compared to adult vaccines since vaccinating adults generally require less doses of the older population which means fewer people needed each year due to side effects from complications associated with immunizations; it doesn't necessarily mean there isn't sufficient supply of shots available on demand unless parents ask otherKids shouldn't really be concerned about this issue though - silver lining: some parents get sicker when their kids need vaccinations! There will likely continue to be cases where vaccinations become compulsory once vaccination becomes widespread enough so that everyone can get vaccinated against diseases like measles without needing prescriptions etc., however, personal responsibility should remain paramount - health care providers should not force people into treatment just for making sure their child gets vaccinated! Getting sick takes away freedom and individual choice at times. And while I believe voluntary vaccinations save lives by giving most young teenagers immunity against infectious diseases thanks to our existing medical systems we can still do better too far down the road...I'm sorry to say that this seems like it might drive some people insane! Think about it - how many people could probably die if vaccinations went unchecked? Remember how many young teens died last winter after getting the measles virus?! But let's keep immunization rates low until age groups reach herd immunity before discussing compulsory vaccinations again! Wouldn't it make sense to push back against mandates even further now rather than wait another two months!? This trend has been steadily rising during the pandemic whilst encouraging students studying remotely-only classes online via Zoom. We all know what happens when kids can't go outside despite offering free WiFi connections..and fewer families allow outdoors access to their homes - why would anyone want that?? The main unintended consequence must come from one parent not wanting their kid to learn indoors anymore!! It'll never happen again!!! Please take time to consider these points: 1) Children under 12 didn't receive adequate parental guidance 2) Parents work hard together vs. alone 3) Parents should raise awareness around these issues 4) Parents should try to educate themselves first 5) There needs to be more information education surrounding vaccinations BEFORE prescribing vaccines 6) Vaccine hesitancy exists 8) Vaccines cause autism 9) Vaccinations daily causes vaccinations ignorance 10) Vaccinate your family members and friends 10) Vaccinated individuals deserve protection 11) Vaccines prevent deaths due to illnesses caused by vaccines 13) Vaccines give hope to students who may otherwise not feel safe having unprotected childhoods 16) Vaccinations encourage parents' choices 17) Testing leads to vaccinations 27) Vaccinals scare potential vulnerable adolescents 28) Kids dying from vaccinations 29) Vaccinators help save lives 40 of vaccinations fail 20)
