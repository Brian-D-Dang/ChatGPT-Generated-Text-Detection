This people are selling good feelings. Not really being able to talk to the dead or a magic pill to lose weight. They are like movies or video games. They want you eat less calories, sleep longer and exercise more because it's healthier than going backpacking around in packs of cigarettes or watching television programmes on TV with your dog. Don't say no to your clothes... That would be impossible for some people.
