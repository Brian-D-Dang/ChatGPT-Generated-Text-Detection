I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites and scrapebuild data from them to create a new report that was used for decision making. At the same time, I was also interested in the data that was already available in the company, but it was not used in decision making. I realized that if I was going to use data in my reports, I might as well try to improve the data itself. That is how I got started in data science. As a programmer, I think the most important skills are to be able to write elegant code that is easy to read and understand. I would recommend books by Andrew Ng and Michael Nielsen. Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning Yearning" is a really easy way to learn machine learning, and Michael Nielsen's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" is a good way to learn about deep learning. I am very happy with my job. I work in a really fun environment where I get to learn new things every day, and I have a lot of freedom to make my own decisions. I love the variety of my job, as I learn new things and have new challenges every day. I really like the community of people working on data science and machine learning. I think it is really helpful to have a group of people to talk to that are working on similar problems. My biggest challenge is to make sure that the data I am working with is the correct data for the problem that I am trying to solve. I think it is very easy to make a problem more difficult than it is by adding unnecessary data that complicates things. For me, the most exciting thing about my job is that I get to use a lot of different technologies. I get to work with data, but I also get to work with programs to visualize it. I also get to work with web servers and databases to store and retrieve it. I would love to work on AI for self-driving cars. I think it is really interesting to see how computers can learn to do something that used to be very difficult. I would be working on a data science team, doing mostly data analysis and machine learning. I would love to work on a startup that is using data science to make the world a better place. I think the best part of working on a startup is that you can make an impact, as a data science team is often the lifeblood of a company. I would love to work at a company that is at the forefront of AI, such as Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. I would recommend to just get started. If you like data science, then you should go for it. There is a lot of free material online, and it is really easy to start from there. I think a data scientist should be a data scientist, and not just a programmer. I think that data scientists should be able to write elegant code, but I also think that data scientists should be able to communicate with others and make a clear data presentation. I would recommend to keep learning, and keep working on different things. I think it is very easy to get into a comfort zone, and think you know everything, but I think the only way to continue to learn and grow is to keep challenging yourself and working on new things. My most memorable moment was when I got my first job at a startup. I got the job because I was able to demonstrate that I could solve a problem using data, and I was able to write elegant code and present my work well. I remember thinking that this was the job I was looking for, because I loved the problem I was solving, and I loved the environment of a startup. I think it was really cool to see how I was able to make a strong impact on my first job, and it was a moment I will never forget. I would love to become a data scientist at a big company, working on interesting projects that make a difference in the world. I think my favorite project was creating a system to help classify customer complaints. I was able to train the system using text and data from the company's database, and the result was a system that was able to classify the complaints into different categories that were more granular than the company's current system. The project was really exciting because I was able to create a system that really helped people in the company. I would recommend working on open source projects. I think it is really helpful to see how other people solve problems, and it is a good way to learn. I would also recommend to read as much as you can, and learn new technologies.
