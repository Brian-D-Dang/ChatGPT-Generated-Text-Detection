Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and want everyone else to come here illegally, but they don't do it themselves because of good moral values (yes I can guess their political affiliation). Person B came here legally via visa or whatever that process is called, and will eventually become a citizen like person A. Person C didn't come from anywhere except Mexico where he also lives now. He doesn't plan on getting legal papers any time soon and has no intention of ever becoming an American. Is this really America?
