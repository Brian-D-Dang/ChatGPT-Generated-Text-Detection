Before anything else, let me say that I am not, nor have ever been depressed, suicidal or abused in any way shape or form. My life so far has been I have been living in India for the last one year and I have no plans of leaving. I have been through many ups and downs, lots of fun, adventures, sad moments, but I have always had a strong willpower to go on and I don't see it changing any time soon. I am not a very talkative person, but I don't have any problem venting about my life when I feel like it. I want to share my story so that I can give some people a chance to talk about it and we can actually help each other. I have been bullied at school and I was also made to feel like an outsider. I have been traumatized by a lot of little and big things. I have been made to feel that I have no values, and all my achievements are only because of my looks and intelligence. Can you imagine a 10 year old being bullied by some bullies at school? I don't think I could have been more sad or depressed for the rest of my life. I had a lot of potential and I knew that I was good enough to make something out of myself. Even though I messed up and I felt bad about it, I grew and became better. I have always believed that nothing is impossible and everything is possible if you put your mind to it. I have always believed that I could overcome anything and everything. Yes, it's been hard at times to believe in myself, but I have made it and I hope I can inspire someone who is struggling to believe in himself as well. I would like to call on all the girls who feel like they have been bullied to go on and talk about it. Don't be afraid of talking about it, and I hope these words can help someone to not feel like they have to go through what I went through.
