The pronunciation of "gif" is actually a subject of debate and controversy among language enthusiasts. However, the creators of the format have stated that it should be pronounced with a soft "g" sound like "jif," not like the peanut butter. They based this on the fact that "gif" is an acronym for "Graphics Interchange Format" and the word "graphics" is pronounced with a soft "g" sound. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that "gif" is pronounced like "jif," not like the peanut butter.
