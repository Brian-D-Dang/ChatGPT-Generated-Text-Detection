I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the freezer on top and the fridge on the right, so that it is the same as the usual way of positioning it, i.e., the usual way of positioning a fridge-freezer, which is on most modern freezers which has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom, but the refrigerator is on the bottom and the freezer is on top
