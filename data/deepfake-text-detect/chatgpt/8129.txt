Let me start off by stating what I believe the reddit basic income theory is. From what I have read from rbasicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society where robots and automation take over most jobs so one can live with relative ease without having to work all day (or even giving up their personal life), people will use this time for leisure or creativity rather than working at some job they hate just because it pays well enough... This really sounds like communism writ large on an online forum....Reddit? Really??? Anyway....... My question here isn't whether you agree but why do folks who seem smart endulge into these sorts of ideas when there are much better solutions outthere........ In essence once again: How does someone get tiredbored doing something if money was taken away As humans we naturally tendto stay true only along our paths until changes occur - as opposed t0 taking risks which often leads us astray! Why not let them figure things themselves through trial n error methods? The current system works fine imo.....
