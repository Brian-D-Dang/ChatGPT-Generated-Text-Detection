While some may argue that national rituals and symbols like the pledge of allegiance may be seen as divisive or outdated, they also serve an important purpose in promoting a sense of unity and shared identity among citizens. These symbols and rituals serve as a reminder of our common values and history, and can bring people of different backgrounds and beliefs together under a shared sense of pride in their country. Additionally, these rituals are often taught to students in schools, and can serve as a useful tool for educating young people about the importance of civic engagement and their role in shaping their communities. Rather than holding society back, these rituals can serve as a unifying force, promoting a sense of pride and purpose across diverse communities.
