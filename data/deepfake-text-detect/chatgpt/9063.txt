EDIT: Lots of very well rounded, interesting points. Thanks! Really helped with my perspective. EDIT 2: I've been awarding deltas to people whom have been making some very good, solid podcasts for a while now - mark up on links so you can get them at the bottom of this post (or just go and read these comments as they come along). We are currently on the "Invented Podcast" list which is an awesome place to start if you're interested in listening. It's also where I'm meeting up with people who like one another. You should be able to find all sorts of unique podcast hosts and writers who would probably fit your tastes in just a little bit. I started out looking around but after about six months or so it became increasingly difficult because the quality of our podcasts was vastly inferior to theirs. Fortunately we stopped talking and moved towards other areas such as web development, web design, web language development and video production. Well, that was about six months ago, the last time we spoke. There are several things we want to do to make sure we keep doing the right thing and keep improving. We don't want to leave any room for improvement though. As long as there is someone else who chooses their podcast over ours, this agreement won't change much. As mentioned before, the "invented podcast list" and its creator have both been decommissioned by Facebook. This means that "the original list" will not be available this year. A lot of these podcasts were created as bits of content - for example, an album played through a network radio station. The idea is that the podcasts could be sold directly from Facebook rather than being distributed via email. Podcasts are still only useful when they're featured prominently in news stories, blogs and magazines. They need to be made into something more relevant, that's why we couldn't make them available purely on Facebook - even though Facebook had already launched something similar back then. The main reason we wanted to keep the original list on Facebook is twofoldfold: it didn't provide enough value for people to click onto it and offer feedback; nor did we think that the new version of what we'd achieved would appeal to everyone. What we really needed are products that were visually appealing and easy for those who weren't afraid to tune in and give feedbackviewer favorites. And, although iTunes has been around longer than Facebook (which is probably why we haven't seen much more of it), the lack of support for this form of communication makes us think that this isn't going to work for everyone. If we could have done more to include 'good' shows in the Podcast List, maybe we wouldn't have been disappointed here. So far, we continue to try and improve on things that we used to be great at. I hope you enjoy the videos above. Thank you for reading. - To see more from The WilyGo Podcasts, visit the blog. Also check out the Wily Go Blog at:
