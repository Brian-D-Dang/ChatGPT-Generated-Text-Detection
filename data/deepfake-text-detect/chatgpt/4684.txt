I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry atheists claim (they are). ...However, people like myself don't care what you think. We weren't born into this world in order to be given freedoms and rights, we were born with them. When you try and take away our basic human right to live peacefully without fear of persecution or death from any other reason than because it is unacceptable for your god-complex opinion on how life will work out, then you may as well just kill yourself. Most "fundamentalist" Christians are damned idiots who love nothing more than to scream about things they know absolutely nothing about. They'll go around quoting verses taken completely out of context so that no one can actually understand what was said originally. These people would rather die hating themselves than allow us all the same liberties they had when they where little children who didn't want to listen to anybody else's bullshit besides theirs. You want an example? Well here it goes: If God really existed he'd put someone up there with his thumbs on some sorta intercom telling everyone to do everything they wanted to instead of letting them decide by free thought based on evidence. But since He doesn't exist...well that means that nobody knows if anybody has anything at all worth living for but money and sex...which makes sense considering most religions founded after Jesus' death got pretty damn sure that everybody deserved eternal punishment and torture. Oh yeah..and you can fuck a goat too. No kidding! Go read Matthew 15:11 and 13:12-14 if you wanna see my point clearly. A couple days ago, I went back to school. For once, I felt ready. Ready to get through my classes...ready to learn...ready to sit in class....but something happened. It wasn't anything real earth shattering...it was more of an emotional roller coaster ride. At first, I hated going back. I missed being home alone with my computer parts, watching DVDs, and eating snacks while working on projects all day long. Then, I started missing Haines. The guy...that's all he ever did anymore, anyway. Be playing video games all night until 3am. That's what I knew him to be now. That's not who I saw last Friday morning when I came downstairs. Not only did he look clean shaven, which I hadn't seen before, but he looked happy,...or maybe just anxious. Either way, I gave him a hug and started cleaningorganizing my room again. Little did I expect to find 10 notes written on scraps of paper stuck throughout my bookcase doors and walls. With each note, I could feel the anger inside me grow stronger and stronger, threatening to make itself known. So much self confidence hit me all at once. And even though I cried continually during that time period, I still defended every single word written on those papers. Words such as 'Love', 'Tease,' 'Trustful,' '4ever.' Each was filled with sincere emotions. In fact, the words almost seemed believable now. Like these were truly feelings Meka had towards me. Maybe I'm misunderstanding things. Did she say those things to me? Is that why she wrote them down? What does her leaving mean to me?! Shouldn't I call her at least? Of course, I did eventually call her. She picked up and assured me that that stuff was a lie, that she wouldn't write anything like that because she cared deeply for me. After hearing that, my heart felt lighter than it had been in months. Before hanging up, I decided that somehow I needed to thank her properly...for caring enough about me to leave these notes. So I sent her 2 letters via snail mail explaining how much she meant to me and thanking her for always wanting to help me. As soon as I mailed those letters, I realized another change within myself...she would never open either letter. The next few weeks passed quickly between friends, family, schoolwork, sleepovers, and trying desperately to sneak homework finished off during odd moments between housemates and conversations. Eventually, we moved apart once more. We continued to keep in touch mostly over Facebook, nevertheless, I guess it couldn't hurt to stay good friends with somebody. Graduating highschool comes with many responsibilities, among them: graduating college and finding jobs. Lots of jobs. Finding ones that pay decently and offer health insurance...is a lot harder than having fun doing unpaid internships. However, I've learned to deal with things better. Mostly. Because I'm in need of assistance, guidance, and understanding in certain areas of my life that require attention. Since moving back into town, my lack of focus regarding my academic future became evident immediately upon transferring schools. Although my grades haven't dropped considerably, especially compared to past years, I began failing my core courses. Very slowly, but surely.
