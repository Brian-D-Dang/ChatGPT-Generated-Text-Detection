1. Military industry keeps some of the very few manufacturing jobs in US, this industry's survival critically depends on US's defence policies and government orders, without US spending sizeable chunk of its budget on military it would not be able to compete with China 2. The USA has a higher per capita GDP than all other countries combined. This means that you can go into debt up to 100x as high as what others do for similar amounts of output because there is simply more money floating around (see: Japan). If they don't spend it on stuff like this then who does? We're talking about an economy where the vast majority doesn't have much exposure to "real" production or physical goods at all - basically only employment. It might be possible that we could get away from this if new technologies make us less dependent upon having everyone devote their time toward labor-intensive work and make them focus instead toward inventing machines which will take over most human labor however I doubt that's going to happen any time soon. Probably just another illusion created by our addiction to physical consumption to keep us busy until the machine revolution is complete... I think y'all are getting carried away here when you talk about people being forced into working long hours....most people already choose to put in those extra hours rather than sitting back doing nothing, so why should anyone care if someone else wants to see himherself as a productive member of society rather than being lazy? Sure it wouldn't hurt to force these 16 year olds into working out how many fucks you need to give your boss before he lets his bitch employees go home early but i seriously doubt that'll ever become law, especially since the youth aren't anywhere near as wealthy as the older generations and thus have weaker political clout.....also, what prevents OUR kids from also becoming addicted to consuming physical products? hmmm maybe its cause they didn't grow up living through the great depression or world war one? hmmmmmm....
