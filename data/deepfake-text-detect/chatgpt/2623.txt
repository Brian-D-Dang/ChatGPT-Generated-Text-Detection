As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They keep your head protected in case of an accident (If you don't have insurance and they do) Its just plain silly if someone takes away your life over something as little as 15 for that piece of plastic, or even more so when there's no real risk of it happening It is also important since most people ride sometimes with traffic on their right side thus making them susceptible to traffic accidents. Overall though its probably because most adults think helmets look stupid
