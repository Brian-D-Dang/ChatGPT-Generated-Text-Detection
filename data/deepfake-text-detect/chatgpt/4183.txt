Headlights are mostly useful for improving the driver's vision while driving in low-light conditions and for increasing the visibility of the driver's car in low-light or foggy conditions. While stationary, headlights can be used to illuminate other vehicles on the road such as police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, etc., during emergency situations that may arise. To improve the visibility of the vehicle headlights, there have been many attempts made with various types of light sources and systems interconnecting them together. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,835,542 discloses a system utilizing multiple sets of lights coupled into lamps of different colors which serves to reflect the light from a single light source onto an object across the surface of another object at varying angles. The reflected light is then detected by an electronic control circuit which uses it as input data for controlling the operation of the illumination device. However, this type of lighting system does not enable manual adjustment of intensity and brightness levels and cannot be realized using conventional headlamps having variable angular positions. Instead, these lightings systems require complex circuitry as well as moving parts when adjusting the intensity andor illumination level. This increases the cost and reliability of the headlight systems. In addition, the use of multiple sets of electrical wires increases the number of components needed and therefore the complexity and cost of the headlight system. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,032,597; 5,769,949; and 3,873,051 disclose techniques whereby the light emitted by diffusers includes lightening rays towards objects directly opposite each other. These patents disclose three primary lighting principles: 1) Lighten the ambient environment around the headlight beam thereby improving the capability of the headlight to transmit adequate lighting power; 2) Use the lightener rays to direct specific beams of light at a particular area; and 3) Direct the light toward the side of the automobile to provide additional observation areas, guide lines, passageways, blind spots, etc. While these systems allow for improved optical capabilities due to the increased amount of light generated over the minimum illumination range, they do not provide for simple operation or easy installation. Further, their application requires accurate positioning of all of the light bulbs within the interior of the headlight assembly.
