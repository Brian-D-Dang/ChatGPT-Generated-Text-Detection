During the first week alone [32 million people] downloaded a copy of a Game of Thrones episode. Even if only 1 of those people keep the file they downloaded after the season is over, that's 1 million people that are now stealing Game of Thrones. HBO should be up in arms over that. But they're not. The truth is, Game of Thrones isn't being pirated because of the free episodes. It's being pirated because of the high quality of the show itself. The truth is, Game of Thrones isn't being pirated because of the free episodes. It's being pirated because of the high quality of the show itself. That is what people want to watch. So, if you don't want your work stolen, don't put it up on the internet where people can get it easily. If you do want your work to be pirated, then put it up on the internet where people can get it easily. The question is, where do you want your work to be pirated, the internet or a physical store? Let's start with the internet. When a pirated movie is downloaded, it is downloaded from a central server and it is this server that gets the attention of the Feds. This is why the Feds are actively pursuing pirated movies on the internet. The trick is to go after the server, not the customers. As for physical stores, the situation is different. Let's start with a store that sells DVDs. In a store that sells DVDs, it's the DVDs that get the attention of the Feds. While they're at it, they can also search the person that bought the DVD and the person that sold the DVD. That's right, it's all about the physical media, not the customers. What about a store that sells books? Now we're getting into copyright infringement. When a book is stolen, it's the book that gets the attention of the Feds. As for the customers, well, it's still pretty much the same as for DVDs. While they're at it, they can also search the person that bought the book and the person that sold the book. Let's move on to a physical store that sells music. In this case, it's the CDs that get the attention of the Feds. While they're at it, they can also search the person that bought the CD and the person that sold the CD. Let's finish with a physical store that sells music. In this case, it's the vinyl that gets the attention of the Feds. While they're at it, they can also search the person that bought the vinyl and the person that sold the vinyl. This is why it's better to sell vinyl than CDs. This is also why it's better to sell CDs than MP3s. This is also why it's better to sell vinyl than MP3s. So, to sum up, it's better to sell vinyl than CDs, it's better to sell CDs than MP3s, and it's better to sell MP3s than software. These are my thoughts. What's yours?
