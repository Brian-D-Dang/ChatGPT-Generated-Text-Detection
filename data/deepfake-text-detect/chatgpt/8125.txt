I think that all humans deserve the same amount of respect, all else being equal. In other words, if I don't know you at all, my respect for you won't be any different than it would have been were we to meet and become friends instead (assuming our relative amounts in terms both absolute physical strengthsize as well size within a social network are not drastically dissimilar either). The problem is with this basic approach arises when one tries apply fairness across large populations; e g., how much should each nation's citizens pay into their respective government? That depends on what percentage they can afford compared against others who already contribute more or less proportionately based upon income levels etc.; obviously no two people will give an identical contribution even given similar circumstances since there isn't anything like perfect equality amongst us - but still some kind "fairness" needs applied somehow so everyone feels justified about getting something back from society without doing too little nor giving up everything just because he doesn' t endow himself fully financially depending where his life stands socially speaking:! This seems very hard a" perhaps impossible under certain conditions - to do via purely voluntary means alone especially among nations which see themselves competing globally long-term wise rather then cooperatively indefinitely locally short term... Even though nothing protects anyone today over tomorrow once de facto global governance takes hold by default through world war most likely starting somewhere running roughshod until eventually becoming irreversible regardless whether many care now here far off decades down future road
