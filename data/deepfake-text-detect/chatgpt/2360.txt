Hi CMV! A recent post on AskReddit about homosexuality and pedophilia being a choice or not led me to this thought that BOTH homosexuality and heterosexuality are choice made by your DNA. I honestly think it's all BS, but now I'm curious as well...which side is right?! I can say with complete honesty the exact same thing for both sides of my family (so far). Some people choose their sexuality while others don't; just like some gaystraight couples have kids that turn out straight in one parent's genetics and end up homosexual in another." You're welcome:)
