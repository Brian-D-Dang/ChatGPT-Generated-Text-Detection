White girls very rarely date Asian men. Even in Asia white men are much more popular than Asian men. Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white women he's going to go with the most attractive woman available regardless of race or ethnicity, and that doesn't include you. Well what if they're dating other asian guys? Or is it only when theres no hope left does she realize its over between them
