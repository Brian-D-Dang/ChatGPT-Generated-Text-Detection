Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do much for me since my experience was so different from most others. Now that you mention it (and no apologies necessary), yes, it's very likely I will make more posts like these based on what happened with my SO. It might be interesting if we find out he did it but not everyone believes him because "he says nothing ever happens when she hangs up."
