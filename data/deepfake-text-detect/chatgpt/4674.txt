I think its fair to say that most people dont give a single shit about morality unless they're driven by compassion"their conscience" or worried about being judged by others for their own personal choices. You've got it backwards, because I'm sure you'll agree with me when I tell you there are many types of "compassion." The kind where someone is overly concerned with what other people feel and the fact that everybody should be treated fairly regardless of race etc. This type of compassion gets in the way of rational thinking, but lets face it...we all know how easily corrupted humanity can fall into this trap. On another hand, there's also empathy which involves an understanding on behalf of yourself as well as your fellow man and woman. Empathy is key for us to achieve genuine harmony within society. Without it we get wars, religious conflicts, crime etc..This doesn't mean that we shouldn't strive for justice, equality, fairness and accountability from each other, simply that these things must come second to our desire to understand each other. So you see here lies the problem - human beings cannot possibly encompass every concept of empathy at once, so then we have to choose sides. And like any good war between ideologies (ie religion) it becomes increasingly difficult to make decisions based solely upon logicrational thought, even though it may seem logical. So that's why the criminally insane continue to do whatever they want, while everyone else fights to change those behaviours into something better! Its not easy, trust me;) Maybe if we could just forgive ourselves collectively for past mistakes instead of holding grudges against one another and trying to blame others for them? Maybe if we were patient enough to realise that blame only leads to hate and anger?? It seems simple doesnt' it?! But unfortunately humans don't work quite that way: (The real story behind war after all was 'good vs evil'. the past years i seen so much bad news stories about Russia, north korea and China. Some times the US gov try to cover up some things... sometimes too many people die and other than USA the media will hardly talk about it. it's sad that during my childhood time the world action always focus on America! Thats why now im mad at american government. If this continue and no solution overcome who knows what happen?
