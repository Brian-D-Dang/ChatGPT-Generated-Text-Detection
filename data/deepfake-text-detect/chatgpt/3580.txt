growing up in america I was condition to believe women's breast are sexual organs do to the fact that we over sexualized them too much. it wasnt till recently that many people have started to challenge this belief and recognize that breasts serve a primary biological function of providing milk for infants. While breasts can still be considered sexually attractive, they are not inherently sexual organs. It's important for us to educate ourselves and recognize the difference between sexualization and appreciation of the natural human body. It's also important to respect individuals' choices in how they choose to dress and present themselves, without making assumptions or judgments based on societal norms or stereotypes.
