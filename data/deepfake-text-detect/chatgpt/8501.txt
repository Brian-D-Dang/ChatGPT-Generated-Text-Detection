First thing, let's assume the biblical Jesus is completely true. Now, I have a fair knowledge of the biblical tale, but if I say something wrong, feel welcome to correct me here and now in comments or by email (I'll check back). But on that assumption: The story seems inconsistent with what we know about human nature today how people really behave when they think religion gives them an excuse for all kinds horrendous behavior toward everyone else? And it contradicts everything science has shown us so far concerning our origins; yet many Christians still cling fiercely as ever before...and around 95 never even look at these things which might seem "unbelievable" without evidence being provided! They just accept their beliefs like sheep because someone told 'em once upon time not too long ago....no questions asked whatsoever.....even though there are serious reasons why most do NOT believe such tales were actually based-upon actual events anymore than fairy stories from ancient Greece would be.. (or more recently.) These days financial gain can make you buy into anything whether rationality requires acceptance thereofsuch wasis also likely among those who've written down any version whatever regarding this man called Christ. (for example) But my intent isn't necessarily focused specifically only towards Christianity -some other religions may prove equally abusive...but certainly men within ALL faiths will turn out some bad apples occasionally no matter where one looks throughout history.as well!! Even Catholicism had its share during Pope Innocent III' s crusades against "heretics" after he became pope...And since then up until very recent times - there exists methods whereby religious zealots could justify literally taking over entire countries via land grabs etc while murdering millions under various pretextual excuses....all justified through Christian scripture -so doncha see?? If peoples' minds work thusly regardless,,it should surprise NO ONE whenever believers take advantage much further outside themselves...... Unfortunately folks get trapped easily using irrational belief systems,especially ones devoid entirelyof reason. When surrounded solelyby fellow devotees committed to living life according ONLYthose wishes consistent wth said systemthe need arises often enough already simply staying alive-which usually trumps real concernsregarding morality!!! So ANY group worth considering fully must focus especiallyon basic needs first foremost otherwise individuals pursue personal benefits irrespective o fanyone elses welfare.... despite God supposedly guiding good worksHe hasn't been doing half badly overall himself either! (ever!) Bear
