I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If we die, that's the end for us and there is nothing more to be said about it unless you believe in an afterlife. What if one believes in reincarnating? We're only here once so why not make our mark on history as much as possible before moving forward into another mindbody?
