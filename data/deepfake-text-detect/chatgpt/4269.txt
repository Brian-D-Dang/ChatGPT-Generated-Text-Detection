A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but this was just an amateur firework display that had a lot more explosions than the typical show. Don't worry, there's one way these guys can make up for it...
