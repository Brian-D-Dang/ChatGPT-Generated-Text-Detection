I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I don't necessarily think it's right or appropriate for me to cut ties with them because of their sexual preference however. In this case, I see things through the lens of sex and love interests so much better than people who are just looking to look pretty and have no interest in meeting other guys. This also applies to dating women who want to be around you but have a problem showing up at all. It can cause some feelings of jealousy towards women who want to date you instead of being yourself so they can manipulate your jealousy into wanting to meet other women. It seems like the only way to stop this kind of behavior is to not seek out those women who would understand what she was trying to do. Also, if someone claims to be having affair with you, talk about it to yourself first. Maybe you should ask yourselves why you chose the woman who might set you on fire rather than her ex-boyfriend. My advice: Don't seek out the beautiful women who will allow themselves to be manipulated in order to get attention from you.
