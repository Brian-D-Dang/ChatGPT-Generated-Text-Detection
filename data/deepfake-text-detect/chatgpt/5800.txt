So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want to know what a candidate thinks, just ask them. If you want to know what a candidate's values are, look at their voting record. Asking for specific positions or policy proposals is a poor way to get information about a candidate's values. But this was a really nice idea for debates. So I thought I would make up a "what do you value" list for candidates. There are a couple of problems with this. First, I don't know all the candidates. But I'll do my best. I'm not making any promises. Second, a lot of people don't know what they value. This is just a list of things that I value. I suspect some people may think the opposite of what I value is more important. And I don't know what the opposite of not being mean is. But that's not my list. The first value I'm going to mention is not a policy position but a non-policy position. That is, it's not an issue I'm going to make a big deal about and force candidates to take a position on. I'm going to assume that everyone running for president agrees with this value. My first value is that I don't like to be mean to people. I'm not going to say anything mean to people. I'm not going to lie to people. I'm not going to insult people. I'm not going to do anything that will make someone feel bad about themselves or that will make them feel less-than-equal to me. I'm not going to just assume that everyone agrees with this value, but I'm going to take a wild guess that most people will agree with this value. If you disagree with this value, I really don't want you to run for president. Of course, I do believe that I am less mean than other people. I may be wrong about that. But that's not really important. What's important is that I don't want to be mean. Ok, so my second value is that I believe that we should support good science. So, what does that mean? I don't have an official position about what constitutes good science. I'm not a scientist. And I think most people, when they think of supporting science, think about funding research. I'm not necessarily going to support research if it doesn't seem like it will be useful. But I do think that it's important to support science. So, what does that mean? It means that we need to train scientists. We need to encourage students to study science. We need to make sure that people are aware of the science that is being done. This is not just about the actual research that's being done, but about the process of research. When you're doing research, you have to collect data, and analyze it, and come to conclusions. And the conclusions that you come to depend on the process that you used to collect the data and analyze the data. And you have to be able to defend the conclusions you come to and be able to explain how you came to those conclusions. That's an important part of doing science. If we don't value doing research, we should also not value collecting data. Because collecting data is important. We have a lot of data that we can use to learn about science. But we have to collect more data. We need to encourage researchers to do research. We need to support research that's already being done, and encourage new research. And we need to encourage people to learn about the science that's being done. Of course, there are limits to this. We can't support any research that's not good science. And we need to support research that actually helps people. We need to support research that's useful. But if you have research that's useful, but isn't good science, it can still be useful. And you can fix the science by doing more research. But that's going to require more research. Now I'm going to start listing the candidates. This list is not exhaustive. I've included candidates who have a good chance of becoming a candidate, but it's not exhaustive. And I'm not listing every candidate. I'm only listing the candidates I think are the most likely to become candidates. Democratic candidates so far: Elizabeth Warren: I have a lot of hope for Elizabeth Warren. She seems very smart. She seems very competent. She seems to have a lot of good ideas
