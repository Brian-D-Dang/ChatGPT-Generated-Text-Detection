Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. I see nothing wrong with eating meat- animals were made for it. Well put! Cows can be either one or two of those things depending on their breed and how well treatedraised... but no more than that
