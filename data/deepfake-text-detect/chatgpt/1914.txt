Hi guys! To expand: Although I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman for example) a woman to their face and when talking about them that is what they are not really wanting, but this does not make me feel better. They're still male by my definition of the word even though you can argue semantics forever if it makes you or other people happy Yes, we know, SJWs use "female" colloquially instead - There's no way around the fact trans women are female..
