It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. It can also be problematic. We are increasingly aware that in addition to traditional ethnic groups, religions, political parties, sports clubs, etc., there are also groups that use the Internet and social media to recruit members and spread their message. There are even whole subcultures that have emerged on the Internet such as the 'anti-social' movement that promotes a more introverted lifestyle. It is often difficult to tell whether these groups are innocuous or potentially dangerous. The academic study of 'group behaviour' has been around for a long time. This research has generally been conducted using participants in laboratory studies. The subjects are typically asked to perform a series of tasks that reveal their group dynamics. The individual subject is studied as an isolated unit but their actions can be used to draw conclusions about group behaviour. Such studies have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of groups. Unfortunately, the subjects in the laboratory have certain limitations. They are limited to what is happening in the laboratory and cannot tell us how their behaviour would be in other situations. The only way to find this out is to study real groups of people and observe how they behave in their natural environments. A recent study, led by the psychologist Professor Sebastian Stober at the University of Kent, UK, did just this. The researchers observed the behaviour of groups of people in the real world and related the behaviour to the lab studies. The results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study involved groups of people who were asked to complete a variety of tasks on computers. The subjects were separated into groups of two to five people. The tasks were designed to reveal how the subjects interact with each other. Some of the tasks were group based and others were individual based. The researchers were able to record the subjects' behaviour by tracking where the cursor was being moved on the computer screens. One of the findings of the study was that even in the simple computer tasks the subjects were divided into different types of groups. A group could be identified as 'co-operative', 'dominant', 'quiet' or 'dominated'. The researchers found that the type of group members formed was related to their behaviour in the lab studies. They concluded that the behaviour of the individuals could be predicted from the results of the lab studies. The researchers also looked at the effect of gender on group dynamics. In the lab study the males were more dominant and aggressive than the females. In the real world group tasks the males were again more dominant and aggressive but only when it was a male-only group. The same was not true of mixed gender groups where the males and females were more equal. The researchers suggest that this may be because women are more likely to be able to avoid aggression through communication and negotiation. The researchers concluded that group behaviour is very similar to lab behaviour. However, the real world results provide us with a more realistic picture of how real groups function. They also show that it is possible to use real world data to validate the results of laboratory studies. This could be useful in the future to predict how certain groups will behave in particular situations and could be useful in identifying dangerous groups and individuals. The study was carried out by researchers from the University of Kent, University of Bamberg, University of Mannheim and University of Groningen. It is not uncommon for animal groups to split into subgroups with different personalities. But new research has found that these group divisions can also occur within human communities. Researchers from the University of Kent and the University of Mannheim, Germany, have found that even very small groups of people can display different characteristics. In a series of experiments, the researchers analysed data from computer games played online by groups of people. In these games, the groups are divided into pairs. The teams then compete against each other and try to score as many points as possible. The researchers found that pairs who were successful at the game split into different subgroups, with one subgroup concentrating on making money and the other on building wealth. When one subgroup became more successful, the other subgroup would then start to cooperate with them. The study is published in the journal PNAS and was funded by the European Research Council, the German Research Foundation and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. The researchers studied games played online by teams of two people. The games were designed to be very simple, with one player in each team playing with a computer, and the other controlling the computer. Each team played the game repeatedly and the team's score was then compared to previous scores to
