Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I don't think they understand the fundamental differences between color and tone though. But what makes it interesting is how different people can sometimes see things differently (like a person who has had an eye operation). I was thinking about this today as well. The difference in perception of colour is quite fascinating; both when you look at paint on paper vs with naked eyes - or even from ink on paper vs printed out on paper etc... It seems strange but then again there isn't really anything else like that around us! Colour is such a beautiful thing, I love it so much:)
