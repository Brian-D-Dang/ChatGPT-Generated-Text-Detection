This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding. For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force you to watch all of your sporting events over the internet when there is so much more out there available for free. I'm not saying this isn't an issue, but what the hell "free" means? That's like if my family wanted to watch Family Guy on TV but they had to pay 10 per episode. Free as in "no money necessary to view"?
