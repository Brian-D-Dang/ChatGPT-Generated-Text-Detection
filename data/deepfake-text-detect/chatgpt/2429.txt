America has accomplished nothing in its history that makes it worth of such widespread pride and love by its people (particularly this time of the year). Every event that Americans celebrate is either complete bullshit, or just a cheap imitation. You honestly think American independence day isn't an important occasion? I don't understand why you would say something as stupidly ignorant as "it's fake." There are lots of things to be proud about but America being independent from British rule was absolutely one of them!
