Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news x] , [x] after delivering a speech in which she said that "for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight and sound of black men being shot by police is still too vivid for them to contemplate." Commenting on her comments, many were quick to voice their disapproval. Oh no! A congresswoman made an offhand remark about how not all cops are evil! God forbid someone point out racism when it's happening!! How dare anyone say anything critical of this administration!!!
