Bar soap is all you need. And you dont wash your hair at all, you just rinse it. Sometimes I use shampoo, maybe once in a month or two, if you have short hair, you might not need shampoo at all. It's also good to use a conditioner after you rinse your hair to keep it healthy and hydrated. As for bar soap, it can be a great choice for cleaning your body, but it's important to choose a gentle formula that won't dry out your skin. You might also consider using a separate face cleanser that's designed specifically for your skin type. Is there anything else I can help you with?
