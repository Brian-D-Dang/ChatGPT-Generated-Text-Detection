The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line in our discussion, but I think a lot of people take it for granted as if they are equivalent. On this website alone (I know because I checked), more than 100 articles have used "legalization" or "abolition" to refer to moral stances on abortion. Abortion - like any other human activity we engage with socially - should be considered by lawmakers not only according to what is best morally but also based upon sound economics. To illustrate my point even further: how many times has anyone heard an economist say something along these lines? Certainly no one said anything about legalizing murder in order to save lives! And while some may argue against both arguments from economists, David Markson did just that over at Salon recently stating his opinion regarding legalization vs. abolition. In short: advocates of legal abortion do so out of self interest; those for criminalizing abortion seek justice due to religious beliefs rather than fear of potential economic consequences from doing away with prohibition. For example, Michael Specter writes here that labeling all forms of contraception as abortifacients would help make the case for eliminating them legally speaking: There's simply too much evidence that women who use contraceptives have fewer unintended pregnancies than women who don't - which means less abortions. That could reduce unwanted kids by nearly half. It makes sense that outlawing abortion laws will lead to less babies being born alive without mothers' consent...it seems obvious really, you wouldn't want your child to die before getting a chance to livehave a proper life either....so why then does abortion still exist!? If you're going to ban birth control pills, condoms, diaphragms, etc., moms aren't using them anyway right now anyways so what good is banning them going to do??
