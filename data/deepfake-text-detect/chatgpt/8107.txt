I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most important when you're using liquid foundation or an airbrush; no need for your handiwork if the "product" does all that work! 2) It's expensiveand it doesn't seem worth 30-50 per tube just so my face looks better (that said: donating some old stuff would be nice). 3.) My friends who wear more concealer than me have blackheads above their upper lip which are totally gross because they look wetooze out around them as well. So really? 4 What has worked best in terms achieving natural looking skin without having obvious lines at 25 years young...is wearing sunscreen every morning before applying moisturizer even after removing make up from previous nights events else there will always remain one line between where two products were applied due
