First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and often result in the unequal treatment of marginalized communities. However, despite my personal beliefs, I understand that some individuals may require incarceration in order to protect society from harm. In those cases, I believe it is important to focus on rehabilitation and restorative justice rather than punishment alone. This can include access to education, job training, mental health services, and other resources that can help individuals successfully reintegrate into society after their release. Additionally, I support measures to address the root causes of crime, such as poverty, lack of access to resources, and inequality, in order to reduce the need for incarceration in the first place.
