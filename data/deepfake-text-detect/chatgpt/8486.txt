There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man wearing women's undies? Is that OK?). Why would you want to leave the house without clothes on at all times anyway when people are already staring or taking pictures with their phones for no reason whatsoever??
