So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor ethnicity because they do not hold institutional power or privilege over the dominant culture. This means that racism is not an equal exchange between different groups - it is a power dynamic where the dominant group holds the institutional power to systematically oppress the less dominant group. When it comes to the "appropriation of white supremacy," this refers to non-white people adopting or participating in aspects of white culture or behaviors that reinforce white supremacist beliefs or norms. This can include supporting or promoting racist systems, language, or ideas, or even adopting physical attributes to look more "white-passing." The idea of "reverse racism" is a myth because, as I stated earlier, racism requires systemic power and privilege to oppress a group based on their skin color or ethnicity. Racism against white people as a group is not possible because white people hold the majority of institutional power and privilege in our society. However, individual white people can still experience discrimination or prejudice based on other factors such as class or religion. It's important to remember that these are complex issues and can be difficult to understand fully. It's always best to approach these conversations with an open mind and willingness to learn more.
