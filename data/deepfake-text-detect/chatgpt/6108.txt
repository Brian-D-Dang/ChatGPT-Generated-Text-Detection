I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was shocked to discover the film's historical accuracy. It was completely inaccurate, at least in the parts that I found most interesting. I was shocked because the film claimed to be historically accurate. It isn't. That's disappointing. I've seen a few other films like that. I guess I'm just spoiled by the attention to detail that's available in today's CGI world. It was the same with the most recent version of Ender's Game. I did read the book, and it is an amazing book. The film, however, seems to have forgotten that it's based on a book. The Imitation Game, with its vague notion of how computer science might have worked in the 1940s, and its complete and total ignorance of the politics of the time, is a film that tries to have it both ways. It wants to be historically accurate, but it also wants to make a point about how society treats people based on their sexuality. As a result, it fails at both. Now, I'm not saying that gay people weren't mistreated in the 1940s. They were. I'm not saying that they weren't persecuted. They were. That was a dark time for the gay community. I'm not saying that there wasn't a stigma surrounding homosexuality. There was. But the way it's handled in The Imitation Game is completely inappropriate. The film claims to be historically accurate, but it completely ignores the political climate of the time. It's not just the fact that the film is historically inaccurate. It's the fact that the film's inaccuracy is being used to make a point that isn't historically accurate. The film suggests that the British government was afraid to let the world know that a gay man solved the Enigma code. They weren't. That's a flat-out lie. They wanted to celebrate the fact that a gay man solved the Enigma code. They did it, but only as an aside. The British government didn't care if people knew he was gay, but they didn't want to get caught up in the controversy surrounding homosexuality at the time. This isn't just an issue of historical accuracy. It's an issue of common sense. In the 1940s, the British government couldn't be seen to be promoting homosexuality. It just wasn't possible. Britain wasn't some free-thinking liberal country. It was a conservative and strongly Christian country. The government had to make it clear that they did not approve of homosexuality. If the British government had really wanted to, they could have made a big deal about the fact that a gay man solved the code. The fact is, that would have been the wrong thing to do. The government could have avoided the controversy if they'd just been quiet about it. The government could have avoided the controversy if they'd just been honest about it. The British government didn't care if Turing was gay. They just didn't want to get caught up in the politics of the time. The British government wasn't lying about it. They weren't being dishonest about it. They just had to handle it the way they did. The British government could have made a big deal out of Turing's homosexuality, but it would have been the wrong thing to do. The film also suggests that Turing was arrested because he was gay. Again, that's not true. He was arrested because he was spying for the Russians. The film claims that Turing had to be careful about his behaviour because of the stigma surrounding homosexuality. That's not true. Turing had to be careful about his behaviour because of the stigma surrounding spying. There was nothing in the way Turing behaved that would have led people to suspect he was gay. Turing was a large man, with a large appetite, and a long beard. He wasn't a cliched stereotype of a gay man. He was a normal looking man. But, in the film, he was careful about how he behaved because he was worried about the stigma surrounding homosexuality. That's inaccurate. He was careful about how he behaved because he was worried about the stigma surrounding spying
