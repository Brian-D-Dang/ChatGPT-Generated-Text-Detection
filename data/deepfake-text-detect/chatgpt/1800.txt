Let me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers , but rather my expectations for the time period at which they were made (mid to late nineties). Goldeneye was one of those games where you could just get better if you kept playing it over and over again... It took quite a while before I learned what all the little tricks are, lol
