Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as I live in a socialist nation where the culture is still young, that's not going to work out just yet. I'm from Hungary myself. It's very weird how we feel about it. I even have some relatives that are friendly to us but not against us. We also have a lot of people who love Hungarian cuisine.
