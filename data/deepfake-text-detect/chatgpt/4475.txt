In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn't work that way and we have to make do with the real thing. Most often than not this means using our own two eyes (or camera) along with some clever strategy and reasoning skills. To help out those who are struggling at home or just want more challenge, I've compiled here several of my favorite classic puzzle images for all ages from around the web and put them into one easy-to-print pdf file: Puzzle Printouts.

Jewels 21 Three Little Pigs Mystery House - Version 1 A picture is worth a thousand words. Be sure to support your local newspaper by reading their front page every day. You'll learn so much about current events as well as new jokes and interesting facts! It pays off big time when the reporter needs an illustration at midnight after reading 3 articles over 2 hours... Three little pigs building a house made of straw, sticks, twigs, leaves and mud sat down upon a hillside and said "We can build a better house!" One little pig went inside and came back outside saying "I think I found the roof!!" He then ran away again and returned shortly thereafter to say "Hey look everybody!! I built the damnest house ever!!!!" As always, if anyone has any great links they want shared, please send me a note and I'll add them right away.;)
