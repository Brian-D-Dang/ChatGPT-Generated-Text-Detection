Being transgender and wanting surgeryhormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think it is important to acknowledge and respect the experiences and choices of transgender individuals when it comes to their physical and emotional well-being. Gender identity and expression are complex and personal, and can vary from person to person. For some transgender individuals, surgery and hormonal treatment may be a necessary part of their transition process to feel more aligned with their gender identity. It is important to support and respect their decisions, and work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting society.
