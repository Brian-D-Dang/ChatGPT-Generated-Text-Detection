The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line in these things but for some reason this issue isn't front and center at all times (some people are so stupid). I'm going to try to explain why on here as well. There certainly can be moral arguments against legalizing abortions, especially considering how many women die during them or because they had an illegal abortion (and even back then you could get killed if a doctor didn't want their license taken away from them for performing one). Many medical conditions have been caused by unwanted pregnancies; we don't think those doctors should pay for the condition with jail time though. But what about just legal reasons? There must be plenty of cases where the mother would like to abort her child. Sure, she could do terrible things to herself and kill a baby accidentally while taking medicine or something but again, that has nothing to do with whether or not abortions should be legalized - both situations leave innocent lives dead. It doesn't matter who says no - my mom, grandma, brother, sister, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, friend, whoever else - none of us wants anyone hurt in such a way. So really, once a woman gives birth, regardless of circumstance, doesn't she already have enough sin on her soul without adding more guilt onto top of it later? What does it say about the state that allows someone to take a life unless there was consent? Does allowing any kind of crime equal having no remorse over committing said crimes? You aren't forced into criminality by the government, nor will your actions cause others to go through the same thing that you did. If anything, you're being punished yourself for making decisions that affect other people. In essence, the act itself is morally reprehensible irrespective of whatever circumstances may surround it. This means that society shouldn't encourage it either; if someone wishes to pursue their own desires and selfishness than let them seek out ways to destroy themselves but please don't force our hands to commit similar acts ourselves. The fact remains that killing another human being is wrong ethically and legally speaking, which makes the position that abortion is okay contradictory, but I'll address some points. One argument I hear fairly often is "so what?." As you've probably gathered, I am referring specifically to comments regarding abortion laws rather than the actual practice of abortion itself. I consider myself very liberal, yet I still believe that abortion law is completely backwards. Abortion should definitely NOT be considered murder unless performed after 20 weeks of pregnancy since animals are slaughtered inhumanely every day and we eat them anyways... Why treat humans differently in regards to slaughteringkilling, yet allow this sort of behavior towards unborn babies? That sounds barbaric to me - it's basically saying that killing is ok in theory but only if the victim looks exactly right (or close) to how you would look when alive. Can somebody justify this difference? Apparently so! A lot of people refer to the idea that unborn children become mammals around 20 weeks old due to cells developing properly. While I agree to an extent, what about when dealing with Down Syndrome or other genetic anomalies? Are they suddenly less important now that they've developed further? Aren't they still living beings deserving of basic rights? And also, why restrict this rule solely to fetuses instead of everyone? After 20 weeks (assuming embryo stage), small animal experimentation using painkillers is allowed, so why couldn't we use anesthesia during labor and delivery too? Just because human beings develop new organs earlier than mice, dogs, cats, etc., doesn't mean that they don't deserve protection until they reach adulthood. Animals and plants have always played second fiddle throughout history, despite being big contributors to modern science. If we need to study development of these organisms, they should receive proper care first before we start experimenting on them. We should see what happens before continuing onward. They may answer questions that the rest of humanity hasn't figured out yet. Not everything needs to end up in a lab to prove results. Take cars for instance they work fine without owning the technology behind them. Even though many people prefer gas engines nowadays, they are proven to perform better without electric motors. Same goes for airplanes and rockets...you know, original designs and standards. Do we stop producing planes altogether simply because of mechanical difficulties if we decide to put wings on chickens? No, obviously not but we almost never make those types of changes anymore anyway. Forcing baby production based off outdated methods might actually lead to worse outcomes in the long run. Another argument I frequently read comes from ridiculous strawmen and false dichotomies. Saying that pro-lifers hate sex workers seems silly given most seemingly intelligent individuals understand that prostitution takes place outside of marriage, creating a large demand for sexworkers. Yet that logic gets thrown in someone's face whenever anyone mentions protecting womens' health or rights just because those two ideas fall together. To illustrate: Let's assume that homosexuality were defined as unacceptably presentable luckless potentials setting off the reels for ten coirepermanentos-then match-offilatternira rrealism pan
