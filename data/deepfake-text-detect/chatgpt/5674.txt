From his personality to the way he handled Southern Succession there is nothing to dislike about him. He had intelligent, moderate religious views, he was compassionate and held the moral high ground. His response to the South Carolina Secession Convention was to consider it, then return with his answer. He saw this as a group of people that would not listen to reason or compromise, so he did not entertain the idea of secession for the remainder of his presidency. He was a firm supporter of the Union and did everything in his power to preserve it. He was the last president to publicly wear a black suit. Abolitionists and Radical Republicans wanted him to take a harder stance against the South and to execute the South's leaders for treason. He stood fast on his beliefs. He believed he had a moral obligation to do what was right and not what was popular. He was a democrat in spirit and believed in the collective power of the people. He firmly believed in the supremacy of the will of the people. He was highly educated and came from a wealthy background. He had a degree from Yale and was a lawyer. He was well read and well spoken. He was the eldest son of a well respected, wealthy family. He believed in his wife and her charitable work in the women's suffrage movement. He believed in his children, and he gave them a good education and nurtured their interests. He was the president of Columbia College, which became Columbia University. He was a man of great faith and deeply loved his wife. He had a calm disposition and did not believe in being provocative. He was slow to anger and would never lash out in the way his Southern counterparts would. He did not feel he had any flaws. He felt he was doing the best he could for the country and would continue to do so until his last breath.
