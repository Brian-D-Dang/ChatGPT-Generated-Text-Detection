Firstly, I'm using a throwaway because most people get really sensitive about this and my views are pretty much the antithesis of reddit (love Rand Paul, support Mens Rights, hate feminism). Secondly, it's not like any woman would want to do that. I am aware you're making an analogy between rape and circumcisions but saying "feminists never want men to have their genitals mutilated" is wrong as fuck. Many feminists actually believe in male circumcision being harmful for society while at the same time many males who are circumcised still believe they did nothing wrong; therefore, if anything. feminists should be supporting foreskins rights.
