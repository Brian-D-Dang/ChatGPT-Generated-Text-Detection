CMV: ISIS isn't about the US, it isn't about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isn't about us, and to those who say that we are responsible for ISIS's existence, I ask you this question: why is America not held accountable for creating a terrorist group in the first place? Sorry but what does "MOVES" mean?
