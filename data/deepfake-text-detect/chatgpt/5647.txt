Not trying to start a flame war, I'm looking for a new tablet and I would consider an ipad, but I just don't see the appeal just yet. What on earth do people do with them? I would need to be sold by someone who owns one. I have a new droid phone and love it. I'm not saying it can't do everything my PC does, but it would be nice to have a tablet to take with me that can do things like surfing the web, read a book, watch a movie, browse the web, check e-mail, and maybe even draw or do some light writing. I'm not asking for a ton of features, but I'm not sure what a tablet has that a phone doesn't. I got an Ipad to travel with, read books, and check email. There are some cool apps you can get to use it for other stuff, but its not really a laptop replacement. I don't need one, but I'm kind of looking to replace my netbook (running Win 7) with something that is lighter, easier to carry and is more portable, plus has a better battery life. I've read that it is faster than a netbook, but I would not replace my netbook with it. I think I would rather get a cheap Windows laptop than an iPad. I think the laptop would be easier to customize, and run a lot more software than the iPad. Plus I would probably end up with a netbook. I'm not saying its a bad product, I just don't see the appeal for me. I want to replace my netbook, but I'd rather get a Windows laptop. I'm a heavy laptop user, and I still don't see the appeal of an iPad. I have a Kindle Fire, and the Kindle app is a lot of fun, but I'd rather have a real tablet. I just don't see the value of the iPad. I am with you. I have a Droid X and love it. I was looking into the iPad for my wife. But it seems to be a huge waste of money. I had 3 people telling me to get the iPad. I told them it would be a waste of money. So I brought her a Droid X. I can see what she does with it and it makes sense. I still don't think the iPad is worth the money. I just don't see the value of the iPad. I don't want to carry around a big tablet, I want a small, lightweight tablet.
