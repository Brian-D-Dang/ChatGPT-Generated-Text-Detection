To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For instance, arguments based on the potential harm to society or the potential harm to the individuals involved are not applicable for homosexuality and therefore should not be used in the case of incestuous marriage. However, there are still valid arguments against allowing incestuous marriage. One such argument is that it can lead to an unequal power dynamic in the relationship, particularly when it comes to parent-child or sibling relationships. These power dynamics can lead to manipulation, coercion, and abuse, and can also lead to distorted family relationships and dynamics. Additionally, there is a concern that incestuous relationships could lead to genetic defects in any children that are born as a result of the union. This is a valid concern that needs to be addressed if incestuous marriage were to be legally recognized. Overall, while the arguments against incestuous marriage are different from those against homosexuality, they are still valid and should be carefully considered before making any decisions related to the legalization of such a union.
