Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. They just get together and say whatever they want to the world without giving a fuck about anything else but how it sounds. I find this opinion hard to believe because there's so many gems out there made by some of the best artists in rap history (Kendrick Lamar, Schoolboy Q). It might take me awhile to get accustomed to your taste, but I'm sure you'll come around very soon as long as you listen to more music other than Kanye West songs:)
