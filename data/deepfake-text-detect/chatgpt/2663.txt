I'm a lifelong veggie, and I've been vegan for a while in the past although I'm not anymore. I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being vegetarian or vegan as long as there is an animal product used at some point to provide that nutrition they need. That said, if someone wants to be vegan, they should be able to eat what they want and it's nobody else's business but their own and theirs alone whether they choose to consume meat products or not Agreed with everything except "nobody elses' business." It absolutely affects us all when people decide to eat animals after being told since birth that eating them is wrongimmoral etc...
