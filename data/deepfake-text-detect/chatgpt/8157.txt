Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of non-combatants and the reason for their use is highly suspect, regardless what argument you may wish make out as justification; 2) The bombings killed more innocent civilians than military men or women combined (estimates range from 130K - 200 K); 3.) Though it was not known at that time how badly radiation would affect those who survived being close enough when they exploded so many people did die later due largely because no one knew about having been within miles upon millions where released into sky by explosion anyways. This all happened despite very advanced science behind these weapons! 2b Why do critics believe we should? Because Japan chose surrender after bombing Hiroshima Nagasaki rather then continue with fighting which only could have resulted most likely if there had remained high probability Japanese leaders responsible might well also perished along side citizens living around targeted areas whose deaths will never rightfully now occur given such logic i've laid before Because maybe Hitler really didn't want WWII much less its horrendous aftermath."That's why folks like me are inclined towards an alternative conclusion that strong urge among humans toward self preservation often trumps justiceas example consider first rule: "Do unto others...a commandment Jesus Christ made himself famous preaching but none better describe his character nor seems fitting here, especially considering he too died violently without receiving world wide accolades...and secondly remember human nature evolved over millennia breeding survival skills practiced constantly! Any person seeking truth needs look inward far past easeful comforts easily found outside themselvesif justifiably angry must work through painstaking process required facing oneself honestly - - in other words guilt while good thing sometimes necessary usually leads nowhere useful even though inevitable...sooner move forward repenting previous misdeed against fellow man....but getting back onto topic..I know some readers still don' t see my point let alone grasp reasoning..it'll take awhile longer until everyone has grasped everything needed including myself 'cause evolution happens slowly - only way thru thicket always follow path leading directly away form danger; until next post....have fun!!
