I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. I just want a safe place where we can have our own beliefs without fear of persecution or abuse. How does it feel being bisexual?
