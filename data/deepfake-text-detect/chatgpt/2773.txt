I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured to take her husband's name if she doesn't want it (or thinks that taking his would make things awkward), but at the same time this has been my experience: My female friend changed her name from Jillian to Sarah. She says that the first few times someone addressed her as "Ms Jones," it really made her feel like an outsider or a second-class citizen. This happened in my high school English class when we had guest speakers come by and they introduced themselves using their first names only. The teachers never called them Ms. so and so for some reason...
