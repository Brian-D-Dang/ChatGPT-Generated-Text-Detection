tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to rugby league on TV or online, that's what gets me excited about it because there are so many different interpretations of the season and how each team is being played out there in the season. Unfortunately for the NRL Premiership Rugby League teams, it seems like every week we're reminded how the NRL has been handed over to the NRL leagues media rights holders and the NRL clubs have no control over their own storylines. I've watched every NRL match since the NRL season began this year with my teenage boyfriend because rugby league fans know how much they want to see matches be televised live! The excitement isn't always good enough if you think about it though... can confirm that a lot of it depends upon which NRL club plays which game at the weekend:) This means you get to experience these games instead of watching them aired locally somewhere else!!
