My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered often include "she," "hehim" or "they" (self-identified). The purpose of the new pronouns can also refer to things such as 'hisher': 'your', 'you' or 'their' rather than 'themselves' hidden in the past tense; also, pronouns which could mean 'husband' around a man who gives masculine pronouns those discussed earlier while referring to him alone from now on outwards; affixed over names such as 'wife', 'daughter', 'mother' before unpronounceable words like 'fathers' counterparts; 'brother' after titles in the present tense, 'girl' preceding titles this way by optional prefixes eg 'mate' instead of 'girls father'. The new pronouns include 'then how shall I?', 'what am i?', 'I think you should call me because this looks nice' followed by 'my dad' where 'Dad' denotes fatherhood but 'dad' suggests affection towards children. The three new pronouns used were collected amongst other examples provided by various publications including the Dictionary of German Polygrammar (Dictionary of German Grammatical Terms) and the dictionary of German dialects (Der Spiegel Online). According to Birnbaum the new pronouns have become obsolete because there was no mention of them previously in German literature until now. Birnbaum goes so far as quoting Friedrich Nietzsche: "the speech boundaries between nouns and verbs are separated entirely... used according to their meanings... [therefore] the meaning comes into place elsewhere without needing any translation." Birnbaum further says that the use of the new pronouns has been ignored since the introduction of the Arabic script in the 19th century and it is important when translating one language into another.
