Hi Reddit. With all the news over the past couple weeks regarding Caitlyn Jenner's transition and coming out, I feel now is a good time to discuss gender's role in sports. I've always found it odd that Olympians are allowed to compete as women on their first day of competition. Women have been competing against men for decades even before they were officially recognized as such by the IOC (and FIFA too). These days, most major sporting events use "women" athletes or facilities, but why? It seems like bad optics since there may be biological advantages between male and female bodies when competing. But how exactly does this affect game play? Are there any rules about which body type can compete based on sex? If so, what happens if an athlete who was born with both sexes has a daughter? Can she still compete as either male or female? Or will her daughter require surgery to avoid having a double-sex identity? What about cross-country skiers; do they have to keep saying they're from Canada just because there isn't an official definition yet for what constitutes a Canadian? Is this something that should be decided at the Olympic level where possible? Lastly, is there any legal implications for being transgender under these circumstances that people don't talk about much? This question is not only relevant today but also pertains to our current society. The extreme and deluded view that gender doesn't exist anymore has caused people to lose credibility in everything from politics to science. People are politically incorrect and have accepted false ideas without questioning them, leading to failures in all walks of life including race, religion and sexual orientation. This leads us to consider whether gender can survive situations while remaining respected and fair. Some say yes, others no, some think it shouldn't, and we ask ourselves: How does gender impact sport? Gender can change through hormones and puberty and experience. A woman could become a man later, undergo hormone therapy during gender reassignment surgery, and then change back to the original gender. Gender roles can vary throughout time, making it easy to confuse one sex with another. Just think about Jane Austen! She wrote about sex differences in marriage, and it shows how important this is to many people outside of the scientific community. In the North American community, it's considered normal for two males to marry each other whereas biologically females cannot marry men simply due to biology. There are lots of ways by which gender affects sports. For example, transgenderism is becoming more common in professional sports leagues around the world. Athletes who identify themselves as nonbinary sometimes participate in female sports categories because they believe themselves to be neither male nor female. There are examples of athletes whose gender doesn't match up with their physical attributes, such as a female boxer transitioning into a male boxer, or a male tennis player transitioning into a female tennis player. Even though transgenderism is relatively rare among athletes, there are several documented cases across multiple sports where transgender individuals competed successfully. The Olympics have historically honored achievements made prior to 1920. However, recent years have seen an increasing number of organizations (including the United States Olympic Committee) demanding that the longstanding rules set forth by the International Olympic Committee and World Sports Confederation should be modified. Several changes have already happened including the introduction of mixed gender competitions, allowing athletes with birth genders listed as "X," "Y," "Z," etc., along with male and female competitors. There is a tremendous amount of transgender representation in the U.S., but this hasn't affected international participation or medals won internationally. Additionally, certain countries allow athletes who self-identify as transgender to compete on national teams rather than using assigned genders. Thus far, the NCAA has not followed suit. Allowing transgender athletes on college campuses would make sense given the unique issues facing transgenders within the collegiate environment. In my opinion, there are some reasons why the IOC and WSC want to change the existing rules governing the concept of gender. First, the idea of a single gender on the medal stand causes controversy because women don't have a natural advantage over men physically. While women dominate in terms of athleticism, strength, endurance, power, and technique, men usually win more victories while training for athletic competitions. Organizing an event that requires serious physical fitness would likely mean moving away from that concept. Second, traditional definitions tend to exclude transgender and intersex people who are able to compete according to their preferred gender identities. Transgender and intersex people often suffer from internalized transphobia and discrimination that can lead to depression and suicide attempts. They need to be protected from unfair prejudice and discrimination. Finally, the IOC wants to bring "better fairness" to its worldwide competition schedule, perhaps by ensuring that biologically opposite men and women never face each other when taking part in championship matches.
