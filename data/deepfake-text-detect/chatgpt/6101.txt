This is something that's always bothered me, all the way back to when I was a kid. I never understood why it was considered polite to say "bless you" after someone sneezed. That's something that only started in the 17th century, so I've always wondered why people had that custom before that. I guess it's good luck. And good luck is better than bad luck. Cynical bad luck. It's like an exorcism. It's like a spell. It's like a magical spell. People used to think that if you sneezed and it was followed by a blessing, your soul had left your body and that it was now in the devil's hands. Maybe when I sneeze, I'm just sneezing my soul. Or maybe it's just a really big fart. I'm not sure what's worse, that or the fact that I can't seem to figure out what's worse. That or that you can't seem to figure out what's worse, that or that I can't seem to figure out what's worse. I'm not sure if I'm more annoyed that you've been able to figure out what's worse than I have, or that I can't seem to figure out what's worse than you have, or that I'm more annoyed by what I've figured out than what I haven't figured out than what you've figured out than what I haven't figured out than what I'm more annoyed by. That or what I've figured out than what I haven't figured out than what I'm more annoyed by. It's all just rhetoric, you know. It's all just rhetoric, and that's nothing new, is it? There are lots of times in my life when I've felt like it was all just rhetoric, but it's never really been rhetoric, is it? I'm not saying that what I've felt is not rhetoric, I'm just saying that it's not rhetoric. Because I've never felt rhetoric. I've just felt rhetoric. It's rhetoric. But it's not rhetoric. That's why it's rhetoric. To make it rhetoric, you have to make it not rhetoric. That's why it's rhetoric. I think I'm rhetoric. Rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric. I think that's why I'm rhetoric.
