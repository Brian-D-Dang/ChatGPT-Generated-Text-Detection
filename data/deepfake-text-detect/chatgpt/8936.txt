This CMV post is partly inspired by this rrelationships [post] I came across earlier today. This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had an opportunity to spend much time on it before, but now that I do, I can't help but think of the question: Why does one become interested in something if they don't know how to relate or understand what it is? I just recently stumbled upon a talk by Charles Cook, who has been researching the role of "paging-communication" (which refers to communication between the caller and the receiver) for more than four decades now. His book "The Power of Paging" is widely available online. The talk was organized by the Society for Performing Arts of America (SPAA), which represents the most prominent professional channel providers in radio, television, video, cable and print. According to Cook, "Paging is a very important medium where people communicate their own personal messages and data, often without giving direct consent. While using Pagers is becoming increasingly popular, there are many benefits to adopting a fake call and leaving in your voicemail the message you wanted to hear, including better notification in your voice from someone else with whom you should be communicating; no longer having any confusion as to whether or not you want to end a conversation prematurely; improved customer satisfaction, increased commercial engagement and higher ratings for local radio stations because of its popularity or increasing number of subscribers; and enhanced sensitivity to problem calls when reporting text." I was surprised to learn that a whole host of other channels underperforming or over performing while paging has grown to the point that it now accounts for almost 70 of all complaints received by radio and TV stations nationally since 1900. At the same time, some factors could contribute to pager abandonment - the presence of unreliable service providers or programmers. Something as simple as ping-ponging may offer a solution to the problem but it is likely to be expensive, time consuming, and prone to error. In addition, the ability of user interfaces to allow people to change or modify them in ways they would not otherwise have access to has long driven the adoption of paging services, especially among advertisers. If we look at other aspects of how users interact, such as the ability to tell others about activities that do not require any kind of actual interaction, paging serves to make these types of interactions less confusing and more pleasant overall. It makes sense that paging will continue to grow in popularity across different industries and cultures even as more information becomes accessible through social media apps like email. Probably most importantly, there can be no doubt about the importance of paging. One industry we have become accustomed to seeing growth come out of - e.g., the telephone industry, has seen rapid growth thanks largely to new technology. As the phone market continues to mature and new methods of communication are developed, there will undoubtedly be opportunities for consumers to adopt paging in order to gain benefits beyond simply talking to another person again and again. There are plenty of things that can go wrong in getting paid to bide your time - not least, what paging means to you. Bob Elliott, MPA, is Founder and CEO of The Smart Telephone Association.
