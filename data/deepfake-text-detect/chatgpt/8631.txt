A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but he was practically the only one there who couldn't get his hands on them. I don't know how many people do this, but when you're an adult and your parents have gone through with getting a ticket for you at some point in their lives that doesn't leave any room for you to be happy. My mom wouldn't let me go until I was 28 as a kid (and it's still going strong today).
