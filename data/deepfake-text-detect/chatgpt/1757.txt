Disclaimer: this talk of secession may not be present everywhere in the United States, but it is more than prevalent where I live, so I'm going off that. To me, a good definition for "American" would include people from North America as well as South and Central America and Canada (with Alaska being an exception). The US Constitution defines American citizens as meaning only those who are born on U.S soil or possess citizenship through birthright which does exclude Mexicans unless they can prove their parentage to have been born there too...and even then they cannot become nationals until they reach 18 years old..in most cases under age 16 without having lived here before, but exceptions do exist according to interpretation by Congress like admitting Mexican immigrants legally married into the United States if one spouse was born here
