A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but not nearly as impressive or memorable as some other Fourth's we've had here in the past. My son was born during the summer months; so when he started school this fall he now has an entire year under his belt (most kids start kindergarten at age 5). But it took me awhile to get together with my BFF, who is also mommy to two little ones...and who happened to be over visiting while her husband played golf that weekend. We grabbed drinks before dinner, then went for a long walk along the lakefront- hand holding, watching our feet crunch through all sorts of leaves: yellow birch, red maple, American elm....putting forth their bright autumn colors by firework standards. When we got back home we made a small cake (like 4"sq) out of cherries from yet another box mix, brewed up iced tea to go with them, spread a thin layer of buttercream icing across each one, added more sprinkles than usual because they make everything taste better afterwards. Thenbaked! I think you can see where this story will end up. Because even though I am sure she watched South Park religiously growing up, there have been times since then when I haven't given her much credit as far as book smarts are concerned. Like today, for instance, since she remembered her own birthday, found out both birthdays of hers last week, told me how many days until Christmas and figured out what day of the month it was with just a quick look at the calendar. And yesterday she brought us lunch and left again without saying anything about it. Just like always. So when she came into the kitchen today, carrying something wrapped in foil and looking very pleased with herself, containing no holiday cheer whatsoever, I asked "What did Santa bring you?" She replied, "Oh nothing!" Then off the top of her head, she said:"But they reminded me of my anniversary." (Okay Mom not only do you know how old your child is going to be on her next birthday...you may actually BE able to figure out if she'll still be alive.) Meaningful post? Absolutely. Humor? Certainly not.Hilarious? Unfortunately yes.Did I laugh somewhere between tears and uncontrollable giggling? You betcha!Post length?: 2 12 hours - full steam ahead!! We're having our first family picnic tomorrow outside, weather permitting (meaning low 60's), with food already prepared. My hubby works nights and doesn't feel like cooking on account of doing things in bed (it requires work anyway, lol!) So his mother has agreed to help cook. Note Her specialties include salads and pasta dishes. So yeah...lots of saucy goodness for everyone to enjoy later. I don't trust the oven too well after playing with it overnight and burning down my house once upon a time. So we used kitty litter instead. It worked perfectly! Heck, that stuff's great for pizza crust too. Did you ever notice that? Anyway, we're planning on eating early sometime around dusk and running errands (maybe just grocery shopping?) after sunset. Does anyone else pull those kinds of shenanigans?? Oh, and I'm bringing a camera, but I'm NOT telling anybody exactly WHY:) Update The first pic is taken after supper tonight. Feel free to click on them for a closeup view. And finally, because I couldn't resist, being the girlie-girl type that I am-here's a couple pics from this morning of the girls enjoying breakfast before starting on their projects. They enjoyed picking raspberries. Also, remember us mentioning headphones earlier? So cute when we put Jenni's 'boombox' headset on.-Mimi
