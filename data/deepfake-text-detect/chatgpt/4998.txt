I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg , "You're being watched," to dismiss any kind of negative feedback). Before I go on further, this is just an example of a TV show I've seen recently. A "trigger warning" would be a series of warnings or phrases such as "We need your permission before we take offense at what you watch." This means that if something causes someone to think twice about watching the show, they shouldn't watch it again - they should consider skipping ahead and checking out the next episode instead for that reason alone! So there's really no point in letting people know beforehand that you might not like their reaction; it only makes them feel better when later episodes are released anyway because that means everyone else feels less guilty afterwards!
