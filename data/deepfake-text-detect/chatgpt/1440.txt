Just as the title says, I firmly believe that the modern interpretation of the hipster does not truly exist and never has. I'm going to link an article from two weeks ago (from a related thread) about how I think people are over-interpreting what is happeningand it's pretty much my general opinion on this whole subject: I love reading these articles but I don't have time right now so if anyone wants me to summarize them for you in one or more posts please feel free:)
