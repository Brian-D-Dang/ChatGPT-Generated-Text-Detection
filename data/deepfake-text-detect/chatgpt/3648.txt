While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established individuals a bit troubling. Respect should be a basic human right, granted to everyone regardless of their age, gender, race, or any other characteristic. However, I do believe that mutual respect between individuals should be based on positive actions and behaviors, rather than simply being expected or demanded. It's important for individuals to treat each other with dignity and respect, recognizing each other's value and worth as human beings. This can be achieved through open communication, active listening, empathy, and a willingness to learn and grow from each other. Ultimately, respect is something that should be freely given and received in any healthy relationship, not earned or demanded through arbitrary standards.
