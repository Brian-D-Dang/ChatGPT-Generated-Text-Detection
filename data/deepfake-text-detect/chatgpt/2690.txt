I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other people's tattoos, to see what kind of things are cool these days. But when you get your own ink done, that shit ain't great new stuff! It will be all about YOU. So either take part in some search for inspiration (which is fun!) or just go ahead with whatever you want right now. And as far as ideas for placement: if you have a sleeve idea already, look up images on Google to find out where artists put their pieces. Tattoos can be any size from an inch square and up; big ones are more expensive but there really isn't such thing as too big (except maybe your wallet). You aren't going to become a famous artist unless you make a career choice based on art rather than money, anyway - so spend enough time looking around until something "clicks." Or ask someone else who has been getting work done professionally whether heshe would recommend this or that specific image. If nothing turns out exactly right after much searching, then try again another day. You want one that looks nice, doesn't cost a crazy amount of money, hasn't been overdone yet by those same types of people whose opinions matter most to kids nowadays...and fits well within your physical limits.
