To me, online entertainment is such a flip of a coin. You either get a partnership or you don't, and even if you do get the partnership, there's no saying how long it will last," said Dave Holmes, co-founder of Supercell. "The problem with partnership is that you have to give up control over your game at some point because someone else owns all the rights." And while partnerships are rare nowadays as the market for games like Candy Crush and FarmVille has shifted towards casual players who play on mobile devices rather than PCs, Holmes says he believes they could return in full force once more developers realise their titles can be played by an audience of millions around the world without being available directly through a single publisher.
