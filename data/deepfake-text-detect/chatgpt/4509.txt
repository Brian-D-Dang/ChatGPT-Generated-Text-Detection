I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. There's a huge amount of money borrowed every year from parents and grandparents that could be going towards education instead. But most people don't think about it until their kids are in college, and by then they're firmly committed to paying for the whole thing with credit cards or cash saved up over years of working low pay jobs (or no job). In other words: we should consider this as an investment problem, not as a spending problem. We need to decide how much we want our children to have access to affordable higher education over time, and spend accordingly now. If we don't do anything about the kind of loans that exist today, there will come a day when you can only buy your kid a single term paper on trust funds. What happens after that? You'll probably never see them again! They'll just vanish off into some academic institution somewhere. Being able to afford good food doesn't mean one has any more than anyone else if that means eating once a month rather than three times a week. Not having enough money does not make life unfair; it makes things harder but life goes on without all the luxuries and necessities. I know what I'm talking about here, I've been through it myself. The point being: everything you gain from buying stuff today won't last forever if you throw away too much tomorrow.
