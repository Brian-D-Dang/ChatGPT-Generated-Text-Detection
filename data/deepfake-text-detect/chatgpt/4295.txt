I believe that a private business should be able to deny service to anyone for any reason. For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, they cannot deny the service at all. The problem with this is that you can't just not want to serve someone; there are laws against discrimination based on race and sex, so businesses have to be symmetrical about it. I'm sure some businesses would be willing to send their employees into black neighborhoods periodically but keeping out all whites wouldn't work well.
