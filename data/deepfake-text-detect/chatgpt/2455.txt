This is something that's always bothered me, all the way back to when I was a kid. I never understood why it was considered polite to say "bless you" after someone sneezed - and not just because my parents were Jehovah's Witnesses who didn't believe in God or any other supernatural beings.) Although we may be conditioned from childhood on to think that saying bless you is an act of courtesy (or even kindness), some researchers have found evidence for another possible explanation: It could actually help us recover faster by making our body realize there has been a problem with its respiratory system. The paper published this week, titled A Sneeze Reflex Deflection Model For Blessing After Sneezing, details how sniffling can serve as one sign your child might need medical attention if they don't cough up mucus within 30 seconds. But "there are no current recommended guidelines regarding whether people should wait before offering support following coughing-related adverse events, such as sneezes," the authors wrote. So what do doctors suggest? Well... nothing at all! This research suggests - at least until further studies prove otherwise - that thanking whomever called out your name could make for more effective healing than simply asking them to bless themselves.
