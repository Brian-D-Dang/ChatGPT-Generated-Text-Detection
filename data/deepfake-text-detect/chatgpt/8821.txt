I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without Strava. The idea of using Strava is incredibly simple and intuitive. While we can use the platform on our phone at home or with a remote control, most people would have some experience with this app before they even started thinking about using it. That said, there are always many users who want to improve their knowledge regarding Strava by taking advantage of these apps' features. You'd be surprised how few folks actually know what the app does, nor do you need an expert who has even basic knowledge. Strava works perfectly as a training program for beginners. Those who already have been trained could easily adopt it if it was free. If you've got any questions please reach out to us directly via email.
