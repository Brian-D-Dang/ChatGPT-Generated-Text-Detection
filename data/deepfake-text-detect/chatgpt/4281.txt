First I think I should make all the clarifications I can. By "true Christian," I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ. There is no room for people who are not part of this particular group and continue on in their own ways with hypocrisy, sinfulness or other sins against God's law. As far as religion goes - that doesn't matter. We're talking about what it means to be a true Christian (or an adherent). I've also thought that maybe we could have some kind of criteria: 1) One must do so through their actions as well as words. You cannot justify your beliefs through any form of scripture you read because they never actually say what you believe. It's either statements made without evidence, lies, deceit, hypocrisy, etc...2) You need to do something in regards to helping others such as being willing to give to those less fortunate than yourself3) They need to take care of themselves both mentally and physically4) They need to respect God's gifts, commandments, and laws5) They need to lead by example6) If anyone disobeys you, leave them alone7) People will call you names like name-calling, gossiping, slander, oppression and much more. So, you may want to avoid that if at all possible8) Some people may try to convertpursue Christianity but no one has mastered it yet. The truth of the matter is no two Christians are alike; there really isn't anything that one person needs to do over another.9) You must adhere to certain rules based off of what God says10) You must learn from previous mistakes you may have made11) You don't have to follow every single word of Scripture, just enough to get you started12) Your focus should be on living out God's command: love everyone, as yourself and as he said: "Love one another, as I have loved you." btw, this site might seem a little too crazy for most people. But please understand that (as different Christians always have!) I am simply trying to help others become better followers of Jesus Christ. Please feel free to ask questions! Thanks for taking time to look into my website:)
