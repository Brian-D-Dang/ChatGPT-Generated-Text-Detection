Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move onto the next heinous crime they commit. I do not think this is a healthy approach to life in general nor to our society as a whole. The world has experienced an influx of mass murderers because we allow such a model to exist - the so called "American Way." The American way starts with the assumption of individual responsibility for their own actions and does away with legal systems to deal with violent crimes. It assumes an ethic based on self - reliance rather than authority and moral guidance; It takes only one or two well meaning but misguided individuals out of all human groups to create an environment ripe for the growth of psychopaths (which includes serial killers). We need to use our brains more wisely instead of guessing at the motives of another person's evil deeds by reading what was written about them on the Internet! We have become numb to the fact that there are people who behave badly simply because they want something and living our lives allowing others to put us down for being 'normal' which should never be accepted to begin with. A normal human being would seek help if he felt that his behavior had reached a point where he needed to make changes in order to improve himself. This change can take many forms such as seeking counseling, finding support groups, pasting notes from someone who helped him obtain treatment, going to church regularly etc... I understand why some teenagers may feel ashamed for participating in a gang if told over and over again that they are making decisions that will end up terrible. However, most adults would agree that it is better to live within the law than breaking laws you don't believe in just to get your rocks off. No child gets caught smoking pot at school without being thrown into detention. So why should criminals who break the law go free? They should be held responsible for their actions and sent back to jail until the job they did was done and we could continue practicing our freedoms without fear of retribution from society. Meanwhile, we should remind ourselves that no matter what kind of punishment we give, the person we punish always feels superior due to the fact that we made the decision. If given a choice between a criminal and a non - criminal, a criminal often seems like a nicer guy gal! Also realize that most of the time the people who murder other innocent people were raised by other evil people who taught them wrong ways and encouraged bad habits. Some children grow up learning to kill because their parents and caregivers teach them right from wrong by example. We cannot expect a murderer to magically turn his herPosted by In my last post, I talked about how I am afraid of bullies but I know as long as I try hard enough, those around me won't hurt me. On top of that, I pray for God's protection everyday. As much as I hate to admit it, I am also scared. At times, I wonder whether I'm even worth the trouble I cause. Personally, I'd prefer to be alone because then I could be vulnerable and let my fears come to the surface. Sometimes my friends take advantage of my insecurities and annoyances but sometimes I find myself annoyed with them too. I've never been good at handling things myself especially if something is bothering me. Even though I love to tell stories, I can't write coherently anymore. That means I don't really share anything very personal anymore either. What is worse is that I tend to forget everything after awhile. Then again, sometimes I remember stuff I never wanted to remember anyway.... It's not that I don't enjoy talking about myself. After all, everyone else loves hearing how creative I am, funny I am, or just plain weird I am. But, I am proud of the fact that I can actually focus on me and ignore any negative comments anyone might say towards me. Those are rare occurrences indeed. Another reason I feel like I am wasting my time: I didn't graduate highschool. For years I believed my grades in music theory and composition weren't important enough to warrant graduating. When I finally did graduate, I realized that all the things I studied for several months to prepare for my test were useless since they didn't involve math or english. I was relieved that I wasn't doing anything really worthwhile. On the bright side, I learned so much during college. Honestly, college was probably the best thing for me. Not only did I learn a lot about myself but I met some great people that I still keep in contact with today. Although I wish I could somehow have taken the same classes I took in High School, I couldn't afford them while attending college and was forced to accept whatever classes mom and dad paid for. College changed my future plans greatly as far as work goes. I spent 2 years working part - time jobs: serving food at a restaurant and hostessunuk firstou
