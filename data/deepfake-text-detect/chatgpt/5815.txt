Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions, but it has been hijacked by a certain type of person. For the sake of clarity, I'm only going to be referring to social justice warriors. Now, let me begin my rant by saying that I think everyone should be treated equally and fairly. As I've said before, I'm a feminist (and always will be). I have no problem with feminism or the advancement of women in our society. The problem I have with social justice warriors is that they tend to be elitist, racist, and sexist. Let's start with the fact that, in order to be a SJW, you need to be white and male. If you're not, you can't be a SJW, and that's ridiculous. If someone is a SJW, that means they're in the privileged position of having access to education, which is a privilege of the white, male, or middle class. I know there are exceptions to this rule. There are definitely SJWs who are women of color, but they are in the minority. And that's okay. I think the social justice movement would be stronger if it included a diverse group of people. After all, if social justice is about making sure everyone has the same opportunities, then why wouldn't we want a diverse group of people? This brings me to my next point: SJWs seem to be obsessed with race and gender. I don't know why, but they seem to care very deeply about those things. If someone is white, they will tell you that you don't understand race because you're white. If someone is a man, they will tell you that you don't understand sexism because you're a man. I guess this is why they're called social justice warriors. Because they are warriors for social justice. Warriors who don't have a clue what social justice actually is. I'm all for equality. I'm all for fairness. I'm all for making sure that everyone has the same opportunities. But social justice warriors are not fighting for equality. I think they're actually just trying to make sure that people of color and women have fewer opportunities than white men. I think that's the opposite of equality. It also feels a bit hypocritical to me that SJWs seem to think they're fighting for equality when they themselves don't seem to have a clue what equality actually is. They seem to think that when you're fighting for equality, you have to be a white man. But if that were true, then you'd also have to be a white woman or a person of color. But that doesn't seem to be the case. SJWs just want you to shut up if you're not white or a man. This brings me to my final point. Social justice warriors seem to be incredibly sexist and racist. In order to be a SJW, you have to be white and male. So, if you're a white man, you can be a SJW, but if you're a woman or person of color, you can't be a SJW. If you're not a white man, you're not a social justice warrior. You're just a feminist or socialist or liberal. I feel like this is actually harmful to women and people of color. When SJWs look at the world, they only see it through the lens of white men. They don't see it through the lens of women and people of color. Because of this, it's not surprising that they're so oblivious to sexism and racism. And that's the problem. If you're trying to make the world a better place, and you don't see the sexism and racism in it, how can you possibly solve it? Sometimes, I think that social justice warriors actually do more harm than good. If you're trying to make the world a better place, but you don't know the right way to do that, then you're probably going to make things worse. I feel like social justice warriors are actually more like social injustice warriors. The way they talk about people of color and women, you'd think they want to make the world a worse place. So, you know, I'll stay in my lane, and SJ
