First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that this system is used to create a class of "undesirables" in our society. The US population is made up of roughly 300 million people. It costs roughly 30,000 per inmate, per year to maintain a prisoner in the United States. Multiply that by 300 million, and you get a grand total of 90 billion dollars. That's billion with a "b." The world population is approximately 7 billion. The US is currently the most powerful nation on the planet. So, if we were to release the entire prison population tomorrow, what would happen? Well, for starters, we wouldn't have enough cops to arrest anyone. The police force is comprised of about 13,000 federal and state agents. We would be able to save at least 25 of our law enforcement budget, but the problem would only get worse. The vast majority of the crimes that are committed are from people that are already here. Crime would skyrocket. I can hear it now. "But, you don't understand, Cathy. We're in the middle of a war on drugs. If we released these prisoners, there would be a massive crime wave!" There is no evidence to support this. The US has the largest prison population in the world. It's also the largest consumer of illicit drugs in the world. There are so many factors that contribute to crime. Some of them include: Access to firearms. Income disparity. Access to education. Low paying jobs. Cathy: Well, that's nice, but what do you propose we do? I don't have all the answers, but I do know that we need to start focusing on these things. If you don't already, please read this. Please read this. It's a great blog post that discusses the history of the drug war. It's incredibly eye-opening. I have learned a lot about the problems that the US has, and the reasons behind them. I am also involved in my local community. I love making the world a better place. I want to help my fellow man. I am constantly trying to find ways to make a positive impact on the world. I know that I am not perfect. I know that I have a long way to go before I can call myself a great person. But, I hope to one day. I also hope that the next time you find yourself in a bad mood, or feeling ungrateful, that you stop and think about the things that you have been given. The opportunity to speak your mind. The opportunity to make a difference in the world. The opportunity to influence the lives of others. I am a lucky girl, and I am incredibly thankful. And, if you are reading this, thank you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to write this. Thank you for being my audience. I hope that this post inspired you, and that you walked away with a renewed sense of gratitude. I also hope that I gave you something to think about. I am always open to constructive criticism. I'm open to feedback. Please let me know what you thought, and I'll do my best to respond.
