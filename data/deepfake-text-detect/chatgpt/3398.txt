I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need a cigarette? Plus, smoking poses a major health risk both to the smoker and those around them through secondhand smoke. Would you like me to provide some more information on the subject?
