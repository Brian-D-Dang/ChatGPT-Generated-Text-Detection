It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be rehabilitated for the sake of the community. "I don't believe in those types of cruelty," says Robert Glattman, president and chief executive officer of the National Zoo in Washington state. "They're obviously an important animal, but they aren't going to please everyone." In a recent article on the organization's website written by director John Cooper, he addressed why some animals are used as pawns in crimes against society. He argues it isn't just about predators. "We're also trying to get people to understand, and there will always be some kind of predator in your life if you give them food or water instead of harming them," Cooper said. "But we have never done this before. We've only done it because it's not right." The "things that make us sad" are often not the feelings of guilt that led to their use. As Stephen Jaffe writes in his book, "The Pet Mind," abuse and neglect can affect human lives every day. Even the most loyal pets end up guilty when they spend years of their lives trying to protect other animals. In one study, 43 percent of dogs died after being euthanized due to neglect within 18 months of their home being allegedly neglected. At the same time, more than half of humans die from preventable diseases related to pet ownership; over half of mothers with children suffer from mental health issues at some point, according to an analysis published in the journal Psychological Science. Because some animals do not like other wildlife, they tend to avoid the life-threatening risks associated with owning a pet. For instance, raccoons are among the best pets ever to survive an attack from other mammals, according to the Associated Press. Beyond eating fish (especially those who are critically ill), raccoon venomous snakes bite birds and rodents too; wild turkeys eat insects and frogs, while horses and ducks bite other animals. Cats and mice frequently kill chickens, rats, rabbits and pigs - all of which cause serious damage to livestock. But these animals are protected from public view unless they exhibit certain behaviors such as biting or scratching that would otherwise result in death. And babies become sicker during childhood. It's possible that cats might learn how to bite and scratch without dying, but researchers estimate that it takes between 5 to 10 minutes for someone to develop a puking condition, which means that even baby cats could be killed by a dog or cat. Cooper says he has seen the need for rehabilitation programs for sick, mentally disabled felines in other countries, such as Canada, where people sometimes take steps to help them out of situations that are not so dire. "Traditionally, the dog or cat population was very small, mainly male, but now adult males have increased, and females have been increasing," he says. "Some communities end up becoming blacklisted for adopting animals in order to keep a single person well off financially." There may be more work to do. Cooper believes there will continue to be risks associated with owning pet animals for whom it is forbidden to practice. "If anybody wants to adopt another species of animal back into its natural habitat, they should ask themselves if he or she would actually feel comfortable doing so, given the risks involved," he says.
