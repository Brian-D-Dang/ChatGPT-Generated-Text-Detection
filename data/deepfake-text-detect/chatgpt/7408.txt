While posting armed guards in schools may seem like a quick fix to school violence, there are several reasons why it is not a legitimate solution. Firstly, many school shootings are committed by students who have access to firearms at home or by stealing them from relatives or friends. Posting armed guards would not address this issue of illegal access to firearms. Secondly, it is not a cost-effective solution as the cost of hiring and training armed guards can be expensive and could divert resources away from other important educational programs. Lastly, an armed guard presence can create a negative school environment and could potentially escalate situations that may have otherwise been resolved peacefully. There are much more effective and preventative measures such as increased mental health resources, community outreach, and strong gun control laws that would address the root causes of school violence.
