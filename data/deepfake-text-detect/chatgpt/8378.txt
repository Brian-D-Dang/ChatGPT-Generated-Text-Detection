Headlights are mostly useful for improving the driver's vision while driving in low-light conditions and for increasing the visibility of the driver's car in low-light or foggy conditions. While stationary, they provide little to no safety benefit since their primary use is still related with providing adequate lighting at night time when there might not be any other sources available (e g street lights). However if used properly headlamps can also serve as a source that warns following drivers about possible dangers ahead such scenarios including accidents vehicles on fire etc but these functionalities require more sophisticated systems than just using basic light emitting diodes (LEDs) which most modern cars already have installed anyway
