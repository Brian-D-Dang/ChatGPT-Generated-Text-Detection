I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I can only speak for myself here and not everyone will agree with me but I do think it's important to get across these messages: Your body does matter - It doesn't have to be an ironclad rule of thumb that your weight determines how attractive you are or what kind of treatment (or lack thereof) you receive in society, however there definitely exists a correlation between being overweightobese and unattractiveness. Being healthy should always come first before anything else because if others don't find us physically appealing then we certainly won't attract them mentally either. People aren't attracted to everything- We already know this one but sometimes people need reminding! Some people may find our bodies perfectly fine while some people might look past all those superficial things like hair colour or eye shape etc. I could go on about how stupid beauty standards are but let's save that debate for another day. Beauty isn't just skin deep- Beauty has many forms other than physical attributes as well. For example, people tend to associate intelligence with attractiveness more so than they do with someone who looks good on the outside. This is something worth bearing in mind when looking at people around you; maybe she didn't seem particularly interesting at first glance but after getting to know her she develops into such a caring person. Or perhaps he seemed smart visually but actually had poor social skills? Who knows? What matters most is whether their presence makes you feel comfortable or uncomfortable, as you were saying yourself. Most importantly though, is whether YOU feel comfortable around him. If you do, then forget about any 'beautiful' conventional standards and enjoy his company. And finally, remember... the grass really IS greener on the other side
