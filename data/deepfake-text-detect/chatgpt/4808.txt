While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established individuals to be very patronizing. You will have to develop a thick skin if you want to work in IT - it's going to happen from time to time. I'm currently working at an organisation where every other person under 30 is either asked or told what they think about this subject (ages range between 20-45). The problem with all these questions isn't that people are being condescending towards me; it's simply that as someone who has been doing web development for over ten years, there's nothing new to tell them. If anything, their question embarrasses me since I feel like showing off my knowledge whilst simultaneously being forced into explaining something so basic that even most software developers know how to do it already!
