I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other people with the design they like, and then they find a tattoo artist or go to a tattoo shop and ask them to do the same thing. They get the tattoo. But here's the thing: I've never seen the original tattoo. I've never seen the tattoo in question. I've never seen the original design. I've never seen the original idea. I've never seen the inspiration for this. Now, I'm not saying that the tattoo artist is lying about the source of the inspiration, but I wonder how many times they've gotten these requests and they are just trying to make the customer happy, because they don't want to tell them that they don't know. So, I'm curious... how many of these tattoos have you seen that you could say, "I know where that design came from," or "I know who did that tattoo." It's one of the reasons I have been reluctant to get a tattoo. I can't know that I won't see it somewhere else later. And, this is why I have never gotten a tattoo, because I'm too OCD for my own good. I have a lot of tattoos. I've also seen the original tattoo, on someone, in real life. Usually, I was the one to tell the person where I'd seen it. I think that this is probably the most common thing that happens. We all want our own individual look and feel, but we're also going to fall back on what we know and what we love. But, yes, I have seen tattoos that I know where they came from. Some of them are in books, some of them are on tv shows, and some of them are from other tattoo shops. I have only a few tattoos. The one that I have is on my right shoulder. It has a star, a moon, and a sparrow. I got that tattoo because I love it. It was originally seen on a tattoo on a friend's shoulder. She was wearing a white shirt and it showed up really well. She was the one who told me about it. I have one other tattoo on my right arm. It is a tree with the word "rain" written underneath it. My grandmother got it on her forearm when she was younger. I have seen the original tattoo of the tree, but not the sparrow. I have a few tattoos, and I'm not sure how many of them were done at the same shop. One of them is a lighthouse that I saw on a friend's back, and the others were done in one of the shops here in town. I've never seen the original tattoos of any of mine. The lighthouse was from a shop, but the rest were from one of the shops in town. I've seen the original of all of mine, but not all of them in the same place. I've had a few. I have one that I got in London about 10 years ago. It is a green lady with a hat and a feather on her hat. I got it on a street in London and the artist had tattooed it on his arm. He was there, he tattooed it, and I paid him. I've got a little bear and a tiny tiger. They were given to me by the artist. I have a celtic knot and a cross that I did myself, using a needle and ink. I also did a little spiral for my brother, and his friend did the cross that goes with it. I've seen the original of all of my tattoos, except for the cross, which was done by my brother. I have a few tattoos. Some are my own design, and some are copies of things that I have seen. I have a couple that are my own design. I have a large tree and a flower with my name and the date of my birth, and a sun with a rose and a heart for my wife. I designed those. I have a few that are copies of things I have seen, including a rose and a heart, and a clover. I did those. I have a heart and a rose and a girl, but I don't remember where I saw that design. I have a clover
