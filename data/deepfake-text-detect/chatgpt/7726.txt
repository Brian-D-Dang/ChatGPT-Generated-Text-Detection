While it is true that reckless driving is dangerous and puts everyone on the road in harm's way, it is important to recognize that highways have a minimum speed limit in place to help ensure a safe flow of traffic. Driving considerably below the speed limit can create dangerous situations by impeding the flow of traffic and leading to frustrated and aggressive driving behavior. It is important to maintain a safe speed that is consistent with the flow of traffic, while also remaining alert and aware of the actions of other drivers on the road. By doing so, we can help promote safety for everyone traveling on the highway.
