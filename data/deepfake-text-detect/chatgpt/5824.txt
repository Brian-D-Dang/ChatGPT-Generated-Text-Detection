I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends. I drink it everyday (I usually get a cuppa in the afternoon when I'm studying, but I'll be honest and say I definitely need a caffeine boost), but I don't know how to describe it. I find the smell of coffee quite nauseating (I've always been like this with wine... I don't like the smell). So that being said, I was very excited to try out a cold brew coffee from Temple. I chose the Gingerbread (which is a blend of Ceylon and Tanzanian) and Cranberry (which is a blend of Coffee Nero and Tanzanian). On the first sip, I was surprised at the strong ginger taste of the Gingerbread and how rich it tasted, so I would not recommend this for people who don't like strong spices. The Cranberry, on the other hand, was very light and tasted more like a juice. My favourite of the two was the Cranberry. I loved the rich ginger taste and I think it's a very unique flavour. The Cranberry was definitely something I could drink throughout the day, whereas I think the Gingerbread is better suited for an evening. The Gingerbread had a bit of a tangy finish and I found that I was able to taste it at the back of my throat, which isn't too pleasant. I was surprised at how strong the ginger was, but I really enjoyed the Cranberry. I would totally recommend it! I was really impressed with the flavour of the Gingerbread (not the aftertaste though) and I'm sure there are a lot of people who love that kind of taste.
