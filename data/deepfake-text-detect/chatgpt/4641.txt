Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. "That means that marriage equality isn't really a human right." This was the question raised by several of my students during our lesson on gay rights in America yesterday. My class is protesting a number of things related to police brutality and I wanted them to understand what these protests were about but not why they are occurring. So when we talked about the recent shooting death of Trayvon Martin it seemed obvious to me that he had been shot because he was black and someone hated blacks. After all his hoodie must have made him look suspicious, as does anyone who walks around wearing rags even if there's nothing wrong with them. When your mother tells you not to talk back or walk anywhere alone unless being followed let alone carry anything at night then don't get into fights with people whose only offense against you may be that you're white. They just assumed from his appearance and clothes that he'd done something bad and they suspected that he couldn't prove otherwise without getting involved which could lead to more trouble than he probably deserved, given the way the system was set up for poor minorities. A lot went through their minds before they pulled out their guns and started firing bullets towards him. So I told my class that sometimes protesters come out dressed inappropriately or do whatever it takes to stand out among the crowd no matter how outrageous those actions might seem. And most laws aren't written very well meaning that some of them can easily become twisted over time due to things such as racial profiling or flawed enforcement practices. Sometimes innocent people end up in jail based on false accusations if those officers happen to be racist or biased. This leads to miscarriages of justice, unjust prison sentences and endless legal fees after going through years of hell trying to clear one's name. Then there are times where the punishment doesn't fit the crime, which leads to wrongful convictions. In addition to the problem of police brutality many other factors play a role including poverty, racism, socialization, media influence (think of what happened last week), etc., etc. But getting arrested isn't always an indication of guilt. It depends on whether you believe the cops acted appropriately under the circumstances. That said, some people think from their own perspective without listening to others. Others try to find beauty in oppression or hatred; therefore everything gets corrupted and becomes ugly. Why? Because those people look beyond appearances and realize that everyone should actually have equal access to basic civil liberties regardless of race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical ability, economic status, age, and so forth. While this is exactly true - isn't because certain groups still feel disempowered enough to bother fighting for improvements based on outdated beliefs about themselves. Sure discrimination exists but not all prejudice promotes hate crimes; however, bigotry has caused some terrible acts inflicting pain upon entire races of people since ancient times. How do all of us not fall prey to prejudices and biases today? If we didn't learn that from history perhaps we deserve to repeat it. Marriage equality is already becoming law and starting to help change public opinion which is good news considering that America's attitudes toward homosexuals haven't changed much throughout its long history. We've seen plenty of progress but despite the fact that homosexuality used to be considered both mentally ill and immoral until recently society wouldn't accept gays marching down main street holding hands and kissing openly while heterosexual couples did likewise. Perhaps now the threshold is higher but this hasn't stopped the march to full inclusion yet so far we can say that anti-gay activists haven't won the battle either. Though juries rarely convict defendants these days in cases involving racial bias instead calling for lenient sentencing as an act of mercy, lawyers too often represent perpetrators rather than victims. Courts also tend to give probationary terms for minor offenses rather than sending criminals away for months or years. Consider that the average U.S citizen spends 25 of their income on taxes, while the amount spent on state and local governments totals 22. Yet government revenue continues growing year after year whereas tax revenues decline. Where does the money go? For most of the past century politicians cut spending everywhere else except defense and welfare; meanwhile, American leaders maintained military superiority through massive arms buildups leading to devastating wars that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions of foreigners. Highways ended up littered with illegal debris carried along by worn tires left behind by vehicles using bridges meant for heavy trucks. As a nation we spend almost four trillion dollars per year but quite simply run out of money every few weeks causing frequent shortages and lengthy delays. There's never less reason to pay off debt but there seems to be ever increasing reasons not to raise ticket prices rather leaving the price crowds paying rise steadily making mass transit relatively unaffordable. Our educational system is plagued by high tuition rates, excessive standardized testing requirements, punishing two hour morning bell schedules which leave little room for teachers to prepare properly even though schools need new books daily, overcrowded classrooms, poorly trained faculty members unable to teach at least 124.
