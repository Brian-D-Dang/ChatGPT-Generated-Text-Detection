I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. One thing you're missing is that most people are drinking CASHEW COFFEE and not actual Coffee, it's a common mistake:) You probably can't appreciate good real espresso-based coffee unless your taste buds have been trained properly by years worth of high quality stuff with lots of flavor.
