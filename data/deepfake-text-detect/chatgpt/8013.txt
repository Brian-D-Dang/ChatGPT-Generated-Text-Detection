While ensuring historical accuracy in films based on true stories can provide a sense of authenticity, it is important to recognize that creative liberties are often taken to enhance the storytelling experience. Banning such films would severely limit artistic expression and the ability to educate and entertain viewers with engaging and emotional stories. Instead, a balance should be struck between artistic creativity and remaining faithful to the narrative's key elements. Additionally, rather than strictly monitoring or banning historical films, they should be accompanied by educational materials to help viewers understand where the creative liberties lie and what aspects of the story are accurate. This way, viewers can enjoy the film and learn about the actual historical events.
