First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" does. But as we look to keep ahead in society today (as much as we can), wouldn't it be nice if men could embrace equality with women? Wouldn't it please them to see themselves represented equally well by our laws and institutions? What do you think about this idea of equal representation for both sexes? Would such an ideal make your feminist heart sing or turn you off? Or would it simply not matter one way or another...
