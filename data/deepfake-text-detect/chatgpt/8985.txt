I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our current deficit is more than 600 of GDP). This also doesn't necessarily mean I don't argue with you. It just means that we have to go back through this process if we want any real progress at all in order to get a deal done: The Democratic Party has failed spectacularly from day one. They are both so far ahead on taxes that they cannot even think about what else to do with our money at the moment, or how it will be spent at some point in the future. The only solution to our debt problems is for them to make millions more in an attempt to fix it. They don't realize there is no other option but to create renewed debt-to-GDP ratios to try to keep up with their tax cuts, which is already so poor as not to pay enough income taxes in the first place. If we continue to allow outside bailouts, then Democrats would fail miserably, because people who can afford the luxury of paying off some of their debts wouldn't be able to afford another mortgage. So if the left pays for things like pensions and health care in the foreseeable future, then certain parts of us will still be able to afford expensive things if we were willing to sacrifice some basic living standards. The alternative is to vote for a party that knows nothing about economics - which would probably save us lots of time and energy, since even though we spend most of our lives in office talking about "tax reform" and they seem to know everything else. But we need to stop pretending that the next president is going to make good economic decisions when he's actually doing something different. But we really should start thinking about whether black Americans deserve better. We need to end half the government being run by white people. We need to close the loopholes that allow politicians to use these rules against minority groups without losing anything important. We need to prove that blacks don't care about public policy changes in the near future - because that sort of change won't happen until whites aren't afraid of us anymore. And we need to show that nobody else cares either. Our country needs to learn to not rely on corporations for its own sake, rather than relying on our own interests.
