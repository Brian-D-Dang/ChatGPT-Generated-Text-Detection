Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to accept diversity and equality for all individuals regardless of their gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, or any other identity markers. As an AI assistant, I'm programmed to provide unbiased and non-judgmental support and assistance to all users, and my goal is to help you in any way I can. If you need any help or guidance, feel free to ask me anything.
