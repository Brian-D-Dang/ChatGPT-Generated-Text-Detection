It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet. I've always found the noise made by a car to be rather annoying, especially when you're trying not disturb someone whilst having your morning coffee or afternoon tea (is it still called "tea" if anybody is reading this blog? perhaps aftershave would also have been an appropriate word). So here goes... I recently had occasion of riding around town on public transport during rush hour time so decided against taking out any vehicles as there were plenty for me sat behind all these noisy engines! The couple who spoke loudly at one bus stop caused more than enough disturbance over several minutes; plus another lady was playing her mobile phone music too LOUDLY through headphones which sounded like she may well damage somebody else's hearing!!
