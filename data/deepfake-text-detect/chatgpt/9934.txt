The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, that being about 13.8 billion years ago, and we know it is still expanding outward. We don't know for certain how this expansion started, or if the universe will eventually collapse on itself or expand forever. Some theories suggest the universe had no beginning at all, or that it existed in a state of infinite density before its rapid expansion, but these are only theories.
