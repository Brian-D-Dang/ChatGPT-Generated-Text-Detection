IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say "preposterous" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more I understand your point of view. While it's true that simpler language is more easily understood by a wider audience, more sophisticated vocabulary can be beneficial in certain situations. For example, using "preposterous" instead of "crazy" or "insane" can convey a nuanced meaning. "Preposterous" can suggest not just extreme irrationality, but also a sense of absurdity and humor. It can also be used to convey a stylistic tone, such as in a satirical or comedic piece of writing. However, it's important to strike a balance between using advanced vocabulary and making sure your writing is accessible to your intended audience. It's always a good idea to consider your reader's level of understanding and adjust your language accordingly to ensure that you are effectively communicating your ideas.
