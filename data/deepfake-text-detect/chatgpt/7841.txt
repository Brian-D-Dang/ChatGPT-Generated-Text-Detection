While it is true that these lab-created elements have a very short half-life and cannot exist in nature, they still have a place on the periodic table. The periodic table is not just a list of naturally occurring elements, but it is a tool that helps us understand and predict the behavior of all elements, regardless of their origin or stability. These lab-created elements offer valuable insights into the properties of the heavier elements that exist in the universe but are too rare or difficult to study directly. Additionally, the discovery and study of these elements have contributed to our understanding of nuclear physics and technology, which has important applications in fields such as energy and medicine. Therefore, it is essential to include these elements on the periodic table for the sake of completeness and to further scientific progress.
