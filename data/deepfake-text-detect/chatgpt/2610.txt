I do not support GMO's and do not want to consume them. Many other countries have restricted GMO's because they don't consider them safe alternatives. I personally don't believe that these products will ever be deemed safe for consumption by the general population of Earth. Because you're way smarter than all those scientists who've done hundreds of tests on GMOs, right?
