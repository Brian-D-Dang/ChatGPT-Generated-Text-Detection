There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a diploma, but it has evolved into questioning and mourning. The idea that such events are not only unavoidable but also necessary 'in some circumstances'. "I don't think there's been any doubt about it," said Professor Anne-Marie Smith, an expert on child welfare at University College London who studies child poverty and mental health issues. "When we look back over time we've got more evidence of this happening than we have seen before." The Department of Education says its intention is clear: that all pupils should be able access to this event regardless whether they're attending school or university. "We want future students who are interested in learning from where education comes first through engaging with the experiences which they see around them so as soon as possible can decide if they wish to continue to attend secondary schools or universities based upon their individual needs," said Mr Porter.
