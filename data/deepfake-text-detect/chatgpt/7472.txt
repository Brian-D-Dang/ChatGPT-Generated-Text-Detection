While shaming, shunning, and exile may seem like alternatives to prisons, they are not viable solutions for a few reasons. First, shaming and shunning are forms of social ostracism, which can have harmful mental health effects on individuals. Such ostracism can also lead to further social and economic marginalization, making it difficult for individuals to reintegrate into society. Second, exile involves physically removing individuals from their homes and communities, which can also have negative consequences, especially if they are forced to relocate to a new and unfamiliar environment. Additionally, exile could lead to the creation of new forms of social control, similar to what exists within the prison system. Lastly, shaming, shunning, and exile do not address the root causes of why individuals commit crimes, such as poverty, lack of education, and mental illness. As such, alternative solutions that focus on prevention, rehabilitation, and addressing systemic inequalities are preferable to these forms of punishment.
