It is pretty well known that the colombine shooters believed in natural selection, a key point of evolution. Just from their [wiki] they talk about natural selection in their journals, and mention that it is not possible for humans to survive on their own. I think this line of thinking comes down more to "God created us" because that is what they believe. Uh... what? Natural Selection isn't something that can be proved or disproved by reading scientific articles.
