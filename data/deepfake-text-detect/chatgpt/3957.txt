It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be trained and institutionalized. Once, in a travel book published by the Smithsonian Magazine (I believe), there was an article describing a program taken to a third world zoo where only female elephants were allowed for training purposes... After I read this bit of news about how they used male elephants it made me so angry! Some animals should not even have been brought into captivity in the first place as some people need to learn their lesson... I mean come on for crying out loud: "long live the male elephant" isn't really a motto you want to hear from elephants! Besides I'm not sure if we can conclude anything from what has happened at other such organizations such as SeaWorld or the American Zoo Aquarium Association - which are two separate organizations... So far it seems like most organizations don't care much about animal welfare and ethics... It really makes me sad when I see all these terrible happenings taking place around us happening with the wildlife.
