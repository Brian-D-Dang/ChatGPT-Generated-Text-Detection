I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say "entertainment," but I think it's more than just that. Most works of literary art are written by people for the sole reason of sharing their thoughts with others. However this doesn't mean these writers don't focus on things they were personally or deeply interested in at the time; you would only be able to judge a work based on how much like someone else's life it reflects. For example, Shakespeare wrote his plays because he wanted to express feelings of depression and isolation through characters who had been raised in the same tradition as himself (whereas Othello, Macbeth etc.) and also felt the need to do something creative in order to express himself. The goal of making music is to make people happy, which is evidenced by most artists releasing an album every other year or so. The problem here lies within the fact that most people aren't satisfied listening to the same old shit over and over again.
