I don't believe that anyone, including politicians, deserves to be taken out of context. Doing so undermines the integrity of any discussion or debate and leads to misunderstandings and miscommunication. Furthermore, taking politicians out of context can perpetuate false narratives and hinder constructive dialogue. It's important to understand a politician's full stance, message, and context in order to make informed decisions and hold them accountable. Taking them out of context undermines that process and ultimately hurts the public's ability to make informed decisions.
