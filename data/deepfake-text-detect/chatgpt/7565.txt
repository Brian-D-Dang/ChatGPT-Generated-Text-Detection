There are several counter-arguments to this opinion. The first one is that the periodic table is not only a catalog of all the naturally occurring elements, but it is also a tool for scientists to organize and understand the properties and behavior of all elements, whether they exist in nature or not. Elements created in labs provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of matter, and the production of such elements through experimentation has led to many technological advances. For example, the discovery of synthetic elements such as technetium, which does not occur naturally, has had significant applications in medical imaging. Moreover, the periodic table is a constantly evolving entity, as scientists continue to discover and explore new elements. The addition of these new elements enriches our understanding of the universe and can lead to discoveries that could not be made with naturally occurring elements. Therefore, it is essential to continue exploring and adding new elements to the periodic table, independent of their presence in nature.
