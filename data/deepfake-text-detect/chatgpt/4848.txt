There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man with no pants on wearing shorts? That's OBVIOUSLY indecent). I have always thought that women who don't wear panties are the scum of the Earth. And I hope they all get raped by animals so hard their babies never see daylight again. A couple times when we were out running errands for my husband I noticed people looking at him strangely and then laughing about something he said or did...I wasn't sure what to think, but figured "good job" was probably the best response! The one time I found myself wondering if someone had seen us going into the bathroom together, because there were four other couples behind me while we went through airport security...but luckily whoever saw us didn't say anything! Even now I can barely remember this part in detail; I'm pretty sure we just laughed as we pulled up our shirts like normal gentlemen. The only thing worse than being caught without panties would be getting caught WITHOUT ANY CLOTHES ON!!!! You could also use duct tape from time to time I guess. But really, you'd end up naked anywayswith NO WAY TO FINISH DRESSING!!! Seriously, she needs to go back and try again tomorrow...wearing clothes seems to work. Or maybe even every day until she gets her groove right....maybe three days out of five. Bubble butt-Miss-America Egghead If life gives you lemons - MAKE LEMONADE!!
