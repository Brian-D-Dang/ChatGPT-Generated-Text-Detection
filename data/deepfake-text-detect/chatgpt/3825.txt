Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself into poverty because if the government does nothing it's going to have to go bankrupt soon, and then the people who didn't pay their fair share will be left holding the bag. And what about all those guns we're supposed to confiscate from private citizens? What are you gonna do with them?! s
