If movies and video games are subject to regulation and censorship, then books should be too. In many places, especially in western cultures, the censorship of books is looked down upon as being 'just another form of speech' that has no value or worth. I would argue it's a bit different with what you read vs screen play. I can see what you're saying about movies though.
