Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on without giving any thought as to who really was the enemy. The media has been trying hard over the past few years to convince us that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was a brutal dictator hell bent upon committing atrocities against his own people in order to stay in power at all costs and is by doing so justifying American military intervention for regime change. However what one may not know or be willing to admit is that Assad's government had long ago made amends with those whom they formerly treated badly through amnesty programs where a mass number of them were released from prison and allowed back into society after having served their time. So why would someone like President Obama feel justified in launching missile strikes which could result in thousands more civilian deaths? All because he wants somebody else besides himself to take responsibility for this situation! This does nothing but make him look even worse than before and completely uninspired and disingenuous especially considering his much touted Nobel Peace Prize award just last year. But there are other reasons behind Obama's decision making process that support my claim: Syria sits strategically between Israel and Lebanon. If Assad falls America will lose its ability to influence the outcome of events taking place in the Middle East region. With no "bad" guys left America will find itself facing an uncharted territory since we don't quite know whose side our allies should ultimately stand on; furthermore we can expect another wave of refugees heading towards Europe if things get out of hand in that area. So now you see while Assad certainly hasn't always acted according to civilized standards maybe we should stop viewing such cases solely through Western eyes whereas looking beyond our borders might give us insight into the reasoning processes of leaders far removed from ourselves.
