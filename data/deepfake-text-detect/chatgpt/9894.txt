People talk about'natural' or'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like "free speech" or "free association" are'inalienable','natural', or'God-given', how come so many people don't have them? Rights like free speech and free association are inalienable, natural, or God-given, but unfortunately they are not always respected or enforced. In some countries, governments actively restrict these rights through laws, censorship, or other means of control. Other times, individuals or groups may be denied access to these rights due to discrimination or prejudice. Unfortunately, despite the fact that many people have these rights in theory, they are often not able to exercise them in practice.
