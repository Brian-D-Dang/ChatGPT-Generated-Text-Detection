I am a husband and father of two. I love my wife, and I love my children, but I am not a fan of Father's Day. I feel the "holiday," if you can call it that, is just another excuse to get people who are at work or school to buy their dad something. Also, some stores make fathers spend 20 on a card, when they could easily pick up a few bucks worth of material around the house. So why do we have this holiday? What is its history? Well, according to Purdue University (where else?), there were originally two holidays in honor of dads: the Feast of Sts. Joseph and James, March 19th; and St. Patrick, June 17th. In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt signed an act making both days national holidays, before adding another one for his own dad. While the Federal government declared those dates as federal holidays, individual states chose what day (s) would be celebrated each year until 1972 when Congress passed the Uniform Holiday Bill. The first Monday after the third Sunday in June became National Father's Day under the new standard. Your state might still celebrate these other days, but now all 50 states recognize Father's Day on that same date. It took nearly 100 years from the founding of our country for the U.S. Senate finally approve legislation recognizing Fathers' Day.
