I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends that have been 'coffee connoisseurs' since they were kids. In fact, it is probably making things worse as now when we go out together and order a cappuccinos or flat whites from Starbucks our taste buds don't react in ways similar with those around us...because if there ever was someone who should know what good tasting drinks are supposed looktaste - its you guys! You grew up drinking them all your lives!! So why can some people drink an espresso shot at any given time while others must make sure their palate has become prepared before? What's going on here?! How did this change occur over such short amounts?? Is everyone just simply lying about how much tastiness one actually enjoys these days because frankly noone likes bad-flavored coffees by anyone other than steamed milk anyway right??? Or am i crazy thinking wrong....please help!!! Comment below so perhaps more enlightened souls will enlighten themselves too:)
