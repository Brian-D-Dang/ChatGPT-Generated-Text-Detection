tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to the NFL, MLB and NBA (and some of their international counterparts) there isn't much else that gets me excited like these big time sporting events! I believe this is largely because my expectation are fairly low for each team on any given Sundaynight in all three leagues: The Bills won 5 or fewer footballs last year...the Rangers have been chasing Lord Stanley's Cup since 2011...The Mets haven had back-to-back winning seasons...ever!! But regardless what happens with your favorite teams during an entire baseball basketball calendar month long "playoff," those days can seem so surreal through streaming access wyour friends from home via social media apps such Facebook Live Instagram stories!!! These live streams become more than just everyday news updates - They provide instant feedback while watching others get vibes off fans who know even less about them then us; If we were at work tomorrow morning our co workers wouldn be talking smack over how bad they think OUR Browns will look next week after yesterday night being humiliated by Buffalo....We call bullshit now right?! We actually saw em lose!!!! Oh man im pumped up already..... Ok..just kidding lol! It sure beats hearing everyone talk shit before knowing anything......right?? RIGHT??? That could mean missing out one day where 49ers crush Seattle 51 - 0. No i was not really rooting against San Fran....but oh well haha..when u got nothing better 2 worry bout, its ok too smile if ur boys win 3 straight:) ...Who knows maybe Alex Smith cud take care o dat Pats offense.....or someone might finally bring down Brady Mayne? Just keepin yall guessing;) And remember always hold yourselves accountable first lmao!!
