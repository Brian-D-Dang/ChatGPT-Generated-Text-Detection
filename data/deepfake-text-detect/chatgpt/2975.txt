We have a responsibility to prevent massacres or civil wars in foreign countries because we are one of the only ones who can. We are one of the only ones capable of preventing them, and so it is our duty to do this." "What's the point? I mean really..." said Ares, exasperated. "It's been done before! It doesn't work!" "Yes," agreed Hermes. "That's just what happened with Somalia for example... And now look at us." Ares snorted. He suddenly seemed very old. "I'm sorry if you all find any of that offensive but honestly, it's not as though I haven't heard that before! Don't get me wrong; I appreciate your concern about my well-being and yes, perhaps you're right that there must be something new here - good grief, even an idiot like myself could see how hopeless things had become on Earth! But I am still uninterested in trying out something which has already failed in every conceivable way once again! This time with no obligation to actually help people other than ourselves!! So don't give me that crap that 'everyone' wants peace when they've never tried anything different ever, after 5 centuries spent waiting around for some miracle that will solve everything tomorrow anyway!" Gods were notoriously impatient though. Perhaps he was being too shortsighted. Maybe he would benefit from a little bit more patience themselves. "And why should I believe you're telling me the truth?" His voice rose slightly. Hermes sighed deeply then paused while chewing his lip thoughtfully. Finally, he replied: "Well, firstly, I think that it might be wise for you to consider stopping by for a visit sometime soon. Our home planet isn't far off anymore and it wouldn't hurt to know for sure where things stand over there before making decisions such as these. Secondly, make a note yourself that it may take some effort for both parties involved. The fact remains that Humans aren't exactly known for their selflessness much less altruism in general; you'd need to focus on keeping them motivated enough for cooperation instead of merely expecting them to jump up and down screaming 'we want peace!' for fear of reprisals. And finally, I'd suggest reading up on the history of humanity a little. You'll most likely obtain a better understanding of what went through everyone else's mind back during World War II for instance, given that it many ways there wasn't much difference between the two sides despite the outcome afterwards." "Thanks, Hermes," Ares admitted grudgingly. His tone carried none of the usual lighthearted teasing, playful teasing which they usually shared together. Instead, Ares sounded tired. A shadow hung over him. There was discomfort beneath the surface of the conversation and Hermes didn't understand it fully himself yet. But he understood enough to notice. Hermes turned to Kratos then without taking his eyes off of Ares anymore. If there was indeed tension between them, it clearly made itself apparent. "You seem to know quite a lot about human culture and its history. How did you come across all of those facts?? Are you...? Do you study humans regularly?" Kratos looked surprised but immediately shrugged. "Oh yeah, of course. My father was working in the science field, researching human genetics and evolution. Since our family lived primarily overseas, I traveled often with him. That was also partly why I knew so much about European history since I studied it extensively as well when living abroad. Anyway, the important thing to remember is that anybody can learn whatever information they want to provided they put forth reasonable efforts towards doing so themselves. Of course, not everybody takes the initiative nowadays but generally speaking education requires hard work and determination rather than spending large amounts of money on expensive schools [which let's face it weren't always available for everybody] or scholarships." Kratos took another long sip of coffee and slowly swallowed it down to savor the taste. When he was finished, he continued talking quietly with a small smile upon the corners of his mouth. "As for studying Human psychology specifically - although others can speak to this subject further - I suppose the main key lies within knowing oneself first and foremost. What motivates you personally and others alike? What makes you happy and sad? What provokes anger inside you whilst eliminating all common sense outside of it (if possible)? These questions aside however, learning from other perspectives helps broaden one's own view exponentially due to simply contrasting points of views." He smiled gently, looking almost mischievous as he spoke. "The best part about expanding one's knowledge is sharing one's findings with others so that nobody falls behind in terms of knowledge each generation. In return, ideas and discoveries tend to grow infinitely faster from that vantage point since the perspective shifts constantly. Although some individuals have wasted away precious resources intentionally throughout history, others employ them efficiently without causing harm. As a result, civilizations change dramatically depending entirely upon whether reason prevails or irrationality as opposed to greed does. Yes..."
