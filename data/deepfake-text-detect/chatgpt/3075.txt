While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established people as silly. There's no way to keep them from disrespecting you if they want it; so why bother? I think it's a matter of developing an "us vs everybody else" mentality. If someone is going out of their way to screw with you or disrespect you then it puts a chip on your shoulder which can be used as motivation
