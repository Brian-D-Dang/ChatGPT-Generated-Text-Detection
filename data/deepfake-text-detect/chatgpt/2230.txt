Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, do we allow our children and teens (and even ourselves) the freedom of choosing their role models? If you are a parent wouldn't your child rather have as hisher hero someone who is living out what they can see himherself doing one day than just some celebrity on TV telling them how life should be lived with no way for kids to take any action themselves toward getting from where heshe currently stands in hisher particular situation at this point in time to whatever idealized model she displays without having actually walked through all those steps herself first! Wouldn't you agree?! Well guess again because many parents think differently when it comes to this issue-or maybe these days most people don't really believe there IS such thing as right and wrong anymore so why would anyone care which path each individual chooses if everyone thinks alike anyway??? As part of my interview process prior to me accepting coaching clients, I ask parents very specific questions designed specifically around whether or not they feel it makes sense to them for THEIR CHILD TO BE "A TEENAGER WHO LIVES BY THE RULES OR AN ADULT IN DISGUISE; A TEENAGE BOY WORTH PARENTING ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY OR JUST SOMEONE ELSE'S SON: WHAT SHOULD WE DO AND HOW CAN WE HELP HIM GET FROM THERE WHERE HE IS NOW...TO WHATEVER IT TAKES FOR US ALL TO LIVE AS ONE BIG HAPPY CLOSE-KNIT FAMILY!!!?"
