Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. For example: American Airlines from LAX to JFK or Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) flying out of Atlanta and Detroit are allowed to offer flights within these cities that connect through other airports but cannot provide a direct flight on their own network.[1] The reason why this matters for investors? Well, according to CAPA,[2] which tracks world aviation activity, there were about 52 million passengers who traveled domestically via connecting hubs last year - amounting to more than 40 total air traffic. And while many large companies already dominate international travel within individual countries such as China where BABA operates its namesake brand, they also have limited representation among smaller nations with extensive regional networks like India[3]. As a result, foreign carriers accounted for over half of all seats flown within India's top 20 metro areas during 2017 compared to just 12 under full deregulation [4], giving them access to hundreds of millions additional travelers locked into domestic markets by local law. Of course, no one expects an Indian exodus of citizens traveling abroad anytime soon given the culture of family-centric migration patterns. But because most Indians do return home after living overseas, it provides another avenue to tap new consumers worldwide. Of note too; India was recently named the fastest growing economy in 2019 despite having some of the highest unemployment rates globally, leading analysts to speculate whether that means fewer people will be able to afford trips back home[5]. If so, then open skies could potentially make up for slower GDP growth due to lower spending at least until cheaper fares attract more customers. In addition to being good news for Chinese nationals returning home each week courtesy of low cost airlines following global tourism trade agreements, it would allow DAL LUV shareholders alike to reap benefits of higher ticket sales thanks to greater guests per route segment along with further incremental revenue opportunities brought forth by bilateral service accords signed earlier this month.[67] Such deals have been controversial though since critics argue dumping price sensitive services onto way less competitive local providers without restrictions may lead to unfair competition benefiting larger firms versus smaller start ups incapable of competing against near zero costs incurred especially when accounting for subsidies provided directly to national governments subsidized by taxpayers. Nonetheless, barring any surprises from recent tariff negotiations coming off of Monday's historic agreement to temporarily cease hostilities, we believe talks should continue moving forward resulting in liberalization sooner rather than later considering how beneficial both parties stand to gain once complete. Even better, the latter forms part of President Trump's master plan aimed at attaining 4 annualized economic growth before his next re-election bid thereby bringing jobs back to America regardless of political affiliation or background check records! But wait...there's much more to our bullish thesis beyond those mentioned above including improved operational capacity exceeding 10 annually across passenger levels alone together with wider margins driven primarily by aircraft fuel burn reductions set to exceed 3 billion liters per annum beginning 2022 free cash flow generation estimated around 13 billion based upon net income figures applied to current market values which should jumpstart potential buybacks while still maintaining ample liquidity available for MAs too depending upon strategic expansion moves made thereafter.[8] One thing is certain however even going outside of basic arithmetic calculations involving projected revenues vs. expenses; CEO Gao Xiaosong has proven himself capable of making smart decisions time and again evidenced by management's focus towards improving efficiencies across multiple dimensions. This includes reducing operating costs associated with mainline operations by approximately 8 percent every single quarter dating back years ago now totaling nearly 50 billion RMB worth (7.37B USD). Take for instance BOC Aviation PLC ADR Class A shares (OTCPK:BOACF), for whom CCO Wong Weng Sun serves as senior advisor representing roughly 20 ownership interest held alongside major shareholder Temasek Holdings Private Limited Singapore holding company currently valued north of 10 Billion dollars (11.87B).[9] That said, he previously headed ANA Group Incorporated Japan subsidiary All Nippon Airways Co., Ltd.
