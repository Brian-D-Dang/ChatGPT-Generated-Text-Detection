Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for "white feminism," which I understand to be a critique of a narrow and often exclusionary form of feminism that centers only on the experiences and struggles of white, middle-class, able-bodied, cisgender women. Can you provide me with more context and resources to further my understanding of this critique and how I can be a better ally to all women?
