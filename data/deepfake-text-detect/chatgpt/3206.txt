So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern political issues have pros and cons on both sides, and it can be difficult to determine where you stand morally. However, using logic and reason to analyze the situation, and considering various factors such as evidence, statistics, and policy, can help inform your decision. It's important to consider your values and beliefs and how they align with the different arguments. Ultimately, the decision is up to you, but it's important to carefully consider all of the available information before making a decision.
