The goods and services we consume are made possible by the abundance of cheap resources and labour that the west gets out of underdeveloped countries. The West has no reason to be concerned with the plight of millions more people. Why do I think this is so? Because it seems like every other country in the world relies on such poor quality products and services, but there's a huge amount of money being spent on protecting the environment from pollution. It also seems to me that governments are not doing enough to prevent toxic waste generation from entering the country! This is one thing that makes it extremely important for us. The world needs more healthy food (can you imagine what kind of fish etc) and less polluting-polluted water sources. If we can't get these things done at home then why should any country benefit from cheap imports? What about Europe or Africa? Why would they need more fresh produce if our trade deficit was as bad as ours would seem to imply? Is there something sinister here? That must go unnoticed for some time now...
