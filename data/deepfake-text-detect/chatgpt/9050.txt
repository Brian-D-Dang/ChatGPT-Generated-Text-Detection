To me, online entertainment is such a flip of a coin. You either get a partnership or you don't, and even if you do get the partnership, there's no saying what kind of content they'd be willing to pay for in return for access to your account. I understand that it's not a huge deal, but I just think it's really hard to keep up with streamingers like Netflix whatever way you can. It's nice to have something to look at while spending time watching a movie on my laptop instead of playing an entire series.
