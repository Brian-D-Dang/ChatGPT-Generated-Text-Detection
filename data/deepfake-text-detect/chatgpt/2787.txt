Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in terms of access to affordable healthcare. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was designed by President Obama's administration as an expansion on existing government-sponsored programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, etc., which would make health care coverage accessible for individuals who may otherwise not be able to afford it. Now with what is being dubbed "Obamacare" having officially gone into effect, millions more Americans will soon fall under this administration's plan. And hopefully they'll see its benefits firsthand because just like everything else this has spawned or brought up for discussion over the years, those affected are going to need some time before things get back to normal so we can stop hearing about politics altogether! Of course, nothing involving the ACA should ever be taken lightly; no matter where one stands politically, it affects us all at some level. So let's take a look at what exactly the law entails: As you've likely noticed from reading between the lines, the main point of contention surrounds how much control the federal government actually has when it comes to implementation of Obamacare. While most people get upset seeing their taxes increase due to the passing of this bill, some feel that individual citizens aren't really seeing any benefits either without even realizing what's happening behind closed doors. But these politics aside, it's becoming increasingly clear that the nation needs this new legislation if only because it gives the American public another option other than suffering through yearly insurance premium hikes for years down the road. With Obamacare, there are also incentives in place to help lower premiums for everyone involved throughout the country including but certainly NOT limited to helping cover pre-existing conditions andor illnesses. In addition, individuals making less than 45k per year AND families of four making below 94k per year will qualify for tax credits annually until 2016. These credits range depending upon income levels, age, family size, location within the US along with state residency status again subject to annual limits after 2015. Finally, plans offered must include coverage for mental illness substance abuse services primarily free of charge while prescription drugs require co-payments. While the above seems pretty straightforward and easy enough to understand based on current information, the devil always lies in the details and it won't go away quite yet. It's worth noting here, however, that until today, just 27 of uninsured Americans had signed up online using Healthcare.gov despite months of hype leading up to March 31st expiration date for enrollment. Now the question becomes whether or not the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will extend open enrollment beyond the deadline? It sounds ridiculous considering the fact that millions of Americans still don't even realize what ObamaCare means for them personally...but then again, maybe that isn't such a bad thing?! Either way though, expect answers very soon - probably sometime around April 1st;)
