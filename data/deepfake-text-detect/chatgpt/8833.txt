Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and it's really sad when you think about the consequences if someone actually did these things to you. Yes please! What kind of society are we in? Where does one go from there to where they can't even get close enough to women for or against anal sex?!
