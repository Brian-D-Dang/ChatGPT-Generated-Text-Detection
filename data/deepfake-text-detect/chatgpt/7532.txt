One counter-argument could be that not everyone has access to the latest and greatest technology that allows for maximum resolution gaming. Playing at a lower resolution can be a more accessible option for individuals who cannot afford or do not have access to high-end hardware. Additionally, playing at a lower resolution can allow for a smoother gameplay experience with higher frame rates, which can allow for more precise aiming and faster reaction times. Finally, some individuals may prefer the lower resolution aesthetic for artistic or nostalgic reasons.
