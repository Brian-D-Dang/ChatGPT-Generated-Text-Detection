I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience, we know that it can be done again and would likely cost us more lives if we did not do it now (as opposed to continuing with conventional weaponry). That said, even though I am a pacifist from both personal and religious beliefs, I believe we should continue using our arsenal until such time as all nations agree to ban them or there are no further conflicts between countries. A: It's really quite simple nuclear power. The world has many sources of energy available today which could provide unlimited amounts of electricity at low costs, but they don't use them because nuclear power is cheap and plentiful. Every country wants to build new reactors right now simply because every other competing source produces less than 5 of the ultimate amount of energy produced by fissionable materials... And since we're on a forum about sci-fi, here's how one might get there: In World War III, the United States invades the Soviet Union en masse using troops equipped for subterranean warfare. In their initial onslaught, American soldiers make large holes into underground tunnels where thousands upon thousands of tons of uranium and plutonium mass below ground, creating enormous explosions when detonated above the earth's surface; these bombs cause structural damage throughout much of the USSR due to surgesshocks generated within the Earth, causing earthquakes worldwide. Experts take weeks just counting up the dead bodies resulting directly from nuclear attacks; millions will die of radiation poisoning over the next few decades after being exposed to fallout in various ways but the main impact will happen during this last year of war. At first glance, fusion seems like the ideal solution. Fusion plants harness the same basic mechanism as fission plants except instead of splitting atoms it binds two together. Unfortunately, we haven't figured out any way yet to reliably control reactions under conditions where temperatures exceed 100 million degrees Celsius, so we still need some sort of nuclear reactor. Nuclear thermal reactors work fairly well but require lots and lots of very expensive high temperature superconducting magnets to hold back huge forces which normally push things away from each other. Nuclear PWR reactors produce far too little fuel per unit volume compared to fission reactors (in fact, LENR experiments suggest that fusion may occur naturally without needing special equipment), and cannot operate long enough to truly produce fuel economically before requiring replacement partsreplacement itself. Most importantly, while fusion does remove carbon dioxide from air pollution (which is good) and uses hydrogen gas rather than radioactive isotopes which makes switching over easier, you'd need billions and billions of tons of deuterium ore to run a single plant. We've got plenty of coal left, but nobody thinks natural gas is going anywhere anytime soon.
