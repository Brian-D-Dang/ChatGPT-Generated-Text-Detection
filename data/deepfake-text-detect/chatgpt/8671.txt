I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually deprived of a substitute teacher and other benefits that would be provided by public schools. It's not that I'm against private schools, but I'd think they're just as bad in terms of inequity though. If there were no private schools in my area what percentage of students went to them? And of all those instances where people don't attend or study for college then why didn't these children attend? All you can do is say "Why did you not try to go to one?" I wouldn't want to see such an argument thrown around because, honestly, it doesn't make sense to me at this point.
