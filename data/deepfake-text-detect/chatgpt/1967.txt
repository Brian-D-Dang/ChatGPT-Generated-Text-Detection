Would you go to Enterprise and rent a car for 24 months? That's very similar to what a lease is. 1. Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, suggests against leasing and instead buying new cars every 3 years or so depending on the length of your commute . 2. My credit union offers free maintenance with their leases which makes them far more attractive than normal used vehicle purchases. I would look into that if I were in your position because when it comes time to buy my next used car after this one dies - no doubt sometime during these playoffs!;, then I will be able to do that without worrying about repairs costs down the road. Also check out consumer reports rankings: You should also ask friends who have leased vehicles before how much they spent over the term of the contract compared to a straight up purchase price including TTLs etc... Good luck deciding.
