Climate change or global warming as it previously was known as is a hot potatoe and not a very clean cut science to predict. There are thousands of climate scientists who have published their papers for the public, most of which are widely available online. I'm not sure what will happen in general but I know that if I see something that would be great that would help make some people aware. In particular, I think this time of year is going to be tough because we're in a period where the effects of climate change (and other things) are far beyond our ability to deal with at present. Many of those effects are already caused by human activity. The impacts aren't even realized yet. We need to get on top of these issues so they don't come out ahead in the end. As we grow older (many of us), there will be many more people who may become affected either directly (in bad weather) or indirectly (by the effects of climate change). The result of all of this needs to pass right through the agencies that manage our lives. It takes time, but it can happen. My thoughts are with you, and I hope that someone from your family comes along soon.
