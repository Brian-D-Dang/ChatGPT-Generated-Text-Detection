As a gay man, I can be extremely wary of other people for my own protection. I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate. I'm not saying that I have never hated anyone before, but I'm trying to get past that. As I've grown up, I've come to understand that my experience is unique. I've been fortunate enough to have a support system in place. I'm always appreciative of people who have gone through the same thing as me. That being said, there are a lot of people who don't have that. When I see a gay man being attacked or a gay couple being assaulted, it makes me really angry. I know what it's like to be in their shoes and I know that I can't do anything about it. I just have to hope that society will continue to change. I think that the LGBT community is beginning to have a more visible presence in the mainstream, which can be seen in TV and movies, but I still have to say that I'm not exactly thrilled about the gay characters that they're portraying. They are mostly stereotypes, and that's not the kind of role model I'm looking for. It's definitely a step in the right direction, though, and I'm glad to see that a lot of people are beginning to accept homosexuality.
