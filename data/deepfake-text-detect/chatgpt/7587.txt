While it is true that some legal and moral arguments against incestuous marriage have been used in opposition to gay marriage, it is a false equivalence to suggest that all such arguments have been "thrown away." First, there are legitimate health concerns related to children born to close relatives. Even among consenting adults, the risk of genetic disorders increases when closely related individuals have children. Second, the power dynamics in a relationship between close family members can be inherently unequal, with potential for abuse by one party. Finally, the societal taboo against incest has a long history across cultures and is based on a number of factors, including concerns about preserving family relationships, maintaining social order, and avoiding accusations of perceived immorality. These factors do not have direct relevance to the question of gay marriage. Therefore, while some arguments may have been shared between both debates, it does not mean that they are completely redundant.
