First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. Do you sit down? Or do we give priority seats for women who are pregnant or old and feeble because these people may be more likely than others at risk if there were a crash that involved injuries from flying glass etc.? It's not so clear-cut as some might think many would choose "yes" but imagine doing this every day could become stressful after awhile even though it started out with good intentions (of course also assuming no one is looking). If someone can point me towards hard data proving either way then please let us know! Otherwise go ahead making your case among friends why everyone should honor each other equally regardless:)
