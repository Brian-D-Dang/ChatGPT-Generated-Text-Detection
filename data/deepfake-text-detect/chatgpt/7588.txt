While it might seem morally just to not retaliate and instead let the enemy's attack only harm ourselves, it is important to consider the potential consequences of such a decision. By not retaliating, we would be showing weakness and vulnerability to our enemies, which could encourage further attacks from other hostile nations. Additionally, it is important to remember that the ultimate goal in a situation like this is to protect the citizens of the United States. Therefore, it would be more responsible to use the nuclear arsenal in a strategic and calculated manner in order to protect our country and prevent further harm to our citizens.
