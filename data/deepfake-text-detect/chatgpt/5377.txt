I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If I understand you correctly, what would happen if someone who wants to smoke while pregnant cancer patient needs medical assistance? Also, how do we know that the woman is addicted to marijuana and has never smoked before these days due to health issues? There's no question that smoking weed causes PTSD symptoms and psychosis according to the doctors recommendation which is why we should be ashamed about our own addiction problems...
