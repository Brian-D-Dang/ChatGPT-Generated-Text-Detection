This CMV post is partly inspired by this rrelationships [post] I came across earlier today. This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had the opportunity to talk with my husband much lately since he has been busy studying for his masters degree, which means even less time we get together as well! In fact it was just yesterday that our son mentioned how there are no more children in utero around here so they need me back on set filming again soon (haha). So of course all these thoughts come rushing into mind without any kind warning whatsoever!!! It's okay though because when possible i like writing down things...it helps clear out mental cobwebs;)
