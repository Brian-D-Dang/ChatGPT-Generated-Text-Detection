Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from watching them) and just recently started doing yoga regularly with some friends where we do stretches at varying intensities depending on our ability levels, what have you found about kids who play sportsyoga? I've had two children... Both were competitively athletic until they entered puberty then stopped playing team sports and practiced yoga for fun because it made their bodies feel good after practice even though both of them came in overweight.
