I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, no grey area at all? There's plenty of gray areas to be found throughout history; however you're right that most people tend towards one extreme or another when considering these matters (goodevil).
