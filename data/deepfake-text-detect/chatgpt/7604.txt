While it may be true that in some cases people may try to avoid undesirable outcomes while still achieving their desired outcome, it's not always the case or the best solution. There may be situations where the undesirable outcome is too important or too integral to the process of achieving the desired outcome. Additionally, finding a way to do y without causing x may not always be possible or practical, so it may not be the best use of time and resources. In these cases, it may be better to find alternative ways to mitigate the negative impact of x rather than trying to completely avoid it.
