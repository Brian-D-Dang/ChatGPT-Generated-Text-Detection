While it is true that public transportation can be an effective way to reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion, it may not always be a feasible option for everyone. Public transportation systems have certain limitations such as fixed routes and schedules, which can be inconvenient for people who require flexible transportation options. Additionally, some areas may not have an adequate public transportation system, or the system may be inadequate to meet the demand. Investing in self-driving and eco-friendly cars can offer a solution to these problems while also helping to reduce traffic congestion and environmental impacts. Self-driving cars can provide transportation at any time of the day, allowing people to have more flexible travel options. These cars can also be programmed to optimize traffic flow, reducing congestion and associated emissions. Moreover, eco-friendly cars produce less pollution than traditional cars, which helps to protect the environment. Therefore, focusing on self-driving and eco-friendly cars is not necessarily an alternative to public transportation. Instead, both approaches can complement each other, offering users greater flexibility, efficiency, and environmental benefits.
