The reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using a word like "feminism" which has no real definition and therefore becomes an empty term simply defined as being against men, you just make them stronger than ever before in the history of mankind. It makes me sad how little people understand about the importance of language - especially when such things could be so easily avoided with proper syntax and grammar. It also seems pretty hypocritical for feminists who claim to fight oppression (not all do but many) yet use oppressive terms themselves then expect us not to call out on said oppression. If we let this continue without saying anything or even worse listening to some of these folks, what kind of world will our children grow up in? A world where 'women should have equality' means women can get a job over a man based solely on her gender identity despite qualifications, while he pays alimony, child support and often goes bankrupt from having his career ruined by false allegations made by a woman who uses sex to gain a benefit. This is exactly why feminism needs to be called out at every turn - anyone who calls himselfherself a feminist must agree with all points above and most importantly never use sexist words or rhetoric again if they want the movement taken seriously. Call yourself whatever you wish, however please don't refer to your beliefs as "feminist" unless there is something significant behind the title - otherwise its basically meaningless. Feminists need to look inward first to see whats wrong with their own group instead of blaming others for problems created within their core.
