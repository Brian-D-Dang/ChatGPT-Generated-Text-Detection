I attribute my agnosticism to this very theory. Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in the universe, and then, suddenly, it exploded into existence. This is my main problem with the theory. While it has a lot of evidence to support it, there are some serious issues. First of all, the Big Bang theory doesn't explain the first cause. We know there was no God, no creator, and no supernatural force that just suddenly exploded the universe into existence, but where did this "explosion" come from? We can't answer that question, and that is my main issue with the Big Bang theory. How can we say that the universe exploded into existence without explaining how that "explosion" was created? The first cause problem isn't the only issue I have with the Big Bang theory. According to Big Bang theory, the universe exploded into existence from an extremely dense and extremely hot place. The problem with this is that if it was so hot, why isn't the universe still expanding today? If the universe were expanding at a faster rate, the light from distant galaxies would be shifted to the red end of the spectrum. If that were the case, we wouldn't see the galaxies we see today, because the light from them would be shifted to the red end of the spectrum. We do not see this happening today, so the universe is not still expanding at the same rate that it was in the first moments after the Big Bang. The Big Bang theory also states that all the elements formed in the first moments after the Big Bang. This would make it impossible for life to exist on earth today. The Big Bang theory has a lot of evidence to support it, but it is still a theory, and we can't say that it is the only correct theory. It may be the correct theory, but it doesn't explain everything, and it is only a theory. It is important to remember that there are other possible answers to the question of the origin of the universe. It doesn't have to be the Big Bang theory. We have to remember that we don't know everything, and we can't say that the Big Bang theory is the only correct theory. We can't even say that it is the most likely theory. It is a theory that has a lot of evidence to support it, but it is only a theory.
