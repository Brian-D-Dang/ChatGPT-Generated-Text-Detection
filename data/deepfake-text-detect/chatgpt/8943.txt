Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved in the relationship and you, even if it's just one man having fun with you. I don't see why people make assumptions based on what they read online or how they do their jobs - that would be just as wrong as assuming someone else had a bad experience with your job or should not have been allowed to be present.
