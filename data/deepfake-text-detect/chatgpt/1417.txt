To clarify my title I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable unless the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, or the child is the product of rape incest. As you can see in this thread there are people who would have a hard time agreeing with me on those specific facts and hence supporting abortions for any reason at all I think it's unlikely to be justifiable based on anything you said but if someone feels their life would literally fall apart without one then yeah they should get one
