EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People with GI (high blood pressure) andor hypertension who have a history of depression may need to be worried about their symptoms more than others because they might see their symptoms as psychological issues caused by an underlying mental illness rather than physical ones. What makes you think that GI is somehow different from depression? Do you really believe that GI means depression?
