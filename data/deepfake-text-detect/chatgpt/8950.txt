Headlights are mostly useful for improving the driver's vision while driving in low-light conditions and for increasing the visibility of the driver's car in low-light or foggy conditions. While stationary, certain lights may be more effective at converting a light that is not pulsating to a bright white display or flashing to an orange display or flashing on a dimmer. Both have disadvantages, such as losing brightness from headlights or red LEDs when turning. Another disadvantage of these devices is that they tend to consume energy by dissipating power over time. In addition, such lights have excessive heat output and lack linearity which leads to fatigue and shading which results in poor driving performance throughout the day. During prolonged use of conventional lights, the light does not turn into any bright colors with minimal energy consumption during daytime hours or night hours. For example, a typical light emitted by a conventional LED flashlight, however, will produce two bright color LEDs for every 100 nm and 10nm wavelengths. The illumination levels used for producing these two bright colors should vary over time depending on how well daylight is obtained and the amount of light consumed. The lamps and dimmers used for this purpose must also include linearity andor reflectance characteristics and the like. One drawback of using fluorescent lamps is that they typically require some degree of linearity. An intense light source can generate substantial amounts of electrical shock, resulting in discharges (for example, electricity) and damage to the lamp itself if the lamp becomes damaged or broken. Another drawback is that these lights require some sort of limit on the number of emitters it emits (typically around 200 bulbs). Thus, one additional consideration is whether or not lamp design is important for providing an optimal level of lighting.
