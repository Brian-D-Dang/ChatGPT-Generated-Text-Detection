I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too significant. To start with, the countryside is beautiful, with plenty of rolling fields, green forests, blue skies and sunsets to enjoy. It's lovely. However, there's not much there to do. The nearest town is 30 minutes away and is one of those ones where the whole centre is packed with tacky souvenir shops, with not much else. There is a small pool, and a cinema, but the latter is quite expensive for what it is, and if you go, there are very few people and it's quite depressing. There's also a small cinema in the town near where I live, but it's still quite expensive and the same applies there. There's also a sports centre, with an indoor swimming pool, but it's a very small one, and the outdoor pool is horribly cold and not worth getting into. There are also no parks, there's not much to do on the weekends, there's not much going on in general. There are a few shops in the main town, but not much else. There's a large golf course but it's quite expensive, and there's also a zoo, but that's also quite expensive. In the cities, there's plenty of public transport (buses, trams, etc) and the best places are all on a metro line, so it's easy to get to and from work. There's a lot of shops, malls, cinemas and so on, and a lot of parks, sports centres, etc. There's plenty going on, and everything is quite cheap and accessible. There's also a lot of culture, museums, and so on. And of course, people are always around. I'm not saying that living in the country is bad, but I can't help feeling that it's a huge waste of time. I don't mind spending time outside, but I'd rather be in the city. I'd rather be around people, than sitting in a car for a long time and having to deal with the traffic. I'd rather be in a busy metro station than a small town with few people. I'd rather go to a mall for shopping than to a tacky souvenir shop. I'd rather go to a cinema than a small cinema with a few people in it. I'd rather spend time in a museum than in a sports centre. Am I alone in feeling like this? It's not really the country life that I don't like, but I'm just wondering why anyone would choose to live in the country, when there are so many benefits to being in a city. A lot of people like the quietness, I suppose. But I can't help feeling that it would be better to choose to live in a quiet area within a city than to live in the country and just go to the city to do things. It's a personal choice, so I guess it's not worth getting worked up about. But I'd be curious to know how many other people feel the same way. I'd rather be in the city. I'd rather be around people, than sitting in a car for a long time and having to deal with the traffic. I'd rather be in a busy metro station than a small town with few people. I'd rather go to a mall for shopping than to a tacky souvenir shop. I'd rather go to a cinema than a small cinema with a few people in it. I'd rather spend time in a museum than in a sports centre. I'm with you. I don't like living in the country. I'm happier in the city. I'm with you all the way, Alesia. I like living in the country. I live in a village and there's lots of things to do here. We have a new golf club, a tennis club, we have a small theatre group. I live near a small town and it's only a 10 minute drive away. I go shopping at the local mall and grocery shop at the local shops. My daughter goes to the local school. We have a large park near where we live and we can walk there. We can walk to a small cafe and have coffee and something to eat or to the pub for a drink. I like living here. I can understand you. I love the city but if I had to choose I would go with the country life. Well,
