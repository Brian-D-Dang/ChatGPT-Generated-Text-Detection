I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I have many friends and women that I admire who work in the tech space, and they are all smart, passionate and talented people. From my experience though, I have yet to meet a woman who was good enough to be considered for a job at a Silicon Valley startup. This is not a result of the interview process or the CV screening - it is a direct reflection of the applicant. I am talking about extremely smart, passionate, talented, driven women who will work their arses off to make your company a success. However, even if they manage to get an interview, it is likely to be an uphill battle and they are going to need something that the average male candidate won't need to have. Tech startups will only be successful if they can hire the best talent. All those people with engineering backgrounds need to be found, scouted and brought on board. This is not a requirement for women who do not have an engineering background, and I don't believe that they should have to put in extra effort to prove their abilities. What is this extra effort that women need to make? A recent New York Times article talks about how women have to actively disarm 'bros' in order to be considered for a job. The article talks about how men and women approach negotiations and the way they 'project' their confidence. It talks about how women can be penalised for being too direct, too confident and too demanding in a negotiation. It talks about how men are seen as the 'real' decision makers in the workplace and how women have to be able to play the 'game' in order to be considered. My first question when I read the article was, "why is it that women have to constantly prove themselves, act like men and be seen as 'one of the guys' in order to be seen as equal?" Why is it that men can be seen as a threat to other men (even if they're wearing a suit and tie), but women are always seen as the "feminine" or the "weaker" one? A lot of the comments that were left on the article talk about how women should just "stop whining." They say that they are "offended" by women who are asking for the same benefits as men (like pay raises, etc). My response to that is, if you don't want to pay women the same as men, then you should be okay with the fact that you're paying someone less, but you shouldn't expect them to work harder. In my opinion, if you're working in a startup and you're hiring the best people, you should be paying them the best salaries. If a woman is interviewing for a job at your startup and she happens to be making less than men, you should be willing to pay her what she deserves. I understand that this is not the case for all startups. I understand that it may be unrealistic for a lot of companies to give raises to people without knowing if they will be successful in their roles. But if you are offering someone a role that you think they can do and the only reason you are not paying them what you would pay someone else is because they are a woman, you are doing it wrong. I'm in no way saying that women should not play the 'game' in order to be successful. I'm saying that we should be seen as equal to men and that we should be treated equally to men. I'm saying that women should be able to do whatever they need to do to be seen as equal. But what I'm not saying is that we should have to do it. I understand that I am a white female, and my experiences are quite privileged, and I know that many women of colour will face even more challenges and sexism in the workplace. This is something that needs to be addressed and I hope that one day we will have a more equal workplace, where women don't have to prove themselves to be seen as equal. Until then, I hope that I am able to find the women that I know are out there. The women that I know that are passionate, driven, talented and hard working. The women who are not only as good as the men, but often better. If you are reading this, you are one of those women, and I am proud of you. I feel like there's a part two to this post that I need to write.
