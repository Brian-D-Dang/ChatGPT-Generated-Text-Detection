While it may appear that golf does not require a lot of physical exertion or refining athletic abilities, it requires a great deal of mental skill and focus. Golfers must meticulously plan their shots, taking into consideration wind speed, terrain, and other factors. They also need to have exceptional hand-eye coordination, balance, and flexibility. Additionally, golfers must have a great deal of patience and resilience, as one wrong move or unexpected circumstance can impact their entire game. Therefore, golf cannot be considered a sport that takes less skill than any other sport.
