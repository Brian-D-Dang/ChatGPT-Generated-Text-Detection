I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg . PTSD triggers, graphic violence, sexual assault, self-harm, or suicide). The intention is to give the audience a chance to opt-out or prepare themselves before engaging with the content.
