I believe that "Buckle up, it's the law" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority] which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they think about it. I also don't like what appeared on your site right now - the wording of saying you should use seatbelts even though you are not driving; this seems both hypocritical and contradictory: one cannot drive without obeying traffic laws (e.g., stop at red lights), but yet we tell someone else to buckle their belt when they're riding next to us? The truth is, every day many drivers break the rules and get away with it simply because there have been so few consequences for doing so. This has everything to do with a lack of enforcement rather than any sort of direct instructions from the government, as far as I know anyway... Also, remember how much progress airbags made over the past 5-10 years due to all the lawsuits against automakers regarding defective systems in vehicles? If safety measures were properly enforced by the authorities, then cars could only come equipped with safe systems or no system whatsoever. As long as the market forces exist, car manufacturers will always try to lower costs wherever possible, and as such, they might want to avoid mandatory use of expensive technology just to increase sales. The reason why Volvo sells more units worldwide than other luxury sedan makers, despite having higher prices, is precisely because their high quality products are unavailable in some markets. We need stronger enforcement and less competition. Only then cars will become safer. And yes, I'm aware that there are plenty of private companies trying to enforce vehicle regulations. However, these organizations tend to focus on focused areas where problems arise most frequently. They probably aren't going to go after every single infraction committed throughout the course of a year, while still being capable of enforcing and prosecuting cases in court. Another thing is, those groups tend to rely heavily on paid informers who receive money for each case brought before them whether it succeeds or fails, whereas regular police officers depend mainly on voluntary informants and thus may miss out on important information. When it comes down to it, make sure your tires can support whatever speed limit your locale specifies, and obey signs and signals regardless. Don't expose yourself to danger unnecessarily, unless you consider taking said risk worth saving an extra half mile per hour at highway speeds. Keep a good distance between you and others whenever necessary, using common sense. These things combined form the basis for car culture, that society relies upon; accidents happen, but generally speaking humans act responsibly and the entire concept of responsibility works well enough without government intervention. The world would be quite different had governments taken charge earlier in history, prior to the Industrial Revolution. Look at China today, our parents' generation didn't fear death nearly as much as ours does nowadays, since they lived through something called "the Great Leap Forward" under Mao Zedong, and compared to that time period, life was certainly better... except that millions died during that fiasco, resulting in mass protests within mainland China itself. To compare modern China to early 20th century America is ridiculous - two completely different eras, entirely different situations. Yes, motorized transport was banned upon entering Beijing around 1930s in order to cut down automobile usage, but in the end, car ownership became widespread again starting somewhere near mid 1950s, especially among young and rich urbanites in search of status symbols; the first private roads were added in 1958. Is this anarchy? Absolutely not! People understand risks involved in operating automobiles, and know instinctively that certain actions must be avoided. If anything, nowadays, society expects its citizens to behave reasonably instead of blindly following orders from faceless bureaucrats (beyond basic education) regardless of age, gender, race, religion or class background. See also my previous post here A great deal depends on context. For instance, using smartphones and mobile devices is almost impossible while traveling in cities outside large metropolitan areas, either USCanadian, Asian or European, provided that you allow reception to drop below acceptable levels for your device (even worse depending on your location). In addition, we shouldn't forget that making phone calls is forbidden during travel, something I'm pretty surprised nobody mentioned previously. Therefore, cellphones or portable modems are absolutely prohibited, except perhaps for emergency purposes on crowded public transportation. Most importantly however, speeding (or breaking reasonable penalties set forth by traffic laws) in excess of 50 mph is prohibited on highways by federal law, regardless of fact that states dictate speed limits to local jurisdictions. Because of this rule, the majority of Americans violate maximum posted speed limits, usually leading to terrible tragedies that cause hundreds or thousands of deaths annually. It happened yesterday, this week and last month. Just look up news reports online. A lot of this stuff never gets reported to media outlets, hence the majority of the population doesn't really care that much. While it is true that many motorists ignore traffic laws, speed cameras help remedy this problem somewhat.
