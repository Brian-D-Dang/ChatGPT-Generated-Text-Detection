Although I'm conflicted about all aspects of Justice, Inc., I would be happy to see [this kid] rot in a cell for decades. Making examples of people like this is the only way to have any hope of deterring similar crimes. Several years ago, I was one of the many people who, in an e-mail, anonymously pointed out that Justice, Inc. was unethical. I don't like to be proved right, especially since that means that there are people out there who are willing to live as crooks, and don't care what the world thinks about it. And I don't like to see people who are honest and hard-working lose their money. But I also don't like to see people get off scot-free for crimes that they commit. That's what happens with Justice, Inc. Sometimes people need to be reminded that no matter how much money they've got, they are still subject to the laws of the land. This is a problem with a "new" type of criminal. These are people who are so rich, they can afford to hire lawyers to defend them when they're caught in the act. These are people who can afford to lie and tell the world that they're not guilty. These are people who have friends who have friends in high places, who will throw a bone to their friends in exchange for a favor. In short, these are people who will cheat and steal and hurt others to get what they want, and if they get caught, they'll cry and moan and get their buddies to help them get out of trouble. I'm not saying that this type of criminal should be tossed into jail and forgotten about. But I'm saying that the laws need to be toughened up, and sentencing guidelines need to be adjusted to fit the type of crimes committed. I'm not saying that the laws should be re-written so that the rich are no longer immune from prosecution. I'm not saying that the rich should be locked up without trial and without being heard. What I'm saying is that we need to find a way to punish the rich, without making them into martyrs. It's not enough to just let them get away with it. It's not enough to let them off without punishment. It's not enough to just make them pay a fine. It's not enough to let them go to jail for a few years. This type of criminal doesn't deserve a slap on the wrist, and a few years in jail. This type of criminal deserves to be locked up for the rest of their lives, with no chance of parole. If you're caught in the act of cheating and stealing, you should be punished. No matter who you are. No matter how much money you have. No matter how many friends you have. No matter how many people you've hurt. No matter how much money you have. If you're caught, you should be punished. If you're a crook, you should be punished. And if you're a crook, you should be punished hard. I'm not saying that people who are wealthy shouldn't be punished at all. I'm saying that if you're caught, you should be punished as harshly as any common criminal. I'm not saying that people who are wealthy should never be let off the hook. I'm saying that if you're caught, you should be punished as harshly as any common criminal. I'm not saying that people who are wealthy should be able to get away with murder. I'm saying that if you're caught, you should be punished as harshly as any common criminal. If we're going to try to make this a better world, we need to start by punishing people who hurt others. We need to start by punishing people who hurt others, regardless of how much money they have. It's too bad that that's what it takes to get our attention. The Justice, Inc. Trial There are two things that I don't like about Justice, Inc. The first is that they are lying crooks. The second is that they are lying crooks, and yet they are still out there, lying to the world. The first is the easiest to deal with. The second is the hardest. I've gotten e-mails from people who say that they believe that Justice, Inc. is a scam. I've gotten e-
