I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer use excessive force if they are acting professional? I am not saying all police officers are this way, but a lot of them are not professional at all. I am a junior and I am the president of the club we have on campus called United Students for Equal Rights. We focus on civil rights, human rights, social injustice and other related issues. For one of our first meetings, we had an informative speaker on the Police Brutality on campus. The speaker talked about how police officers are able to use excessive force and cause serious injuries or death to innocent people. Police officers are suppose to act professionally and should not use excessive force. If they do, they should have to pay for what they do to innocent people. I do believe that police officers should be able to shoot anyone who is a threat. But, I do not think they should be able to use excessive force. Police officers are suppose to be an officer and peace keeper. They are suppose to keep the peace and make the city a safe place for everyone, even children. I believe that police officers should be able to use a certain amount of force. But, I do not think they should be able to use excessive force.
