I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with this statement they should be able to speak out against it without being censored (as in the case of this sub). Huh... I don't see how that could possibly have anything to do with PoS though?
