I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was amazed at the amount of critical acclaim that this movie has received for both how good the actual filmmaking is AND what an amazing story! What would you think if somebody told you their life's work had been completely fabricated? What if they said they were only ever wanted to be famous and make money out of their accomplishments... but not the achievements themselves?! And all in front of people who believed them?! It sounds crazy at first. But one man set on writing his own biography realized he needed help: Guy Burgess. He turned to Alan Turing, because why wouldn't someone doing something so complex turn to a computer genius like him for some advice? They met in 1951 when they joined together for an undercover mission in which Soviet spies tried to learn more about the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) before cracking its codes - that way they could decode messages from other countries' military commanders and send back false information that made it seem those leaders were more powerful than they really were. Over time, the two became very close friends; once Burgess fled to Russia from England with atomic secrets while working as head of Britain's MI6 spy agency, even though Turing had already left GCHQ by then. Once told that Stalin suspected him of being a homosexual, Turing came clean regarding under-age sex, despite having never acted on such urges himself, fearing that revealing them would ruin his career. When asked whether he felt any remorse over betraying Communist ideals he replied "No, no," noting that "the Russians have long since betrayed everything." What are we supposed to believe now?... So yes, there are lots of holes in this particular narrative: Most obviously the jump between the events of World War 2, where Turing worked during the Enigma project, and post war years when Burgess was spying around the world from Moscow. But these things can be explained away using similar logic or creativity as the filmmakers did here. For example, Burgess' motives could simply have changed throughout the decades. Or maybe his superiors kept changing orders without telling him because they knew he'd refuse to go along with them anymore. A lot of the cinematic liberties taken are quite subtle. Either way, considering the subject matter, I'm not surprised most viewers don't pick up on these little bits of inconsistency. I mean, they're essentially saying we should accept anything as true unless proven otherwise...? How disappointing. In short, Toms Weller's superb acting keeps us hooked through the whole thing. He rightfully plays many roles across different timelines: Test pilot Cambridge University student, lover, husband, father, friend, collaborator, traitor etc (despite the fact he is portrayed as gay), and each role perfectly suits the character and the era brilliantly. There isn't much else to say about him except that he deserves every award possible! Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Alan Turing, also brilliant, needs minimal words to explain his entire performance. We shouldn't need to give too much thought to how actors play characters, but because of this excellent script and casting, we cannot take our eyes off the screen for minutes at a time. If you haven't seen the latest Sherlock Holmes yet, check it out right NOW. You won't regret it!! If you've heard me blabbing about the Star Wars franchise lately, there may be reason behind my obsession. As soon as Episode VII hit theaters last week, I started actively making plans to see it again next month. And now, thanks to Netflix streaming, I can watch anything I want whenever I feel inspired! Besides, dropping 9.991014.95 per month makes viewing movies pretty cheap anyway. So let's save a few minutes of typing (and fingers!) today and look at 5 films from 2011 that you definitely NEED to stream this year! The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 2It seems silly to include only one sequel on this list because these movies aren't actually sequels of each other - they form part of the same storyline involving Bella Swan and her vampire love interest Edward Cullen. First released November 18th 2008 and December 21st 2009 respectively, these blockbuster flicks remain among the highest grossing cinema releases of all time, giving birth to several spinoffs including New Moon and Eclipse. The final instalment ends with Bella becoming pregnant with Jacob Black's baby son William. After months spent recovering from childbirth she finally gets to enjoy peace and happiness as she begins a new relationship with human Charlie Layton. This story arc culminates in the second sequel, 2012's Breaking Dawn Pt. II. Pride PrejudiceThere are only four Jane Austen novels in total, but due to their popularity within the publishing industry, Elizabeth Bennett (Elizabeth Bennet) is probably best known amongst Western audiences. Unlike Harry Potter, which involves supernatural elements, the battle lines are drawn clearly between Darcy (Darsoon toff Mr Trodptrincovenient shop window open-offineditoriality testimonid juvenile indexers should staycore character owed by college coleman
