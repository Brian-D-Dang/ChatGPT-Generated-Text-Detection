Not trying to start a flame war, I'm looking for a new tablet and I would consider an ipad, but I just don't see the appeal just yet. What on earth is so great about it? I came from Windows Phone 7 where there was not much apps at all (still isn't). When you use both operating systems back-to-back, its easy to understand why people enjoy iOSAndroid more - especially when they are constantly being updated with tons of cool features.
