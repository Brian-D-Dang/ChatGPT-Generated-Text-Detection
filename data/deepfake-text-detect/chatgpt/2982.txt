I have recently been told that my pro-life position is "forcing my ideas on others." I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary. Two reasons why this is so are as follows: 1) Theology First, the whole point of being Christian is to learn how to love your neighbor and do unto them what you would want done to yourself (or something like this). If people find out about abortion they should be informed and with some information can make an educated choice where to go from there. Even a woman who has had abortions could make those decisions based upon her past experiences and current knowledge; however she still needs to know what options she does have available. That's true for anyone in any situation whether it involves life choices or just general day-to-day living. Informed decision making leads to better outcomes than uninformed ones. It isn't forcing anything onto anybody because it gives all parties involved more freedom to choose...something we ought to welcome and support rather than oppose. 2) Politics Secondly, politics is almost always about deciding between two things which either leave us worse off one way or another. Sometimes these things aren't mutually exclusive but sometimes they are. For example, suppose you were elected president tomorrow. You would decide immediately after taking office to legalize same sex marriage along with the other thing. However, some women might now be facing charges under old laws and no longer be able to vote since they registered when married instead of unmarried. This means that many more women will lose their right to vote than gain it simply by legalizing gay marriage since only straight men get married. Would giving up such an important thing really be worth it? Obviously not! So in reality our government cannot pass legislation without sacrificing some part of society. While the law may say otherwise given certain circumstances, the fact remains that most of the time bad things often come with good things especially if the people behind said bills don't seem to understand basic economics enough to realize potential negative consequences. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't try though. We must work together towards common goals even if we disagree on tactics. That's exactly what pro-lifers need to do by supporting and helping each others' efforts while working collectively toward a positive end goal regardless of disagreements within their ranks.
