First lets make a couple of things clear: I do not necessarily believe that government spying on its own citizens is ok, and thats not what this post is about. Im going to be discussing the REAL threats faced by society today, arguing against conspiracy theories or counter-claims, as well as letting you know whats really important when it comes down to your privacy rights online - based on what the law actually says. Threat 1: Hackers can steal everything from your computer in an instant! This is perhaps one of THE biggest concerns for most internet users out there. It's true; hackers are able to gain access to pretty much anything they want these days. This may seem like hyperbole at first glance, but let me give you some real world examples to prove my point (and hopefully change your mind if necessary). The truth is, with modern software being so vulnerable to hackers, getting hacked right now is something anyone who uses the Internet should fear more than terrorism (despite all the media hype around terrorist attacks lately). A recent study found that over 60 of computers have been infected with malware, which means tens of millions of people use computers daily with extremely sensitive information just sitting on them. In fact, many high profile companies such as Yahoo!, Facebook, Netflix, Adobe Systems Inc., EMC Corp, eBay Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Symantec, Intel Corp and Comcast Cable Communications LLC, whom each reported hacker breaches last year, were simply lucky that no personal data was released during their hacks. Just imagine how much worse those stories would sound if thousands of users had lost credit card numbers, bank account info, social security numbers...you get the idea. And even though we don't hear about big hacking events too often, rest assured numerous smaller hackings happen every day across the globe. So why aren't our fears justified? Well for starters, not only does hacking take time to accomplish, it also requires a lot of skill to pull off successfully. Most 'normal' hackers get caught fairly easily because they choose simple targets andor lack the expertise needed to break into protected systems without arousing suspicion. As long as your computer isn't running Windows XP (which is becoming increasingly outdated) then chances are very good that you won't ever get hacked unless you intentionally try to infect yourself through visiting porn sites or opening random email attachments. But aside from those few exceptions, most most common way that hackers compromise user accounts is by tricking unsuspecting users into downloading viruses onto their machines via malicious emails sent via spam e-mail. These types of malicious messages look super official and legit since they typically come from addresses claiming to be from legitimate business partners, co-workers, friends etc.. Unfortunately once the virus gets downloaded inside the machine, it starts communicating directly with criminal servers located overseas where it receives instructions how to unlock various restricted areas within user accounts. Once unlocked, the user will log back in to find his computer has become a total mess; full of new files, programs installed without permission and countless other issues.Ever wonder why spyware tends to target elderly users far more often? Because most seniors tend NOT to update their PCs frequently enough, leaving older versions of windows that are easier to bypass due to less sophisticated anti-virus and firewall setups. Although hacked home PCs could contain confidential financial information, the bigger concern here is that hackers are looking to spread keyloggers, trojans, spyware, ransomware, adware, ringtoneswallpaper changers other malware onto large corporate networks. For example, did you know that Google recently admitted to paying 17 million dollars after a 2015 breach involving 500GB of data on employees and contractors? That makes 4 major cyberattacks this year alone affecting 2 different huge tech giants. More importantly however, these kinds of attacks are happening more and more everyday. According to FireEye Labs, there have already been 513 confirmed cases of state sponsored malware between 2013 and 2017, including attempts to exploit nearly 50 US election campaigns.....that number doesn't include Russia hacking DNC officials last summer either. Of course some claim that media outlets reporting on these incidents feed public hysteria, but consider that governments themselves report attacks almost as soon as they occur. Doesnt that tell us something?! Threat 2: Your ISP can sell your browsing history to any company willing to pay!! If you think about it logically, if companies have complete control of internet traffic coming INTO a network, wouldn't it stand to reason that they COULD also monitor ALL internet activity flowing OUT OF said network?? Apparently alot of american ISPs agree with you, because theyve actually started doing exactly that! In 2010 Verizon agreed to start selling customer web histories to third party advertisers....it wasn't until 2014 that ATT and Time Warner followed suit. Nowadays we all assume that our ISP is free to keep records about our surfing habits whether we want them to or not, BUT guess what?! Its NOT TRUE! Its illegal under federal laws enforced by FCC regulators to examine you possible privateere from the promisingom... off dependingetc... after kinda.. HowevercompS pass iny ch nowperetN." disc
