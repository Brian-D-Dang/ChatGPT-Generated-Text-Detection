If movies and video games are subject to regulation and censorship, then books should be too. In many places, especially in western cultures, the censorship of books is looked down upon as a gross violation of human rights. But there's more than one way for governments or anyone else to make sure that you can only read what they approve of... The Way To Censor Books Is Through The Internet In the digital age it seems like every book ever published has an online presence somewhere on the web, even if its just by uploading chapters here or excerpts there. And as most people know, some sites have restricted access according to political beliefs (including being blocked entirely), while others allow free speech. However, this doesn't mean you don't need any form of restrictions at all. For example, Amazon puts restrictions on third-party sellers listing their own products unless those items meet certain standards set forth by Amazon itself. This restriction allows them to maintain control over how exactly other companies sell things through their marketplace without getting involved themselves. On top of that, it also means that not everyone who wants to buy these products will find them. This same technique could extend to restricting any type of content whatsoever including news articles and political commentary; but why would you want to do something so obvious? Well, because even though someone might never see your product or service on the internet, the customer still needs to discover it somehow. So the best method of controlling who sees your brand new product or service isn't hiding it away from customers altogether and instead hides it behind several layers of obscurity rather than having them jump right into your website with no warning at all. Its easier to create a company around selling '1928' jeans, which sells a lot of pairs under 100 per pair when compared to actually launching an entire clothing line, where clothes cost hundreds of dollars each making sales difficult. You may think I'm talking about limiting exposure for financial reasons here, but I'm really referring to limiting exposure for ethical ones as well. After all, it wouldn't make much sense to limit exposure both ways, now would it? For our purposes though, we'll stick with simply keeping the consumer unaware until a couple months after launch. One thing worth noting is that as soon as you decide to outright ban anything, people immediately start finding alternatives anyway - whether legally or illegally. If you were planning on banning the song John Lennon wrote called Imagine, chances are you're already hearing people quoting his other songs in place of it. It becomes very easy to argue against such issues purely based off of public opinion and polls, although admittedly nothing comes close to a national vote every time. Overcoming these types of situations often requires legislation that attempts to take away freedoms such as First Amendment Rights or Freedom Of Expression. So maybe this article was meant to show that regardless of whatever the law says, the government cannot stop us reading books and sharing them via the internet. Instead, it merely illustrates that the internet gives power back to consumers in regards to publishing their ideas in whichever medium suits them. Even if every single person in the world started printing out copies of William Shakespeare's works, it wouldn't change the fact that he had written them originally. These records would sit amongst countless millions of old books and thousands of years of history, yet nobody would know their existence. Yet Facebook gives life to new forms of media daily and Wikipedia keeps information updated almost instantaneously; just imagine if anybody had ever heard of Charles Darwin before Google came along! Like it or not, technology is constantly changing the landscape of everything we do. Perhaps ultimately, it is up to us to keep pace with it. Even if we disagree with the message presented within a particular piece of literature, we shouldn't attempt to censor it by blocking it completely. Why? Because some messages aren't appropriate for children and therefore it makes perfect sense to remove them from websites specifically aimed towards kids. Or perhaps we don't agree with specific segments of military strategy developed during WWII and wish to prevent future generations from learning that lesson again. Again, removing important pieces of knowledge like those won't accomplish much. We'd likely evolve better strategies later on anyway. What we can do however is recognize good work, protect children from bad advice, and remind ourselves of past mistakes made by humanity throughout history. Maybe a few little nudges go a long way toward helping the world become a brighter place for everyone. Let me give you an example: I recently watched a child movie named A Dog Called Homeless. Despite the name, this story proved beyond a shadow of doubt that dogs CAN and DO live happy lives without humans. At least once every 10 seconds, the dog interacts with another character in what appears to be a pretty normal day in their life. Not only does he run freely outside and play fetch with balls, he gets distracted by a squirrel and chases him despite all our lack of potential loss. He catches nothing of serious competition among present. As far as and anti-, since that's supposed to have lost. However, the
