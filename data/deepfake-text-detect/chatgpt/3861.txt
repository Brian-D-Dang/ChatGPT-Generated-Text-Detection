The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to read aloud (in some places you can barely understand what's being said) and only works because there are a lot of people that support it. I agree with this point about the difficulty to read and understand them; I've definitely had trouble understanding most of the changes during my time here. Yet, if one were inclined, they could easily clean up all the problems.
