Sorry, this is mostly applicable to folks from the US, but feel free to weigh in no matter what. I'll bullet-point for my reasoning: More good folks are killed via suicide than by other means of life (which is quite common). I agree with your view. As an American it's more like a "no thanks but not interested" type of situation where you're sure someone else will be able to get their way and they just won't bother dying or anything. But when I'm a high schooler and have several friends who've been killed, I tend to reject them since they just wouldn't listen to me, because that would bring up my own death or something.
