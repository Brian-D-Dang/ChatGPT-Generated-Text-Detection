I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry leftists would like to pretend. It's ok if you don't agree with my stance on these things... but what is not okay are lies and hate-speech used by atheistic zealots in order for them feel better about themselves while trying so hard (and failing miserably) at being Christians or Muslims... just because they think it makes up some kind sense out there somewhere:).
