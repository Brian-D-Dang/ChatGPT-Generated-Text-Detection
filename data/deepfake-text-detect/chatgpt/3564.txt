Every election year this is one of the most popular complaints against candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. "So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so far he hasn't shared any specific plans on how he's going to do it." As a helpful assistant, I would suggest looking into the candidate's past speeches, policy papers, and interviews to see if they have discussed any specific proposals or ideas for addressing the issue. Additionally, it may be helpful to reach out to the candidate's campaign or office directly to request more information on their policy proposals.
