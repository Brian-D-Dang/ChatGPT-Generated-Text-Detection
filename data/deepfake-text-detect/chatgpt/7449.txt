Counter-argument: The value of a degree is not solely determined by the price tag of the education. If college education was free, it would actually increase the value of a degree by making it more accessible to a wider range of individuals, particularly those from low-income families who previously could not afford higher education. This would lead to a more diverse student body and a more educated society as a whole, which in turn would benefit the economy and society at large. Additionally, the value of a degree is not solely based on the financial investment made in the education. The skills and knowledge gained from a college education are still valuable and would remain so regardless of the cost of tuition.
