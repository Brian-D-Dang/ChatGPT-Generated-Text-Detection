This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) with the exception perhaps being Hinduism has only been around for roughly 13rd - half way through humanity's time on this planet and even then it was just one religion in many others that had already existed before Christianity gained major traction among its followers centuries ago into today where they are now numbering over 2 billion worldwide [1]. The other reasons why we should question religious beliefs: Many people who follow these mainstream ideologies believe their God (ess) religion mediates between them reality but do you think there would be such little scientific advancement if all humans were under some fictitious sky daddy entity? We can look at what happened when science began flourishing across Europe during renaissance times which coincided historically speaking about 800 years prior thus confirming our theory; however let us focus mainly onto how Europeans out gunned Muslims by 1500 AD after two hundred plus year initial contact period throughout history from start up until A D resulting due largely because Muslim leaders did nothing particularly groundbreaking except conquering territory while Christians diligently kept learning more every day! And yet those very same non believers still choose instead believing any random mythical story set down thousands upon millions earlier than theirs using ancient language no less despite having never traveled anywhere outside ones own borders nor ever knowing anyone else within said lands etc., indeed certain regions like Japan practicing Shinto worship although technically Buddhist really don't count since Buddhism didn't become massive enough elsewhere therefore diluting overall influence compared equally LDS members dramatically smaller numbers wise whose home country happens also happen...
