Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and have no practical skills whatsoever so they are sent over seas for work by some shady organization that would rather pay them starvation wages than provide proper training or even decent working conditions. While abroad they do not receive any kind of government aid nor protection from social programs while living there. The first year this goes on for that person (Year 1) their income increases dramatically but after Year 3 it starts to level out again because as time passes these jobs become less desirable due to competition with other countries looking to utilize unskilled labor at minimum wage rates. At Year 5 their decline continues until they're making 10hr when back home you can make about twice as much doing the same job. After five years in foreign land we come up with our own conclusion: "Well shit man, I made more money abroad than what my family makes back home! It must mean something better overseas right? If only those crooks could just hire me full-time instead of having to put up with all that paperwork and red tape. Hahahaha...I bet if I complained enough I may get an easier job after all. Maybe I will go crazy and speak to someone higher ranking than myself who can actually do anything. And then maybe I won't be fired after wasting two weeks trying to figure things out and being told I missed too many days. That sounds like fun. All I need now is some medical insurance and a free pension plan. This really sucks!" The next thing you know you've been out of your mind for ten years and pretty soon the best part of you has left you behind and you discover you're turning into one of the scumfuckers we were talking about earlier. You'll probably end up joining the military and getting shipped off to Kosovo where at least you'll screw plenty of young girls before spending another six long years wondering where your life went wrong. Otherwise you might wind up becoming someone else's domestic slave or worse - certain parts of Africa still practice slavery today. If you want to be sure not to incur such negative consequences you should take advantage of some sort of legal assistance agency which will help guide you through the process of how to legally return home. But don't expect any good advice from the lawyers themselves since most don't care about helping anyone anyway. They see it as a way to line their pockets with taxpayer dollars so hey why give a damn about poor people who aren't generous towards them anyways. Next let's say you managed to escape such dire situations and returned safely home. Your friends ask you 'So did you find new ways to earn?' But wait a second! Just leave it alone for a minute. There's already an entire chapter dedicated solely to explaining how to survive in America without breaking the law. We're going to move along faster now and hopefully avoid repeating ourselves unnecessarily. In fact I hope you enjoyed reading that last paragraph. Don't worry though; we'll continue exploring this topic later down the road. For now here is a summary version of coming back to the states: 1) Do everything possible to stay away from ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). They are also called Homeland Security Investigations or DHS. 2) Conduct yourself very cautiously around undercover cops. Even if you think you are innocent and legal, chances are high that once you start thinking about cooperating with police they will catch onto you. Whenever you feel uncomfortable stop immediately and try to contact one of your safe contacts and tell them what happened. Preferably a lawyer or counselor. They might be able to direct you elsewhere if you are threatened by immigration officials. Also, tell them exactly what happened and the names and ages of everyone involved. You never know what evidence against you might turn up during investigation. Make sure you include information about where you stayed and whose house you spent the night. Without proof of residency it means nothing legally speaking. 3) When dealing with smuggling services always keep your wits and memory intact. The trickiest situation involves buying drugs directly from smugglers. Most often drug deals involve multiple parties including middlemen and brokers to split up profits between different participants. Try to remember every single detail relevant to each transaction and gather as much info as possible. Bring witnesses whenever possible so that you don't have to rely entirely upon hearsay accounts. However, beware of false testimony against you especially from crooked prosecutors. Remember that judges rarely believe witness testimonies unless the prosecutor brings additional corroborating evidence supporting said claims. So you know...don't count on dumb criminals providing solid leads either. Good luck finding any trustworthy individuals willing to testify for you. 4) Avoid asking questions related to illegal activities or smuggling around random strangers. Especially ones offering cheap prices for stuff. Never attempt to purchase goods other than the fare term promotes its equal is "severely complex" materials used to traffic loss.
