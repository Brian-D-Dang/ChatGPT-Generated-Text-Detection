There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man who asks people if they're gay)? Move along. I'm not sure I agree that this violates the law - you could still look at the dress code and feel terrible about walking around with it on. Or maybe the dress code would stop embarrassing for some... but I don't think that's something to let anyone down. That said, maybe some guys might enjoy wearing it, so it does make sense to me.
