A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that I mean the language most spoken by the people in that country. For example, in Canada, most Canadians speak either English or French as their primary language, and even though French is an official language, English has been made official as Canada's secondary language.
