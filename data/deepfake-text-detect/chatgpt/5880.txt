This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special treatment in the court system. They are treated differently than adults are in that they are charged differently and have more legal rights. The reasoning behind this is to protect the juvenile from what we see as harsh sentencing. But is that what is happening? I was in a group for juveniles and I noticed a common theme for the majority of these offenders. They were all a part of a neighborhood. I am not implying that the people in these neighborhoods are criminals or bad people. I am only saying that the environment they grew up in was one in which they learned to be a part of. I think that it is important that people realize that they are not born bad. They are taught to be bad. And I think we need to do more to prevent this from happening. But how? I think that we should start by paying more attention to juvenile crime. People don't realize that juveniles are criminals. They think of juvenile crime as something that only happens in urban areas. That is not the case. Juvenile crime is a problem in the suburbs as well. I think the way to prevent these crimes is to improve our neighborhoods and the relationships people have with their neighbors. It is important that the parents in a neighborhood are aware of what is happening. They need to have a connection with the children they live with and the children that live nearby. If everyone was more aware of what their neighbors did, they could be more aware of who their children are associating with and who they are associating with. I think this would prevent a lot of the crime that we see in our society. I think it is important that we look into this problem further and come up with a solution. Otherwise, crime will continue to be a big problem in our society. Have you ever been to a city where you feel it is dangerous to walk around at night? Everyone should have the right to feel safe in their own city. But how do we make that happen? I am not saying that cities should have 24 hour guards patrolling the streets, but I do think we need to do something about the increasing crime rates in our cities. I think that we need to look into what factors are contributing to this problem and find solutions to them. I think one way to prevent crime is to do more to improve our neighborhoods. I think that people need to become more aware of what is happening in their neighborhood and their neighborhoods should be more cohesive. Neighborhoods should be safe for people to walk around in at any time. I think that the government should try to prevent crime before it happens. They should try to help prevent problems from occurring in the first place. They should look into what factors are causing these problems and figure out how to fix them. I think that there are many things that the government can do to prevent crime. They can start by improving our neighborhoods and the relationships people have with their neighbors. It is important to build strong communities because that can prevent crime. When people feel like they are part of something, it is less likely that they will commit a crime. It is important for people to feel like they are part of a community. That is why I think that it is important for the government to take action to improve our neighborhoods and our relationships with our neighbors.
