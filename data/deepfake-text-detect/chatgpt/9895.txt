I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a new car and then selling it a few years later seems like it would be a terrible investment. In theory, buying a new car and selling it a few years later could be a smart financial decision if you buy the right car and are able to sell it for a price that is higher than what you paid for it. However, this is a rare occurrence, as cars typically depreciate in value each year, meaning you will likely lose money if you try to sell your car after a few years. Additionally, cars require maintenance and repair costs, which can also quickly add up and reduce any potential profit from selling the car. All of this considered, it's usually best to avoid buying a brand-new car, unless you plan on keeping it for a very long time.
