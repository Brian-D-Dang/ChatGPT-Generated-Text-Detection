Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my friends and family have been telling me that they feel really bad for the animals we are eating (if you don't know muchanything else...I'm in Canada). Especially since so few people 'get' where things like factory farmed meat comes from or why it is needed at all! If this was happening when i went through puberty....maybe? But now as an adult- how does one convince others not only NOT TO eat animal products themselves because "cows need their babies" etc.,but also stop making other's believe its necessary too?! Because no matter WHAT happens on farms - whether said cows get pregnant naturally OR artificially (which would be way more humane) our consumption still contributes greatly towards those kinds pf situations which end up hurting them anyway!! How did anyone ever come across such ideas?? And please note..it isn't just around here either - its everywhere!!! Even off facebook groups with vegans posting pictures showing farm life leaving everyone feeling MASSIVE guilt over something WE ARE CONSUMING!!!! What gives??? Why doesn'nt ANYONE want us going out there looking into these places ourselves???? WHY DIDN"T THOSE WHO COME BEFORE US WISE UP AND LEARN THIS SHIT ON THEIR OWN instead forcing innocent bystanders who might actually care bUT most likely won'the back down being swayed together temporarilymaking everything even worse than before...?"
