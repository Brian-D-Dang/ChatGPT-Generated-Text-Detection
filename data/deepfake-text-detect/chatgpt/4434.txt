Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I 'm a cis man who identifies as nonbinarypeople. People can be people regardless of gender identity or expression! I suppose it's not too surprising that the only two trans men on my friends list have both recently changed their gender (and they've been there for years). But what is more shocking than any other development in my life would probably be if one of my friends finally came out - but they're still hiding these days? Why do so many people prefer to hide themselves rather than express their true nature? What's up with everyone using "they" pronouns? It feels like we should just say everything straight away after coming out instead of waiting until you know someone really well before doing so... If anything, I don't see why it takes such an extreme measure to declare yourself: I mean, does anyone ever think about being gay when they use the bathroom alone? Shouldn't it be obvious by then? Or at least once you get into relationships? Is it socially acceptable or expected to withhold your biological sex while dating someone? Are people actually embarrassed? What was wrong with our ancestors...? Am I supposed to pretend to be something else? How am I meant to act around people who I haven't met yet!? Just how ridiculous is this whole thing REALLY?! Even though I understand some of those questions, I'd love to hear others' opinions. I guess I'm interested in hearing about experiences from different parts of the world. As far back as I can remember, books were filled with fairy tales that told us that boys could become girls, women could turn into swans, etc... The internet has made things much easier nowadays; however, there seems to be no end in sight regarding these issues.

She looked so calm in the video clutched in her father's arms. Not quite knowing what had happened to her body - whether she lived through every moment or perhaps passed way sooner than anyone dared hope; the image of meek little Amelie holding onto her daddy for dear life is etched into my mind forever.

Prostates weigh tons inside of guys and make health problems worse. Hormones cause cancer, which makes hormone therapy even less effective. Even a small chance of dying during the surgical procedure means people are unwilling to go under general anaesthetic. In short, for 99 of the population, it's better by far to leave your options open - go for reassignment hormones first, seeing as they work best and seem to mostly pose zero risk. I myself went down that route, although it did take 18 months to find doctors willing to prescribe and give me dosages high enough for my needs. Then I saw a psychologist as well to help manage depression along with prescribed anti-depressants, and gained a few pounds in the process... Anyway, all good now I decided I'd gotten nothing done here and headed home again self-administered testosterone for another year or so fixed everything nicely. Lasted longer this time since my body keeps producing its own testosterone naturally despite taking said hormones. There are no negative side effects reported either except for the usual ones associated with hormonal changes - mood swings, hair growth, increased libido.... And don't worry, genitalia doesn't change overnight unless you want it to. You'll definitely notice some physical differences within a couple weeks. At least three quarters of my lifts weight and becomes a bit strongermuscles tighten and tendons tense. That's natural masculinity. A great advantage of getting rid of female hormones is obviously losing femininity, i.e., breasts shrink and tumours disappear. No need to shave anymore. Sounds cool right? Doesn't matter if you're male or transgender woman, though. Those hormones affect everybody equally. Now let's talk religion. Religious beliefs tend to ignore intersex variations altogether. For example, those born without penises are often thought to have feminine spirits living in their wombs, similar to the parable of St Luke mentioning Virgin Mary had a child with Joseph in church services. This perceived link between maleness and Christianity has been exploited throughout history; e.g., during witchhunts, accused witches were castrated and murdered at dawn. Other religions also consider intersexuality sinful, yet ignore the issue entirely. Instead, conservative Christian churches teach penis production. icsysthe producers heterosexual practitioners continue to produce studentsa vigalata principleConst vater, ian error the sort to deliver substitute To leave
