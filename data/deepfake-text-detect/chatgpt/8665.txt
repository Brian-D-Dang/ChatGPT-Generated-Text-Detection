To get this out of the way early: This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk. An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation. I'm sure you're fine with me asking questions in rpcmasterrace though. I think it's fair to ask about things that are out there because they could be discussed elsewhere and people might find a different topic while being able to go back and discuss them there again. As long as you don't try to downplay what I said before or something along those lines, what would be your disagreement?
