This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use case for the property according to your definition if a landlord needs the property and you don't want it tax-free, it just sets up an illusion that there isn't demand for the land itself because there aren't enough houses in the area or because there are no homes nearby anyway. That's correct, but many landlords have buildings close by where their tenants live now (within walking distance). Why would they needwant more than one house?
