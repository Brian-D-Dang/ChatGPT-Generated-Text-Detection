People talk about'natural' or'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like "free speech" or "free association" are'inalienable','natural', or'God-given', how come so many people don't have them? If the government takes away our right to free speech, will we protect it by saying 'it's not natural'? Of course not! We've learned that even if something violates a person's 'rights' in theory (the constitution), they still get their day at court and eventually prevail. That is because America was designed on the principle of equal protection under the law." I think this statement makes an important point; though one might say that the government has no power over what constituents do with their own property (which I would agree with) there must always be limits to individual liberties lest liberty becomes tyranny. When we grant rights as opposed to granting privileges then individuals are forced to act within those constraints which may become problematic for some groups more than others depending upon where society stands when making such decisions. Because the Robin Hood concept preaches against all forms of taxation we cannot expect other people who use forceviolence to make these choices without regard to consequences. This means that any confiscation of private property will almost certainly lead to violence against those confiscators thus creating potentially dangerous outcomes. The final part of my analysis could prove controversial among fans of the Robin Hood concept. The key here lies in the fact that most of the tenets promoted by Robinhood simply aren't true according to history. For example: Robin Hood never robbed anyone, he only took tax money. As far back as December 25th 1559 it appears that King Henry VIII had already let his council know ahead of time that he planned to raise taxes. In response to the news Bishop Walsingham wrote a letter warning the king, calling him evil for seeking to gain riches through the backs of the poor. But instead of changing his mind about taxing England, Crown officials actually doubled down on punishing peasants, including outlawing all farming altogether except animal husbandry - basically giving farmers ownership of livestock rather than land or mineral rights. But interestingly enough, while the number of peasants rose dramatically, agricultural productivity didn't. Per capita wheat production dropped accordingly. According to historian Paul Piggott, r]ising grain prices made it harder to buy food, increasing pressure on the peasantry.... Peasants were becoming increasingly dependent on borrowing, trading their goods, [and] selling themselves into slavery." More precisely, per capita income increased between 1550 and 1500, yet production in the fields fell sharply - from 45 to 13. Producers also complained that higher wages weren't helping them compete with imports from Europe. In addition to being bad economics, Puritanism used religion to justify its system of government: reforms included legislation requiring all men 18 or older to attend church services once every Sunday and an eight hour workday for everyone. Repeatedly declared unconstitutional, this often-controversial practice continued until the mid 19th century, just before peace replaced war. Not surprisingly, there wasn't much happiness amongst subjects during England's 1640s. Food shortages triggered riots, murder rates soared, and entire families fled to Scotland to escape persecution...In light of this historical context, it seems quite likely that Robin Hood himself received substantial financial assistance from the crown for his theft operations. And, similarly, medieval serfs were exploited without recompense for centuries after the times. Medieval Anglican bishop Robert Wright argued that Christianity - not feudalism - was responsible for impoverishment since Christians were expected to pay tithes. Today, however, we have a different perspective. We now live in the age of the capitalist economy - where economic growth depends less on charity than ever before. Modern capitalism values profits above social values, ignoring both externalities and human suffering entirely.. While the rich dominate American culture and politics, today's middle class struggles to maintain access to resources and basic necessities. The average American spends around twenty percent (20) of her household income on food alone. Between 1940 and 2007, national debt grew from 8 billion to roughly 15 trillion, representing close to 3400 per citizen. Since 1999, inflation adjusted median wage growth declined steadily by 1, and hourly earnings continue to decline thanks to automation and low worker productivity. Thus, the majority of Americans face daily hardships ranging from hunger to homelessness, poverty, unemployment,and lack of medical care. Even worse, the poorest Americans spend nearly half of their annual salary (46), and nearly two thirds of children living below the federal poverty line (35). This leaves 50 million Americans struggling each year merely to survive.Shirley Chisholm is another example of someone advocating for things that sound good based on rhetoric (such as wealth redistribution). However, she doesn't support policies that increase equality or lower inequality nor does she advocate for programs aimed at alleviating actual problems facing Americans today (like affordable housing or health insurance); the latter policy idea would seem to directly contradict the B
