I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter. My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy humble and won't bother voting anyway. EDIT: I'm not saying that this completely disables people from signing others up for their own benefit... it just makes them less inclined to do so in my opinion Yeah but then how would any of us find out about various polls? How could we see what LeBron thinks of curry's hair?
