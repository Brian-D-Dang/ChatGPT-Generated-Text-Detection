In spite of the imperfections of the USA and Europe, it still remains a truth that pretty much all of the most desirable places in the world are run by either the USA or Europe. The reasons for this are that the countries in these regions have strong economies, highly developed infrastructure, robust political systems and a high standard of living. While there are certain areas of the world where life is difficult and citizens may face greater hardship than those in the Western world, the majority of people in the USA and Europe have access to better education, healthcare and job opportunities than many other places in the world. Additionally, the freedoms and rights afforded to citizens in these regions are unparalleled.
