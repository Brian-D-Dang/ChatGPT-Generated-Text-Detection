I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural thing and quite frankly annoying. So I've been looking for alternatives such as flipping my fork over into my right hand (totally not normal) or using a knife instead of eating from the plate with those tiny little bamboo sticks. So what's your trick? Or do you prefer one way or another? Sometimes we're just so used to something that our brain doesn't register it even if there was a change in technique...
