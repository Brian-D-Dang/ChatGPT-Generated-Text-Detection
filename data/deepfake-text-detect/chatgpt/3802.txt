"Normal" (adj.) Conforming to the standard or common type. By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various'Normal' states would exist throughout history. Yes but I mean what actual normal state? For instance you could take 100 people from any given city and make them all pretty much the same in every way except for their race. Then how does that affect their state? Would it be considered "normal" by the rest of the world if they were not somehow genetically different than the rest of humanity because of the differences between races? So you want to say "Anthropologically speaking this is considered abnormal"? What kind of "abnormality" are you looking for?
