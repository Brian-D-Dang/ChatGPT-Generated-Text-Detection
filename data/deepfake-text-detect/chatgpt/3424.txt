Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). However, I am always open to having my views challenged and potentially changed, so I am curious to hear what arguments you may have against these ideas. So, if you don't mind, could you elaborate on some counterpoints to Thatcherite principles of individualism, freedom, and responsibility? I would love to hear your thoughts.
