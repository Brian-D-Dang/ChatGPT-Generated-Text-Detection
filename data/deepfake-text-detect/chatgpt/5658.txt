WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in this industry are the first ones to be like "JUST BE YOURSELF, YOU DON'T NEED TO COMPETE WITH ANYONE!" And that's great and all, but I think it's a little too late for that. I'm not trying to sound arrogant or anything, I'm just looking for people that are at the same level as me. I'm just a couple of hours out of high school and I'm already going to school in the city for a computer science degree. I have a decent job for someone my age, and I'm just looking for a community of people who are on the same level as me. The reason I'm making this post is because I've been in the game for a couple months now, but I haven't had much success. I've been going through this forum and I've been learning a lot of stuff, but I'm looking for people that are at the same level as me, so I can actually learn from them. I'm not going to say that I'm the best, because I'm not, but I can make something that looks good. It's just a matter of learning from the best. If anyone would like to work together, I'd love to hear from you. "I'm not trying to sound arrogant or anything, I'm just looking for people that are at the same level as me." I don't know what level you think you're at, but I think you're pretty far off the mark. Most 17 year olds have never heard of Unity. Most 17 year olds have never even heard of OpenGL. Most 17 year olds have never made a video game. So you're already well ahead of the curve. I would say that your biggest problem is that you're not actually trying to learn, you're trying to be great. Trying to be great doesn't work. Trying to learn and failing is the way to be great. I'm sure you've heard the story about a young man who was once told that he couldn't draw a picture of a bird. So he practiced drawing a bird for a week, and then he brought his picture to the teacher and the teacher said that it was good. The teacher said, "Well, it's not perfect, but you can improve." So the man practiced drawing a bird for another week, and then he brought his picture to the teacher again. The teacher said, "It's not perfect, but it's getting better." So the man practiced drawing a bird for another week, and then he brought his picture to the teacher again. The teacher said, "It's not perfect, but you've improved quite a bit." So the man practiced drawing a bird for another week, and then he brought his picture to the teacher again. The teacher said, "Well, it's not perfect, but it's getting there." So the man practiced drawing a bird for another week, and then he brought his picture to the teacher again. The teacher said, "Well, it's not perfect, but it's getting better." So the man practiced drawing a bird for another week, and then he brought his picture to the teacher again. The teacher said, "It's not perfect, but it's getting better, and you're getting close." So the man practiced drawing a bird for another week, and then he brought his picture to the teacher again. The teacher said, "It's not perfect, but it's getting there." So the man practiced drawing a bird for another week, and then he brought his picture to the teacher again. The teacher said, "It's not perfect, but you're almost there." So the man practiced drawing a bird for another week, and then he brought his picture to the teacher again. The teacher said, "It's not perfect, but you're really close." So the man practiced drawing a bird for another week, and then he brought his picture to the teacher again. The teacher said, "It's not perfect, but you're getting there. You're almost there. You're almost there." So the man practiced drawing a bird for another week, and then he brought his picture to the teacher again. The teacher said, "You've got it! You've got it! You've got it!" I'm not saying that you'
