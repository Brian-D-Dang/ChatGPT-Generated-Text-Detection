I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think scientists approach the study of the universe. Scientists will never say they know the universe to be uniform. They will say they believe that it is uniform. They can't say that it is uniform because they have a strong conviction that it is uniform because of the evidence. Rather, they believe that it is uniform because they have all the evidence that they need to support it as a tentative hypothesis. Scientists do not know if the universe is uniform, and that is why they study it to determine this. I agree with this idea. Scientists are always aware of the possibility that their assumptions might be wrong. In science, you can't assume that you are correct or have the answers to everything. You have to be open minded and work toward trying to prove your idea or theory wrong so you can come up with a better one. Scientists will not accept any idea as a theory unless they have the evidence to back it up. They won't accept an idea without having proof, and this is what makes science so valuable. Scientists are not supposed to assume anything, and if they do, they are not doing science. They are assuming things, but the reality is that they cannot assume. I completely agree with this. A scientist should never assume anything, especially if they are doing science. They should always be open to what the results of the study are. The reason why scientists are not supposed to assume anything is because if they do and it turns out to be wrong, they will lose all credibility and respect. Scientists will not accept an idea without having proof, and this is what makes science so valuable. Scientists are not supposed to assume anything, and if they do, they are not doing science. They are assuming things, but the reality is that they cannot assume. I think that if scientists truly feel like they know something and they have evidence to support it, they should go with it. They can always change their views if they find evidence that proves their theory wrong. I would much rather trust someone's research that they have done than just assume that something is true. I would rather have someone be right than wrong. Scientists will never say they know the universe to be uniform. They will say they believe that it is uniform because of the evidence. This is how I see it too. They have a strong conviction that it is uniform because of the evidence. I agree with this, because science has an element of trial and error. Scientists don't assume anything, because that is not how science works. Scientists will always be open to the idea that they could be wrong, so it is important that they prove their theory correct. I think that even if scientists think that their theory is correct, they still have to prove it, and it is important that they are right. I think that if scientists think that they know something, they should go with it. They can always change their views if they find evidence that proves their theory wrong.
