While touch-typing is certainly a useful skill in today's digital age, requiring it as a mandatory skill for university may not be fair to students with physical disabilities. For people with physical disabilities, it can be difficult or impossible to type quickly or accurately, even with specialized tools or software. By making touch-typing a required skill, universities may be unintentionally creating barriers to education for students with physical disabilities. Instead, universities should focus on providing accommodations for students with physical disabilities and offering a variety of resources to help all students develop the skills they need to succeed academically.
