I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. The facts are these: On a Sunday afternoon in 1995, four year-old Akash died after eating at McDonalds after church with his family. His death prompted widespread outrage and media coverage. A few months later the parents sued McDonalds for 4 billion dollars on behalf of their son (who would be 20 years old today if he were alive). In spite of having no medical evidence that this eating establishment caused the death of their child, they demanded compensation from McDonald's over what many believe to have been a tragedy involving an overcooked hamburger. The case went all the way up to the Supreme Court where the decision rested on whether or not there is liability when someone eats food prepared by another company under certain circumstances. The jury found that in order to determine if there was negligence in such cases, you must consider both "the restaurant owner's conduct and the quality of its services." It also considered two other factors relating to McDonald's practices - did they advertise themselves as being able to provide safe meals? And if so, did they actually deliver them safely? Also, because some people claim that there has never before been a similar incident occurring within the US even though millions upon millions of children sit down each day and eat fast foods purchased from restaurants owned by McDonalds - McDonalds argued that since 85 of those deaths occur outside the country and only 12 percent happen here within the US, then we can't do anything about them either! Regarding safety standards, McDonald's claimed that they had redundant systems in place to ensure proper meat preparation and cooking and could offer no proof otherwise. They further noted that they have always made efforts to minimize risk associated with food handling procedures. However, one particularly interesting point comes out of their filing statement regarding public awareness and advertising: "McDonald's does not know who inspects [its] plants," which leads me to wonder why anyone should think they knew. If anyone deserves blame it seems like it ought to be the parent (s) rather than McDonald's. But McDonald's is right back to being innocent unless proven guilty. So let us look at the facts surrounding Akash's tragic death again. According to reports, it occurred on September 26th 1995 during St Paul's Lutheran Church's Kids' Fun Day event. Some witnesses said they saw Akash sitting in a booth next to the window and others heard him cry out while lying on the floor motionless minutes afterwards. One possible scenario brought forth by experts involved a faulty ventillation system causing excess pressure inside the pan thus forcing the burger patties together tightly. Others have suggested that the stainless steel surface may have been too hot with the result being charring and oxidization of the beef proteins leading to denaturing. Health investigators examined tissue samples obtained from the body but couldn't find bacteria or toxic substances. Autopsy results revealed nothing more than mild protein degradation in parts of the intestines. As far as explaining exactly what happened to cause the boy's death goes, a consensus among expert witnesses appears to be something along the lines of most likely a combination of overheating due to three things: poor ventilation; ineffective cooling measures; and high internal temperatures resulting from high thermal gradients between external and internal air flows. This is the same thing that happens whenever microwaves cook foods. With McDonald's the situation is somewhat different because they don't use microwave ovens for heating and serving meals and they have very effective means of controlling heat transfer via well designed equipment. Still, the interior temperature of a typical McDonald's environment stays relatively constant due to strict regulations imposed on its facilities. One problem with investigating incidents involving defective products is that it boils over into a discussion about free will, responsibility and culpability. While legislation might be used to fix issues with product design and manufacturing, people just have to live with whatever shortcomings manufacturers produce. Cases of consumer rights vs manufacturer responsibilities seem to lend themselves best towards legal action. That doesn't mean McDonald's didn't try hard enough though. After receiving the complaint letter alleging negligent business practices and informing the parents that it would take steps to assure their future satisfaction, McDonald's reached out to the hospital and asked the doctors about the viability of additional testing. They offered to reimburse the cost of examining the remains if needed. Since there wasn't anything else available besides autopsy tests, the facility director met with the parents to explain procedure and answer questions. Finally, the couple agreed to allow McDonalds to send its own pathologist to perform the examination. He reported finding no signs of violence or disease corroborated by xrays and took photographs of the body prior to slicing off tissue samples for microscopic analysis. All of this behavior tended to suggest that everyone involved acted reasonably given the circumstances. Despite the lack of compelling evidence, however, the Parents filed suit against McDonald's anyway claiming that the corporation failed to exercise reasonable care in maintaining safe food service areas, failing to maintain adequate records and failing to follow through clearly expedited. Subsequent studies showed higher incidence rates again proved to keepers whose findings indicated that the fact that the failure rate began to stay focused micropetitioned
