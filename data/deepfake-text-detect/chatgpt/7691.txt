One possible counter-argument could be that claiming to be a different race than one's biological or social identity is a form of cultural appropriation and erasure of the experiences and struggles of the people who have lived those identities. By claiming to be black without actually having any of the lived experiences, challenges or social conditions that come with being black, Rachel Dolezal is trivializing and belittling the struggles of real black people. Furthermore, it can be argued that she was dishonest about her identity and lied about her race in her professional life, which can have negative consequences for her credibility and the people she claimed to represent.
