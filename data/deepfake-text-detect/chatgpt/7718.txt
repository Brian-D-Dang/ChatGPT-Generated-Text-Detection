While it is true that the recent Supreme Court ruling regarding same-sex marriage has opened up the possibility for other non-standard marriage arrangements, it does not necessarily mean that the legalization of polygamy or other such arrangements is an inevitable or even desirable outcome. It is important to recognize that the recent ruling was based on the fundamental principle of equality and the right of consenting adults to marry whom they choose, regardless of gender. However, polygamy and other non-standard arrangements are often associated with issues of coercion, exploitation, and inequality, particularly in relation to women and children. Furthermore, legalizing these arrangements is not a straightforward matter and would require significant changes to existing laws and societal norms, which may not be practical or desirable. In short, while the recent Supreme Court ruling may provide a basis for further discussions about non-standard marriage arrangements, it does not necessarily mean that their legalization is inevitable or desirable from a societal perspective.
