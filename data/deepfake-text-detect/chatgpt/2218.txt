I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically it's not likely to happen here (or in most places for me). The biggest risk is probably terrorism related; if one were placed near an international border or something like that then we'd be screwed.
