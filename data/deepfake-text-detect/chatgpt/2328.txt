I say "killer asteroid" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth. I have three rules: It must be a natural occurrence that is impossible or unlikely with present technology We will not consider nuclear war as an extinction event It has to happen this century - and soon! In fact, we are counting down from 100 years left if nothing happens now until it's gone forever at zero. The clock starts again once you've hit 0 days hours minutes. Rules 1 2 seem pretty self-explanatory; rule 3 is more complicated... Let me frame my argument here by saying something about our human psychology. Our minds cram things into neat categories based upon simple comparisons - because there was no Internet back then, people would use analogies to help understand complex ideas like calculus. If your brain can't make sense of what goes on inside the machine, just compare it to one thing outside the machine instead. That makes it easier both to think through how everything works together, and also gives us easy labels for each part so when problems arise later on they're easily identified. This worked great before computers could do anything resembling pattern matching, since after all humans were doing most of the comparison work anyway. But computing power is growing exponentially faster than our ability to explain ourselves intuitively. As long as machines keep getting smarter while staying dumb enough to need someone to tell them exactly which buttons to push next, sooner or later their sheer numbers alone could overwhelm us even without taking advantage of whatever knowledge they accomplish during those endless hours spent staring blankly ahead. And given humanity's track record using math and science towards ends counter to its own survival up till today, why should anyone bet against such eventuality? Let's get serious. Now where did I put my tinfoil hat....
