White girls very rarely date Asian men. Even in Asia white men are much more popular than Asian men. Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white women as long as they aren't sexualized as such, the Chinese don't like white chicks because Asians tend to be perceived by their peers and communities of color as misogynistic across all races alike so whites generally prefer white male dominators despite being grossly outcasts from society's perspective (an idea that's been articulated many times over). The problem with Asian males is that most Asian females will likely find the white sex harder to connect with because Asian females think it "keeps them safe" overall rather then competing against white males who want pure white female virgins. Yeah but if you're Asian you ignore what everyone else thinks about me!?!? I'm not sure why you would value having white supremacy above all others when your entire social group consists entirely of those same people...
