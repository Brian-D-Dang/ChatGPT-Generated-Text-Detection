To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific need for it. Animal rights activists may disagree, but I believe that humans have an inherent right to use animals for their own benefit as long as they do not cause undue suffering or harm. That doesn't mean that animal abuse should be condoned but rather that we can take steps to minimize suffering and ensure the humane treatment of animals while still utilizing them.
