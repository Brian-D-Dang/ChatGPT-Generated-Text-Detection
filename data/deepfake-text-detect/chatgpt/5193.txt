The host country thing has run its course. Organizing the Olympic games is financially ruinous, blatantly wasteful and the procedure favors corrupt regimes willing to put themselves on the map.

The IOC calls for a boycott if they have any influence over anything else which gives them an illusion that their example will be followed by international spectators
