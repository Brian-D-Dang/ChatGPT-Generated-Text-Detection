For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to the fact that my brother is 21 and he's going to be starting university soon as well so he wants me to take some more time away from him before we go our separate ways, but also because school life can get pretty stressful for someone with very little support from their parentsguardians and since I've never had any problems till now (I hope), then why would it suddenly become a problem? Just curious if you have ever considered yourself having Asperger's Syndrome or something similar. It could help explain your disproportionate anxiety about a few things. If not I understand completely...
