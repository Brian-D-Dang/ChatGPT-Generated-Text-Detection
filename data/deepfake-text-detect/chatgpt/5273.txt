I think the real reason people punish others for transgressions is not so much to discourage the behavior, but rather to channel humanity's inherently predatory nature in a way that's conducive toward revenge or self-loathing. Or maybe that would be what makes it better? I'm not arguing against revenge because I do believe in vengeance and I know there are plenty of other ways we can go about punishing people without hurting them (like slander). If you're going to punish people who have done something wrong then consider how much worse they could've been punished if it wasn't vengeance...
