Not trying to start a flame war, I'm looking for a new tablet and I would consider an ipad, but I just don't see the appeal just yet. What on earth is so good about it that makes other tablets obsolete? This seems like a no brainer... What the hell are you talking about? You can get all kinds of Android Tablets from Samsung or LG at very low prices. The only thing Apple has over any one else is its software ecosystem (which means more apps) and if you want OS X there's always Macs which run OSX as well. Nobody needs a Windows Tablet because they have laptops with windows. And now we're back to needing a computer anyway when running CounterStrike: Global Offensive in Fullscreen mode:D. If this thread was actually going anywhere maybe someone could explain why people need to own an iPad instead of buying a cheap android phone and using their laptopcomputer...? My take on it is limited by my experience with Apple products and what I've seen of other products on the market right now, not based solely off speculation.. So here goes!:P First let me say my iOS devices have been nothing short of amazing so far, especially since my first iphone 4 years ago. But after a few months of use for gaming purposes, while playing CSGO in fullscreen aspect ratio, the battery life wasn't enough. It felt like I had switched tabs mid-game every time before the game was even half finished. A friend recommended getting an OG Google Nexus 7 2013 due to being able to stream video games without worrying about draining your battery fast, making a decision between his recommendation and waiting for the next generation model (due out later this year), I decided to go ahead and buy him a replacement tablet rather than wait around for something better. Let's talk specs first. My iPad Air 2 didn't disappoint me either way. Specs wise it comes close to matching the nexus 7 pricingwise (249 vs 299). 6GB RAM, 128GB Internal Storage (32GB base, 64 GB expandable via MicroSD card slot), Intel Atom x5 Z3580 Processor 1.8GHz Dual Core MPC8960T GPU capable of rendering 1080p30 videos, 802.11abgn WiFi support, Bluetooth v4.0 EDR, dual band GPS, accelerometer, NFC, gyroscope compass, 3 megapixel rear camera wLED Flash VGA front facing camera. For those interested, I purchased mine through Amazon although most sites carry them, including Best Buy Target. Battery capacity isn't specified leaving it open ended, however, reviews seem to indicate average battery duration varies greatly depending on how much usage you put into things such as web browsing, emailing etc The benefits of having both computers and consoles becomes apparent when watching movies, tv shows or streaming content on Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube, Spotify (or whatever music service provider you subscribe to - which curiously doesn't include apple music), Pandora, HBO Go, NBA League Pass, MLB Game Pass, NFL Sunday Ticket, NHL Center Ice, NHL GameCenter Live, WWE Network, Microsoft Movies TV, Disney, YouTube Red, Amazon Video Prime Instant Videos, TwitchTV, Vudu, Crunchyroll, Anime Strike, Tubi TV, Showtime Anytime CBS All Access (although some of these may be available to non US consumers!). If you watch netflix then you know that there is hardly ever a point where i'm worried about whether or not the movie will continue to play smoothly because once it starts up it plays fine until completion, unlike PS3 Xbox One where during gameplay pauses are common despite adequate internet speed; sometimes i'll have to restart the app completely expecting everything to pause again halfway through. With a device like the nexus 7 however, you never worry unless the screen turns black for several seconds and suddenly refreshes itself. Another benefit to ownership are accessories, ranging from external speakers headphones with integrated wireless audio playback (for listening in private areas), 10ft long USB C Cable, car charger, lightning adapter, power bank, charging station for multiple devices and connectors, wall plug syncing cable, HDMI dongle, case for taking selfies, carrying cases, sleeves for keeping it safe, pen holder, personalized cover, memory cards, etc. There really is almost too many options available, each different from the others. Now onto the pros... Pros of owning a tablet are simple, easy portability rather than lugging around a portable console, controller peripherals along with cables, adapters, etc.... It also allows access to media streaming services directly from within the operating system rather than accessing through another service's website... Being able to surf social networks comfortably without loading a browser tab means that friends don't have to carry phones or laptops around with them; everyone stays connected from everywhere. While the convenience of quick access to media files is pretty cool as mentioned above, opening applications requires being physically near a wifi network which takes away from little work to keep DoosTa ta helpTo stay It'sThatBeoYes,TheDo behaveBeet "qu1
