Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as you can see from the image attached there is evidence that modern society has been in a constant state of decolonization since the Industrial Revolution. The scientific method did not arrive overnight and neither does culture but slow changes are inevitable even for what we believe should be an agrarian society to become industrialized. Maybe with proper education on how these things work for our youth now days most people would actually find them inspiring?
