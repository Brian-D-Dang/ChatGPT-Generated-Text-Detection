I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends . The reason is because: 1) My taste buds are not developed enough yet 2) Coffee tastes nothing like I imagined it would 3) I am a very impatient person My taste buds are not developed enough yet If you want good coffee, and appreciate its flavour, try drinking only single-origin beans from small producers in places such as Africa or underdeveloped countries where freshly roasted and hand-ground coffee is difficult to obtainget hold of at all. A lot less than 60 of consumer preference comes from judging flavours on brand names, which will always be wrong anyway.
