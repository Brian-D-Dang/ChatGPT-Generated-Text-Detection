I always have to hold my eyes to keep them rolling out of my sockets when I hear (australian) people talking about their trips to europe and canada and america. "Oh, well you know it was just great!" - You bet! The food is sooo much better in austria than here!!! Our ketchup has less sodium!! the beers taste like water but at least we get our money's worth with a liter mug instead on some little plastic things that look as if they're made from recycled glass bottles... For me there are only two countries where i would really want or even dare visit: New Zealand for its scenerynature AND switzerland because who doesn't dream once upon time off visiting Switzerland? But then again both come pretty expensive considering not everyone comes form wealthy families nor do most places offer any scholarships giving away free accomodation etc.. And besides someone else already bought all those tickets:)
