I'll try not to spoil anything here for people who haven't watched Game of Thrones, but this post is specifically about events in that show. So if you don't watch it and want a spoiler-free blog, stop reading now! But per usual, I'm going to just start off with some general thoughts on the series before diving into any specifics: Let's be honest, there are two themes running through most fantasy books (and TV shows), and they're basically "It's always darkest when you think things can get better" and "no matter how bad your life gets, no one ever dies." The same goes for Game of Thrones in every episode up until the end, we see plenty of political skullduggery on all sides, but what really matters is whether or not Jon Snow lives another day after he shatters his father's Valyrian steel sword against Jaime Lannister's spine or Stannis Baratheon loses control over Winterfell at the hands of Ramsay Bolton. Yet somehow, season five manages to go even further than previous seasons by taking these ideas literally. Every season so far has had various different contenders trying to seize power from the others; Season 3 featured many internecine struggles between houses Arryn, Stark, Frey, and Lannister, while Seasons 4 and 5 have given us Cersei versus Littlefinger, Daenerys Targaryen vs Jorah MormontStark alliance, Skinship rivalry among House Greyjoys Tywin Lannister vs Robb Stark, etc., etc. But there's something special about directionless chaos following an ancient prophecy and then suddenly someone shows up to save the world. In addition to being incredibly gripping television drama, sending our protagonists down this path also allows for more interesting character development because almost every single person in Westeros' history could potentially step forward and take charge. That means each character has room to grow. Even characters like Tyrion Lannister, which are often portrayed as villains of the piece, actually become much stronger emotionally when forced to make tough decisions. And since those choices usually play out in ways that benefit them personally, their enemies generally look worse. There was a lot of shit happening on both sides last year, but ultimately only three major players were left standing in King's Landing, and none of them looked particularly good (Daenerys aside). Season 6 will likely find its own way to resolve these storylines and bring back everyone else, but right now I feel like this new direwolf situation would probably be best served if it led directly into giving Sansa her rightful place as Queen instead of forcing her to engage in some sort of bloody standoff against... well, everybody? Maybe she should let kill White Walkers herself and leave politics alone from there... Just saying. So yeah, the idea of hundreds upon thousands of years having passed doesn't exactly mesh very well with modern sensibilities. You've got legions of armored men marching around town killing peasants en masse, entire cities are reduced to rubble, and even dragons seem capable of causing massive destruction on a regular basis. It makes me wonder why a bunch of weirdo religious fanatics are still worshipping fire demons nowadays. What happens to society when children never learn to fear monsters? We need to fix this frickin' time machine ASAP. Speaking of the latter topic... Weirdest thing yet with the wights. Part 1 - They're zombies. Part 2 - They're essentially half-wight (i.e. Volanti), except when they turn human [The mysteries of the undead continue]. This may be my favorite element in all of GoT, especially once you consider that everything we know about them comes straight from George R.R. Martin himself. With such little information on hand, there's endless potential for things to change radically halfway through the story e.g., maybe dragon riders aren't extinct anymore, or maybe there have been other similar occurrences throughout the ages where nonhuman beings adapted to walk amongst humans without turning evil. Then again, perhaps they did evolve during the centuries, but now they simply hate humanity enough to infect it with zombie disease. Who knows? Perhaps Dany ordered some voodoo curse put on the ones attacking Meereen, and it's working, but now they can't die due to magical constraints. Or perhaps they're fully sentient, evolving half-way through all on their own....
