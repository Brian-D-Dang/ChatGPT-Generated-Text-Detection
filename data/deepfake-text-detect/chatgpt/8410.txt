The state of Palestine has 4 million people residing within Isreal. The West Bank and Gaza strip together have 6,000 square kilometers of land. The North Sinai Governorate alone has 13rd the size (1120 km2). To compare: Staten Island is 3100 times larger than East Jerusalem's area at 15km by 8 - which makes for a total population that would be about 7x as large or around 400k. If we are going to use an accurate comparison then one should also include in their calculation Fatah-controlled areas into this number because there aren't any Israeli settlements on these territories with actual populations living alongside them... unless you count Tel al Hashomer? This gives it quite another meaning if Palestinians wanted peace they can easily afford giving back all those lands since Netanyahu reminded everyone he already owns most Palestinian territory anyway!
