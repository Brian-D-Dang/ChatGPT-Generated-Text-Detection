I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too amazing that any market could have one... I'm from the US and I don't think the advertising campaign really has anything like what you describe. It's just lazy marketing. And while some people may get excited by my accent it just isn't worth it IMO. To each their own!
