It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. Solar, wind energy should be the first priority of our new government to build sustainable clean power generation systems around this country not these expensive experimental vehicles which will never change anything over gasoline or diesel fuel driven machines as they continue depleting earth's finite resources for profit!
