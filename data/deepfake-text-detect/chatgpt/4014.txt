Linux is a hard to learn OS and seems daunting for the average Windows user. Many things on Windows cannot be used on Linux (Distros I have tried were Mint , Ubuntu, Slackware and others). As an alternative look at Fedora How can you know that things cannot be done if you don't try them out? Also what does Fedora do that you couldn't do with ubuntu or mint which would make it better?
