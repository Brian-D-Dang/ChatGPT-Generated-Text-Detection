First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are being wasted on this thing while the rest of us use them to live normal lives. I don't know what your point here was but I'm sure you could convince someone from ratheism if it's relevantstupid enough...
