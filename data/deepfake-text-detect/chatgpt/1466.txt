It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be rescued from the wild. But rearing an animal in a cage for our entertainment? That's idiotic and immoral. Yes they are necessary to save species of dangerous or rare traits like lions and tigers who have been in danger over many years due to poaching or habitat destruction; while other species might only need to be artificially bred if they're from places where there aren't enough left naturally.
