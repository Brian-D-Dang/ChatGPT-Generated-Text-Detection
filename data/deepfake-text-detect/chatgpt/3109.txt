To start, I'm not here to discuss wealth distribution, or income inequality. They are real issues that need to be addressed, and as much as governments like to talk about these things they don't do anything. A lot of time is spent talking about the lumbering cost of government in Canada. It's frustrating because it's all self-imposed. And there isn't a better example than what we're doing with immigration policy today. The Harper Conservatives have been trying for years now to make people from Mexico and elsewhere poorer by denying them access to Canadian jobs. The most recent attempt was last year when Conservative Minister Jason Kenney tried to limit low-skilled temporary farm workers on tomatoes and other plants to 550 per employer instead of 1,200. In his final budget before being kicked out by voters for incompetence, he offered an extra 2 million to help farmers find "proper, full-time" workers that were already working their fields at less pay. Or maybe, farmers could just leave the work undone and get paid more money! That sounded so good. So many times over the past few weeks I've heard candidates say they want immigrants who will stay long enough to learn English and add skills. What a joke - if you feel this way then why bother bringing anyone into your country? Why even try to become rich if someone else can take those opportunities away without doing any work themselves? Surely you wouldn't put up with living conditions in a foreign country where no one speaks French if you knew Quebec would end up speaking English anyway. Yet somehow Canadians believe that our country has some kind of right to keep Mexicans poor simply because our political leaders think that's what we should be doing: making sure we're keeping others down while enriching ourselves through hard labour. As far back as 2007, economists criticised the Conservatives' anti-immigrant policies, saying that everyone benefits economically when skilled foreigners come to Canada, whether they choose farming or oil production or high tech software development. But Mr. Kenney didn't care; he had decided that cheap Mexican labourers weren't suitable for his particular interests and thus he decided neither should Canada benefit from letting them work here. Not only does this hurt low-income Mexicans but also the domestic economy since companies won't hire Mexicans either for fear of expensive court battles and criminal charges. This hurts the world more than it helps us, because if Canada doesn't grow its food supply and relies heavily on imports, which we currently do, we'll probably see prices rise across several industries. Instead, Canadians should stop pandering to hyperright wing parties whose ignorance leads to xenophobia and racism against Hispanics and Asians and Africans who aren't white Europeans. We shouldn't scapegoat outsiders, especially since we live side-by-side peacefully on roads and sidewalks together every day. It reminds me too sadly of my youth in Texas during the Reagan era when the Republicans blamed everything wrong with America (and certainly nothing about Americans) after the Cold War ended on illegal aliens pouring southwards illegally via drug cartels. Partisan politics sucks sometimes.
