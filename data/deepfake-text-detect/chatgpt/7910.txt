While it's true that random encounters can be frustrating for some players and disrupt the flow of gameplay, they also serve a very important purpose. Random encounters provide a sense of danger and unpredictability, making the game world feel more alive and immersive. They also encourage players to strategize and plan ahead, as they never know when a tough battle may arise. Without random encounters, gameplay could become repetitive and stagnant, as players would simply avoid battles and breeze through the game without much challenge. In short, random encounters add depth and complexity to gameplay and are an integral part of many classic RPGs, including the Final Fantasy series.
