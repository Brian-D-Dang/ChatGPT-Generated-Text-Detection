Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number at all levels, it always sounds like they are succeeding with no problem and that more than half could be done if we just had different groups working on them harder for a shorter time period... But whenever there is any discussion regarding men's rights (feminism etc), every single one mentions how awful this group movement whatever-theyre called now,is ruining everything;..,..Oh yeah thats why its so quiet:. I think these folks would have gotten much further over their goals without being harassed as well! What do you guys make out from your perspective? Any idea who does win when both sides start fighting each other?? Are most feminist female? Maybe some tend towards male causes too but where not able play fair because couldn't say " Feminism sucks...." anyway.. long rant short: thanks!
