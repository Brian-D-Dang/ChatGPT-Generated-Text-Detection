I know this is a very controversial subject, and many people disagree with me, and I have to admit, I am not the perfect judge for this. A little background A few weeks ago, I was in the middle of a discussion about religion on a fairly heated internet forum. There was a post about "the dangers of relying on your faith in modern society." The poster in question, "Jesus," wrote that he should not be required to take part in any religious practices. He then went on to explain that he thought that he was a "religious person." This is obviously a controversial subject and I don't know what to make of it. So, I am writing this to explain why I think the Bible is true.
