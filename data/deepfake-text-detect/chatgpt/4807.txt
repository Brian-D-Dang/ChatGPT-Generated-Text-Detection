Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between the haves and have nots. A perfect society, yet this never seems to happen. In fact Socialism has failed so many times that it needs a new name, I suggest we call them Socialist Colonies where people live peacefully together for all their lives with comforts of modern day living but still under one rule which is socialism as you will see below when read my summary on why they fail. We also use renewable energy sources like solar power produced from our own sun whether you believe or not in what I am about to tell you. So lets start by talking about History shall we? History Look around you at your surroundings right now do you notice anything special? Maybe outside your window a few trees waving gently in the wind, maybe birds singing away, perhaps some houses built close together creating small village community spaces, roads leading into town centres etc.. If however you look closer you can begin to spot more detail instead of just large buildings filled with cars and shops, which just looks odd and out of place here, there's lakes looking untidy because a bit too much water was left over from flooding during heavy rainstorms and there're those old chimney stacks and industrial smokestacks scattered across these beautiful countryside villages that used to be full of industry before decades ago as demand for electricity plummeted along with sudden realization that fossil fuels were polluting the air. These days people drive their cars everywhere and fill huge shopping malls mainly designed to make money off other peoples hard work. It's been said that capitalism isn't working anymore although if history could repeat itself then it probably wouldn't even get that far as government decisions keep changing today towards a planned economy as opposed to market forces and individual choices. Capitalism became popular after World War 2 due to high oil prices coupled with US dominance economics wise, it came as a good alternative to all countries having to completely rebuild infrastructure and recover massive damage caused by the war. During the Cold War era Ronald Reagan effectively dismantled the union movement in America mostly through de-industrialization whilst simultaneously pushing his line "government doesn't work." At first most American workers didn't really mind as it provided lots of jobs, especially since the Civil Rights Act had given African Americans civil rights, making discrimination illegal. However eventually people began to complain constantly about long hours, low wages, lack of benefits (health insurance) job security, job training programs that didn't provide any useful skills and on top of all else they weren't allowed to organise unions! Inequality rose steadily, unemployment rates soared higher than ever and millions lost their homes as foreclosures mounted. Eventually public outrage forced Obama and Congress to pass Dodd Frank legislation aimed at preventing another financial crisis by forcing banks to become better supervised giving us stricter regulations, tighter lending criteria (higher down payments), deposit requirements (larger deposits required to reduce risk of bank runs etc..). Even though things haven't improved very much particularly housing prices remain unaffordable despite mortgage loans being made easy using federal largesse called quantitative easing this essentially makes cheap credit available thus allowing consumers to buy bigger car tyres...............................................a lot larger house for less money with lower interest rates than they could previously afford. Why does this sound familiar? This is how communism works, no shortage of affordable credit means more demand therefore rising inflationary pressures - nobody likes paying more money for something they did previously pay little or nothing for. But wait there's more: central planning!! No longer does a company hire only a single person to run operations but rather whole teams of experts who decide everything to manage efficiency and productivity within entire industries which results in an overall reduction of costs and overhead expenses. Central planning ensures fair wage levels as well as equal opportunities for education throughout society meaning every citizen gets to live happy life free from poverty and inequality. You might find this strange but it actually sounds pretty appealing seeing that western democracy failed miserably as soon as voting age citizens were granted the franchise. Take a look at history again, post WWII Europe was divided into four regions; East Germany, West Germany, Yugoslavia and Italy becoming Communist countries whereas Japan and South Korea thrived economically as capitalist economies. Did anyone bother asking the young European women and men whose fathers died fighting Nazi Germany, what they thought of spending years of their youth building Soviet style cities with concrete apartment blocks, factories complete with zero hour contracts and worse benefits, unemployment queues during holiday seasons like Christmas and Easterand barely enough food to survive? That's exactly how everybody feels when trying to explain Marxism to average voters without a background in biology, chemistry or physics. Although after 35 years of Communism in Russia it finally collapsed causing untold suffering and famine resulting in 50 million deaths. What happened next? Well the USSR crumbled, China followed suit, Albania broke apart and Germany fragmented once again into two different nations, both hosts.
