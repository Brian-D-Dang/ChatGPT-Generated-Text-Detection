I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand that getting A's isn't easy for everyone but no one should be able to get 90 of their grades from cheating. If it makes you feel better, this seems pretty typical. When I was in high school (8th grade) about 50-60 percent of my classmates failed some class, including myself. I already knew that though, just found out today.
