I'm not sure at what point people stopped thinking about the ramifications of their actions and became so head strong that they believed they were invincible, that officers judgements were meaningless. It's a paradox: If you're confident in yourself as being right, your judgement is meaningless because it doesn't reflect reality. And vice versa - if you don't have confidence, your judgement can be easily distorted to make things seem bad when really they are just fine.
