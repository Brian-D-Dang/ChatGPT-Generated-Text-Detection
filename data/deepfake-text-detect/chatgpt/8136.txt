As the title says, I can't find any valid reasons to not wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle. Here are a few of the many to wear one: They keep your hair in place and clean up nice after rainy days; when you crash it protects against head injuries (though helmets don't prevent all brain damage) as well helping with concussion recovery from crashes for increasing rates by 20-30; they make cycling look cool - onlookers often assume that only bike racing requires some type safety equipment like this which gives people who ride without them an instant air about being hardcore bikers or just plain weirdos; if every cyclist wore their "helmet" then we would significantly reduce our carbon footprint because no energy is wasted manufacturing these things into production These aren' t even ALL my thoughts but why else wouldn' take time out posting something so utterly stupid? You obviously have nothing better than writing nonsense comments anonymously under different names, go surfing next door instead!
