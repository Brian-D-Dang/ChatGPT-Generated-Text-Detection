If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available for humans to perform, so having a smaller population helps to ensure there is enough resources and jobs to go around. Additionally, a smaller population can decrease the strain on the environment and promote greater sustainability. However, it is important to note that population reduction should not be forced or coerced, but rather achieved through education and empowerment of individuals to make informed decisions about family planning.
