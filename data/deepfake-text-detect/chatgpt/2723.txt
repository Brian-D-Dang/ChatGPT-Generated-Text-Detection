I know this is a very controversial subject, and many people disagree with me, and I have to admit, I am not the perfect judge for this. A little background on my life: This past week was pretty dreadful in terms of hearing about several friends who are struggling or have lost their children due to cancer; and at the same time, another friend from high school just learned that her father has stage 4 lung cancer which he never smoked nor did anything unhealthy (he's only 50 years old). When I look back it seems like every year someone else close to me dies from some sort of horrible disease... which also means there must be more than one reason why so many things seem to go wrong when we get older especially women. This brings me to another point: Why does everyone always tell us how great our "childhood" was? As if everything goes downhill after 20 years? Is that what they want us to believe?? I feel like no matter where you turn, music videos, movies, tv shows etc., the main agenda seems to focus heavily on making money and keeping kids entertained while parents work long hours during the day. And yes, family vacations were important too but as an adult working full - time it is hard enough finding free weekends let alone vacationing together with your spouse and or small childlet. So we often find ourselves wondering, WHERE THE HELL DID OUR CHILDHOOD GO??? So here's to hoping our childhoods weren't totally shitposted by Kate 10: 39 AM 17 Comments 1.
