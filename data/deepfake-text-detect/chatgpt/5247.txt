First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised. Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, but if they want to say this isn't sex you can consider yourself lucky and have been put through the procedure naturally but I guess it would still be painful if it happened due to some other cause? I'm assuming so.
