To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental differences in one person's culture. You're right! It would be great if it didn't have to get so complicated since I was literally just trying to figure out how to post a link without wasting time. But my point still stands. Fuck you for being such an ass hole.
