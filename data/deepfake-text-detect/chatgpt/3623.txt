I should caveat that I'm talking about these terms as applied to humans not plants, nonhuman animals, or electronic devices. And by "socially-sanctioned," I mean a definition broadly acceptable to the majority of people within a particular culture or society. With that in mind, let's define the terms: 1. "Sex" is typically used to refer to the biological differences between males and females. These biological differences involve physical characteristics such as reproductive organs, hormonal levels, and chromosomes. While sex is commonly thought of as binary (i.e. male or female), some people are born with intersex traits which do not fit into typical male or female categories. 2. "Gender" is a social construct that refers to the roles, behaviors, and expectations associated with being male or female within a particular society or culture. Unlike sex, which is determined by biology, individuals may identify as male, female, or nonbinary, regardless of their biological sex. Gender roles can be socially-sanctioned and enforced, such as certain dress codes or expected social behaviors. These roles and expectations can vary from culture to culture and across time. 3. "Sexual orientation" refers to an individual's emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction to people of a certain gender or genders. Sexual orientation is commonly understood as a spectrum including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and asexual among others. While a person's sexual orientation is typically thought to be stable over time, it can also change or shift throughout the course of a person's life. It is important to note that these terms are complex and are still the subject of much debate and discussion within many cultures and societies.
