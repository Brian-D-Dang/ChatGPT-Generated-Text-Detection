To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, a man should be able to marry his mother in order for her to take care of him after he becomes an adult or if one parent dies protecting them from predators. That is the argument used by many gay rights groups as well. For starters, why couldn't they just get someone else to do it? If you're going to accept homosexual relationships then there's no reason to stop at your own family. You can always make up some other kind of relationship. Why must we put our personal beliefs aside and allow this into society when these "other" kinds seem so much more acceptable anyway? And how do we know what defines a "marriage?" It seems like everyone wants to say that if two people love each other enough (which means nothing) than they deserve equal rights. Personally, I think it comes down to genetics i.e., who inherits your moneypropertyetc.? Is it fair to let gays mingle their genes with those whose families pass on those diseases associated with having too few chromosomes? Would it also be right to allow anyone to mate with animals since they share similar DNA? Or maybe only females could breed with males because men don't carry children even though male-female couples produce offspring. The world will never agree 100 but I'd rather see us all come together for something greater instead of fighting over who gets to sleep with whom.
