This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is that the slippery slope argument doesn't have any force unless there is an established link between Y and X. In other words, unless there is a reason to expect that Y is related to X, the slippery slope argument is not relevant. I often get people telling me that if I accept X, then I must also accept Y, and that I have no argument against the Y thing. But the problem is that there is no established connection between X and Y. Y is just a hypothetical situation that someone dreamed up. It may or may not be relevant to X. There is no reason to believe that Y is relevant to X. And therefore the slippery slope argument fails.

The Turing Test is a test of artificial intelligence, not consciousness. So it doesn't really tell us whether there is consciousness in the computers or not. I think I'm supposed to say that it does, but it doesn't. Because of this, I think the Turing Test is a bad analogy for the zombie argument. But I think the zombie argument is a good analogy for the Turing Test. The zombie argument is a way of testing whether we can conceive of an agent that is in all respects identical to us, but is not conscious. If we can conceive of such a zombie, then we are implicitly making an inference to the best explanation, namely that consciousness is not necessary for being an agent. And so the Turing Test is a way of testing whether we can conceive of an artificial intelligence that is in all respects identical to a human being, but is not conscious. If we can conceive of such an intelligence, then we are implicitly making an inference to the best explanation, namely that consciousness is not necessary for being an agent. I think the only way to get at the issue of consciousness is to ask whether or not there is a link between consciousness and agenthood. If there is, then we will never be able to conceive of an artificial intelligence that is identical to a human being, but is not conscious. If there isn't, then we can. I'm not saying that a link between consciousness and agenthood will be proved. I'm not saying that we will never be able to conceive of an artificial intelligence that is identical to a human being, but is not conscious. I'm just saying that I don't think we can rule out the possibility that the Turing Test is a valid test of whether or not there is a link between consciousness and agenthood.

The current version of the argument is: (1) If I am conscious, then I am an agent. (2) If I am an agent, then I have a belief. (3) If I have a belief, then I am conscious. But the problem is that the premises of the argument don't establish that I am an agent. It seems plausible to me that I might be a zombie. The premises of the argument just don't establish that I am an agent. I'm not saying that this version of the zombie argument isn't any good. I just think that it's not as good as it could be. The point of the argument is to show that if I am conscious, then I am an agent. But it is also worth pointing out that if I am conscious, then I am conscious of something. I am conscious of my beliefs. And so this raises the question of whether or not I am conscious of my beliefs. I think the best way to address this question is to make an analogy with the Turing Test. The Turing Test is a test of artificial intelligence, not consciousness. So it doesn't really tell us whether there is consciousness in the computers or not. I think I'm supposed to say that it does, but it doesn't. The Turing Test is a test of whether a computer is conscious. But it is also a test of whether a computer is an agent. And so if we were to find a computer that passed the Turing Test, we would be forced to
