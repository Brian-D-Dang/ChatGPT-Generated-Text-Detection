I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a Green Card for 100 off the limit is a good deal, but at this point I'd like to talk to you about buying a car. I don't have much money to spend and I'm not a snowball salesman, so I really can't see why I would be interested in buying a car.
