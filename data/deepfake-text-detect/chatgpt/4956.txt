Most social progressives, love democracy, and so it is of relatively little surprise to me that as they have achieved a majority (in Reddit and the West), that they want government to provide clean water for everyone. Both the leaders in Denver focused on economic growth and redistribution instead of promoting progressive ideals like socialism. And let's be clear here: The most promising candidate seems not only to be supporting progressive principles - at least from a political point of view - but also offering huge free market values, even if you're not sure what those look like. The Occupy Movement has been an example of that vision by forcing employers to admit their employees into retirement programs or shut down their workplaces where workers can't afford Medicare or Social Security, even though most wage earners don't need them anyway; the revolution against the Wall Street banks went farther than any other Communist Revolution before it did because the movement was founded peacefully without anyone shouting at each other about their mistakes. The Occupy movement brought this kind of solidarity across parties rather than coming together when it came knocking at each others' doors screaming "I'm sick of capitalism!" The Occupy movement was so successful because it didn't make much noise until it pushed people toward realizing that social democratic policies are necessary for survival. That makes sense since the United States still relies upon subsidies and regulatory swaying public policy decisions over private decision making. Which means that while the Occupy movement is now solidly behind the Republicans who've had such power, it may soon lose its appeal among Americans seen as eager to pull back from the political establishment once again thanks to the coronavirus pandemic wrecking economies around the world with no real plan B elsewhere. Advertisement So why all these people do want to push for further deregulation? Because deregulation increases efficiency within businesses: It helps companies improve operations, lowers costs and allows capital markets more flexibility. It leads to fewer regulations governing everything from environmental regulation to tax cuts, so consumers aren't forced to choose between paying higher prices under the dollar cost model and finding better deals online versus buying goods cheaply just because they can buy something cheaper locally via Amazon or Walmart. And deregulation will give corporations the ability to decide how much money should go towards profits during times of uncertainty, which benefits consumers everywhere except China, Saudi Arabia and Russia whose governments often find ways every day to screw up their finances through recklessness. According to research conducted by Harvard University professor Samuel Rothman, banning gas pumps directly raises gasoline costs sixfold compared to eliminating them indirectly through taxes paid by customers. With the 21st century economy slowing down and corporations increasingly shifting away from corporate profits to shareholders' pockets, deregulation could transform American life forever. Democrats desperately want deregulation, too. President Trump promised during his election campaign that he'd eliminate rules regulating foreign investment flows if elected president, yet Republicans haven't done anything meaningful besides quietly repeal Obamacare after Democrats seized control last November. The same Congress is poised next year to reauthorize Obamacare altogether, despite years of GOP obstructionism, but Democrats insist they won't put forward amendments that would weaken protections for individuals participating in ACA enrollees. Meanwhile, many Democrats are pushing plans aimed at rolling back Obamacare's restrictions altogether unless Republicans explicitly reject them, including bills restricting insurance exchange exchanges already established nationwidelike the ones already underway in Texas and Florida. Republicans then insisted that they'll fight tooth and nail for a sweeping overhaul should Democrat Joe Biden win reelection - but if your dream is to reinvent America, you might want to wait for an alternative to Trumpian politics. Instead, Democrats aim to carve out a new image as champions of moderate voices amidst distrust for oligarchs giving access to wealthclimates outside of Washington and Republican-controlled legislatures. That's why it behooves us to focus our attention on Democrats who ignore arguments made by Republicans opposing Democratic policies, like Bernie Sanders' impeachment resolution, or even by Republicans who embrace progressive intentions. We shouldn't forget that the majority of Americans were born to Democrats and chose them for reasons beyond party affiliations. They embraced socialism based upon the ideology of a free market system rather than because they enjoy spending billions subsidizing big corporations, while Democrats believe in doing whatever it takes to protect working families from massive inequality created by unchecked market forces. In short, we owe it to ourselves to learn lessons about how to sustain unity amid unprecedented chaos wrought by coronavirus epidemics and trillions of dollars spent attempting to keep people hostage abroad.
