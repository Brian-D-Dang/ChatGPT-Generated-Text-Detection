This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in Blackest Night] and [red Hulk in Red HoodArsenal]. For me personally, it's one of those things where you may love it as an idea but not be able to tolerate its execution. The main reason being... it just doesn't look good. In fact, aside from what was shown at SDCC, I think they're trying too hard to make him "cool." It makes his costume all shiny and slick and high tech looking (which works well on Hulk) but reeks of over-engineering (even if he's supposed to be powered by green lightning). They should go back to the more simple approach on Firestorm: grayish skin, black pants, boots, coat and helmet. If anything, they could keep the red hood or maybe black cape like the Green Lantern who has a star symbol in their forehead instead of a shield shape. Perhaps use chrome paint? Then again, what do I know about comic book design? Maybe someone else can weigh in. How would YOU redesign these characters?! i agree wit u 100, i mean how come every time Marvel crossovers into DC Comics there always are 2 guys dressed in all colorfull outfits? (if we were talking about the Justice League guys) and yeah when ever i see fire storm i want her blue jeans but the rest looks fine. They're doing everything right so far, imo. It takes balls to take a character that hasn't had much crossover attention since the early 90s and revamp them without making them seem cliche'ed or cheesy (the Black Panther issue comes to mind), which they aren't. As far as Captain America goes, I'm glad they went away from the boring greytan uniform sculpting and made him look like Cap from the old days...but, still, he needs some work IMO! Love your style concept though, Kudos!! You sir are clearly smarter than me!!! Keep working man, yo!! I wouldn't give two s about the costumes either. A lot of people have said "it doesn't match" blahblah.....just because they don't fit enough, or whatever, does NOT matter. It doesn't matter, why? Because comics are visual medium first and foremost. That is, after all, the point of having pictures rather than words words HAVE meaning within the narrative context of the series itself. So as long as this looks cool AND gives us SOME insight into the characters personalities and motives, then wtf WHAT OTHER THINGS DONT MATTER?? This is Filmation style for God sakes....we dont need to talk about it!!!! And no offense towards anyone who likes it as I am sure many other fans feel the same way, but I honestly cant get past the ugly (to my eye anyway). My own personal opinion only matters when it actually helps make my enjoyment better (or worse depending on your perspective). Even if someone enjoys panels 12 3 and hates panel 4, as long as it fits the story line or theme of the universe nothing matters except the quality of drawing etc., hence why even an illiterate monkey can draw basic storylines very well, yet others might find it crap simply due to poor taste. And also yes obviously lots of great things could come out of a poorly executed story, even bad stuff can suck less and add little value to our lives...unless you work here. As for Firestorm himself....well it doesnt really bother me one bit now either. He looked pretty neat in Axis 1 lol. Yeah, but visuals CAN enhance storytelling, particularly in a medium such as comics. Take any random movie off the shelf and ask yourself if you'd walk out thinking that was a decent film. No, you probably wouldn't, despite seeing actors at least attempting physical action scenes. But if you saw that same movie on screen with live-action footage featuring actual movement done properly say, batman punching through concrete getting bruised and contrasted against cardboard cutouts from movies like Superman II, Iron Man, Dragonball Z, Thor, Star Wars, etc.? Then chances are pretty damn slim you won't hate that thing outta sight. Now imagine taking that exact scene and setting it in between pages of SpiderMan, Nova, Swamp Thing, Wonder Woman et al. Suddenly it becomes the best piece of cinematic art you'll ever experience irrespective of whether you enjoy stories based upon superheroes. You should care about the artwork on display; it enhances the whole package significantly in terms of'storytelling'. The problem isn't that we accept blandly painted images. We shouldn't - as a species we evolved under skies filled with clouds moving across vast horizons. Our brains weren't designed to ignore details. Same concerns apply to books.
