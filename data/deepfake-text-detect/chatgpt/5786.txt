Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. Let's cut the cynicism for a moment and pretend he is President. Now what? During the campaign, the Democrats had the Senate and the House and that made a big difference in terms of what he could achieve. Now it's the Republicans who have control of both houses and they're not going to suddenly stop being Republicans because Bernie is President. In order for him to get anything through Congress he'd have to get Republicans on board and that's not going to happen. So, what he can achieve will be limited. Things he could do include repealing some of Trump's executive orders, which I'm sure he would do, but that's all. And, even then, it'd be very difficult, as there would be Republican Senators who would fight him every step of the way. He's also going to have to deal with a Republican controlled Congress who are going to block everything he tries to do. I guess he could run for a second term and that would allow him to get rid of the Republicans in Congress. But by then it'd be too late. I have a feeling that a lot of Trump supporters are going to be disappointed and vote for Trump again. We have to remember that Trump got elected because a lot of people were fed up with both parties. A lot of people wanted change. But, like Trump, they didn't want to pay for it. If you look at the people who were excited about Trump's economic plan, it was basically a wish list. A lot of people who voted for Trump had been telling their families and friends that they were going to move to Canada if Obama got elected. Now, they have to admit to them that they were wrong. There's going to be a lot of people who are going to be embarrassed. I don't think a lot of Trump supporters are going to be happy. I think the middle class is going to be hit hard. I think we're going to go back to the days of Reagan when the middle class was ignored and the rich got richer. I also think a lot of Trump voters will be disappointed that he didn't build the wall. That will be another thing that will make them angry. They'll say they were lied to. A lot of them will be like, "I voted for Trump because he was a businessman and he was going to make America great. Well, he didn't make America great. He didn't even try to. I think a lot of Trump voters are going to be really disappointed. I think Bernie is going to be disappointed too. He's going to have to deal with the real world and that's not what he's going to want. I don't think he'll make a lot of progress. I don't think he'll get very far. Sanders is a perfect example of the kind of person who needs to be in charge, as he's not part of the establishment. But there's a difference between being a leader who gets things done and simply being a leader who talks about what he would do. He'll be a great leader in the Senate. But he won't get much done. And I think he's going to be in for a rude awakening. I think he'll be a lot less popular after he's in office. And I think he'll be disappointed with what he can accomplish.
