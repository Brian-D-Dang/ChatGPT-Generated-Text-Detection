Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians and all other nations, not just Japan. 3. Nuclear reactors produce carbon dioxide instead of nuclear energy generation because we already have them. They may be hurting the world economy by producing more greenhouse gases than those that would be created if it weren't for the nuclear weapons they are killing off our planet while we're fighting over there. 4. Nuclear power plants emit less earth-warming radiation along with carbon emissions compared to solar panels or wind turbines (although many India researchers believe they do). That combined is why there aren't enough plutonium reactors to go around without harming Earth's atmosphere! 5. Nuclear works against the basic notion that carbon dioxide pollution harms the ozone layer as well as humans who breathe air polluted from combustion engines whose oxygen is too weakly oxidized to cause serious problems like ozone depletion caused by burning fossil fuels. 6. Nuclear weapons destroy habitats worldwide - though there are little evidence that any single reactor has caused more harm then others. We need both. Nuclear weapons are destroying ecosystems across the globe despite having been proven safe since the beginning. We don't want them. Nor should we allow ourselves to become another Chernobyl catastrophe like Chernobyl was last week when the Western Wall burned down due to a lack of uranium enrichment. 7. Nuclear weapons depend upon the consenting populace taking responsibility so we shouldn't let them control us unchecked yet again - even if nuclear weapons waste makes us unsafe. We must take action now rather than wait until we decide what happens next year after nuclear attack. We cannot tolerate this anymore unless we demand aggressive action from the leaders of countries such as Iran before it becomes inevitable and destroy the planet altogether through nuclear destruction. 8. Nuclear weaponsowitz calls for "preventative measures" including stockpiling weapons, implementing nuclear disarmament laws and adopting international standards for protecting human lives at home country levels so no one else will use them. But he also wants all nations involved to cooperate fully which means eliminating nuclear weapons entirely. He claims that such cooperation only encourages terrorist groups intent on spreading terror attacks abroad but fails to mention that terrorism creates accidents overseas, allowing terrorists to commit attacks wherever they choose. 9. Nuclear weapons proliferation breeds distrust between countries where citizens live side by side with weapons users. Cheney insists atomic weapons "isn't real." That's nonsense. Nuclear weapons violate people's right to life; however, the world views them differently depending on how the weapons operate within their borders since most countries harness them. Our governments could stop permitting nuclear weapon manufacturers' arms sales while expanding modern weapons systems into their territories...and everyone wins. 10. Nuclear Weapons bring out the worst in humanity throughout history whereas nuclear weapons create peace amongst nations heretics who hate each other. Nuclear weapons create conflicts among nations far away from their own communities making them unable to work together toward peaceful solutions regarding their dependence on foreign threats to the human condition. 11. Nuclear weapons generate conflicts further apart globally resulting in casualties at home and increase tensions and disasters all round the globe since conflict generates needless misery for mankind everywhere. Terrorists wreak havoc internationally with impunity thanks to nuclear weapons aggression aiding them economically and contributing to global warming issues since those who reject treaties fail to uphold these commitments. The world does NOT want nuclear weapons causing war anytime soon!! 12. Nuclear weapons cause catastrophic consequences elsewhere so we should avoid putting nuclear weapons anywhere near areas controlled by hostile states. We deserve a lot better than this - especially considering that the world needs nuclear weapons MORE regularly than once every three years itself. We've heard many times about the dangers posed by nuclear weapons who wouldn't agree? We need global safeguards against accidental nuclear detonations in homes and vehicles..but destructive nuclear weapons won't help us much outside the region since people respond poorly to nuclear weapons interference. 13. Nuclear weapons endanger the entire planet including children under 12 ages and women working hard leading up to birthdays and holidays, helping create economic turmoil during disasters like hurricanes. Threatening nuclear weaponry increases rates of suicide deaths worldwide thus leaving families devastated immensely dying young fathers bereft of love. 14. Nuclear violence invades homes and destroys communities creating environmental disasters resulting in millions suffering. Nuclear weapons threaten nations worldwide while destroying lives worldwide. Nuclear weapons cost billions on an annual basis costing trillions yearly alone. We need to demand that we abolish the nuclear weapons industry and promote responsible nuclear energy production, safety and respect for human rights worldwide. 15. Nuclear weapons reduce household incomes drastically reducing domestic spending increasing unemployment severe hardships affecting millions affected directly or indirectly. Nuclear weapons still kill innocent civilian populations sustaining poverty raising concerns about global warming still today. Nuclear weapons create hundreds of thousands of jobs but burns bridges sending gas pipelines crashing onto villages bringing devastation to homes worldwide. Nuclear weapons smokers kill countless innocents giving rise to hatred towards innocent people seeking survival every day. They feed wars spread chaos promoting ISIS and other extremist groups worldwide ruining lives forever.
