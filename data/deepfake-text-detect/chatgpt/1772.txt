There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man wearing women's underpants) because other people may see you doing so. I don't think this guy has an issue with fashion though... that was just the first thing I thought of when reading his post title lol
