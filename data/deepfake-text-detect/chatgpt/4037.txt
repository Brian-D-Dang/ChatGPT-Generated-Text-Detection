I believe that "Buckle up, it's the law" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority] which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they see themselves as being part of a political party (whereas here we are talking about copyright and trademarks). It should have been "Watch Your Back; It's the Law." That way you're not just making fun of them for their stupidity but also mocking them for their fearlessness.
