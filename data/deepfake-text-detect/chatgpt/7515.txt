A possible counter-argument could be: While it's true that the law cannot and should not encompass all moral values and principles, it is wrong to dismiss its role as a moral compass. The law serves as a public expression of society's moral values and standards, reflecting what we collectively believe is just and fair. Moreover, the law can provide important guidance and direction for individuals and communities in navigating complex moral issues and dilemmas, providing a framework for resolving conflicts and promoting the common good. Therefore, while the law may not dictate our personal moral choices and beliefs, it has a crucial role to play in shaping and reflecting our society's moral outlook.
