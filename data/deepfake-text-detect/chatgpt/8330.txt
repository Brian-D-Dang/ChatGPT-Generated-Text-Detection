I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that it is a natural part. I am not trying to defend anyone who has been raped or abused; my goal here though was just wondering why there are so many such issues on the same spectrum (rapeabuse). Also wanted if you could explain how these topics relate because despite them being close they also seem like completely different things... but obviously have similarities! So what's going? Why do we always hear "It isn't okay!" whenever talking abour abuse alongside statements stating something along those lines for rapes?? Does this make sense from your perspective since both crimes can be associated together when brought up??? Thanks.. This question had me confused till now!!
