While nonfiction offers knowledge and facts about the real world, fiction can provide an escape from reality and offer a glimpse into the human experience. By reading fiction, we can develop empathy and understanding of others, explore complex emotions and relationships, and engage our imagination. Fiction can also improve our cognitive abilities, such as improving our creativity, language skills, and critical thinking. Additionally, reading fiction can provide psychological benefits, such as stress relief, improved emotional intelligence, and increased mental flexibility. Therefore, reading fiction is not a waste of time, but rather a valuable activity that can enrich our lives in many ways.
