Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of good in science. The problem with political science is that it's supposed to be empirical. The scientific method makes direct observations, and then testable predictions are made based on those observations. Political studies uses data to formulate hypotheses about society and culture. It's pretty much useless to try to follow these models back to their origins because they're so far out of date (e.g., gender roles). What you need is an approach like anthropology or sociology where we can make tests of our hypothesis by taking people who haven't studied politics at all and asking them questions designed for a specific purpose. That would give us more info than what politicians could ever get through talking to average citizens.
