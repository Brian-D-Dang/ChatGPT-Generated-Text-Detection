Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the lot is full of cars, but there isn't anyone to park. You're supposed to park where you can legally be seen by a camera on your phone. It doesn't matter if they're empty or not. People do it so that they don't have to payparking fees and get an extra ticket. But government regulations for places with more than 2 spaces means people keep getting tickets.
