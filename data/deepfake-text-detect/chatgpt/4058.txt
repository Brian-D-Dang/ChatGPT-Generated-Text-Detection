Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). So far as policymaking goes, so far as the state is concerned, my criticisms are motivated by pragmatic concerns about whether or not we're going to be able to get money from everyone. The Centre-right party doesn't have a coherent plan for how they'd do that, since they think it's an issue that isn't worth worrying about at that point but that leaves us with Atwood and company, who may well be right: "The more you look into government, the harder it gets." And yes, I know there were lots of lefty governments back before Thatcher took over; but I also knew that if I want to vote for Labour, I had to accept their policies even though I disagreed strongly with them. So while a lot of people wouldn't necessarily agree with me when I say I'm against austerity, I do understand why someone might think the same thing about spending cuts. But what does this actually mean? What do these two parties have in common? That's one question. Another is making sure that our taxes don't fall too heavily on the poor another area where Thatcher never really got round to doing much. The third is dealing with the economic crisis, which hasn't been handled very well by either the Conservatives nor Labour, although both sides are still clinging to Keynesian methods. As for environmental legislation: I suppose that is something we could call a'soft' idea because most environmentalists see its importance (I am one), so let's just assume that it has some relevance otherwise it would've been omitted from this post [3]. Oh yeah, and one other thing a big part of why I can support the Conservative Party is that they seem to be the only ones fighting for the interests of the British public rather than the handfuls of businesses and wealthy individuals that own them.
