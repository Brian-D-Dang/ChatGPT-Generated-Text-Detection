I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends can. It just seems too much bitterness and astringency, even when paired with cream or sugar. It's a really rare thing that you'll get it right first try!
