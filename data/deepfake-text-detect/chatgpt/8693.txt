So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training training every year and we don't get to keep them up all winter but just because they can't defend their homes doesn't make the fire not worth fighting for. Yeah, I had a kid who made it through one by one in his long time with us with us (my wife has been at home since she was 4) and she ended up dying from what she called a "full body" burn due to the heat alone. A little anger management would have gone a long way here...
