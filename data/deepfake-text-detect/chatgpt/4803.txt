Written hastily, but hopefully I can clarify any mistakes in comments, here we go: The Confederacy was racist according to the cornerstone speech and secession papers (tx): [Cornerstone Speech] excerpt from a speech given on Feb. 23rd, 1861 by Jefferson Davis at the Secession Convention of Texas held at Houston. quotes Former First Lady Annabelle Ewing's letter requesting that the President ask his cabinet members for their opinion as to whether or not slavery should be allowed to continue during the war if the Union Army were successful... which he did about two weeks after this speech being delivered and the Cabinet responded with a unanimous NO! It is also interesting to note that Lincoln himself had reportedly made an appointment with the man who wrote the Corner Stone Speech back in November 1860, which does lend credence to our idea that one party actually knew all along it would fail before they decided to put forth such blatantly false propaganda leading up to the election.... (politician). By 1820s - 30s slavery existed throughout most of North America, so some people must've known there'd be no way around its demise. Why then did it take 2 more decades until Abraham Lincoln sided against the South? Because while other southern states kept going through these phases where pro-slave and anti-slave rhetoric were traded out and repackaged every few years, Virginia never changed course, just like New York... They still owned slaves and decided to secede because they felt threatened by the Northern (anti slave) views of new president Washington. But you know what they say; "If history repeats itself, someone has to make history." Franklin Delano Roosevelt
