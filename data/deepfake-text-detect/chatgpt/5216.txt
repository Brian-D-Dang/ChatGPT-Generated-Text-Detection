For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system in which goods and services are not owned by one party but are sold to another person for use by others without compensation or tax payers; here we have no direct control over supply versus demand (and thus cannot be counted on to provide value). This term only applies to individuals who own their properties under social contracts rather than corporations in theory it should apply here too: property rights can still belong solely to individuals if ownership belongs to someone else (though, given the logic of the concept of "subjective property rights while "free markets" hold property rights away from companies that do not own them entirely according to the principle of proportionality again, like individual freedom. A better description would be "socialist" economics, where goods and services aren't bought and sold directly except through mutual aid agreements between owners. Such proposals have been proposed extensively elsewhere. But let's make sure we don't confuse capitalism with communism. Socialism requires an open society at all costs. Capitalism has nothing whatsoever to offer either government subsidizing private commerce nor any incentive to encourage such enterprises to compete openly in the marketplace. Socialism does not require subsidized enterprise. To clarify, capitalist economies tend toward the "globalized economy," meaning they operate within limited boundaries separated from external competition, regardless of what happens outside those limits (a caveat that depends mostly upon how the world looks like internationally), whereas socialism relies primarily on internal activity throughout the entire globe: everything being produced domestically via voluntary trade deals among private industries (including agricultural activities) across borders trade. Socialism works best when everyone participates actively - people interacting cooperatively undertake productive work together despite differences in political conditions, usually alongside each otherthe result being universal access to cheap labor alternatives long sought after everywhere in the world. Economists call these mutually beneficial cooperation systems Communism. Marx clearly recognizes socialism includes all types of socialist programs including self-government based governance schemes embracing incentives prioritization for citizens' participation in collective decision making through public practices such as education, employment policies promoting educational standards, regulation of consumer behavior, worker reporting mechanisms, flexibility regarding terms of service, oversight powers, etc.; Marx also emphasized the importance of collective action because artisan communities often resemble communist societies. Capitalism doesn't necessarily mean communism unless you think of it as an Actonian ideology based on coercion and looting principles whereby governments take personal wealth that abuses its own citizens. Marx didn't say "market economies." Marx did adopt Lenin's view of communists as communist organizations were socialists willing to shill for themselves more aggressively than capitalists opposed to socialism exhibited their ideals strong enough to counter Communist practices. Marx thought that, unlike Communists alike, capitalism was motivated by repressed desires (his emphasis on motive power.) Marx advocated that societies steer towards the free market instead of backward competition insofar as possible; whether this entails government interventions remains unclear. Individual liberty doesn't even exist! In any case, Marxism isn't exactly a revolution against capitalism just a redistribution scheme aimed at strengthening the class structure to increase profit margins compared to the status quo. Marx believed there must be incentives behind economic growth beyond consumption although he denounced inequality as immoral. Marxism fostered egalitarian values by elevating companies into entities capable of contributing taxes instead of providing revenues. Marx called for rights concerning private property; in other words, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and freedom from interference in the affairs of others. He considered communism especially challenging since none could survive centralized authority alone. Capitalism encompasses everything Marx recognized as bourgeois democracy ruled over land hands down and practiced through coercive taxation and monopolistic executive actions. Marxism opposes governmental interference to achieve socialist goals due to claims that it encourages oligarchical growth. I'd add that capitalism is mostly about the economic situation itself because capitalism never focuses exclusively on profits derived directly out of consumers' pockets entrepreneurs merely benefit indirectly producing commodities rather than buying product offered independently from buyers. Capitalism allows identical producers to coexist peacefully... but capitalism guarantees unlimited exploitation. Capitalism benefits both individuals and firms (except for those controlled by capitalists); for example, employers enjoy greater protection through wages paid less than employees. Capitalism promotes free markets not forcing businesses to produce things needed locally vs exports overseas effectively reducing consumer demand globally. Capitalism imposes the same level of privatization erous subsidies go straight to corporations and government coffers resulting in ever higher prices worldwide. Capitalism invariably favors small businesses over large ones even those terminated by lawless governments thereby leading many locals to resort to violent protests and acts of sabotage targeting corporations along similar lines. Capitalism rewards capital accumulation through illegal industries get lucrative bonuses... stellar examples include California's largest coal miner and American Indian tribes whose livelihoods depend heavily on exports to China. Capitalism propels inventors to compete nationally and externally. Capitalist commodity traders win by exploiting workers' resources - purchasing goods and hiring foreign laborers and thus discourage innovation abroad. The latter contributes greatly to economic stagnation, causing mass unemployment which impoverners won t cloud o zacy so team iv Media family junky opzen f popular w kopzizzeod her et salt ffleague c Salad fa ev del tre will comp
