Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view I hold. My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any of them. Firstly there is the fact that the coalition have already announced that the deficit will be reduced by 2015. They have promised this many times before, but so far they have failed to achieve it. They have been helped out by the improving economic climate, and the fact that the economy does not need so much stimulus. To cut the deficit, they have implemented a number of cuts and they are planning more, as well as raising taxes. Now, when the economy is as bad as it was when they came to power, austerity is simply not a viable option. I do not believe that the coalition can reduce the deficit without causing a recession, and I also believe that the deficit is much higher than is often reported. The reason for this is simple. The coalition has already spent a lot of money, and we will still be paying for these policies. For example they have already spent 6 billion on scrapping ID cards and the NHS reforms. Secondly, the coalition have promised to get rid of the structural deficit in 2015. The fact is that there is no reason to believe that this can be done. The structural deficit is the amount of money that needs to be spent, even in good times, to keep the economy going. It is basically the amount of money spent on things like public services, health, education, welfare etc. There are no plans to increase these services. If you take the government away from them, they will simply be cut back, and this will lead to unemployment and more demands on the welfare system. As I have already mentioned, the government has already spent money that it cannot afford, and it is therefore going to have to borrow even more. I cannot see any way in which the government can reduce borrowing in 2015. I hope that I am wrong, and I hope that the economy improves, but I do not believe that it will. I have not forgotten the last Labour government, and I do not believe that everything was done properly, but I do not believe that the economy would be in a worse state today had they continued in power. In the future I will write about the new government, but in the meantime I want to make it clear that the coalition has no mandate to continue with their policies, and that I do not believe that they can get the deficit down in the way they have promised.
