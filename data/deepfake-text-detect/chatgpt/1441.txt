Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable that Starfleet officers would want to be around other species (which is why Captain Picard was relieved when he learned his ship had been assigned a new captain). But being Human makes you special among them too; among everyone else on Earth! In "The Family," it dawns upon half the people watching the screens at the Vulcan Science Center that they're not alone and have friends nearby who are also human. The same thing happens with Cardassians: Humans were born in Federation space so their relationship with humans is much more intimate than others in the galaxy. That ties back into one of the themes I brought up earlier about representation: Humans aren't seen as valuable because we don't see ourselves represented enough. But Heroes From Beyond is far from just another episode where humanity gets its comeuppance for wanting to rule everything themselves or potentially making things worse by trying to run all empires together. As usual, Spock finds himself torn between what he wants Kirk to do - which isn't always easy since Kirk knows more about the situation than Spock does at any given moment - but it becomes clear quickly how important friendships are even while dealing with hostile aliens. And then Romulans show up and give us some great comedy potential. There's a strong message here about friendship across borders and cultures but this episode doesn't get bogged down in political correctness like many Star Trek episodes. Instead, I got the impression that writer Ronald D. Moore wanted to write an episode based on real world issues such as xenophobia and isolationism without getting unnecessarily preachy about these topics (I'm looking at you, Into Darkness!). There may not be any real solutions to the problems explored here, just a framework for exploring ideas. But those ideas lead to good conversations among fans.
