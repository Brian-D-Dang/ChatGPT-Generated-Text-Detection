With the advent of self-driving vehicles, the unavoidable will become clear: people are terrible drivers, and operating your own car is unacceptably reckless if a better alternative exists. I see no reason to consider the practicality of driving in an autonomous vehicle that can solve this problem without causing serious injury or death, even if it involves only two passengers. When I was first asked about my choice for Nissan's autonomous drive system in 2014 at the Ford Motor Company's conference, people said they would "love" it, but from what I can tell, most of them believed it wouldn't work well for them (and they were right). But after months of testing, a test vehicle has taken full advantage of Tesla Motors' technology, human drivers, and artificial intelligence which we call AI. Yes, the three-hour trial period for both systems runs through next month, but it's not the same as a one-time, battery-powered test, and there isn't enough evidence that it works unless you live near someone who uses it. All four of the systems run on electric motors connected to either a lithium-ion battery or USB ports. The Tesla model is equipped with a combination of all three sensors, including the ability to take selfies or video calls, and track users' habits by watching their screen along with the touchscreen. It includes the Autopilot feature, which plays music when you're busy adjusting your behavior snooze time, for example. So far, Tesla's platforms have been able to meet many of the vehicle needs we expect from a driverless vehicle, such as improved grip and maneuverability, more safety features like lane keeping, and greater autonomy everything dreamed up over decades by engineers at Toyota. But there's still a lot of work to be done before the system can fully meet our demands. According to global research firm Woodward Research, the total cost of trucking cars throughout the world is expected to hit US25 billion (A41.7 billion) by 2023, or 5 percent of the gross domestic product. The future of autonomous vehicles If a solution for autonomous vehicles becomes commercially available eventually, these systems could quickly increase our mobility coverage dramatically. For instance, mobile remote control on new high-speed trains could provide us with closer proximity than ever before. And while those technologies have some limitations, for now, they don't really offer much protection against flooding, fires, and other industrial accidents. Instead, they're proving important for the automobile industry, where they make cars safer and less likely to cause problems. As companies like Walmart now suggest, the strong demand for reliability and delivery services may ultimately lead to automakers replacing traditional car models and small businesses expanding their fleets with autonomous vehicles. In the meantime, however, this is the short-term goal, not the long term goals. Once autonomous vehicles can be tested, our need for good drivers will gradually deplete. If automakers choose to focus too heavily on self-driving trucks, trucks, vans, buses, and SUVs, then they won't know how safe and reliable they'll be until the next decade. We should expect the technology to continue growing over the years, so perhaps the company will try again and produce something similar. Wendy Williams Is Your First Hot Potato
