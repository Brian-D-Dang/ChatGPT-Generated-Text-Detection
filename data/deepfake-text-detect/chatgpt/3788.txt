I'm not a cop hater. I like to think I'm a relatively reasonable person but I'm honestly not even 100 sure how I really feel with the constant barrage of information thrown at us in today's world. In the middle of it all, we're told that one out of five people are missing and one out of six is killed by guns each year (to be fair, most of those numbers aren't accurate). Not only that - according to UPI, "the odds of being murdered or wounded by gun last year were 75 percent higher than they have been since 1990" So - what can you do? Well, my guess would be keep your cool - there will always be another day when things just don't make sense anymore (and this isn't meant as an excuse for turning into a complete asshole), but try to focus on the positive aspects of life instead of dwelling on the negatives. Keep up some sort of regular routine. Read as much fiction books magazines as possible - you'll get a good night's sleep! Try hanging out with friends after work if possible... it helps so much during times such as these. If you want to talk about something negative, call a friend; but you should probably also find someone who knows a little bit more about whatever issue you're dealing with. No matter what happens though, memories are made and experiences are passed down through generations - try to remember them fondly.
