To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental differences between men and women. Women have their own unique needs or interests as well; men don't necessarily need a man who will be unable to control themselves sexually with another woman's desires for instance. Men cannot control every aspect of their sexual life without consenting adults consenting adult relationships being in essence consensual partners but are encouraged by society depending on others' approval. Women also work together more often because they want to provide support and help each other when possible rather than enforcing sex roles exclusively according to what men prefer instead of what they desire. The two types of women are not mutually exclusive: ladies love you regardless if it means putting pressure into finding someone suitable from time to time even though these differences seem related within our culture although we feel that men should use caution at all costs whenever this occurs. What would happen then (and why?) if men were forced to choose between partners? Why do you assume that?
