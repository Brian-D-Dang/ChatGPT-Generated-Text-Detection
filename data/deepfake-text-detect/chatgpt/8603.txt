Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a war against terrorism, and by that it was mostly designed to create chaos in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. But when you look back at history itself, even the beliefs of some misguided people have the potential to cause much more than chaos or violence. And in the process we are also creating an environment where terrorist groups will be able to commit atrocities, which could lead to mass killings and widespread displacement. I think your PT claims that this was all part of the US strategy. What did your impression about what happened after the conflict? How do you feel that these events held up the US's military presence in Libya and Syria for long enough to prevent another spillover from Iraq into North Africa? Thank you!
