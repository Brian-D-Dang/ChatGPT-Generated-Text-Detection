Would you go to Enterprise and rent a car for 24 months? That's very similar to what a lease is. 1. Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, has written many books on how she spent 100K in her early 20s (before bankruptcy). She says that the only thing you need to live on next month is: 1) Rent or Mortgage Payment - This will cover your monthly bills, including utilities like phoneTV etc. You can use any amount of this money however it should be at least 30 of all other funds available to you. If its 50, then spend half of everything else and if its 10, spend ALL OF IT. You don't want too much room left over because there are so few daysmonths!

Emergency Fund 3-6 Months Salary - In case something happens where you lose your job or have some medical issues, you'll still need to pay these things off in order to survive.

And yes we were young (25 23 years old), unemployed, had no loans (in fact weren't even thinking about buying a home yet), already lived together, didn't know anybody, had never owned furniture nor made simple household decisions before we moved in together... We feel pretty confident that anyone who follows through with the same method would achieve the same success! One note though...with a 10k deposit, the housing market could potentially be hard to come across. But if you're able to find a place around the area that suits your needs, it doesn't necessarily mean the price will be high.
