For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to my inability to keep up with the rising cost of tuition and roomboard (which have both risen rapidly), but also partially as a result of personal finance; since graduating from HS two years ago i've spent most days at work so that i could pay rent and bills while attending school full time... I know what you're saying about living frugally when you are young and can't afford it because they want to live like their rich friends.... thats not me though, im more worried than ever now even after working hard for 2 years straight trying to make ends meet.. for instance this summer ill have to move into a basement apartment where if the power goes out monthly electric bill alone would exceed 1500 per month which is nearly half of my current salary! My expenses for food, gas and other utilities add another few hundred dollars each month just by themselves. On top of all those things there's still always something else going wrong or needs replacing on a daily basis. Some people may think its fun to go overboard on spending every weekend etc but personally id much rather spend that money on low intrest loans paying off student debt and saving for retirement early with freedom later!
