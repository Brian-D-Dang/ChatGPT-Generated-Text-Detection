The reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using them and as a tool in our own minds, we can get rid of the fear which prevents us from being aware of what really matters in life; not about what others will think or feel. I've seen this with my brother-in-law. He's 58 years old now, but he prays for his health every day. My mother said "be healthy," and stayed healthy. She was 67 when she passed away, and she did almost everything that she could to prevent her death.
