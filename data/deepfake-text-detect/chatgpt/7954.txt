One counter-argument to this opinion could be that victim-blaming culture does not necessarily lead to helpful information that can prevent rape. Instead, victim-blaming leads to a culture of fear and shame that can discourage victims from coming forward and seeking help. This can ultimately perpetuate the cycle of rape and sexual assault. Furthermore, anti-victim-blaming culture does not necessarily suppress helpful information about preventing rape. In fact, it can promote more open and honest conversations about consent, boundaries, and respectful relationships. This can lead to a more supportive and compassionate culture that is better equipped to prevent sexual violence. Ultimately, the goal is not to blame victims or to suppress helpful information, but rather to create a culture that prioritizes respect, safety, and support for all individuals.
