Im probably going to ramble on and such so I will make my point clear from the way I see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice or politically correct because you are clearly a jerk for your comment First of all, let me say that i love Windows 10 as well... very much in fact.. But when something goes wrong with windows 810 there seems no one who can help at Microsoft support forums.... They just ignore questions like "where do this go," etc.......... People still ask those question even after millions have used win ten.... So what's up? Why don't they answer them???... What if someone would write an article about how Linux works without answering any technical query?? Who cares right!!! Lets create some hype around linux instead!! Shameful! This forum needs more articles concerning issues faced by people using Win8 WIn Ten but since MS doesn't want anyone writing anything bad against their OS then we get these kind off replies which sure makes our life hard...... Btw am glad u mentioned safari browser..... Even though everyone knows Apple products suck big time specially compared 2 other brands (Google) but When ever somebody mentions Safari its good enough 4 us apple lovers:D Thanks again:)
