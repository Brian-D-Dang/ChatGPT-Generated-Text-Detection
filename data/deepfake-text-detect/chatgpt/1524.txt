Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than others. It's a terrible thing and we should all work together as one human race. Being proud of your ethnicity or nationality isn't bad, it just shouldn't be used for political purposes like you said.
