There are biological and statistical reasons to consider heterosexuality as the "default" or "normal" orientation. Biologically, the primary biological function of sexual reproduction is for heterosexual intercourse to occur between a male and a female. Additionally, statistically, the majority of individuals identify as heterosexual. While it is important to acknowledge and validate all sexual orientations, it is also important to recognize that heterosexuality has been traditionally viewed as the norm due to these factors.
