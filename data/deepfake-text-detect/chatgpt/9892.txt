I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too stark from a city. I think it really depends on the individual. Some people enjoy the simplicity of life in a small town or village. It can be peaceful and calming, with clean air, open spaces, and no hustle and bustle of city life. Plus, you often get to know your neighbors better in a small town, which can lead to a stronger sense of community. There are also typically more opportunities for outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, fishing, camping, etc. In short, it all comes down to personal preference and lifestyle.
