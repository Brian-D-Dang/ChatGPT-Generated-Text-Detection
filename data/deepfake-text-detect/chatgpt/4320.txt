There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man who walks up to a woman and shows her his penis? After all she's only 14 and he's 17.) Yeah... My dad is an atheist but I have yet to meet anyone that thinks women are allowed to go on their own without seeing some kind of underwear.. Maybe because I'm Canadian or something, maybe...
