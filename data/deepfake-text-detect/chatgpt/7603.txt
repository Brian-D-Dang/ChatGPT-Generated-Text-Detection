While it's understandable that some people may view intentionally having children as a selfish act, it's important to consider the perspective that having children can also be a selfless act. When individuals decide to have children, they are taking on the responsibility of raising and guiding another human being through life. This requires a significant amount of sacrifice and selflessness, as parents often put their own needs and wants aside to ensure their child's well-being. Furthermore, many individuals who choose to have children do so with the intention of contributing to society and creating a positive impact on the world through their offspring. They may hope to raise children who will go on to make meaningful contributions to their communities, or who will bring joy and happiness to those around them. In this sense, having children can be viewed as an act of selflessness, as individuals are making a conscious decision to bring new life into the world with the intention of making it a better place.
