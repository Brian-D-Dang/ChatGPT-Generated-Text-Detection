First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue that there would be no additional cost to me and my precious space in the area where I live has been ruined by someone who does not want people moving into our parking lot should they move out soon." Hence, a parking spot charge was enacted against these two vehicles after the two drivers argued over ownership rights with the driver arguing that the owners were attempting to steal from their car park by removing it illegally. The drivers complained that the owner owed them money for their parking spaces or parked vehicle and were being harassed as well as being the reason why they got arrested. According to police reports, the two drivers argued about the matter further stating that they wanted to operate illegal businesses but the two were caught fleeing from police officers afterwards which resulted in them getting away with a fine and jail time.
