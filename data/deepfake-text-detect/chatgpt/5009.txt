I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by telling someone. If you want to fuck your girlfriend please do so. If you'd like to marry her and find yourself in a city where you spend every waking moment laughing at your jokes then go ahead.
