This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in Ultimate Comics] (URL4). The argument seems to be: Which of these two images looks better? The first one has more detail and shading added into it (which tends to make things look darker), but they both still maintain their bright colors as well. It's like comparing apples and oranges here... or at least it would seem so if you didn't know any better than just looking at 2 pictures on your screen. After all, can you really judge how good an image looks by simply clicking "Next" until you get bored? Not exactly. Thankfully, we humans are able to use our eyesight, brains, experience, etc., to take a bunch of different details from each picture and come together in our best judgment as to which one is most pleasing aesthetically. We can tell when something looks too dark without being boring, or vice versa. However, there are many times where our judgement isn't completely correct, because what might look great to us may not necessarily be true objectively speaking. So why do people then say an artwork is "too detailed"? Well, much of the time they really aren't wrong; however, the reason behind them saying that goes beyond simply aesthetics. In fact, some artists intentionally draw their artworks this way! Let me show you what I mean. Here's another example. Here's the same comic panel once again, except now let's zoom in further to see the individual strokes used to color the characters' skin. When zooming out, we're not losing any sharpness. Furthermore, those small dots add interesting texture to the drawing. But since they seemed to be causing problems before, let's turn off the outlines next! This makes everything blurry and creates even more depth! Now look at how awesomely complex it looks! Yes, it does lose a bit towards the middle due to blurring effects, but overall it definitely doesn't suffer nearly as bad as before. And yet, despite its decent resolution, it also doesn't look as realistic as before either. Upon closer inspection though, you will notice some fine lines around EVERYTHING. These lines form little waves around every part of the character, giving him his own sort of 3-dimensional effect. They actually help define the shape of each area slightly, making it easier to distinguish between areas of solid shapes vs. areas of soft curves and shadows. Much like how water ripples cast light onto objects next to it on land, these tiny wavy lines cast light onto certain parts of the artwork. So basically, instead of having flat colored sections of 5 pixels tall like we saw earlier, the artist gets practice defining basic forms and adding dynamic lighting elements through brushes. This helps establish scale and distance quite easily within the scene itself. These benefits above in addition to being very forgiving visually work them perfectly to create high quality fanart such as [this piece] (URL4) recently posted by uYayyCello. This style, known as "texture," allows the artist to express themselves using simple blending tools and essentially only requires them to recreate all those nice textured patches seen throughout nature. Unfortunately though, much like real life, it comes at a price - namely that it takes longer to produce per unit amount compared to other styles. Fortunately, modern software packages allow the artist to increase speed by running multiple instances simultaneously to achieve smoother results faster. For instance, my modern PC runs 3 Photoshop windows side-by-side continuously with no noticeable loss in performance whatsoever. As a result, I could reproduce a similar texture background twice as fast as before. Though, of course, that depends greatly on your hardware resources. If you want to go crazy and run 6 simulated instances of Photoshop at once, that's totally possible and should provide a dramatic improvement over plain old single instance operation. That said, I doubt anyone reading this thread right now owns anything capable enough to handle THAT. On top of improving speed, canvas size generally doubles along with number of simultaneous instances opened for increased accuracy, so larger monitors usually provide a significant advantage over smaller ones. Another thing worth mentioning is that textures don't always need to be hand drawn. One relatively new method involves taking photographs rather than manually painting directly on Photoshop's layer mask. This means that whatever pattern the photographer wants to mimic can be captured digitally and resized automatically via photo editing programs afterwards. With this method, it becomes far simpler as the artist can keep track of the camera's shutter speed during shooting to match precise widths and heights for stitching later. Check out [my friend uKrosti's recent tutorial on this method here.] (URL4) On top of traditional methods, several third party application exist to aid in the creation process. Tiled offers immense possibilities for creating large scale seamless environments quickly, while Hexels provides pixel-perfect tileable patterns straight from a web browser. Some other useful good.. ...,!
