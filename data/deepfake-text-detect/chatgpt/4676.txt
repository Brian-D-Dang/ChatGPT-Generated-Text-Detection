First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a very specific viewpoint - which is fine if it's your first time posting (or even second) but when threads get out of hand over subjects like politics or religion in personal attacks without any real discussion happening it gets discouraging. I don't want to sound rude here so please understand my suggestions are not meant as criticism; they're more suggestions on how we could improve things going forward. My goal is to have constructive discussions about topics relevant to us all and especially those who come through our doors looking for advice or answers. And while I'm sure there will be plenty of uninformed opinions at times as well, these should be given their fair share of voice with proper arguments, counterpoints debate rather than something that would make you feel ashamed coming back some day; And yes, I know everyone says "don't feed trolls" because trolling may mean different things to different people but lets face it - just by posting one comment exposing some absurd thing someone has said, they probably won't change. But on top of that, it makes them appear ignorantself-righteous! ( ( ( (!!! They also get away with being assholes without giving much thought whatsoever. So yes, let's try to be mature and responsible whenever possible (and forgive me for falling prey to juvenile humor): Even though my main interests lie in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and physics it doesn't take long before I realize the depth of knowledge on certain areas within each respective discipline varies significantly between professors and students alike. It was hard enough finding professors willing to discuss current newsworthy issues regarding history, culture, etc., where those same professors might tend to fall into pedantic territory when discussing molecular dynamics or quantum mechanics. I felt that anyone seeking to learn anything worthwhile would quickly find themselves better served elsewhere, regardless of whether they were enrolled fulltime or part-time. Eventually, I began searching anywhere online that had free content: blogs, podcasts, youtube channels, wikipedia pages, reddit comments... The list goes on and on. Within each field, basic introduction courses existed for most majors (liberal arts classes excluded), so once again, why settle? Why waste money on a degree or certificate program if getting ahead wasn't feasible in the beginning? In 2011, scientists discovered the properties of graphene,[78] a form of carbon consisting entirely of sp hybridized C-C bonds.[9] In 2012, American scientist Andre Geim received the Nobel Prize jointly with Konstantin Novoselov "for groundbreaking experiments concerning revolutionary nanoscale materials" after previously winning Britain's 2004 Newton Prize for his work on graphite[1011] - both prizes related to graphite's use in pencil lead, albeit in vastly different ways. Graphene is a monolayer of silicon carbide formed via the expansion of graphite under high temperature and pressure conditions - a process known as exfoliation. The discovery resulted in significant interest in using graphene's unique electronic and mechanical properties, such as its ultrahigh thermal conductivity.[12] A year later, chemists reported synthesizing single atomic layers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2).[13] By 2015, MoS2 was found to exhibit semiconducting behavior.[14]
