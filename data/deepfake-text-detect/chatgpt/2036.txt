I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. If you aren't interested in someone because of their sexual choices just move along and let them be happy with who they are...don't fucking try to make everyone else conform to your standards anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a slut its misogynistic shit like this FTFY
