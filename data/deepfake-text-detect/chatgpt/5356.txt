I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our government has a monopoly on regulation or taxes). The only thing I'm concerned about these days is how much student loans are used for. I do not think we should rewrite American history books as we know them now because of government regulations that are too expensive (like regulations restricting abortion rights) but it would be extremely inappropriate if we did up front just because they're overused. We need better ways to regulate things rather than regulating everything under control.
