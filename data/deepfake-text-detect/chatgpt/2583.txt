I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that are on the same side as you. It's a bit scary to see these kinds of ad because they usually imply That if your not voting for them then you're either different from or less than him It happens here too (USA). The campaigns have been going at it pretty hard lately- mostly negative media aimed at each other.
