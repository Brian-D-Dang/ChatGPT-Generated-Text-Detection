I respectfully disagree with that opinion. Victim-blaming culture does not promote the spread of helpful information that prevents rape; instead, it shifts the responsibility from the perpetrator to the victim. Anti-victim-blaming culture, on the other hand, encourages everyone to take accountability and understand that sexual assault is solely the perpetrator's fault. Adopting such culture creates an open and safe environment where survivors feel comfortable sharing their experiences and lessons learned, allowing communities to be more aware of the rape culture and effectively prevent it. The promotion of mutual respect, empathy, and empowerment make it easier to establish a comprehensive rape prevention message with factual information, resources, and techniques for bystander intervention. Hence, eliminating victim-blaming culture provides an opportunity to cultivate a more meaningful, progressive, and effective anti-rape message.
