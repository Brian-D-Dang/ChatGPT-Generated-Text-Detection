While it's true that some people may post content on social media with the intention of it being seen by others, making the assumption that all content is meant to be viewed by anyone and everyone is a flawed one. People have the right to control who sees their content and may have privacy settings in place to limit its visibility. Just because someone has a public profile doesn't mean that they have forfeited their right to privacy. Additionally, even if a person has made their content public, it doesn't give others the right to use it against them or make assumptions about their character based on what they have posted. Therefore, it's important to remember that browsing social media without consent or respect for privacy can still be invasive and disrespectful.
