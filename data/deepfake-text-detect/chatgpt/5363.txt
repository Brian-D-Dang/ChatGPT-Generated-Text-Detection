So, I saw a commercial today about a pill that helps with BED, and I did a bit of quick research on it. From what little research I did, it seems like it's very strong stuff for people who have BED symptoms. But I'm not sure if there are any studies showing it has an impact on Beds malnutrition (i think it might be true). That's cool! Did you see that commercial? It looks great! You're definitely going to want to check out the website.
