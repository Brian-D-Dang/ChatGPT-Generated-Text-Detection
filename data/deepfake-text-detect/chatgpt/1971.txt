Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do much for me either... But here is where things start getting interesting: Looking at some of those other threads it appears that there were lots more members who posted similar stuff but their comments never seem to make it into these "top" lists? How does one get on that list if you can post something awesomeinformative or whatever without being considered part of an established group with which your opinion should align? What would cause someone not already listed whose comment was just as good (if not better) than what's currently up top to have his message buried under all those others yet still be allowed to participate? Is it about immediacy? If so then why are we allowing guys like rkposteo repeatedly posting nothing more than spamming links to their own sites while claiming it somehow helps foster discussion when he could easily wait until later and actually add value to discussions by making actual posts instead of constantly filling every thread with silly unhelpful crap no matter how many times people tell him to stop doing such useless nonsense before banning him from participating completely since nobody wants to see any more of his garbage ever again anyway?! Why aren't mods enforcing simple common sense rules rather than leaving everything vague enough to allow anything to happen anywhere anytime regardless of whether such behavior makes any sort of positive difference whatsoever?? Or maybe its just because most moderators don't even know any real basketball fans personally let alone play fantasy hoops themselves...
