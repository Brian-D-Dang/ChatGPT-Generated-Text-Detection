Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking spoilers ahead. There is no end, but Mark Watney spoils the entire plot of the book The Martian, which also leads to the Mara film version of The Martian. It does not spoil anything. Massive Spoilers ahead. I just finished the book version of The Martian, and read book version of The Martian (both movie and book versions), which leaves the ending of the film The Martian.
