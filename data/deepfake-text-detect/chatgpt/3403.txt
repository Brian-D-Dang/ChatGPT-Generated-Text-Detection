So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want to know what someone stands for, it's important to look at their policies, track record, and statements outside of a debate format. Additionally, debates often prioritize style over substance and can devolve into petty arguments or sound bite battles rather than a substantive discussion of important issues. The column you linked is definitely an interesting take on this issue. The author argues that we should have candidates switch places and argue for their opponent's positions. This could be a way to see how well candidates understand and can articulate their opponent's ideas, and it may also encourage more empathy and understanding across party lines. Ultimately, the best way to assess a candidate's positions and qualifications is to do your research and seek out reliable sources of information. Debates can still be valuable for getting a sense of a candidate's communication style and ability to think on their feet, but they should not be relied upon as the sole source of information.
