First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however: We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is not to be taken seriously and sometimes, a joke is just a joke. Let me also clarify by saying that when I say I support free speech, I'm talking about as much as possible. Like, I believe the government should keep its nose out of our business and people should be able to say what they want, as long as it doesn't hurt others (and even then, I'd personally defend their right to say it). However, I think we've reached a point where our society's understanding of what is and is not acceptable for discussion has become all-encompassing, and while I support your right to say what you think, I don't think you should be allowed to say anything. This is why I support The Moot's new Policy on Bullying and Harassment, and why I think anyone who doesn't think that it's a good idea to protect people from being harassed, should just go ahead and leave the site. It's the same thing with our new policy on Humour and Political Correctness, which should really be called "Making Fun of People," because that's what it's about: making fun of people. We can all have a laugh at the expense of those we don't like, and at the expense of those we do like (I'm looking at you, jokes about my Canadian accent). But the fact that these are policies is indicative of the fact that some people are not okay with being made fun of. Maybe they don't have the thick skin that many of us do, and maybe they just don't know what is and isn't acceptable in a society where a single comment from a Twitter troll can ruin someone's day. It may seem like a small thing, but you know what? It's not. People are made fun of, and belittled and sometimes even threatened, by others every single day. And when you're made fun of by people who are anonymous, it's even worse, because you can't respond to them. People are bullied and harassed and their lives are made hell on a regular basis, because they are perceived to be different in some way. And sometimes, that difference is something that should be celebrated, like being gay, or being trans, or being non-binary, but often times, it's not. And you know what? It's awful. This is why people get depressed and commit suicide, because their lives are so bad. This is why people are afraid to come out as gay, because they fear being bullied, and sometimes, even being killed. This is why people get into fights, why people are beaten up, why people get shot. It's a problem, and we need to do something about it. If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say it, because it hurts people. If you don't like being a homosexual, or a trans person, or a non-binary person, or a Muslim, or a feminist, or a person of a different race, or a person of a different religion, or a person with a disability, or a person who's not a man or a woman, or anyone who is different in any way, then don't be. It's not a crime, and it's not something you have to be ashamed of. But if you are, and if you are made fun of or harassed for it, don't think for a second that it's not a big deal. I'm all for freedom of speech, but I'm even more for free, safe speech. There is no reason for you to threaten someone with physical violence, or to make fun of them, or to harass them, or to do any of the things that you see people doing all the time, and even more so on the Internet. I know you're a big boygirl, and you can handle yourself, but that's not the point. The point is that you shouldn't have to. There are people who can't handle themselves, and they need to be protected. And if you think the policies are too strict, or that they're infringing on your free speech, then maybe you should think about what you're doing. Because if you really think that what you're doing is harmless, then you're wrong. So, what do you think about The Moot's new policies?
