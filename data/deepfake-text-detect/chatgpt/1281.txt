I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is one, then that's all well and good as long as you don't bring in your own beliefs into the discussion (which yes people do often times). But what if we are wrong? What happens then? Do our children suffer for eternity because they were born without God? That's an interesting point!
