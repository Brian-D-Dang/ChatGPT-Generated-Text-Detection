I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter. My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy to make a change. I'm afraid though that some people might find it hard to trust themselves. They may not know how free voting works in my experience. I had no control over them and just felt like I was in no position to even want to participate in a vote. They are more interested in looking at your action history than actually doing anything about it. Most of them seem to think voting is for the money.
