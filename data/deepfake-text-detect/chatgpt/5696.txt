Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of vaccinating my two children and seeing the potential damage of anti-vaxxing I am appalled at the lack of education that is going on. I was actually one of the fortunate ones in that I was never hurt by the measles. I do however know numerous people who have been hurt by the measles and other diseases. A few of them have not survived. It's a shame that people are so worried about the small risks of vaccines when they are much more likely to be harmed by the diseases themselves. You might be interested in this: I'm not sure why the "medical profession" is not taking this more seriously. This is a public health issue that is impacting everyone. There are reports of children dying in the UK from measles, which is pretty frightening considering the UK has a great health care system. There is also a huge push from the anti-vaccine community to get the vaccine schedule reduced and vaccines themselves removed from the market. I don't think anyone can be expected to "follow the science" with a lot of these issues because the information is so complex and so many people, groups and entities are involved in making decisions about the research. I'm in the same boat as you. I'm in the medical field and I've also never been sick with the measles or any other disease where a vaccine exists. I think that has something to do with the fact that I've been vaccinated and it's easier to keep your kids vaccinated. I would be interested to know if the anti-vaccine movement is linked to an increase in disease. Does anyone know? Here are some facts that I've found to be interesting: If you have any good information regarding the link between disease and the anti-vaccine movement, I'd be interested in hearing it. Just so you know, my two kids have been vaccinated.
