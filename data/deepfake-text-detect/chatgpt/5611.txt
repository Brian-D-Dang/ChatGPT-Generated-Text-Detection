I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is one of the better animes I have seen. And since I love this anime so much I decided to make a blog about it, as a way to keep track of my progress through the story, and a chance to share my thoughts and analysis with others. I've created a discord server for SAO, so if you're interested in discussing the show, be it opinions, theories, comparisons, or general conversation about the show, you're more than welcome to join. My discord link can be found below.
