One counter-argument could be that while modern feminism and its activists may not always be perfect or consistent, that is not necessarily a flaw unique to feminism. No social justice movement or ideology is free from criticism, but that does not mean it should be dismissed entirely. Additionally, feminism has achieved significant progress towards gender equality, including legal rights, workplace opportunities, and social acceptance, that should not be discounted. Lastly, criticising feminism for not being perfect does not address the very real issues and inequalities that women face and perpetuates a false dichotomy that feminists must be either perfect or irrelevant.
