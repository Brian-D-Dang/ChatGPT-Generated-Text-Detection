It is wrong to generalize and stereotype a whole group of people based on their race. Attractiveness is subjective and should not be narrowed down to one race or gender. Furthermore, the idea that Asian men should not pursue white women is discriminatory and perpetuates harmful prejudices. Everyone has the right to pursue love and happiness regardless of their race. This type of mentality promotes division and hate, which our society should strive to eliminate.
