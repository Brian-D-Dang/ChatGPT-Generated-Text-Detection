I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg. Trigger Warning - Graphic description of self-harm ahead). The other aspect that the OP referenced was the use of triggering elements in a story, and that is a different thing altogether, as it is entirely dependent on what triggers the reader in question (for example, a triggering story to one person could be a huge relief to another), and is not really a question of decency. I don't really see what the problem is, unless you're referring to the latter (in which case, see above). Some of these stories are quite well known, though, so it's not as if they're being hidden. Bah, forgot to finish that. A trigger warning is exactly that, a warning. The context in which it is used is as a warning. It is not a content warning, it is a warning of content that is likely to trigger. The context in which the warning is used is to warn people of content that might trigger them. There's a difference between a trigger warning and a content warning. The former is used to warn people of content that might trigger them, while the latter is used to warn people of content in general. If you put trigger warnings in the title, you have to label the content, otherwise the title itself might trigger people. If you put a warning in the title, you have to label the content, otherwise the title itself might trigger people. Besides, if you put trigger warnings in the title, there's no way to know what the actual content of the story is, as the title itself could trigger. If you put a warning in the title, you have to label the content, otherwise the title itself might trigger people. I don't know why you think the word 'trigger' is so important to me, though. I was addressing the OP's point about how trigger warnings are not 'Content Warnings'. It's important to me as I use the term as a warning of potential content that may trigger people, and it's important to me as I've seen how trigger warnings are used, and how they are used by people who are actually aware of the meaning of the term, as opposed to the people who are using them as a catch-all for content warnings (as it is a term which refers to triggering content specifically, and is not used to refer to content generally). I'm not saying that trigger warnings are a catch-all for content warnings, but they are a warning of potential triggering content. Therefore, I don't see why they have to be used in the title. Why do you think they have to be used in the title? Because if a person gets triggered by the title, they're not going to read the story anyway. Saying 'Contains Trigger Warning' in the title is a bit of a warning to those who may be triggered. I've seen people say 'Contains Trigger Warning' in the title, and then in the summary, they go on to describe content which is likely to trigger people. And people get triggered. I don't know why you have a problem with the term 'trigger' in the title. I think that 'trigger' in the title is a warning to people of content which is likely to trigger them. It is not a warning of content which is likely to trigger people. Because if a person gets triggered by the title, they're not going to read the story anyway. Saying 'Contains Trigger Warning' in the title is a bit of a warning to those who may be triggered. I think that's a bit of a stretch. I'm not saying that 'trigger' has to be in the title, but the title itself is not likely to trigger anyone. If a person gets triggered by the title, they're not going to read the story anyway. Saying 'Contains Trigger Warning' in the title is a bit of a warning to those who may be triggered. But a person who is triggered by the title is unlikely to read the story anyway. I don't think that people are triggered by a title. I think that a person who is triggered by the title is unlikely to read the story anyway. I think it is. That's what I think about it. I think it is. That's what I think about it. But a person who is triggered by the title is unlikely to read the story anyway. I think it is. That's what I think about it. I think you're wrong. It'
