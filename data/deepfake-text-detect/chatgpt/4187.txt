Firstly, I'm using a throwaway because most people get really sensitive about this and my views are pretty much the antithesis of reddit (love Rand Paul, support Mens Rights, hate feminists). Secondly it was Cuckerberg who called for Facebook to be regulated by our government and he actually brought up a good point: The average American has no idea what privacy means. I think you've got some things mixed up here. Just saying...
