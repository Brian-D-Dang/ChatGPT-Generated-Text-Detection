Counter-argument: While it may be true that the pledge of allegiance and other national identity rituals may sometimes seem outdated or unnecessary, they actually serve an important purpose. These rituals help to instill a sense of patriotism and unity among citizens, which can be especially important in times of crisis or hardship. Additionally, these traditions serve as a reminder of the values and principles that our country was founded on, such as justice, liberty, and equality. They provide a common thread that brings diverse groups of people together and can be a source of pride for many individuals. So, rather than holding society back, these rituals help to strengthen our bonds as a nation and provide a sense of continuity and stability in an ever-changing world.
