Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the best locations will be full and mostly not by people with disabilities, but instead by able-bodied folks. Why? Maybe because they aren't close to store or restaurant where it matters a lot whether you get there 5 minutes early after work
