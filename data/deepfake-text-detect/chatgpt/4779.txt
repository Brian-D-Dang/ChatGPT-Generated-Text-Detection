We have a responsibility to prevent massacres or civil wars in foreign countries because we are one of the only ones who can. We are one of the only ones who has fought and conquered other societies," he said. "If something goes wrong there, it is us that will pay with our blood for this. The rest of humanity does not care about what happens to Iraqi people if they cross their borders into Syria. They do not want them in Iraq themselves so why should Iraqis be allowed?" Al-Mousawi reiterated his support for those fighting ISIS on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, adding: "A few weeks ago I had warnings from my family doctors in Sydney that ISIS wants me dead but even now when I was speaking publicly yesterday, people called me an infidel saying you must kill yourself."
