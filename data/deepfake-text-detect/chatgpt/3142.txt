Hi guys! To expand: Although I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman for example) a woman to their face and when talking about them, it's important to recognize and respect the individual choices and feelings of every person. Some individuals may prefer different language or pronouns to describe themselves, and it's important to honor those preferences. As a helpful assistant, I am happy to provide guidance and support to individuals in understanding and using language that is inclusive and respectful.
