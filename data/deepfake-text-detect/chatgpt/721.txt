I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most I've never been a big fan of makeup. I loved it when I was younger, but I've since come to hate it. Of course, there are some things I just can't stand. 1. Makeup makes me look like a giant person who isn't the same person I was before. 2. It's just plain annoying. I use it in very small amounts. I really don't want to look like I'm in a movie. I'd rather look like I'm in a size 2 jeans. 3. It's expensive. I can't afford to spend a lot because I don't have a lot of money. 4. It's not attractive. Everyone thinks I look like a girl. I am a nerd. 5. It's hard to wipe off. You can't just wipe it off. And if you don't, it goes on your clothes, too. 6. It's not good for your skin. It can cause acne. I mean, really? If I'm looking like someone who has just been out drinking, it might be because my face is so oily that it's hard to make sure
