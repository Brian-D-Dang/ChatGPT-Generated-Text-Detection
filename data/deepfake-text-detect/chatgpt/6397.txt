First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" I know it's not the same as "feminism" but it is not the same. I know that is the same thing as "equality" and "feminism" and that is the same thing as "feminism" and "feminism" and that is the same thing as "feminism."
