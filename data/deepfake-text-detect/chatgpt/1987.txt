A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but nothing that made me want two thousand dollars' worth. That's what we're looking at here: Two grand in cash just for the pyrotechnics themselves before you add up any sort of back-end deal with local law enforcement or other services like medical personnel who will have to be brought out if there are injuries (which cannot be ruled out). This is not something where it would make sense to spend ten bucks per person; this is an expense best reserved for those willing to take their children to sensory overload hellscape firework shows - and hey! That sounds fun too!
