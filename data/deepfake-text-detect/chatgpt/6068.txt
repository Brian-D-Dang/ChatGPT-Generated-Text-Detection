Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between the rich and the poor. However, in the real world, the concept of socialism has never been truly implemented, which is why there are so many socialist nations that have failed. The idea of socialism is to remove the gaps between the rich and the poor, giving everyone the same living standards and working conditions, so no one is put at an advantage over the other. The only way to achieve this in a society that has a high amount of inequality is to implement laws that limit the amount of wealth a person or a family can accumulate, this is known as redistribution of wealth. Redistribution of wealth is also known as wealth tax, which is also known as progressive tax. In most societies this tax is imposed on the richest 10 of the population, which is the case in most of the developed world. This tax is inevitably a negative thing in any country, as it reduces the amount of wealth in that society and makes it harder for people to accumulate wealth. In other words, it stops people from creating wealth and progressing themselves. The more inequality there is in the society, the more the wealth will be accumulated in a few individuals. When the majority of the population is poor, the rich will be seen as evil for having so much money and the people will demand a tax that takes the wealth from the rich and gives it to the poor. In a society with a lot of inequality, the poor will not feel the need to work, as they know there is an endless supply of money for them if they do nothing. A socialist state will therefore create a large amount of unproductive people, who will consume more than they produce and be a drain on society. There is also a strong argument that the people who work hardest are the ones that should benefit the most from the society they live in, not those who do nothing and only have money to thank for it. This is why socialism is a negative thing for society. The concept of socialism is just that, it is a theory and has never been proven to work in any society, because it is impossible to create a truly equal society. The wealthiest people will always want to accumulate more wealth, whether it be by building a business and employing more people, or by spending money to gain more money. The only way to implement socialism in a society that has a large gap between the rich and the poor, is to reduce the amount of wealth the rich have. This is where the concept of wealth tax comes in and is a negative thing in any society, as it takes away from the economy.
