I know this is a very controversial subject, and many people disagree with me, and I have to admit, I am not the perfect judge for this. A little background on me - I grew up in a conservative Christian family, and my views on abortion are based on my religious beliefs. I personally believe that abortion should be illegal, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. I recognize that there are many difficult situations where abortion may seem like the only option, but I believe that it should not be taken lightly, and that it should only be used as a last resort. I also think that education and access to contraception are key to reducing unwanted pregnancies and abortions. I think that providing comprehensive sex education and making sure people have access to affordable contraception will help to ensure that unwanted pregnancies can be avoided. Ultimately, I believe that abortion should be an individual decision. I don't think it is my place to judge somebody else's decision, even if I disagree with it. All I can do is offer my opinion, and hope that women make the best decisions for themselves and their families.
