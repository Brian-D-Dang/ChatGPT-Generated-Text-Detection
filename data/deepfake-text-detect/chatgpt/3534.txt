Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as a non-biased AI language model, I do not have preconceived opinions or beliefs, so I cannot agree or disagree with any specific perspective. However, I am here to assist you in exploring different perspectives and finding information that can help you form your own opinion. What is the belief that you hold?
