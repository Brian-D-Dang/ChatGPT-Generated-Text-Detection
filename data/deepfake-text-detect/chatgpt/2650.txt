This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation I have come to. The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) doesn't offer any answer for what I also see in the New Testament - that Jesus was born without sin and died on the cross because he believed it would bring him closer to Godotherwise if you interpret correctly. It also came out from my reading that this idea of Christ being all powerful (and knowing about everything before hand and thus choosing to die etc.) may be one reason why non-Christians don't like Christians very much; they believe that Christians are saying "You can do anything!" when we say things along those lines: You can become rich, get into Heaven, live forever after death by just believing in us... And then getting angry with them if these goals aren't achieved. Meanwhile, many people think that their life has been quite mediocre but good enough anyway so there's no need to really try at doing better than others etc. But again this isn't necessarily said explicitly. It gets confusing though. So does Christianity claim that all other gods are wrong? Because some religions seem to. Or does it only make sense if another god exists who created both himself AND Jesus and therefore is more knowledgeable about how humans will behave than whatever made up our own brains? Is it right to judge the wisdom of something based solely upon how long ago it first appeared and whether it had visible followers in its early days? How did cultures establish which theories were true? Why didn't Jesus simply show everyone that his power was real instead of having to sacrifice himself? What makes us different from animals? Are some races more intelligent than others? Does anyone know? Couldn't God create NEW species of animal that never existed before JUST FOR HIMSELF? Did any of your commentaries ever mention such questions? I feel like I'm missing important points here. If you watch TV shows like American Idol, where contestants compete against each other to win money etc., kind of similar ideas arise within Christianity. Judgmental self-centeredness seems illogical especially considering that Bible believers are supposed to love every human equally regardless of race, gender, sexuality etc. Since men shouldn't marry women who aren't virgins either, couldn't God change this practice too since adultery is considered evil? Should abortion even exist? Would it help matters if people weren't allowed to procreate until 25 years old? Sorry for posting so many questions here, maybe none of them deserve answers:P. EDIT: Thank you very much for replying.
