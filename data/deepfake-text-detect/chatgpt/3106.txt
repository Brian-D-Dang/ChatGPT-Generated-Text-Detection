WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in terms of writing ability have been doing it since before they even had a blog and can write 5-6 posts within a day while others take weeks or months (or longer) with their content. The first person who comes to mind is one of my favorite musicians, Bonobo. His music sounds so meditative but he never skips an opportunity to engage his audience and share more about himself on social media than just playing guitar. He's great at creating relatable characters as well which makes him an even better story teller; I mean if we could all follow our dreams like this guy right? If you're not familiar with his work I highly recommend checking out The North Borders to start off your journey into world building. You will find yourself coming back over and again because there are always new things being found out! From time to time I see updates where he reveals more information about what exactly went down during certain events (e.g. how did the race start? What was the state of play when it started?) This kind of transparency really engages me further with the story and helps me feel connected to the main character, Ramin Nassirpour. No matter how many times I listen to this album, I love listening to "Waves of Fear Coming Through Me." It feels fresh each time but some other songs get tired after repeated listens, especially ones like "Black Sands" which has such a limited range vocally. That said, overall I think he's done a fantastic job with everything he put together. Here are some videos featuring various tracks throughout the entire album along with another bonus track that features my favorite artist ever, Regina Spektor. Another example would be the gaming channel the Yogscast. They have numerous series scattered across different games and genres typically based around comedycommentary. Their most popular series by far is Jaffa Factory where Simon Lewis build factories using redstone circuits for whatever purpose they choose while Duncan provides commentary via the Yogpod podcast network. My personal favorites were always their RPG series Magicka, Minecraft Dungeons, and Terraria. To keep these games going though, they need consistent new material every week so naturally they release a bunch of videos a day! However they know very clearly that there needs to be a break between episodes otherwise it gets overwhelming having 6 video releases all at once. Thus they have two 2 hour long episodes published daily leading up to something big happening at the end of the week. For instance let's say today is Monday. We've got 4 hours worth of content scheduled until Wednesday. Let's say Tuesday ends up releasing 8 videos instead of 1 due to unforeseen circumstances. Now you might think twice about watching those since there is SO MUCH STUFF ON YOUR TABLESTABES!! Well thankfully there is a thing called 'timestamps' which removes clutter from YouTube and allows us to pick and choose what videos to watch without worrying that we missed any important info. These timestamped links appear below each video title and allow anyone to skip ahead to the parts they want to hear. Now imagine running a large corporation like Microsoft but instead of selling software you sell hardware: PCs. Your company does extremely well considering there isn't any real competition. Then suddenly someone creates SteamOS: a PC operating system that promotes both indie games and AAA titles over Windows. Not only that, but Valve Software offers Steam Machines, prebuilt systems meant specifically for gamers to buy. Because of this, sales have dropped drastically. Obviously there's no way you're going to lose market dominance overnight either, although that doesn't stop angry shareholders from pressuring the board members to do something. Unfortunately, you don't fully understand why they've made this decision so you give them 3 options: 1. Continue business as usual and slowly decline due to lack of innovation, resulting in billions of dollars lost per year. You'll likely go bankrupt eventually anyway; corporate corruption sucks and corporations tend to turn evil quite often. Without proper oversight they may try to become bigger than life itself. 2. Outright kill SteamOS outright and dump a ton of money into competing consoles like the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Probably won't happen because consoles haven't changed anything other than adding a few bells and whistles and everyone knows what that means: exclusives. Competition should breed innovation and thus increasing revenue streams for consumers. Oh wait.. 3. Stop making PCs altogether and focus solely on consoles. This seems reasonable in theory however nobody wants to actually own multiple machines anymore. As soon as manufacturers realize this, all three major firms switch course instantly. For now, you make the wisest choice possible, especially considering half of your workforce used to run Linux anyway. Yes, despite this being "big bad" firm number 3, you recognize the value in...
