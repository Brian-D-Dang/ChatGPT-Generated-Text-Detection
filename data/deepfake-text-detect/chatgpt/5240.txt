There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: spelling mistake made me think the movie was Jurassic World. My kid can't wait to see it again when he comes home tomorrow! Really? Could have sworn Jurassic World wasn't made in 1968...
