In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals . However, in some countries like Australia it is more common for a puppy or kitten to be euthanized if they have no food at all or a lack of nutrition in place. I will also point out that there's an Australian law prohibiting animal cruelty which states "You shall not harm any human creature whatsoever." So the thing is obviously what cruelty does to animals is illegal (and most of us should) but they don't get away with it. Why then? Because it doesn't help them. It feeds off their fears and misinformation on social media. Now we know why. We know how insidious this can be. The reason people discourage this kind of stuff is because it's so convenient when it comes to the public. They fear that someone might try to blame the abuser who broke into their home without permission from himherself or her. Also, people think that dogs are a dangerous breed, that treats are harmless. No, I'm not talking about that one incident where a dog was spied on, snipped, or beat up while on a leash by a German Shepherd. That one case is particularly upsetting, because the dogs were fostered by a friend and had come to terms with the cruelty and punishment that took place in front of them. And, I don't want to mention the fact that the dogs spent almost three weeks in captivity. In my opinion, the abuse is still horrific. So what do you say when you read Charlie Chaplin when he says 'the lies that love must first live and die' and looks around in your window and sees George Bernard Shaw smiling and being cheerful and happy? Do you believe his words or do you believe in his actions? Well just remember this: the lie that loves always lives and dies and that's okay!
