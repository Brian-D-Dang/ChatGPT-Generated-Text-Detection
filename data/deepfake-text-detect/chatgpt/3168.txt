One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this a valid argument? It is partially valid in the sense that an increase in the number of people with college degrees can lead to an overall decrease in the value of a college degree in terms of its rarity and exclusivity. However, this argument overlooks the fact that the value of a college degree is not solely determined by its scarcity, but also by the skills and knowledge that it imparts, which are increasingly valuable in today's economy. Moreover, providing free college tuition can increase access to education for disadvantaged populations and therefore increase social mobility, which is also an important measure of the value of a college degree.
