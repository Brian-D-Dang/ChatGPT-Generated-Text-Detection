For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system where state power is exercised in order to control all economic activity and redistribute wealth by force (and other methods). Capitalism is like socialism but better because it provides most people access to goods without coercive intervention by governments which are inefficient at best and corrupting at worst. I agree that capitalism can provide fairly equitable allocation of resources. But socialism has the potential for more suffering than what we have now due to its centralized government powers regulating EVERYTHING from wages to corporations to how much our airwaves should be monopolized.
