I disagree. Ignoring the existence of race and racism does not make these problems go away. In fact, it contributes to their persistence because it allows for discrimination to continue unnoticed and unchallenged. By acknowledging and discussing issues of race and racism, we can better understand the ways in which these issues affect different communities and work towards creating solutions. Additionally, racial preference programs are designed to address existing inequalities in areas such as education and employment. Without these programs, marginalized communities would continue to face significant barriers to success that are rooted in systemic discrimination. Thus, talking about and supporting such programs can actually help to level the playing field and promote greater equity. Finally, the idea of "not seeing color" ignores the reality and experiences of people of color. Acknowledging and respecting differences in race and culture is an important step towards building understanding and empathy, and ultimately creating a more inclusive society.
