I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately turning around and making fun of or criticizing someone else for their appearance or lifestyle choices. It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and kindness, regardless of whether or not we agree with their choices or beliefs. We should strive to be consistent in our actions and treat others as we would like to be treated ourselves.
