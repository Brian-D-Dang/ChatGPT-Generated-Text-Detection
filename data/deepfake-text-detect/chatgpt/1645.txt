EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People have them because of their own feelings and our culture somehow thinks it's okay if we show cartoons or movies about these triggers as long as they're clearly labeled as such!
