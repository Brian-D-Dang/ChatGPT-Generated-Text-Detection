I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. There were many cases where groups such as the Japanese or Germans could have won if only they had not been so greedy for resources during wartime, but it is difficult to begrudge them victories when their actions helped secure victory forever more than once over us!
