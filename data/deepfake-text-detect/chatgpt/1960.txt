I think English should not be the international language for these reasons: It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words here uBrotherChe makes a really good point. Many people are using incorrect pronunciations of Americanisms, and this could lead to misunderstandings on levels far beyond an odd word or two being mispronounced in everyday conversations (which we've all done). Not only do I believe there will come a day when Americans will get tired of hearing "Omaha" pronounced as if it were spelled like muh - hawb instead of mah - hahb and then have everyone ask them what they just said It's Nebraska!, but one pronunciation change can alter the entire meaning behind something. For example? Ok... so let me give you my opinion about why America needs its own language at least parts of our country need their very own languages! The problem with writing down the exact same way everything was spoken during colonial times has caused many problems today where someone who lived hundreds of years ago would probably sound nothing close to anyone from a modern city simply because accents drastically changed over time. Think back 100 years; did your grandparents speak exactly like most parents teachers politicians do now? Or even remotely similar? Using spelling rules created by Merriam Webster yesterday doesn't always work well when trying to decipher meanings of old documents written down by bored patriots while sitting around campfires after returning home froPosted by To explain more fully than I ever thought possible regarding why ENGLISH SHOULD NOT BE THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OF EVERYONE IN THIS WORLD!!!!!!! This post contains quite possibly too much information for those whom may already know it all, therefore please bear with me.:) Because it wasn't until recently that I learned this piece of information myself, perhaps others might find benefit reading my thoughts below also!: D CHEERS TO OUR COUNTRY' S UNIQUE NATIVE RACE AND MY STUPIDITY FOR NEVER LEARNING SOMETHING THAT WAS EASYLY AVAILABLE THROUGH SEARCH ENGINES LIKE GOOGLE LOL! So.... My friend Kristin called me up tonight asking questions concerning her upcoming trip across Europe next year. She asked things such as.. Should she bring money?? Where does she exchange currency into Euros??????? How long before it equals out to US ????? What kind of credit cards can she use overseas? Can she buy Euro with USD Money Cards? How safe is it to carry cash everywhere? These are valid concerns which made me unable to sleep last night. On top of being worried sick about my pal flying off somewhere else without me..... lol.... Little tidbits kept popping throughtout my brain throughout the course of the evening making me wonder whether any other foreigners had encountered difficulties traveling abroad like mine!! As luck would have it...... While searching online just moments later....... I found ANOTHER website explaining everything perfectly........
