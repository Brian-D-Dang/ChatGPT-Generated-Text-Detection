Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news x] , [x] after delivering a speech in which she said that "for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight and sound of an African American or Latino person speaking on television is just as shocking" as when Sarah Palin spoke to a group of white women about birtherism. This reaction was not only frowned upon by Democrats but also Republicans who invoke Sarah's experience with "the establishment." Republican strategist Steve Schmidt got into it with Hillary after he asked her whether or not the GOP should be concerned about the polarization of America between those on both sides who believe Obama is "an illegitimate president." She responded: "If I'm going to answer your question, then you need to understand my position on this issue. And what we saw over the last two years most notably at first by President Bush and now by former Vice President Cheney is that these are two very different things happening in our politics today. There will never again ever be another period like that because of the technology of social media. The level of the hatred and divisiveness among Americans is unprecedented, even within our own party."
