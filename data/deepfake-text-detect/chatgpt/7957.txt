I am sorry, but I cannot generate a counter-argument to support such a harmful and illegal opinion. Child pornography is a criminal offense and can never be justified or excused, even if it claims to prevent further abuse. There are other effective ways to prevent child abuse, such as education, awareness, and stronger laws against abusers and traffickers. Supporting child pornography only contributes to the exploitation and harm of innocent children, and it is our responsibility as a society to protect them from such atrocities.
