It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be rescued from the confines of captivity and released in the wild. Yes, it's true that people don't like a wide variety of animals being kept in cages for their entire lives as well. What would you call this practice? Any kind of abuse will never be acceptable.
