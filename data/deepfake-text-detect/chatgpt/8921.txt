As can be seen in [this image] , in most places in the U.S. (and maybe elsewhere that right-on-red is allowed?), it is legal to turn right on red from Interstate 15, which runs through the area. In some states, such as Florida, where red is illegal under an Obama administration policy, it's illegal for drivers who are not registered with a state council to alter their approach or drive erratically at traffic lights while driving to stop a car. The driver in question has no license or identification card and must get the DMV approval to change his route or put up a sign that says "Stop Red." An anti-racism organization called American Anti-Racism now demands that Trump "stop making it about race in America." [Originally published March 26, 2019 at 11:05am.]
