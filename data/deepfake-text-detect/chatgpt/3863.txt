In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn't work that way - so instead we get this "game" which is basically an extension to the original puzzle box. I also find it odd how there are 3 different versions of the original "puzzle." I'm guessing it's because they didn't have enough pictures for all three?
