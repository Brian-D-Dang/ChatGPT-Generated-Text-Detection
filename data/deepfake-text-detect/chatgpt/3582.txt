Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than others. It can lead to discriminatory behavior towards individuals from other countries or even within the same country who may be seen as different or inferior. Nationalism can also promote a sense of superiority over other nations, which can create tension and conflict between countries. However, it is important to note that not all forms of nationalism are the same. For example, civic nationalism promotes a sense of national identity based on shared values and beliefs rather than ethnicity or race. This type of nationalism can be more inclusive and tolerant towards individuals from different backgrounds. Overall, nationalism can have both positive and negative effects depending on how it is expressed and practiced. It is important to be aware of the potential negative consequences and strive towards promoting a more inclusive and tolerant society.
