I can only see socialistic systems (The harder variety that imposes 90 tax rates and such) work out in ethnically, culturally homogenous societies like the Nordic states, or certain Orthodox strands of Christianity. I don't think it's possible to have a socialist system with so many people suffering due to no incentive for them. When there is incentive you get things done and when your not getting things accomplished you become lazy. I'm sure there are some exceptions but on average I believe this is true
