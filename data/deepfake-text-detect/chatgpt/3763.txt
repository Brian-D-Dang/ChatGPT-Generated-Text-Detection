So first of I am danish. That means that I follow american politics, much in the same way I follow german politics. Somethings are importent for me and my situation, but not all things, sometimes there is a little bit of an American attitude to everything and thats why I don't like to talk about it with friends. I think you can answer your question better by describing what sort of problems you have; then we could be more specific to help
