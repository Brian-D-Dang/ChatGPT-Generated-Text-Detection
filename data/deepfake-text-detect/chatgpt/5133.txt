I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need to smoke a cigarette? Just saying I've heard no harm reduction in the state of California would help with stress relief from smoking chances are there is climbing due to all these chemicals being stored indoors because smokers shouldn't use them indoors. In fact everyone smells like a garbage can...
