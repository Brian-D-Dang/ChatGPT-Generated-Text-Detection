I believe that it is bad for humans generally that we have patriotism. It leads not only to discrimination. (hello Mr Trump) But also to economic and political difficulties and wars. It means you look at the world as if from one perspective, partly because of education. And this becomes a habit in your life. You think that everybody else sees things like you do. If so, how can any agreement be made? I don't want to say even world peace but just good neighbourliness requires mutual respect. This cannot exist when there are many different views about what should happen or where people come from. There must be some kind of convergence between countries: "To me my country matters more than yours...!" Apartheid has worked very well for many years because people couldn't see each other as their neighbours. They were all blind. Today I am looking forward to seeing everyone together again!
