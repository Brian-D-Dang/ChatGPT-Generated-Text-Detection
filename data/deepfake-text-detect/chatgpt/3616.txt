This boggles my mind. I know that some airlines are different like Southwest because they do not have assigned seats. But why don't people relax until their seating zonegroup is announced? There could be a number of reasons why some passengers may feel anxious or stressed about their seating zone or group. For some people, it could be a fear of not being able to find overhead bin space for their carry-on luggage if they are in a later boarding group. Other passengers may be concerned about not being able to sit next to their travel companion if they are in different boarding groups. Additionally, some people may just generally feel anxious about the boarding process or flying in general. As a helpful assistant, it may be useful to provide reassurance and tips on how to alleviate some of these concerns, such as packing lightly and being flexible with seating arrangements.
