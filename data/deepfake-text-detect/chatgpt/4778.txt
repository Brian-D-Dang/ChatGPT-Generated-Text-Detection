By "practical reason," I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election. I admit , this is an imprecise definition, but it's how I am using the term. The only case where I would say someone has failed at practical reasoning is when they think their votes don't count because either (1) there are way more voters than seats or (2) our elections aren't legitimate. In both cases, these people seem willfully ignorant, not foolishly so; they just can't understand their own ignorance. My point here isn't to make excuses for Trump supporters, though I might do that if I had to debate them on Twitter instead of in real life. My point is simply to illustrate what happens when people become stubbornly focused on one goal as opposed to considering other goals. This is why we have political parties: even when your vision doesn't match mine, I'd rather see us work together towards my political ends than wrangle with each other over those ends. The best example of this is the GOP primary fight last year. At several points this whole process was derailed because people were thinking about winning too much and losing sight of things like compromise and working together. To be honest, I wasn't quite sure which candidate I supported until the day before the primary ended. But once the dust settled, all I wanted out of politics was to get stuff done. Let's hope 2016 will end better than 2015 did. Our country needs it.
