Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women on TV and movies, etc... it seems a bit counterproductive. Do you have any thoughts? I don't know if this is considered off-topic here but there are many interesting threads on such topics already that would be welcome as a new addition for an existing discussion
