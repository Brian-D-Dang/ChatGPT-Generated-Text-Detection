When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether the motivation behind implementing a new form of speed prevention is to generate revenue or to increase road safety, the effects should still result in a reduction of speeding on the roads. However, it is important for law enforcement agencies to prioritize road safety and communicate clearly with the community about the reasons and goals behind new initiatives. Effective communication can help build trust and support for traffic safety measures.
