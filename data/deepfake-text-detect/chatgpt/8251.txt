Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. Let's cut the cynicism for a minute and look at some of this man's policies that are very popular with voters: (1) Universal single-payer healthcare, (2), Free college tuition including room board, (3). Ending student debt through refinancing all current loans into something more flexible like bonds - not actual cash. (4) 15 minimum wage within 5 years among other things such rent control which has been shown time after again by Harvard economists have proven harmful once implemented on their own apart from massive increases taxes accompanying them or simply used incorrectly when combined instead.) What about ending wars? It almost makes you wonder why he doesn' t run under an election law where candidates must state policy before they can be nominated... The fact remains though; without support behind him especially if we get another Republican administration following Donald Trump there will likely only ever exist half measures unless Americans become radicalized themselves toward peace activismnonviolence etc.. If people start voting based solely upon how well someone represents nonviolent thoughts rather than those who scream most loudly then perhaps results might actually change positively over night! No doubt many do already vote using these criteria sadly however much resistance still exists against true civil disobedience backed up my armed forces fighting back rationally too bad so sad. Maybe human beings haven 't evolved enough yet despite our technological advancements since WWII... They may never evolve beyond being caught between two extremes depending entirely either way whether violence comes first OR negotiation followed closely thereafter.... Sadly both options seem equally fatal now..... Sigh.... As always love life passionately while attempting rationality;)
