I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think about mathematics: math isn't free from assumptions like natural laws are and so if you want to prove something mathematically then you need to be clear on what your starting point (assumptions) is. If there are any radically different set of starting points that lead us to two conflicting results we should try to figure out which one is true (assuming science has reasonable ways of doing this). Consider Newtonian mechanics - were our current theories based upon some other theory or was Newton just lucky in deriving his equations? Consider Einstein's General Relativity - were these mathematical objects discovered by someone who had no prior knowledge of them or did they arise naturally through thought experiments? In both cases there is evidence supporting either option but ultimately we could never know which one really happened without going back and asking people directly. The same thing applies to quantum physics - have all our experimental models been correctly interpreted or do they have gaping holes that make them invalid because they don't match up with reality properly? What happens at the Planck scale is still unknown and may conflict with predictions made using classical methods of calculation thus making string theory an interesting approach to future research! This leads me onto another topic, namely where does consciousness come into play? While many might argue against the possibility of life being able to feel itself since nothing is attached to anything else in the universe, I believe that perhaps alien intelligent beings would feel connected to each other and therefore, possibly have conscious feelings towards their own species. Could such aliens have experiences similar to ours and even act differently when faced with situations? Would they move around within groups much like humans behave during times of war? Are they afraid of things they can't understand yet will find intimidating simply because they aren't used to dealing with them? Does fear exist outside the human condition? Might they develop fears regarding Climate Change because they couldn't predict its effects? There is plenty more room for debate here too though, as happiness also seems to vary between cultures and individual lives, leading to arguments over whether all human emotion is positive or not. This brings me to my final question; why am I reading about all of this now?!
