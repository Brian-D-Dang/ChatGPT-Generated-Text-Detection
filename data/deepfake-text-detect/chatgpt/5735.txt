Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just let people finish up. 1. Continuity. You mention that this is "an original work," but you never actually tell us what the story is about. I know it's "a dark fantasy," but that's not really saying anything. What is the story? The premise is not really clear. 2. The beginning. I was pretty confused about what was happening at first. It wasn't until after you mentioned the name of the place, "Chaos Mountain," that I realized that they're traveling to a place called Chaos Mountain. Why don't you just say that, or call it something else? Also, I was confused about the whole "warring brothers" thing, at first, but it became clear that they're on their way to try and stop some kind of battle between the two brothers. 3. You have a really strong voice here. It's very nice, but at the same time, you haven't really told us what the story is about yet. What's going on? It's like this is a character study. 4. I'm not sure about the paragraph beginning with "A fireball exploded on the...." This is the first time I've seen this technique in a fantasy story. Have you used it elsewhere? I'm wondering if you've used it before and I just didn't realize it. 5. I don't know who these "men" are that they're traveling with. You refer to them as "men," but I don't really have any idea who they are, other than that they're traveling with the protagonist. I'd like to know more about them. 6. It would be helpful to include the protagonist's name. 7. The sentence "It's the scent of Chaos Mountain" is a bit awkward. You might want to reword it. 8. I don't like the line "The dark-skinned man was all but dead, but the lithe brunette was full of life." I don't like it because it's implying that it's more important for the woman to be alive than for the man. It doesn't matter what sex they are. That's a problematic attitude. 9. I don't like the way you describe the environment, especially the "colorful" part. I think you mean that the scenery is "diverse," which I think is a much better way to describe it. 10. The sentence "A 200-pound man is not going to be easily wounded" is a bit awkward. 11. I think you meant "mercenaries." 12. There are a few "r's" that should be "l's." 13. I think you mean "corrupt." 14. "I need to find a way to kill them, but I have no way to harm them.." I think this sentence could be rewritten to be less repetitive. 15. I don't know why you have the protagonist doing a headcount of the men that are traveling with her. 16. I really like the paragraph about the dead animals. 17. You could mention that the twins are brothers. I think it's important to establish that. 18. I think the sentence "Their father, a man of status" is awkward. I think you mean "men" rather than "man." You might want to rephrase this. 19. I'm not sure about the last sentence. I don't know what it means. 20. There's a couple of instances where you use the word "on" twice in the same sentence. 21. I think the sentence "You're a murderer" is a bit awkward. I think you might want to change it to "You're a murderer!" or something. 22. You use the word "screamed" twice in a row. 23. I don't know what a "back-to-back" is. I think you mean back-to-back room. 24. You use the phrase "glaring at her" twice in a row. 25. I'm not sure about the sentence "They'd continue to travel.." It's a bit awkward. 26. You use the phrase "down to earth" twice in a row. 27. "Dropping to
