It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing we can agree on is this: there's no question that Xi Jinping has made his mark in China. He may not have created the 'New Silk Road' project or won the Olympics but he has certainly managed to get through to an entire generation of Chinese who now have a voice and are able to make themselves heard. He is not just "head of state" - he is head of government. A new type of leadership with a clear vision of how things should be run. That vision will inevitably generate controversy at times and it seems inevitable that clashes will break out over what exactly the new order will look like, especially if it seeks to change the country's social structure from top down. But the fact remains that everyone knows what needs to happen because China, under Xi Jinping, wants a different kind of world in which their leaders understand the challenges facing humanity and respect for human rights, freedom of speech, civil liberties - not just those of Westerners, but also those of East Asian Muslims, Christians, women and gay fighters in Russia and other places around the globe - span the spectrum. He is building a new power base in China that understands this. We need to stop thinking of him as the man who brought stability back to China after three decades of revolutionary chaos. He's done more than anyone else, since Mao Zedong.
