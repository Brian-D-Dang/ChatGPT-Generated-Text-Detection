Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap . I disagree. I believe that communism has failed because it's centralized government which makes people feel bad for not having a common purpose. There won't be any single collective goal to pass.
