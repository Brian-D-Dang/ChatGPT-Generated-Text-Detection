Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and I also understand that the statistics on rape are skewed in the female direction, but I'd still say that rape is generally a much more serious problem for men than for women. I really don't want to be dismissive of the trauma that some women feel from being raped, but I don't think that we should ignore the fact that men face a much more serious risk of being raped than women do. I just think it's important to acknowledge that the problem is much bigger for men than for women.

A person who has been raped doesn't deserve to be ridiculed. We get it, you're a guy.

Females aren't the only ones who get raped, but I'm sure your implication is that males aren't. That's disingenuous. Not only are men raped, but it's considered a "sexual crime" when a man is raped. The shame and social stigma that come with it are far more damaging than the rape itself, let alone other possible crimes that could happen as a result of being raped. The problem isn't just the rape itself. It's the implications of being raped. In a male's case, he may not even be aware that what happened to him is rape. It's not a "much bigger problem" for males than females. It's an equal problem for both genders, and it's an unfortunate thing that we have to be reminded of that.

Yes, there are some cases where a man is raped. But it's a far rarer occurrence, and they are almost never by other men. Also, when a man is raped, it's often seen as the man's fault. This causes serious psychological problems that are often overlooked. You have the right to dismiss this. I'm just trying to explain to others why you're wrong. austofoz 1 insightful - 1 fun1 insightful - 0 fun2 insightful - 0 fun2 insightful - 1 fun - 1 year ago (1 child) It's not a "much bigger problem" for males than females. It's an equal problem for both genders, and it's an unfortunate thing that we have to be reminded of that I'm sorry but I don't agree with this. The statistics on rape in general show that women are much more likely to be raped than men are, and I don't think we should overlook the fact that male rape is a much bigger problem for men than it is for women. I don't think the number of rapes has anything to do with whether it's a bigger problem for men or women. It's a much bigger problem for men, because the consequences are much more severe for men. I don't mean to sound dismissive of female rape victims, because I think it's a huge problem. But male rape is even bigger. It's a much bigger problem for men because of the implications of being raped. In male rape cases, you don't even know if what happened to you was rape. If a man is raped, it's usually by another man, and society will not take the male victim seriously. If you are raped by a woman, it will be blamed on the man. If a man is raped, it is often seen as the man's fault. This causes serious psychological problems that are often over
