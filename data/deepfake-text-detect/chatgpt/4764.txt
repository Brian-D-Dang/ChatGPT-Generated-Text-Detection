The state of Palestine has 4 million people residing within Isreal. The West Bank and Gaza strip together have 6,000 square kilometers of land. The North Sinai Governorate alone has a population of 2,700,000 residents. With such large populations the PA will need to build many schools in order for all its citizens to receive an education. Construction materials must be transported from Israel into the PA areas. So there is expected to be a large demand on cement production facilities across the Palestinian territories. These factories are currently owned by Israeli companies that also produce cement for export back to Israel. This arrangement was tolerated until now because it maintained economic cooperation between both sides but this can no longer continue with the construction of new settler colonies inside occupied East Jerusalem and other parts of the West Bank. Unfortunately, these projects are moving ahead already despite the PA having made promises not to do so. For example: It is evident in their tariff structure that they intend to use imported material at subsidized prices in the hope that future settlers will pay higher rates than those who live elsewhere or who left during the Intifada. They cannot possibly believe that building settlements will cause any harm if subsidies outweigh high costs and risks associated with importing quality raw materials, like cement. This kind of plan will only make the situation worse as the PA remains isolated economically and loses its international legitimacy while the seeds of conflict grow stronger.
