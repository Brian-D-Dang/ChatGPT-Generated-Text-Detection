So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But even more importantly than all this, what does it say about men? It says they get to be stay-at-home dads for extended periods after their children arrive into the world because there aren't any jobs available to them now. And in fact, that this can help women enter caregiving professions such as nursing or teaching because we need people who have gone through childbirth experiences to take these positions and teach other young parents how to handle childcare issues. I know a lot of fathers who work full time maybe five days a week, but some do six or seven days a week. Those poor guys don't seem like they're getting the same kind of benefits from those extra sessions with their kids at daycare centers during the weekdays. Maybe if men were given entitlements toward childrearing, then there would be equal opportunity out there. My theory on that is that you'd be able to find male nannies much easier.
