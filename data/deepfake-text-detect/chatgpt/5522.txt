When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether it's the fact that the road is more dangerous or that people are speeding more, the impact of the speed prevention will be the same. This is according to research from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and the University of Oxford. The study looked at a road where police officers were given a handheld computer. They could then more easily track drivers speeding. They also carried out spot checks and gave out tickets, compared to a control area where police officers didn't have the computer. "In our study area, speeding went down by 13 per cent. But whether this was due to the new computer system or the increased speed checks didn't matter. It turned out to be the same result either way," said Sara Jensen from NTNU. The researchers also discovered that the same was true for drivers' behaviour on the other side of the road. "It's clear that people adjust their behaviour when there are new rules. But the effect is very similar whether they do it because they feel the rules are fair or they do it to avoid a ticket. The new rules changed people's behaviour, but it didn't matter why," Jensen said. The researchers also asked people whether they thought speeding was worse on the road that was targeted by the new computer system, and if they thought their own speeding had changed. "People's answers were a bit different. In the control area, they said they thought speeding was a bit worse, and that they were a bit slower. The people who were speeding more said they thought they were slower. But the researchers discovered that there was no difference in how much people actually were speeding," Jensen said. Those who thought the rules were fair also thought they were slower, but those who were speeding more thought they were slower too. The researchers believe the results have implications for how speed limits are set. "It's important to understand how speed limits are set. We know that speed limits have an impact on how many people get injured and how many die. But we now know that people respond to speed limits differently. Some people are prepared to drive faster, others slower. And we don't know whether people who were already speeding are going to drive even faster," said Jensen. The researchers also hope that the study will change the way speed limits are set. "Speed limits are currently based on people's feelings about how speedy they think the traffic is. They don't take into account the impact on people's behaviour," Jensen said. "We hope that in the future, research like this will be used to make speed limits more effective." The study is part of the research project The Social Life of Speeding and has been published in the journal Psychological Science.
