A potential counter-argument could be that legalizing prostitution may increase cases of human trafficking and exploitation. Legalization may also create a demand for this type of work which could lead to more vulnerable groups, such as children and minors, being forced into the industry. Additionally, the legalization of prostitution may create a negative societal impact by promoting the idea that a person's body is a commodity that can be bought and sold. Therefore, it is necessary to address the underlying issues that often lead individuals towards sex work, rather than solely focusing on legalizing it.
