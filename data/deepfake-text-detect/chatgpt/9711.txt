So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor "White supremacy" is a racist term that implies everything is white. Reverse racism means the racists are black. If white people are racists and black people are racists, then reverse racism is racist.
