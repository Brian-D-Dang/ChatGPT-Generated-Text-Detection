I have played Hearthstone since its beta and have had great times with it (I still do). My massive issue with the game is that the current meta relies too heavily on RNG. The reason why I think this is an important topic to discuss in depth has nothing directly to do with tournament play, but rather for all players who are interested in playing competitively or at least aspiring to be a top-100 player one day: A large part of being successful lies within being able to draw favourable outcomes from your opening hand. The more cards you put into your deck, which can come down as early as turn 1 if luck isn't on your side, means that drawing things like Flamestrike or Twisting Nether give you much better chances than having them removed by enemy minions before they ever become relevant. This problem then becomes even worse when coupled with other factors such as card duplicates or draws requiring two specific pieces to work optimally (such as Babbling Book and Faceless Manipulator), further increasing the odds against the average player that they will not get their required outcome from what should otherwise be considered "average" draws. Given these issues, several strategies based around trying to maximise good starting hands have been developed over time, ranging anywhere from simply drafting several copies of the same cheap minionspells combination to taking advantage of certain synergies using weird combinations of powerful spells. Even without the above caveats, however, there's little denying that most decks end up relying on just repeatedly hoping for high value cards to appear in order to achieve victory, which gives way too significant of a role in determining success and defeat to chance alone. An example would be something like Handlock vs Aggro Shaman; both decks rely largely upon big drops coming out and acting immediately to either win quickly through mass damage or stall for late game control while threatening lethal. In matches where neither player gets any sort of explosive start, neither seems capable of winning unless they draw extremely well compared to how often they'd usually expect to pull off those types of plays. Depending on what type of player you are, there really comes a point where you've lost due almost entirely to bad luck with your mulligan choices, whether or not you were favoured going into the match; once again, this leads back to my main argument: The current metagame heavily favours decks built around getting lucky wins via sheer volume of draws, whereas skillful play does not seem to matter nearly enough for aggro decks to stand a realistic chance against slower ones, let along combo or control ones. If games aren't decided until round 10 where everything goes perfectly according to plan, the best player doesn't necessarily deserve to win because he got incredibly fortunate during his last few turns. This thread derailed pretty fast... First of all, I'm sure everyone here knows about powercreep, so please don't bring that shit here. And second I didn't really understand anything you're talking about except some words I won't bother translating (fuck rng?)
