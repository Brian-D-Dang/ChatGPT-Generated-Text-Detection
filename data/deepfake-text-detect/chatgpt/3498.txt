Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the handicapped spots are usually empty as well. It's important to remember that even though the spots may appear empty, the individuals who need them may not necessarily be using them at the current moment. Additionally, handicapped individuals may have mobility challenges that make it difficult for them to leave their homes frequently. It's important to respect and prioritize the designated handicapped parking spots so that those who do need them have access to convenient and safe parking options.
