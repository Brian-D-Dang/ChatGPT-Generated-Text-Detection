After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read far too many novels written by people who are not my cup of tea - like Julia Rowan's The Good Wife (for example), Stephen King's Lament for the Kings, or William Shakespeare's The Last Queen. So when it comes to fiction, it's no surprise that I'm feeling guilty about going into a different book every day and reading it again after so long. Some days I have to start with another novel because I haven't finished it yet, while others I don't even know what they're in for. But when there is something I want to read at least twice, I do this all day every day. If I'm at work, then don't watch TV until Monday morning because I can't get enough sleep. Or if I need a little bit of rest, I don't go out and make coffee anymore. All three days I feel guilty that I'm reading twice as much. Why? Because when you're writing, it's very hard to keep up and sometimes it takes hours to finish your sentence, depending on how many characters you write. Some days, I don't even know where I am, but other times I end up more frustrated than before, which is why I usually just stop writing. It's similar to when we spend the whole day outside, talking and then watching TV. We often forget that we don't really think about someone else's story. Instead we focus on ourselves. We should be doing things that contribute to our society instead of focusing on the ways that we "do" things that impact us. When we sit down to eat lunch, for instance, we might simply say 'good job', and not worry about whether the meal was good. But once we step away from having food to talk about, we become depressed and unable to fully concentrate on anything. What do we actually care about anyway? And since talking about isn't really one thing, it brings us closer together. That is the extent of what we truly value in life. When I write about a topic, I try to focus on the knowledge that is inside me, namely how my mind works, every single moment In response to this, there's an almost constant urge to remind myself that I could really use some help right now. Through stories, poems, song lyrics, journal entries, pictures, etc., I try to remember to live within the limits of my own thinking. It may seem ridiculous to ask myself: would I eat breakfast when I first started learning English? Would I still want to brush my teeth after eight years of school? Could I willingly take a nap to avoid sleeping so well? How could I possibly stay awake all night without bothering anyone? After all, if I had taken breaks, I would probably still be sleeping through the morning. So whatever I choose to believe, I can never convince myself otherwise. I find that writing helped me enormously in finding life-long friends and relationships, especially through the music industry. While that was great, I didn't see any opportunities for connecting directly with people who were inspirational to me, and was surprised to learn that working at radio stations helped me amaze and inspire other women in the industry. There was also the chance to meet new women entirely, unlike most of my older female coworkers. As I have been getting older, I have realized that it has been easier to relate to younger men. My dad was a musician; he gave me his favorite rock album of all time, which included such classics as Brian Eno's Black Sabbath, Sam Cooke's The Fifth Element, Bruno Mars' Destruction, and even Patti Smith's Ten Thousand Ways to Kill oneself, among many other songs. He told me that I had to listen to Billie Joe Armstrong's The Beatles as much as I did other artists, and he encouraged me to sing along to them live, too. This helped me connect with strangers. People opened their eyes to where they went. I couldn't imagine anyone knowing me better, but being around people who knew me was a joy. Once I understood a thousand words of the songs and their meanings, the emotions that formed my heart became exactly the same ones I ever have felt when listening to them live, including deep emotional attachments. They gave me an appreciation for everything. And so it goes for me that being young makes us more aware today. As I age, I realize that while I may feel sad over the loss of my best friend, who died unexpectedly due to cancer, I will have stability in life, regardless of the fact that she wasn't my best friend nor her great-grandmother. Not only will I miss her, but I'll likely be able to hug her again soon.
