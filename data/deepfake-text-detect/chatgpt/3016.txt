First of all, I want to first express how happy I am with this subreddit. It has always been a hub for civilized discussion on complicated and difficult topics. I 'm proud that so many people here are interested in learning about the world outside their own little bubble and using it to improve themselves as persons. Edit: Spelling Oh man you're making me blush!
