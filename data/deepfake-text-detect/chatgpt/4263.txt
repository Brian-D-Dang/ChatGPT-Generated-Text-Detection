I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I also notice that on many occasions in recent years when people have been speaking about domestic violence they've referred to it being a man's problem and this was not true even one hundred years ago. It should be said that we don't know for sure yet whether there will be any consequences for those who voted yes, but we can at least speculate as to what might happen - and we'll see if any of these predictions come true or not in future years.
