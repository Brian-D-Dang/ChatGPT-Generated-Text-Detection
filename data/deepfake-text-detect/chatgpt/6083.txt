When I see debate about'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about'evidence'. If they shift on these things they don't say'well, I looked at the evidence and this is the conclusion I came to', they say something more like'I don't know, I just think..'. Or'I've decided to do this because it's cool'. This is obvious to me, but I still get confused and frustrated when I see people trying to convince me of things using pure opinion, or personal anecdotes. How can I, as a rational person, know that they're not just making this stuff up? I was talking about this with my wife the other day. She thinks that people are more emotional and irrational about politics than they are about, say, their choice of lunch. For example, she thinks most people would not be irrational about whether to eat a sandwich or a bowl of pasta, but would be irrational about what kind of government they wanted (e.g. capitalist, communist, socialist etc.). She also thinks that there is a systematic flaw in the way that we learn about politics. We get taught about politics in a way that is emotionally charged, whereas things like maths and biology (where I'm from) are taught in a more neutral way. This suggests to me that, if we want to reduce the amount of irrational political debate, we should try to remove as much emotion from political debate as possible. And the best way to do this is probably to teach politics in the same way that we teach maths and biology. This is also the sort of thing that could be tested. We could try to reduce the amount of emotion in a discussion about a political issue and see whether people become more rational about it. (E.g. by having a group of people with different political views chat about the issue without saying 'I think...', instead just giving their views as if they were facts.) Or we could try to introduce emotional politics lessons into the school curriculum. Or just try to get more people to 'think, don't feel'. Of course, this all seems a bit wishy-washy and 'touchy-feely' to me. I like the idea, but I'm not sure how it would actually work. I'm open to suggestions! 1. Does it make sense that people are more irrational about politics than about other things? 2. If so, why are they? 3. What could we do to reduce the amount of irrational debate about politics? 4. Do you have any suggestions? I'm not an expert on how politics is taught in schools but it seems to me that there are two kinds of political education: 1. Taught as history. The problem with this is that history is written by the winners, so kids are only taught about the political systems that were successful. They don't hear about the failed ones. 2. Taught as philosophy. The problem with this is that philosophy is about looking for the truth behind something, but often people aren't trying to find the truth behind the political system they're discussing. They're trying to convince people to adopt their way of thinking. It seems to me that we need to teach about politics in a way that is more about objective truth, and less about personal opinion.
