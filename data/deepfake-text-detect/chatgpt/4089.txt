The U.S. Constitution is an old document. At the time it was written, it made a lot of sense, and it was a large jump ahead for democracy, politics, and social policy in general. It took us through some very tumultuous times; many fought for its basic principles, only to lose them all at the end - which, ironically enough, pushed our nation forward into great new horizons. However...it's also one big mess. The text is riddled with grammatical errors, is filled with typos and mistakes, and so on. That's because, as we know from history, people had different ideas about what their country should look like at that point in time. It wasn't until much later when the Founding Fathers decided to put things together more effectively by formulating the first amendment to be enacted. But this means the original draft could have been better. And it probably would still be if there were more editors! In addition, all too often is indistinguishable between "the rights of man" and "natural law." There are lots of examples where the two concepts conflict: In the discussion about abortion versus sex-selection abortions, there are those who say one is wrong but others who think they're both right. This kind of inconsistency makes it really hard to imagine how anything can possibly work if you don't take these conflicting positions into consideration. One thing I've noticed over the years is that most versions of the constitution use the word "God" a lot less than it used to (say 50 or more). There might even be instances today where God doesn't appear at all in the text. Many people believe that this is because no one wants his or her religious beliefs to interfere with public affairs, but this simply isn't true, nor has anyone ever suggested that reason reigns supreme over faith. So why exactly did people change their minds?
