From The majority of sexual assault are not reported to the police (an average of 68 of assaults in the last five years were not reported).1 Those rapists, of course, are often described as victims who want to avoid punishment for their crimes.2 This is why we need a big punitive measure against those responsible and also because it allows victims of rape cases more time with legal recourse after being informed that they will be prosecuted by the community should any evidence prove necessary.3 In other words, victims have needed long periods without information until investigations into their claims make clear enough that there was no crime committed intentionally or unintentionally; thus allowing them ample opportunity before the law becomes overly broad so that perpetrators can escape responsibility if they see justice delayed indefinitely even though the incident lasted too much longer than expected when no criminal record is available from the guilty party.4
