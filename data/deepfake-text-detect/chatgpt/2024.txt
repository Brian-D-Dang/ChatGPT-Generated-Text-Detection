Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from 5th grade through high school) and was in track throughout middle high schools years. In both of these sports we were requiredexpected to shower after practices or games every day regardless if it was hot out because we sweat more than other students who don't play those two sports- this is where i have an issue with parents refusing their childs' showers on days they are "too tired" due to having homework etc.. It would be one thing for them knowing that they need to shower afterwards yet choose NOT too however leaving me wondering why do you even bother going out there? And also how do certain coaches treat players differently based off gender?? I've never played basketball so can't really comment much about that sport itself...but when it comes down to athletic events between boys vs girls which coach does better job at making sure all athletes receive equal treatment like'showering', especially since most people agree females tend to perspire less hence resulting into needing to take shorter showers than males. What say ye Reddit?!
