Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as more and more evidence and commentary from the most brilliant scientists and philosophers come to light, I realize I am right. I believe this is the most fundamental problem of our age, and we need to address it. The greatest innovators in the last centuries, such as Newton, Einstein, etc., were either born or spent the greater part of their lives outside their home countries. They were often refugees fleeing from their home countries. In fact, Einstein's work in general relativity was born out of the urgency of his escape from Nazi Germany, and his subsequent move to America. Far from being a sign of cultural decline, it's a sign of the highest order of innovation. They felt compelled to go somewhere else to escape the stagnation, the conformity, the nationalism, and the prejudices. They were compelled to go somewhere else to be able to think free from the constraints and dogmas of the homeland. The evidence is irrefutable. This is why we need to welcome more refugees from the Middle East, and why we need to keep immigration high. We need to keep attracting those with the greatest potential, the greatest creativity, the most critical thinking, those with the greatest ambition and drive. I'd love to hear your take on it. What do you think of this idea? There's nothing more dangerous than a big idea.

The only issue I have is that I think more emphasis should be put on bringing refugees to the western world instead of the middle east. There's a lot of controversy and pushback to this idea and I think we're only hurting ourselves by not bringing in more people from more places.

Even if I don't agree with you, I'll ask you to please be careful with how you word this statement. It's rather obvious that the post 1945, post WWII era and the fall of the Soviet Union is not a good representation of the state of Hungarian culture. It was in this period that Hungary was the victim of a campaign of destruction and infiltration by agents of foreign nations to turn the country into a vassal of a particular group of people. While I can't blame Hungary for being nationalistic at this time, I can't condone the use of such language. I would suggest that you use a different country that would show you this state of decline. It would also be good if you could show us a few of the great Hungarians of today that you think are the greatest innovators of our time. I agree with this though. There are some good points here, but to be clear, I'm not talking about the nationalistic and hateful response we've had in the last couple of years. I am talking about a more long-term phenomenon, that is to say, the "Hungarian national identity." I'm also talking about the fact that there is a general mentality in Hungary, that we are a country that has declined in the last few decades. That we've been a great country in the past, but we are not anymore. That we are not as innovative, creative, cultured and progressive as we once were, and that the reason for this is that we've been declining over the last several decades. This mentality is a deep cultural one, that I think is pretty much an inherent part of the Hungarian identity. It's like a national identity crisis, if you will. It is this mentality that I am fighting against, and that I am trying to disprove with facts and reason, rather than nationalistic rhetoric. (08-05-2017 06:37 PM)
