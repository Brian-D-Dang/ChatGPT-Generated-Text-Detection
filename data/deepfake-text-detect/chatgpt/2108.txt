After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read some incredible novels but they usually aren't as educational or beneficial in any way besides entertainment (save for maybe A Tale Of Two Cities). I think it depends on what you are reading. If your goal is only knowledge then yeah probably not going to find much out if books like The Great Gatsby which seem purely recreational
