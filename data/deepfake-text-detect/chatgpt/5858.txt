I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any harm in that, it should be dealt with in the here and now, not in the afterlife. 212328 - 012809 07:49 PM Re: atheists who feel they will go to hell [Re: 6Satan6Archist6] If it weren't for the fact that I have experienced the infinite, I'd have to be a card-carrying atheist, myself. But I have experienced the infinite, and that experience was so overwhelming, I am left with no other choice than to believe. The idea of an afterlife is absurd to me, because I have had a glimpse of eternity, and it is a place of great joy and peace. The idea of a God who would damn someone to hell, is, I believe, impossible. But, if there was a God who would do such a thing, I would not worship Him, because he would be a cruel, sadistic, monster. 212332 - 012809 10:36 PM Re: atheists who feel they will go to hell [Re: EvilEve] If an atheist is trying to reason his way to believing in God, then he's not really an atheist. Atheists don't believe because they're trying to prove something. I've heard it said that "The atheist is an agnostic who doesn't want to have to go through the trouble of justifying his agnosticism." 212348 - 012909 03:09 AM Re: atheists who feel they will go to hell [Re: EvilEve] I have had the "glimpse" you speak of. I don't believe I can put it into words. I will say that I did not get it from a religion or a book, I got it from nature. It was a simple lesson that would explain everything. I didn't know it at the time. The experience was not for me, it was for everyone. This is the lesson that is waiting for us all. The lesson is not about the "end" or what happens after death. It is about learning how to live, here and now. Everything is in our life, and we just have to look for it. 212352 - 012909 03:50 AM Re: atheists who feel they will go to hell [Re: SIN3] SIN3, I'm going to have to respectfully disagree. I consider myself an atheist, and I do not claim to know. I try to keep an open mind about a lot of things, and my approach is to question everything. I'm a mathematician, so to me, there is no such thing as a "proof." The best we can hope for is "evidence" and "reason." You said, "I've heard it said that 'The atheist is an agnostic who doesn't want to have to go through the trouble of justifying his agnosticism. This statement is just plain false. I don't think anyone actually thinks that. In my opinion, the only reason to be an atheist is because of the evidence and the logic that one has come to conclude that one does not believe in a god. My personal opinion is that there is no way to prove a god does not exist, and there is no way to prove a god does exist. I just look at the evidence and logic, and then make a decision on what I believe is the most likely conclusion. If I look at the evidence and the logic, it leads me to believe that a god does not exist. I'm not saying this is right, I'm just saying that is my conclusion. I would not be so arrogant as to say that my conclusion is the right one, or even that my conclusion is correct. I just don't believe that there is any other conclusion that could be made based on the evidence and logic. It's a different experience for everyone, I guess. I don't find it arrogant to say that I "know" something. I think that claiming you "know" something is a matter of personal definitions. If you define "know" as "to be certain beyond doubt," then I guess that makes sense. But if
