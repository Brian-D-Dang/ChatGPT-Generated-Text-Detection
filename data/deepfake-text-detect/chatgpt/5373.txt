I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still believe Sanders deserves respect for speaking out publicly against racism and xenophobia; however I also feel he should remain silent when his supporters try to undermine his actions on this issue by questioning his motives or condemn him directly. Bernie Sanders has been vocal about wanting to reform our criminal justice system but doesn't want to acknowledge what has happened since slavery was abolished more than forty years ago because of his views on race relations - even suggesting it is time to start recognizing his positions as he disagrees strongly on the issue. It seems clear how deeply his stances are unpopular among Americans such as himself who wish his ideas had been changed sooner rather than later! Sanders may be politically correct, but I don't think anyone could argue he isn't hypocritical enough for calling attention to an unjust system whose purpose is not just punishing criminals but protecting all people from discrimination based upon race so they can continue committing crimes against others like themselves. He only wants to abolish slavery once too many people have been killed at the hands of white people's hatred of Black Americans due to his own racist beliefs which includes slavery being outlawed. He didn't ever offer any apology except for saying Hillary Clinton needs to apologize to Black Americans whom he said killed him during her nomination process AFTER he was murdered by a racist white supremacist named Andrew Carr. Sanders ridiculed Clinton for failing to confront these racists and her failure to address them after Carr attacked him before the DNC convention despite Clinton beating him by 29 points over Trump last week! Sanders said Clinton has no business apologizing for what Sanders called "murderous attacks" on Donald Trump. Sanders also compared Hillary Clinton to Hitler without citing any proof! Trump made a small concession last night when he conceded voting for Hillary Clinton was wrong until he decided to support Bernie Sanders instead of Trump after they sparred together earlier in the evening. Trump gave Clinton credit for having done nothing wrong during the election campaign prior to his defeat by Biden but Trump criticized Sanders' proposed constitutional amendment banning white supremacists and neo-Nazis ahead of the 2016 Republican National Convention via Twitter predicting it will help with voter fraud. Sanders said the amendment would destroy the democratic party Democrats. Comey said Clinton lied multiple times throughout and falsely accused Hillary Clinton of lying several times herself when she did not lie to Congress!! TRUTH NEVER SEEN ME!!! CNN - Donald J. Trump (realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2018 It appears Bernie Sanders is finally acknowledging he believes his political opponents murder victims deserve punishment but would prefer to let Trump do it! Sanders thinks Trump does not care if he kills Nazis who call for genocide but Clinton does! This shows Trump actually cares whether his opponent commits treason instead of murdering innocent people! Trump repeatedly says all Americans need protection from violence, yet Sanders stands up for victims like John McCain who died defending slavery supporting white supremacy! Sanders calls Trump a racist who supports white supremacy but makes sure minorities aren't protected against such atrocities! Bernie Sanders believes white people commit war crimes every day believing they shouldn't be punished for killing Blacks! Sanders claims he hates Trump but only advocates action against white power politics hate crime! Sanders calls white nationalists and neo-Nazi groups terrorists and terrorists BUT DEMOCRATS AND OTHERS ALL KILLED EVERYDAY by lying accusing them of murder!
