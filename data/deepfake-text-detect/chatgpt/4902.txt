In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing for or against same-sex marriage but if you're going to lump together polygamy and polygamy then there are two ways of looking at this: either polygamy is adultery (which it isn't) or polygamy is adultery because it leads to polygamy itself Yes, and it is an incestuous relation between two adults who have been brought up together by a single mother... those are three reasons polygamy is immoral separate from homosexuality
