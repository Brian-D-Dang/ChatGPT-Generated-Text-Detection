Though my personal political views match those of Bernie Sanders much more than Hillary Clinton, I believe nominating Bernie could ultimately be very damaging for the progressive cause. My main concern is that progressives will not only lose a major battle but cede large swathes of territory to conservatives and libertarians in what has already been one of the most conservative general election seasons yet seen. I am also concerned about how this would play out within the Democratic Party itself. If America wants an actual left-leaning candidate then it needs to accept differences between candidates and their records-for example Hillary's record on gay rights was far from perfect whereas Bernie is far ahead of her (Sanders voted for DOMA and voted against DADT). Similarly, just because Sanders can talk big doesn't mean he knows any useful things to say; his proposals are often little more than warmed over Republican talking points with some liberal rhetoric sprinkled around them. For all these reasons I think Hillary should stay in until she wins the nomination and then drop out gracefully so as to leave the field open to someone who might actually give Republicans a real run for their money in November 2016: Elizabeth Warren
