I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to predict the properties of a new element. A new element is a new particle, and since it's a new particle we don't have the data to predict how it will behave. The behavior of most elements is predicted by the structure of the atom, which in turn is predicted by the behavior of the electrons. New particles have not been observed before, so we can't predict how it will behave. So I don't understand why you can predict the properties of a new element. How are you predicting them? StevenK, It's not just a new particle. It's a new and very complex atomic structure, which is then made up of a large number of electrons and nucleons. This structure can be predicted with great accuracy using a computer and the data available from the old particles (which are in the periodic table). For example, the number of protons and neutrons can be predicted with great accuracy, which in turn determines the number of electrons and the charge. The structure of the electrons around the nucleus can also be predicted. Once you know this, you can predict the ionization energy, electron affinity, and other properties of the new element. As far as I know, the only element where the only known properties are the name and symbol is the periodic table's placeholder for the hypothetical element 119. The structure of the electrons around the nucleus can also be predicted. It's my understanding that you can't predict the structure of the electrons around the nucleus. You can predict the number of electrons, and therefore the charge, but you don't know where those electrons are going to go. What you're saying is basically the same as saying "if the orbit of Pluto is made of plastic, it will be cold." The number of electrons and the charge are connected, so if you know the charge you can determine the number of electrons. You can then determine the electronic structure of the atom using a computer. This is how we know the properties of every element on the periodic table. For example, the number of protons and neutrons can be predicted with great accuracy using a computer and the data available from the old particles (which are in the periodic table). I understand that you can predict the number of protons and neutrons with great accuracy. What I'm saying is that you can't predict the location of the electrons. You can predict the number of protons and neutrons, which is all you need to know to predict the number of electrons. The location of the electrons in the periodic table is determined by the elements that come before it in the periodic table. If a new element has 119 protons, then it will have 119 electrons. That will determine the location of the electron around the nucleus. In the case of [ununpentium], you know the number of protons (119) and electrons (119), so you can predict its electronic structure, which will determine the ionization energy and electron affinity. The location of the electrons in the periodic table is determined by the elements that come before it in the periodic table. This is not true. You need to know the number of electrons and the charge. You can't predict where those electrons are going to go. You can predict the number of electrons, but not their position. If a new element has 119 protons, then it will have 119 electrons. But you don't know where those electrons are going to go. You can predict the number of electrons, but not their position. That will determine the location of the electron around the nucleus. No, it won't. That's the only thing that will determine the location of the electron around the nucleus. I'm saying that you can't predict the location of the electrons. The structure of the electron around the nucleus is determined by the elements that come before it in the periodic table. If you know the charge of a new element, you know how many electrons it will have, which you can then use to predict the electronic structure. I know the charge, so I know the number of electrons. But I don't know where they're going to go. If you know the charge of a new element, you know how many electrons it will have, which you can then use to predict the electronic structure. But you don't know where they're going to go. I know how many electrons it's going to have, which you can then use to predict the electronic structure. If
