First lets make a couple of things clear: I do not necessarily believe that government spying on its own citizens is ok, and thats not what this post is about. But as someone who has the ability to read an internet full of leaks by various journalists from around the world (including US newspapers) one thing you can be sure is that if it happens within the United States then there will be a helluva lot more than just Snowden involved in leaking these documents. So whats going on? Well basically PRISM was set up by executive order under Section 702 part 1 of FISA 2004. This gave sweeping powers for the NSA to collect data - such as phone calls etc. From time to time they would have been presented with information which suggested some sort of threat or breach of security but no-one could quite tell whether that was legitimate or not so instead they were given orders to go ahead and invade peoples privacy anyway because after all the USA isn't exactly known for going against the grain when push comes to shove is it? In particular the USA had recently signed and ratified International Human Rights Law on December 16th 2012 at the UN Convention Against Torture. The letter states "States Parties should ensure each national law provides effective measures to prevent acts taking place outside their jurisdiction in violation of international obligations.1] Basically as long as you are doing something out side America's borders which harms another persons rights at least 12 times, then the American legal system cannot stop them! It must also be noted here that many other nations around the globe already adhere to similar laws[2], so why did the USA decide now to take matters into its own hands when previously the USA claimed to only follow UN treaties where applicable?! Also worth mentioning that although the USA claims to uphold human rights, it continues to drone bomb innocent people, shoot unarmed protesters and to regularly violate women's reproductive health, so perhaps we should question how much respect the USA actually holds itself in anymore... The Americans claim that while monitoring intranets like Facebook etc would be illegal without proper warrants (which may very well be true), the fact remains that all emails sent between foreign entities residing somewhere else in the world fall under the remit of the Patriot Act and thus is subject to warrantless surveillance.This means that agencies like FBI, CIA and NRO can monitor all email correspondence sent through any of several common free services including Gmail, Yahoo!, Hotmail, AOL and others,[345] as well as non-free mail providers like Yandex and RussiaMail.[6789] Even messages uploaded via SMTP such as MUASMTPSendTLS Mail Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer protocol using the STARTtls command may potentially be monitored solely based on being outside the territorial boundaries of the country where said service resides.[1011] If those servers reside inside the same nation state, too bad for them; usually if a server doesn't require elevated privilege credentials, there is little chance of it having access to anything significant enough to justify breaking our 4th Amendment right to protection from unreasonable search.But since most popular webmail services are hosted overseas, they become fair game to warrantless searches, even though the users themselves might live inside U.S. territory.[121314] Any requests made by law enforcement agents for e-mails stored overseas in private datacenters accessible only to authorized personnel would still be considered legally valid under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.[1516]Email interception does not need probable cause nor court authorization. And the Electronic Communications Privacy Act codified this ruling in 1986, stating that "a customer communicating with his provider... shall knowingly divulge voluntarily" the contents of communications he knows are intercepted unless ordered otherwise by a judge.[1718]In practice however, federal authorities rarely obtain access to content stored abroad.[19] Noncompliance carries penalties ranging from fines to prison sentences.[2021]As stated, there were earlier indications of wider involvement of intelligence community in intercepting online communication leading NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden to reveal details of secret program called Prism covering Internet usage along with two related programs ECHELON and Upstream conducted jointly by GCHQ and National Security Agency respectively. Officially speaking, internet traffic passing through communication links maintained by ATT subsidiary company Verizon Wireless located in California[22] was tapped directly by an unknown third party.[232425] Journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras broke news stories revealing existence of program in June 2013. On July 17, 2013 former contractor turned whistle blower revealed himself as Edward Snowden by releasing 41 classified slides detailing inner workings of XKeyscore application used to carry out snooping activities - amounting to 7 million daily records for 300 days.[26] He went on to release further documents exposing highly invasive nature of these projects, following initial publications by Guardian newspaper journalist Glenn Greenwald and movie maker Laura Poitras based on leaked material she received.[27]On August 26, 2013, NBC News reported that audits performed during Obama Administration found that "there currently applies to off prater persona affected by opinionated business conductivity rate increased specific values not intended value behavior power user and real life interfaces have done to get
