If movies and video games are subject to regulation and censorship, then books should be too. In many places, especially in western cultures, the censorship of books is looked down upon as it's seen as a violation of the right to free speech and expression. While there are some instances where books might be challenged or banned for various reasons, many people believe that individuals should be allowed to read and access any book they choose. However, it's important to note that there are different standards for different mediums. For example, movies and video games have guidelines and ratings in place, so that parents and individuals can be informed about the content before making a decision to watch or play. This isn't the case with books, which don't have a universal rating system that can be used to inform readers about the content. Ultimately, while there may be some valid reasons to censor or restrict access to certain books, most people believe that individuals should have the right to choose what they read and that censorship should be kept to a minimum.
