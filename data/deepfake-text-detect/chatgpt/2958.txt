I realize the OP is a bit vague, so let me clarify. Similar to false advertising, I believe that people who release lies (in a publishable, marketable format). This includes both those who lie in public and also those who lie behind closed doors where their falsehoods can be kept private for years on end. Those who tell the truth have no reason or incentive to do it Why?
