Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of being on my own I finally decided to get vaccinated. I had my first vaccine last week and I can honestly say that I regret it. After reading through numerous "pro" and "con" articles, I decided to get the flu shot and the Tdap. I am now contemplating what to do next. If I get the tetanus shot, will I still have to have the booster in 5 years? Should I just not get any more vaccines because they are all pretty much a crap shoot? Should I get the hep b vaccine? I would be curious to know how much more protection that one actually provides. I will have to get the MMR if I am exposed to measles, mumps, or rubella. I just got a full MMR shot years ago and I am still contemplating getting it again. I need to get my rabies booster soon. I will be attending a college with a large foreign student population. I am curious to know if I should get the meningitis vaccine. I am a sophomore at a private college in the midwest. I have never had any vaccines until last week. Since I am in college, I am living in a dorm. I have never been exposed to any of the diseases listed above. Should I still get vaccinated for them? Jonny - My parents don't think vaccines are necessary and have been very vocal in their opposition to them. I have been doing my own research on this topic and have been very curious about it. It seems that no matter what side of the fence you stand on, there are plenty of pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine arguments. I have a lot of questions and I was hoping someone could answer them. I am also curious to know if there are any more vaccines I should get. I am 19 years old and will be attending college in the fall. What vaccines should I get if I am going to be exposed to a lot of people? Should I get my tetanus shot every 10 years or is there a booster shot I should get instead?

I am also curious about the hepatitis b vaccine and whether or not it is necessary. I would also like to know if there are any other vaccines I should get.
