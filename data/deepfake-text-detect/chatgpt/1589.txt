I like Bernie, love his politics in fact. I doubt there is a politician I agree more with. I like the fact that, unlike most politicians, his rhetoric matches his actual stance on many issues (especially foreign policy). But he's single-handedly responsible for starting several war crimes and helping to push the world into full-scale nuclear annihilation... What are you talking about? He hasn't started any wars! He would never do such a thing! s
