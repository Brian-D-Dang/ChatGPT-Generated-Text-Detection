While it is true that false rape accusations can occur, the vast majority of sexual assaults go unreported and survivors face immense barriers in seeking justice. Discouraging consensual sexual activity due to the fear of false accusations further stigmatizes survivors and perpetuates rape culture. It is important to prioritize communication and consent in all sexual encounters to ensure that both parties feel respected and empowered. False accusations should not be taken lightly, but they should not be used as an excuse to avoid engaging in healthy sexual relationships.
