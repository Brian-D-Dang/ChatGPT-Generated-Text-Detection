The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, and what it's made up of (all matter), however this is still not knowing for sure. The question remains - if there was a beginning of time and space and all other things, then where does "now" come from? Considerations: a) If we assume that the whole thing started at once, there would be no way of telling which point-in-time corresponds to now, because forever ago everything could have been happening simultaneously. For example, you like watching TV right now, but however far back your timeline goes, before TV existed on earth, every second happened simultaneously with another moment in time, so perhaps your "timeline" spans an infinite amount of moments. b) Even if we assume some sort of special relativity thing where events happen relative to eachother instead of absolute times; again, consider where our own little currentmoment comes from. We are aware of certain facts about ourselves events that have happened to us as humans, however this has only occurred within the past few seconds or minutes depending on your definition of yourself (if you think of your bodybrain as a computer program running on hardware). But can you really say whether or not those same human experiences just took place 30 years ago or 100 billion lightyears away? I'm inclined to believe they just didn't take place anywhere outside of my brain. And even though most scientists do model their work assuming something called recursion, which means that currently existing systems may continue into their future states after they become extinct; thus making our present timelines finite. That is why many physicists use a different definition of the word'simultaneous' than the one above. This article explains more about this matter here. Note though, even if these theories weren't true, there must always exist some timeless entity that spatially separates any two points such that they cannot be said to occur simultaneously. c) The fact doesn't change much. Maybe the entire history of Earth starts at the Big Bang event, and all previous entities were generated by that single moment. So maybe our existence somehow went through billions of eons until the big bang finally created us. However, this logic also fails since nothing actually changes between that first instant and today except for labels describing things. It seems to me logical therefore to call that first instance of something whatever label we wish to give it, for the sake of convenience and simplicity. Consequently, the notion of "the beginning" becomes extremely unclear unless its based solely on the concept of labeling things.
