Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from recreational) and I have noticed a trend of parents becoming overly invested in their child's performance and development in sports. This often leads to parents putting immense pressure on their child, creating an unhealthy relationship between the child and the sport, and ultimately causing burnout or feelings of failure for the child. Additionally, some parents may become aggressive towards other parents, coaches or officials in the pursuit of their child's success. While it is important for parents to support their children and encourage them to excel in sports, it is equally important for parents to recognize that their child's performance does not define their worth and that the child should be allowed to enjoy the sport without feeling overwhelmed or afraid of disappointing their parents. In my opinion, the focus should be on the child's enjoyment and personal growth rather than solely on winning and success. It is also important for parents to model good sportsmanship and respect towards others involved in the sport community. What are your thoughts on this topic? Do you agree or disagree with my perspective?
