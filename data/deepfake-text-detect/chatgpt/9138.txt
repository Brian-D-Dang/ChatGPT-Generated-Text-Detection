WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in real life are pretty cool, but sometimes a little bit too far away from me to be able to relate to their experiences... No worries though, I try to avoid reading disturbing things like this on purpose... keep it under my radar if you ever want to talk about anything!
