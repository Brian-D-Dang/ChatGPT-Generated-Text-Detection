In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they do not want to is considered a form of sexual assault. This is why it is important that we recognize and respect the right of people to make their own decisions about when and with whom they have sex. This means that everyone involved in any sexual activity must give their full and enthusiastic consent before engaging in any kind of sexual contact. It also means that if someone changes their mind at any point during a sexual encounter, the other person must stop immediately. We must all work towards creating a culture where everyone's boundaries are respected and individuals can feel safe and comfortable expressing their sexuality.
