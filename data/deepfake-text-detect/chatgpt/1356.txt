I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to let everyone live as they wish without any judgment on their choices." In fact, he emphasized in an interview with the New York Times: "I don't believe there's a choice here. If you think about trans kids who are born male, are forced into men's bathrooms at school - those aren't trans issues."

The state requires transgender students (and also other children) use restrooms corresponding to the sex listed on their birth certificate when attending public schools. This means children cannot change genders while using these facilities because they would risk being arrested under the law if even suspected of performing a sexual act in them. A copycat bill was introduced earlier this year but failed to make it out of committee before it expired last month. That didn't stop other lawmakers from introducing identical legislation next session.
