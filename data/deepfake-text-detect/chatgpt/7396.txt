While it may seem that way now, it is important to recognize that our feelings and circumstances can change over time. To say that you are "meant" to be alone assumes that your current situation is forever predetermined, which is not necessarily true. Additionally, humans are social beings and thrive on connection and relationships with others. It is possible that by opening yourself up to new experiences and connections, you may find that you are not meant to be alone after all.
