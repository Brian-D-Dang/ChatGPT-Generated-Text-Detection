I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry -black-people jokes. I am not offended by those jokes because they are funny in and of themselves and because they make me laugh. Gay relationships do nothing for me.
