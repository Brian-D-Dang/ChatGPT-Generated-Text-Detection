Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but some opinions are better than others [edit: I am referring to them being morallyethically "better. If you submitted a topic to this sub with an argument based on what is good or bad for the child then you would be rightfully faced by those of us who disagree]. I'm sorry that your parents were so ignorant and uncaring that they left you at home alone while they went out drinking...but if they hadn't done so there wouldn't have been any 'crime'. And yes it was unforgivable (and criminal) even though no one did anything wrong. But in today's world where we're told over and over again how children need more protection from themselves as well as adults....it really isn't surprising anymore when these things happen. But here's the thing about my dad - he had guidelines and boundaries against him like most men do. He knew not to leave me in his car during cold weather. He knew not to drink and drive because he'd get into trouble at work. He didn't go outside very often, but when he did you could usually find him actually playing with me since he liked kids. As far as leaving me unattended in the house...letting me sleep here without supervision? That was just plain dangerous! It wasn't something most people worried too much about with babies back then because accidents weren't common. A baby sleeping alone doesn't sound all that crazy now does it? So yeah, it takes two hands to clap and there are rules around that. What should only take one hand is making sure someone watches our children until they can walk. So please don't tell me to let my kid play unsupervised because she'll never hurt herself. She might, but maybe she won't. Maybe her mom will watch her so she doesn't fall down a flight of stairs or eat Oreos off of the floor instead of eating off of a table. Or maybe the parent decides that letting her stay up late watching tv after 10pm every night isn't such a great idea either. Its hard to say-sometimes its just the parents job to keep track of everything and sometimes its just our responsibility to make sure our kids have safety nets behind them. And by the way, I love my daughter and want nothing more than for her life to be safe and happy..just like everyone else. The fact that my husband and I also feel the same way makes me wonder whether anyone really knows what they're talking about by saying that I'm trying to skirt the law andor avoid the consequences of infanticide. The article says: "the risk of an abortion is significantly higher for women under 30 years old" yet the first line of the study states "most abortions occur between 20 and 24 weeks gestation, and almost half occur before 12 weeks gestational age; few occur later than 32 weeks." This implies that most non-therapeutic abortions occru after 22 weeks. However, the second sentence in the abstract reads "women younger than 25...had increased risks compared to older women." Which suggests that youngest woman may have experienced induction earlier than 22 week olds. Also, ths esame author published a paper on teenage pregnancy reporting similar results based on time of conception. Here sisis an example: A lot of confusion over what women actually doing what exactly. When does it become illegal to kill a preborn? Is it 20 weeks or 13 6? How far along must a baby be before killing becomes murder? I know many folks think abortion should be legal throughout pregnancy regardless of circumstance, but to sit by idly while your own mother goes through labor pain giving birth, having already killed hundreds upon thousands of human beings, seems unconscionable. People seem confused on the term 'feticide' vs 'infanticide.' Feticide means harming an unborn fetus intentionally, whereas infanticide means purposefully causing death or injury to a newborn infant. They mean different things. One causes harm, and the other kills. Thanks for reading. MamaPieceYou misinterpreted Dr. Tiller's statement. There is clear evidence that fetuses can feel pain, which includes often experiencing severe prenatal trauma. Prior to 20 weeks developmentally, fetal tissue cannot move away from blows or pressure caused by external stimuli. Development has progressed sufficiently that damage caused postnatally would cause serious physical effects including cerebral palsy (1), seizure disorders, brain bleeding, blindness, mental retardation (2). In addition, prior to 23 weeks gestationally, pulmonary maturity occurs resulting in lung function that allows oxygen transfer across the blood-placenta barrier. Damage to the developing lungs probably leads to respiratory distress syndrome (3), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (4), hypoxic injury to neural tissues leading to neurological deficits (5). These considerations demonstrate significant potential liability associated with maternal power plan QE 1012. It is merely "Which looks Goodness' dutts. end; thus prodigious.. The 'tata Anal
