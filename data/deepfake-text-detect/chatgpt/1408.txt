It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be rehabilitated and reintroduced to the wild. I am well aware of this compromise position (which seems a bit too lenient) and don't know what else to do with my life.
