So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal , which the American government has stated that it would be in retaliation for any use of nuclear weapons on United States soil by North Korea (which there are very few ways to do), then they will regret ever doing so once China or Russia decide to join in at full force due to America's lack of response after using 100 of its military might against them first. This could lead into World War 3 as well because those countries may feel obligated to help out too since we invaded Iraq just two weeks ago... 2) What if Trump does nothing but bluff his way through negotiations? He said he won't talk unless NK denuclearizes completely under Obama's terms- - and now suddenly wants talks according to an article from last night Why should Kim Jong Un trust him when he can see how fast everything changed in less than one week time? Also what guarantee do you give for keeping all agreements made between both parties? How much evidence did Reagan provide before launching Cruise Missiles during The Cold war with Soviet Union? That whole thing ended up being exploited later on down the line right? So why wouldn't something like that happen again? But most importantly even IF US strikes nuke sites, where else in world goes around looking for underground water supply tanks only used for making bombs?? You think our technology isn't advanced enough yet to look elsewhere besides these specific locations?! Maybe those sites aren't really important! My point exactly.. If anything happens, UN inspectors come afterwards and find out more information while thinking "why didn't anyone tell us?" And also question "what other places were missed?." Afterall Seoul alone is home to almost 25 million people!!! Imagine millions dying within minutes of missiles raining from above without warning!! Something tells me South Koreans don't want to live anymore anyway considering suicide rates amongst young adults are soaring high nowadays compared to rest of Asia. It doesn't matter whether Americans win or lose either way cause the loss of life lost is going to far outweigh whatever outcome comes... Too many variables involved to predict outcomes accurately. For example lets say hypothetically USA managed to strike vital targets successfully leading towards toppling current state leadership of N Korean regime; who replaces it? Does DPRK becomes democratic country overnight? No chance lol.. Its just another puppet state similar to Vietnam Cuba today. Only difference is maybe higher population count wise. Will public accept new leader (s)? Probably not imo.. Ultimately no hope left for humanity: (.. Superpowers truly have destroyed themselves over centuries trying to dominate eachother...
