Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). That said the reason that I joined rukpolitics is because I'm an idiot with nothing better to do than read Reddit. I enjoy discussing current events and international affairs so figured why not join up here too? I enjoy discussing current events and foreign affairs so figured why not join up here too? This is exactly it. Well put
