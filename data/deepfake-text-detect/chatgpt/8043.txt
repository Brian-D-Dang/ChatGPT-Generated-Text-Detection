When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether you're speeding because someone made your car go faster than its top end was designed for (and "gave" to) by design; whether this is done as part and parcel with responsible financial management in respectful recognition that driving can be fun but not at other people's expense - if there are bad guys willing en masse enough ready-made ways around any kind cost saving measure introduced then their attempts will always render these ineffective regardless how well intentioned those introducing them might have been: If I may offer an analogy from my life so far about all types such issues being faced today under our current system represented hereabouts... erm......... If some government policy makers were able advise me which team should win each football match based solely upon who has more players playing better individually when both teams consist largely only giga millionaires former footballers now earning 5 figure bonuses per week while working full time employment elsewhere notwithstanding however much money either club ownermanager spends outlaying millions purchasing world class stars capable winning 10 matches every year without concedding goals against successfully swatting away anything like even half (!1!) his opponents' shots twice knocking himself off balance still overturn doing acrobatic back flips up into mid air landing perfectly upright uninjured despite having spent last summer selling everything he owned including literally going bankrupt just before running rings round everyone else during England World Cup Championship tournament final yet spending next season lying almost permanently injured flatly refusing after nearly dying once again due making blatant bogus injury claims rejected unanimously though employing ex Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger first denying him entry until forced otherwise finally admitting allowing allowed access!...... Wouldn't take advice very seriously no matter whom offering especially given nothing changes whatsoever affecting results adversely anyway!!!!!!!
