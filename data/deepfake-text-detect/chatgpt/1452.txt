To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, there is no way to restrict a state's right to define what constitutes an "appropriate age of consent" without violating the First Amendment rights of adults engaged in consensual sexual behavior between two consenting individuals who share the same gender as themselves or their spouse. By definition, then, if we were really committed to protecting children from pedophilia we could only allow heterosexual marriages among those 18 years old or older (which happens already). We can never outlaw it for anyone under 18 because they will always be protected by 'reasonable laws' written prior to their birth. What do you think gay couples should be allowed to marry? Do you feel this applies to all states across America where homosexual couples can live together but cannot legally wed until they are 21 years old? Just curious about your opinion on this subject.
