A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that country (or at least one of these two). By secondary languages, I include all other world's languages and those who deviate from them and use a pidgin form for intercommunication within their community - be it ethnic group, race, religion, class or nationality. The expression "mother tongue" is used to refer only to an individual's firstprimary language; this includes its dialect (s), variations and even more generally any variant of every primary language ever known to man. I know some are not happy with me using the term "pidgin," but remember I wrote about pidgeon-English in the 19th century as well! "And if you call upon God His Name in vain He will manifest Himself unto thee." Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said we should never assume things about our Creator because it has always been proven wrong throughout history. Theologian Karl Barth once suggested that creation ex nihilo (out of nothingness) would imply divine evil intention on the part of God, given how Barthelaths' understanding of creation worked...let alone the fact that no such thing can exist. In short, Barth's conception of creation implies disintegration, which goes against the entire idea behind his own theology. So, barring that particular formulation of Barth's views (which doesn't accurately represent him anyway), apparently according to Barth there isn't evil intent involved here so much as ineptitude. Even though (obviously) incompetence does involve evil intent, mind you, since someone must have done something bad enough to get everyone here into existence. It also stands to reason that Barth himself did good stuff too, otherwise why bother being created? Why don't just let us slip quietly away forever? From whence came Barth's sense of moral self worth then and now?:) My copy of Harry Potter 7 says July 2003 instead of 2011. Whether that means anything I am unsure. But thanks for pointing out that book date discrepancy it probably didn't matter much in context anyway seeing as they were already working on Book 7 before they finished the previous book in 2000.:P Or perhaps another explanation could be offered: maybe she got bored writing YA fantasy novels after having written several nonfiction books previously and decided to try her hand at something else altogether. She wanted to break free creatively for awhile. Who knows. Of course this is unlikely.
