Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked, and keep the chef's head. It was broadcast in Australia from 2011-2018 before being cancelled after three seasons for its low viewing figures. In 2012 it made an appearance during The Great British Bake Off series 4 episode 3 when contestant Ben Jones successfully impresses one of his past bakers by mimicking her voice whilst in character as Miss Marple. Cutthroat Kitchen has also been featured several times in Australian television shows such as Underbelly: Razor (2011), Fat Albert Co., Myths amp; Legends (2015) and Reclaiming History (2014). Gameplay Two teams are put into competition. Each team receives seven ingredients and must cook a main course meal within 30 minutes while under attack. At any time, two chefs can start "cutting." A cut is similar to an opportunity but lasts longer than 15 seconds. While cutting they receive 5 per second until either side has all four cuts or both sides have stopped attacking each other. If only one side stops attacking then the cooks with more cuts wins the round. Cuts may involve making multiple dishes not just one. In some games there were no restrictions so you could do anything your heart desired. Either side has five means to win. They can get rid of whoever is winning the most money, tell the judges that is what they will serve up hence eliminating the winning chef, give themselves immunity from getting eliminated no matter how much food gets sent down the conveyor belt or pull out all their tactics including performing illegal activities against others like putting someone else's raw meat directly onto the fire or using poison such as rubbing alcohol etc.. The game ends once six cuts are achieved by either side. Once this happens all remaining cuts cease and whichever side loses fewer points wins. However if the losing side still holds 0 points then the first-place winning team earns 10 bonus cash which goes towards their next challenge. Ties always go to the side who won the last match. For example, Team 1 had beaten Team 2 4 - 4, so they would score 58. This went to tiebreakers because Team 1 had scored less than 20. In order to avoid ties, all tied matches will use sudden death rules with one additional rule - one extra ten percent added to a winner's final total. So even though Team 2 had lost to Team 1 earlier, instead of scoring 1 point over 7 points as normal, they would now earn 81018, pushing them ahead of Team 1. Finally, if neither chef earned enough points to finish, then the host or guest judge determine the outcome via random selection. The same applies for special challenges played in tandem with regular rounds. These include a timed elimination round (last person standing wins); double eliminations; reexamining previously cooked courses; or category changes. All these variations follow the standard rules set forth above except that the food never makes it to serving plates. Instead, judges eat everything right off the pan and throw half away. Judges' scores are tallied separately. Any cooked items that remain uneaten become part of the banked prize fund for later contests. After the end credits roll, a form is posted online showing individual players' starting lineups. Depending on the number of successful chefs involved in a given season, the top grossers of the year can qualify for bonuses ranging between thousands of dollars and full sponsorship contracts. Commercial packages include meals served around Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane featuring the winning dishes. There is some overlap between venues due to similarities in value and presentation. Competitions usually award one grand prize package consisting of two trips overseas - sometimes domestic flights coupled with accommodation included, valued anywhere from US15,000 to 25,000 depending upon location. One extended alternate plan includes international travel, accommodation and visas paid for solely by the sponsor, the winner collecting nothing. In addition to prizes, the highest finishers of many competitions can claim bragging rights as being crowned king or queen of the gridlock. Regardless of performance, almost every contest awards discerning viewers with free home cooking lessons courtesy of our sponsors. To date, the show has produced some extraordinary outcomes. Season 1 contestant Sarah Jackson became Queen of Queens when she eliminated all of her opponents in regular, sudden death and wildcard match ups without allowing herself to lose a single game. Contestants earning runner-up status have similarly employed various methods to have their way in subsequent episodes, often leveraging their success to achieve higher finishes in future matches. Other notable participants include chef Amanda Leckie, whose top placing propelled her into the finals, despite having already secured 50,000 in funding prior to competing.
