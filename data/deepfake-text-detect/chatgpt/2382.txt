I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites for certain metrics (e.g., number of users) or analyze them using algorithms like k-means clustering. Since programming is not exactly something that requires an advanced degree from MIT, the fact that these basic tasks are interesting surprised me quite a lot! My new understanding has been: "you can do so many awesome things with computers!" It's just amazing how much you can automate when given enough time and compute resources;) The other aspect which changed this perception even further was giving up on trying to argue people out of their beliefsopinions regarding ML - there seems no point anymore since most peoples' opinion about ML boils down to one simple statement: "ML does not work better than humans" - i.e., they have very little knowledge of what actually makes ML successful at all. This realization alone made me realize how ignorant we all still are around AI research fields...: (As someone who considers himself mostly self taught I must say that Haskell played its part here as well; being able to learn more concepts without getting distracted by syntax issues helped immensely over the years:) So did books such as Elements of Programming Languages [1] which introduced functional programming principles early on and without too much syntactical sugar. Another important book would be Learning How To Learn[2], but only if you don't already know a bit about neuroplasticity;P If anyone finds any mistakes please let me know because there were lots while writing this post.. EDIT: formatting etc.
