A potential counter-argument to this opinion is that while it may be true that people's weight is ultimately their own personal business, it can also have a significant impact on society as a whole. Obesity rates have been increasing over the past few decades, leading to a rise in healthcare costs and negative consequences for public health. Additionally, people's weight can also affect their ability to perform certain jobs or participate in certain activities, which can have implications for employers and organizations. For example, if someone's weight has become an obstacle to their ability to complete their job duties, it may be necessary for a conversation or intervention to occur. While weight can be a sensitive topic, it is important to acknowledge that it can have wider implications than just being a personal matter. Therefore, it may be appropriate and necessary to address weight concerns, in a respectful and supportive manner.
