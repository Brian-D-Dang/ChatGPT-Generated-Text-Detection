I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, man is either an angel or devil, God loves us but He also hates us for we're sinners. The problem I have here with DD is that to be evil means you kill people which conflicts with what Christ wanted us all to do: love each other even if they don't deserve anything from us. This doesn't mean killing others is wrong; it just means that being kind and doing good deeds is more important than any one person. In fact, according to Scripture, if someone does something nice for you, they will receive ten-fold (Matthews 6:33). That being said... Being evil should never happen because humans are made better by living together as brothers and sisters under God instead of fighting against each other (Romans 13). However, sometimes, these 'evil' creatures need to be dealt with before they cause too much trouble. This isn't always easy since many of them can mimic normal characteristics very well. For example, demons could look exactly like anyone else unless you see their true nature - they have no conscience at all when compared to angels who do feel remorse (Luke 10:18) and would rather die themselves than hurt another creature. But still, there must come a certain point where some "lesser beings" cannot endure anymore and they become harmful. They know right off the bat that when harm comes to them, they won't get out alive and that makes them dangerous. What they lack is compassion towards human beings, especially children; therefore, most likely, they were born into sinfulness andor Luciferianism once upon a time (1 John 3:10), which means that those parents really didn't care and weren't willing to raise their child properly. As long as he has destroyed his mind on wickedness and immodesty, he will always live for pleasure and greed. Humans should understand how their minds work and try to change them (see Romans 12 James 1); they could learn to read and write easily enough and then study about the Bible, including its history. And yes, Satan knows every single little detail about us! So basically, our knowledge base needs to grow exponentially if we want to stay safe and happy. And as far as playing Dungeons Dragons goes, sure it's fun, but ultimately, DnD has nothing to do with Jesus Christ and His Holy Word, except maybe to give us the power to fight evildoers? If your pal was ever raised up and took part in such activities without knowing that this wasn't Godly behavior, then it might seem cool to him now. Afterall, he already believes he's "special" and above angels and men. To tell him otherwise could force him to admit that he did indeed make mistakes while growing up...and that's certainly not going to go down well with him. It'd probably put him back to square one and cause further damage to whatever foundation he may have built up. Of course, none of us wants to hear that sort of thing, but unfortunately, real life seldom follows game plots. I suggest ridding yourself completely of this fantasy idea if you really want to remain pure and innocent. Just my opinion though, after 30 years in Christianity.:) Firstly, let me begin by saying that I am definitely NOT a Christian nor am I trying to convert anybody to believing in Him. My purpose in writing this post is merely to express my thoughts regarding DD games. Nowadays, the word 'Bible' still carries quite strong connotations among Christians due to its association with religion: specifically monotheistic religions led mainly by Abrahamic traditions (i.e., Judaism, Islam, and Christianity). Consequently, many modern people often view faith in terms of belief systems and beliefs alone, not necessarily through the lens of the Gospel. However, biblical interpretation involves both application and understanding. Thus, although following the clear instruction given by God in His Word, believers must at times apply Scripture creatively, i.e., drawing inspiration from its teachings beyond literal interpretations. When DD games involve magic items and spells, players rely heavily on divine intervention to achieve success since without God's help, the outcome is pretty unpredictable. Therefore, I believe it is reasonable to infer that DD games tend to introduce concepts similar to Mysticism in order to account for the supernatural occurrences taking place. From the perspective of Biblical Studies, mysticism attempts to put oneself in touch with spiritual forces outside of the realm of human perception, whereas occultists attempt to invoke powers within the area of hidden magics. Both forms defy reason and thus add superstition to the equation. Once again, using the principle of analogy based on similarities suggested by scriptural passages allows for open minded approaches towards exploring topics related to magical mystification hidden behind the veil of religious dogma embedded in the Bible. Hence, I consider DD games as instruments to measure tolerance to an extent of freedom to do and weather sense for adopting their last two finally over three quasi-measuremen
