While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes I understand your point, but it's worth noting that many people of different backgrounds and political affiliations have been drawn to Bernie Sanders' message as a politician. It's also important to consider what specific qualities you think are necessary for a president, and if there may be other candidates who possess those qualities. Ultimately, the decision on who to support in the election is up to the individual voter.
