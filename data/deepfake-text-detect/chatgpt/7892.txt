While it is understandable that some individuals may feel like their life lacks purpose or meaning, it is important to recognize that this is a subjective experience and not a universal truth. Moreover, it is important to recognize that committing suicide is not a solution to the existential crisis and personal struggles one may be going through. Instead of giving up on life altogether, individuals can seek meaning and purpose in their lives by exploring their passions, developing meaningful relationships, helping others, and engaging in activities that give them a sense of fulfillment. Seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor can also be beneficial in working through these challenges and finding a renewed sense of purpose. Furthermore, suicide does not only affect the person taking their own life, but it also impacts their loved ones and the community around them. Suicide prevention and support resources are available to help individuals in crisis and prevent the tragic loss of life.
