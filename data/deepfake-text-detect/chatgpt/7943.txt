A counter-argument to refute the opinion that you should never drink Pepsi, especially the one in your fridge, could be that drinking Pepsi in moderate amounts is not harmful to your health. While excessive consumption of sugary drinks can lead to various health problems like obesity and diabetes, having a can of Pepsi once in a while as a treat or refreshment is unlikely to cause any significant harm. Additionally, the Pepsi in your fridge may be fresh and therefore safe to drink, as long as it hasn't expired. Therefore, avoiding Pepsi altogether may be an unnecessary restriction on your choices and enjoyment.
