This boggles my mind. I know that some airlines are different like Southwest because they do not have assigned seats. But why don't people relax until their seating zonegroup is called? I think the second group should get on the plane first because they have been waiting so long. I'm not sure if you could tell by the picture but this was after almost 5 hours of waiting. I've been on flights where people have moved seats and they've been more than 10 seats down. It's ridiculous. I'm not sure if the flight attendant said it was the second group getting on the plane first, but I don't think that is what the second group wants. I would have been freaking out at the airline's customer service desk if this had happened to me.
