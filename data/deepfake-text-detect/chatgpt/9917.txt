Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news x] , [x] after delivering a speech in which she said that "for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear." The speech, which was delivered during a recent visit to the historically black college, Tougaloo College, sparked a nationwide conversation about race and racism in America. Clinton's remarks were well-received by many, but critics argued that her words were too little too late, given her past record on criminal justice reform. Some took issue with her suggestion that "we must recognize our privilege" and argued that it was not enough to simply acknowledge privilege without taking action. Others praised Clinton for speaking out against implicit bias and noted that it is important to have conversations about racism.
