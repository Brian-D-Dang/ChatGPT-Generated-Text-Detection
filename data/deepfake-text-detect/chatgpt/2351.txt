There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, while others say they don't work at all. In fact, there is no consensus among economists about which policies have an impact on The main goal for most people in government should be jobs creation because it improves living standards by raising incomes and reducing unemployment. That means promoting economic development through infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges; investing in education from pre-kindergarten programs to vocational training so more Americans gain skills needed for today's workforce (after high school graduation only 50 of students enrolling in college complete their degree); encouraging exports of goods and services with less reliance on imports, particularly when we buy foreign products where American workers could produce them here instead using our own resources; providing incentives for entrepreneurs who create new businesses and job opportunities; improving access to health care and other basic needs like housing and transportation; and lowering costs associated with these necessities by reforming outdated regulations rather than giving money directly back to individuals via increased income taxes since this gives little incentive for higher wages or working harder. For example: People need cars and trucks if they want to get and keep good paying jobs - not just minimum wage service sector positions-and some might argue whether we really need four million semi-trucks driving across our nation's highways but everyone would agree that public safety requires safe vehicles owned by responsible drivers - that cost over 3,000 per vehicle each year according to one expert analysis -over 150 times what many truckers earn annually. Yet due largely to anti-business regulation imposed under former President Obama, small truck operators find themselves unable to afford those types of expensive trucks even though demand continues to grow every day creating shortages throughout the supply chain forcing companies into bankruptcy despite growing sales. This situation was worsened last month after Congress failed badly yet again - despite numerous attempts during his presidencyto repeal Obamacare making changes necessary before any meaningful healthcare reform takes place. With fewer providers available doctors refuse to accept insurance plans preferring cash payments leaving patients without a choice between possible life saving treatments or going bankrupt trying to pay out of pocket expenses. Then too prescription drug prices continue skyrocketing costing families thousands of dollars extra every time they fill a script regardless how much coverage may help narrow the gap between what Medicare pays versus private insurers reimbursements. So far none of these issues were addressed seriously until recently thanks mostly to Trump taking charge and initiating serious reforms along with action taken earlier by previous Republican Presidents Reagan and Bush 43. The problem now facing Republicans is getting enough votes in both houses including Democrats willing to support bipartisan legislation given past failures involving bailing banks out years ago rather than letting them go bust waiting for the market to clear up. Another challenge includes finding agreement within party lines especially regarding immigration policy. But I suspect once legal measures are put forth concerning DACA recipients then hopefully compromise will become easier. Finally business leaders must realize that China has been manipulating its currency to promote unfair trade practices that harm U.S. manufacturers causing millions of lost manufacturing jobs affecting middle class citizens and exporting hundreds of billions of dollars worth of wealth overseas. Likewise whatever success Putin had meddling in election process doesn't seem adequate reason why he acted unless you believe Russia hacked voting machines changing results thus putting Hillary Clinton in office against her campaign promises motivating him somehow to attempt another breach next year? We never know except perhaps Vladimir wanted Donald J.Trump elected president believing something nice couldn't happen on his watch possibly leading to war threatening his continued rule hence why Russian intelligence allegedly helped fund Wikileaks knowing full well Julian Assange would release emails damaging to Hilary's candidacy increasing Trumps chances winning key swing states thereby becoming America's 45th president? Just kidding! Telling jokes helps me relax...
