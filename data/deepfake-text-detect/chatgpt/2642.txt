This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this was a poorly written article with little information and few details of the study itself. I agree it is somewhat thin on content. But if you read between the lines there are many interesting points raised that were not mentioned directly (for example they discuss how working parents have more time for their children because less time spent commuting and getting ready for work).
