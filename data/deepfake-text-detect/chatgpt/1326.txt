I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it It's the oldest profession"; "we should have full rights to our bodies don't you think" etc are valid, there is something else I find compelling and also very sad: Birth control (male or female) has become legal in Canada since 2000 but still remains expensive at approx 300-400 per month with no insurance coverage; even less accessible if your income comes from working multiple jobs as is common among many young adult Canadians today despite the ever increasing minimum wage. These cost can turn women off completely which means they either pay out of pocket for their own contraception regardless of not being able to afford those pillstampons that will keep them safe from unwanted pregnancies OR decide abortion is the only option left when all other options fail forcing girls into risky situations like unsafe abortions often resulting in death due to complications. Both these things happen frequently enough where people need an alternative option than relying on government mandated birth control. The above mentioned argument used by so called pro-lifers against CIHRA doesn't wash because 1.) Many of us who do work and struggle just barely make ends meet paying bills every month so surely we shouldn't be gettin' more handouts? 2.) If abortion becomes illegal then what happens to the estimated 50 of Canadian women who actually end up getting pregnant anyway...surely some are going to choose pregnancy over sterilization right?? 3.) Where does this leave women who already experience sexual violence including rape? How exactly does that help anyone?! 4.) Women talk about wanting kids after college yet how exactly would having free access to contraceptives improve life prospects especially college students...? 5.) What about places with extremely restrictive laws such as Saudi Arabia where women aren't allowed to drive let alone go to school??? 6.) So basically everything stated here proves why CIHRA (or any form of Plan B) makes perfect sense! So instead of arguing about a plan we COULD implement without infringing upon others freedoms what really needs to change first is society itself!!
