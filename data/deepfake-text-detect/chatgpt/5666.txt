I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. I don't believe that the government should pay for students to attend college, but I do believe that the government should pay for the students who can't afford to attend college. The only way to solve this problem is to get rid of the stupid laws that have made it so easy for colleges to raise tuition. Students need to stop paying high tuition. The government needs to stop paying high tuition. Every college needs to switch to a free market system. Tuition needs to be low enough that a student doesn't need to borrow money to pay for it. Instead, they need to be able to work and pay for it. Free market education could work just like it does for textbooks. Students pay for their textbooks, but they can then rent them to other students, which means that the cost for the books can be kept low for the student. Students could even rent their textbooks to other students in the same class. It's not uncommon for professors to give out the same books for the class, so students could share those books as well. In return for keeping tuition low, students will be forced to work more. However, if the cost of college is reasonable, people will still be able to afford to attend college, and they'll be able to pay for it with their own money. This will be better for everyone. Students won't be forced to borrow money for their education. That means that they won't be in debt for the rest of their lives. The government won't have to pay for students to attend college, which means that they won't have to take money away from other people to pay for college. Even the colleges and universities won't have to borrow money to pay for their employees, which means that they'll be able to pay them a decent wage and stay in business. One thing is for sure, the government isn't going to solve this problem. If anything, they're going to make it worse. And if you think that they're going to make college free, you're sadly mistaken. That would mean that the government would have to pay for it, and that's never going to happen. The only way to solve this problem is to remove the government from college. They need to stop paying for students to attend college. Instead, students need to pay for their own education. That way, they'll be forced to pay attention in class and actually learn something, or they'll be stuck paying for tuition without a degree. As a bonus, the cost of tuition would be kept low because students could work for money. The government won't have to pay for the education of every student, which means that they won't have to borrow money to pay for it, which means that they won't have to take money away from other people to pay for it. If this ever happens, the rising national debt would be brought under control, which means that the government could stop borrowing money from China. That would mean that the national debt will actually start to go down. Even though I was never able to attend college, I believe that it's important for people to have a good education. I also believe that everyone should have access to education, even if they aren't rich. That's why I'm calling for free market education. Students need to work and pay for their own education.

Instead, it came out on Saturday. Here are the four things that I really liked about the episode. The thing that I liked most about this episode was the part where Lyndon ended up going to a bar with an old friend. That's a great idea. I liked the part where the bar was called The Flying Dutchman. I'm not sure what the significance of that is, but it's pretty cool. I also liked the part where Lyndon's friend tried to sell him a hat with a monkey on it. I'm not sure what
