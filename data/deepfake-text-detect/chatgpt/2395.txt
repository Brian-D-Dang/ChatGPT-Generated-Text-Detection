Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move onto other things and forget. This however still affects those who are left behind in terms of their own recovery from what has happenend to them as a result of witnessing such atrocities, with some suffering post traumatic stress disorder or depressionanxiety which can be devastating for families. I am hoping by bringing this campaign into schools we may raise awareness and encourage the next generation not only think but act. By signing up you will receive information and updates via email regarding our work at SAWA and also regular invitations to presentations and events where students get to hear directly from survivors who share testimonials to try and break down barriers around taboos surrounding mental health issues; helping young people understand they should never suffer alone.
