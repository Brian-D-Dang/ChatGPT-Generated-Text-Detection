"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into an advanced technological society we need to ensure there is no risk of us destroying ourselves. If you're not careful with your technology then it could turn against you. It's important for people to know what our potential future as a species might look like and where we may go wrong. This book is one example of a process of thought that I believe has led some brilliant minds in philosophy and science to consider such questions. The following quotes come from my personal favourites among those who have considered these issues: 1) "No problem can be solved by adding more information unless the initial data already contains all relevant facts." (Lawrence Krauss). 2) 'The path to utopia runs through chaos.' (Hannah Arendt) 3) 'We should regard artificial intelligence as humanity's biggest existential threat' (Ray Kurzweil 4) 'Technology tends to change human behaviour in ways that increase social inequality'. (Edward Dutton Nicholas Wade 5) 'I am optimistic about mankind's ability to live together peacefully because I see much evidence of cooperation in nature. But on the other hand there is also plenty of hostility expressed towards others and even toward fellow members of one's own species. Lee Smolin 6) To fight Auschwitz, resistance would require the Germans to become better than themselves. That requires them losing their evil side. And that means becoming less sinister and destructive.-Gareth Matthews 7) "Anyone who doesn't think suicide bombers pose threats to humanity mustn't watch any television news programs or read anything published after September 11th 2001. Bodies exploding at airports, cars blowing up in crowded cities etc., we've seen all that before. Now let me ask you something; when was the last time someone blew himself up while being interviewed by TV reporters?" - Douglas Adams 8) One does not understand history without understanding how deeply rooted viciousness is in the mindheart of man. What makes men do wicked things to each other and destroy whole civilizations - once again, especially cultures which differ from theirs - is best understood through Darwinian principles rather than altruism concepts and moralizing notions of right vs. wrong. Mankind's Dr Jekyll succeeds only under certain circumstances. Unfortunately, along with the positive aspects comes cruelty and savagery... Think about the Middle East conflict for example; the most warlike area on Earth today is still largely populated by women, children, homosexuals, Kurds, Muslims, Russian soldiers, Jews, Christians and communists, yet many Westerners lack sympathy to these unfortunate groups because they don't recognize them as victims instead of hateful villains... They just want peace and love. Once again, it's good old common sense applied to political realities, not morality and ethics. 9) Life as we know it cannot exist anywhere else in cosmos apart from Earth, so even if another planet did contain life forms exactly alike ours, we couldn't communicate with them anymore than ants could talk to whales. 10) No matter how far away space travel takes us in terms of distance, it seems inevitable that any interstellar civilization would eventually evolve its equivalent of religion whether alien beings were willing to learn how to practice it or not. Religion is simply too crucial a part of human psychology to allow its disappearance throughout the universe forever. 11) We shouldn't worry about buying fewer products and consuming less energy, or going extinct during next hundred years of progress, since the biosphere itself will undoubtedly continue evolving so long as new technologies spread across the world. Changes in lifestyle will always happen naturally and spontaneously, regardless of how we try to control everything around us. 12) Computational thinking is revolutionising entire fields of knowledge including biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics and economics 13) Asimov said that AI is not just about computers playing chess, but that this miniature model reflects some fundamental problems affecting human existence. Although he had no idea what form this ultimate question of life actually took, the fact remains that he wrote extensively about various applications of AI, paving the way for thousands of computer scientists to follow his lead. 14) Many people fear the idea of super intelligent machines judging every aspect of our lives, deciding the value of goods and services, determining economic growth, initiating wars, fighting diseases, controlling population numbers and promoting disarmament. These kind of scenarios often terrify economists because they imagine massive unemployment, poverty and hunger in countries whose economies depend very heavily upon automation. However, what really worries everyone is the prospect that computers - or autonomous robots - could take over jobs previously carried out solely by human workers. 15) "One day it occurred to him that machine translation was perhaps not quite as difficult as he'd imagined. He didn't mean that it wouldn't seem fiendishly clever, getting the meaning of sentences correct almost automatically, but that it wasn't nearly as exacting as decoding DNA or protein sequences. Perhaps this was because when translating between two languages, unlike breaking down into cellars, the inevitable outcome is mayhem even eenvenvelmeeting the words no longer true.16) It should make novene disposal rate per part to
