Written hastily, but hopefully I can clarify any mistakes in comments, here we go: The Confederacy was racist according to the cornerstone speech and secession papers (tx): [Cornerstone Speech] excerpt ed here[1]. The Confederacy harboring slave owners who were not racist. I'm sorry, but this is not black separatist propaganda - it's an historical fact that slaves were looted from their homes by white supremacists, and a stated goal of a long history. So who made the statement "not racist"? It wasn't racist to justify slavery? Yes. And these are just some examples of globalists holding up some sort of hypocrisy as justification for slavery...
