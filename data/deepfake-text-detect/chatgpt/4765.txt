So, I saw a commercial today about a pill that helps with BED, and I did a bit of quick research on it. From what little research I did, it seems to be an appetite suppressant kind of thing - the same way they use phentermine for cravings? I guess if you're going into surgery tomorrow or something like that, then maybe take one last big hit before you leave your house (think "knee jerk" effect) but otherwise... not sure that would work as well, actually. Thoughts anyone? And is this some sort of legal steroid? Because there are no such things available in Canada yet because we have a stupid drug control system where they just remove all substances from our stores without ever testing them first (because nobody wants their drugs tested). We can't even get real steroids like trenbolone through the mail for free anymore!:
