After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific sense. I think this is because the idea of determinism has been so ingrained into our everyday lives, such for example when we're driving down an empty road late at night there's no doubt about what direction you'll turn if someone walks out on one side or another (unless something comes up like police lights). So naturally most would say "I could have gone either way! It was all determined by chance." Unfortunately these kinds ideas are often combined with religious views which can only complicate matters even further through confusion between sciencemathematics vs religion etc... The thing i'm struggling over isn;t whether they do actually create machines capable showing how 'free' your actions may be - but rather why? If quantum mechanics showed us anything certain then surely its not just more humans being forced towards believing whatever theory fits their own beliefs?! The reason behind my question stems from seeing religions around me generally tend toward atheistic arguments ebcause almost everyone who believes shares them too therefore making themselves sound unique compared than others whose belief system makes less logical reasoning possible... Not sure where im going here huh?:) Any help appreciated!! Also sorry should mention, Im English fairly new due learning languages mainly via school plus internet sources. Thanks again!
