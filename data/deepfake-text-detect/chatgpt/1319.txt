Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as homemade and you certainly can tell if it was made "on-the-hoof." When choosing which place has better pizza (or any other food item), think about what matters most to you: taste, price or convenience? If I'm eating at home with my kids, then cost definitely wins over both of those factors because we eat leftovers for lunch all week long anyway. But when dining out, where that money goes depends on your preference - do you want something convenient but mediocre tasting like Dominos' thin crust pizza (7) or something more adventurous but higher priced such as Papa John's specialty pepperoni pizzas (911)? In looking for local restaurants serving high quality foods in Port St Lucians, here are some options that offer fresh ingredients, reasonable prices AND great values based on a wide variety of criteria.
