I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say "entertainment," but I think it's more than just that. Most works of self-expression (books) are made for entertainment purposes only; they aren't written with any sort praisable or moral quality in mind at allthey're simply put out there so the reader can feel a certain emotion while reading them pleasure" perhaps). But not every book has some kind message behind its existence...like even those books you read when studying philosophy will never tell me something useful like how life really worked things back then as opposed now etc., which would be much better if true.. If anything though this blog might help people appreciate literary valuequality enough by exposing ideas via author thoughts expressed rather well through their words on paper [not speaking from experience:D]..And also give others an idea where else such writings exist other places online apart form physical libraries....
