As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this obesity epidemic. The American Medical Association (AMA) is one of those organizations that has been vocal about their support for taxing soda, junk food, and high calorie drinks like Mountain Dew. In a letter published on April 16th, 2013 which was signed by their President James L. Madara MD, Dr. Madara wrote: "Healthy eating habits start at home with parents" but noted that it also takes strong action from our nation's government officials who need to make healthy choices when it comes to funding programs aimed at dealing with increasing rates of childhood obesity. He further pointed out the dangers of children being exposed to advertisements advocating unhealthy products such as candy bars and sugary beverages. But despite Dr. Madaras claims - there is no scientific evidence linking advertising or marketing junk food to obesity. In fact, most studies show that exposure to certain types of media can be beneficial to developing healthy eating patterns all through life. There is a growing body of research that indicates that media portrayal of vegetables and fruits may actually help keep kids away from less nutritious options. A study conducted by researchers at Children's Hospital in 2009 found that children aged eight-to 12 years old were willing to eat broccoli after seeing an animated character named Dashiell repeatedly put down hot dogs during a TV commercial. Researchers noted that pro-vegetables messages did not increase children's overall vegetable consumption over time, but rather increased their desire to try new varieties of veggies. Another study released by University College London last year also concluded that showing young girls pictures of thin women had a positive impact on how fat they wanted to become later in life. As reported by WebMD, the study followed 1,000 British adolescents and interviewed them monthly for three months about both negative and positive images related to weight loss strategies. They found that females perceived lower levels of pressure to lose weight if they saw thin models compared to heavier models or morbidly obese adults; adolescent boys thought thinner people looked better than heavy ones. Fatness was an idealized attribute for female teens whereas male teens preferred slender physiques. This may come as a surprise to many health advocates but a lot of us should really consider ourselves lucky we don't live in Mexico where even small packages of chips and cookies are taxed up to 40. According to Coca Cola, taxes ranging between 15 and 20 could result in 62 million fewer cans sold each month. This would translate into a loss of 180 million USD per year. And according to Bloomberg News, companies paying higher taxes aren't just cutting back on packages sizes either - they are shifting production to other countries like China. The soda industry will tell you it isn't the industry's fault Mexican consumers simply love sodas. But these findings suggest pressures differ widely around the globe...and that some nations might feel ill effects sooner than others due to cultural differences in consumption habits."
