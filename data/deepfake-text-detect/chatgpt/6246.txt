I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our Financial Crunchers are doing mill-work to gather the money to fund their cult.) In the political arena, I always thought that there should be a minimum wage for everyone. I am a minimalist, and I can see that right in the middle of the budget. However, I have always argued that a higher minimum wage is the only way to achieve a higher minimum wage. I believe that for most Americans, the minimum wage is due to their economic status, but for many people, it is a matter of income tax, income taxes, and an education tax. I am not of the opinion that this tax has anything to do with our economic status, but it does. As a retiree in the 1980s, I was a member of the Republican Party, in a small way, and I remember the White House offering me some of the most expensive housing in the country. I know it sounds like a thoughtful gesture, but I think it depends on how you think about it. I have a very liberal friend and I have a very conservative political opinion, which I think is very unfortunate. He would be proud and if you are not a progressive, you would not be able to support a higher minimum wage.
