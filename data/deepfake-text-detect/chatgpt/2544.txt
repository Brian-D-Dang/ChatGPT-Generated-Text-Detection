before you guys bombard me with downvotes I would simply like to point out that I am not saying this is true. I am just expressing my conditional views that could be in conflict with the truth I'm sorry, but when people use "conditional" as a way of backing up their statements it makes them sound incredibly ignorant and uneducated. It doesn't matter if something can be backed by evidence or even make sense; if your statement hinges on one single thing being truefalse then there's no reason for anyone to take what you're saying seriously at all.
