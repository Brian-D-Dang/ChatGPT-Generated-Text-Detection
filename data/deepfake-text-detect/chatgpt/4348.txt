I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was shocked to see that the film, despite being based on real people, is NOT factual at all. It's fictional in every way. You're not alone. This movie made me want to learn how to code but i think im learning more of an appreciation for the talent behind this piece than anything else.
