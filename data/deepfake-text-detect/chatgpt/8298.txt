Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and since it's happening to females in this situation as well there has got be some validity behind the idea which stops me from seeing how you judge males for being raped by women (even though technically they are). That said; your post was very good overall but had one major flaw: The fact remains - having someone forcefully penetrate another person without their consent IS RAPE no matter what title or pronouns we use when describing those who commit such acts against others - whether its "he" versus an individual womangirl whose age makes her seem more like she rather than he does not change anything about reality except maybe making people feel less uncomfortable reading things written on TV news websites where only statistics get used instead text boxes probably because political correctness will make them lose money if everyone knew why certain word selections were made...? All other points aside my main issue here would also apply towards any type victims including children....and yes even animals left uncared too.. (but i guess thats always going back into natural selection) so long story short despite most posters seeming socially unethical behaviour toward these girls im still gonna support survivors all around ive been through hell before losing everything then coming out better off after years spent alone away form anyone important at time...so go suckle ur mumma.....or do u prefer breast milk....lol
