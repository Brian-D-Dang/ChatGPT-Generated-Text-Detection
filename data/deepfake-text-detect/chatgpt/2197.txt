So, it's obvious to anyone who took a math class that the average number of sex partners between straight men and straight women must be the same. However, the median is less clear cut since there are more single people than married ones in this country (about 50 vs 30). The fact they asked only one question out of two about sexual behavior suggests their sampling method was not great either; I would have provided both questions as part of my response if given the opportunity instead of just "straight or gay?"
