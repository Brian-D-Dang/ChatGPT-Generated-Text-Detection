A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off. [Watch the launch video to understand how it works] Echo is a voice controlled speaker that answers questions and plays music. It's available in white or black, with four different volume levels. The screen displays information such as news and weather updates on-screen, and you can ask for recipes, shopping lists from Alexa and more. Unlike Siri and Cortana, which are Apple's mobile virtual assistants, there really isn't an equivalent Alexa OS for Android, as far as I know. So, when Amazon released Alexa earlier this year, many people were excited about the idea of using her instead of their phone. However, it still lacks truly useful features like playing audiobooks aloud or giving me the option to turn on the lights without pulling my phones out of my pockets. But now, Amazon is increasing its angle - it just announced plans to bring Alexa to desktop computers. That means that what we saw today could easily become reality. And not even two years after Alexa hit the market, it might already start acting as a third operating system, and thus, a competitor to iOS and Windows 9. Over time, these new abilities could lead to another race between the app stores and streaming services. The smart home will continue evolving over time, so if you're interested in making your life better, it would make sense to get involved early. In addition to all the tech companies looking at ways to give us more control over our devices, this is also one area where you'll likely see your friends switching into the same line of work.
