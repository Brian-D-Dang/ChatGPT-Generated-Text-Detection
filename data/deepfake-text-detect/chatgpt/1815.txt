GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job yet so no skates? 2. The weather here isnt that great for skating right now it's been almost all rainsnow this week but its supposed to start warming up out of the cold soon! But just because i'm not living by this rule doesn't mean im going home every day at 5pm or anything:). One thing you might want to do though if your having trouble finding something in your area; If they are doing youth hockey leagues or AAU teams try contacting them ask what team their using and where there training center located, Their usually really good about giving info on how much cost per player etc...
