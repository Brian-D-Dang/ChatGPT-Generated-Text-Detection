This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point about being "on vacation" was intended to allude more broadly than just sexually active people in relationships - it's obviously possiblelikely there will be situations where someone has sex with another person and doesn't want any of those other things but still wants some commitment from them (not necessarily marriage). Vacation would imply not wanting commitments either though... The only reason one may wish to get away more often without committing could very well relate back to why they wouldn't commit after having had casual sex
