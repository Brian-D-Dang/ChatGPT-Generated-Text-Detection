I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with you, they should be able to say "Forks aren't a blight upon society." And you should be able to say, "You're a moron." And I should be able to say, "Forks aren't a blight upon society" as well. As for forums that are in direct competition to each other, I see no problem with having them both coexist. If there is one that you like better, go there, and if there is one that you like less, go there. However, if one forum doesn't like the idea of the other forum, they shouldn't waste time attacking it. They should just ignore it, because if they don't, it's like a man telling a woman that she's ugly and won't get a man, and then wondering why she tells him to shut up and go away.

I also know that I was a flaming idiot back then. I think that it's a bad thing to look down on people just because they may have a different point of view. I also think that it's a bad thing to make someone feel like they are not welcome just because they may have a different point of view. If I recall correctly, I was banned from FWR for stating a few opinions that I felt were valid. I also remember feeling like I had been raped. I don't think that that was the intent of the ban or of the moderators. But that is how I felt. So you tell me, is that a good thing for a forum to do? I think it is not. I think that FWR needs to change that policy. I have been banned from a few forums for expressing my opinions on things. I have been accused of being a flaming idiot more than once. I also know that some people just can't let go. I am not a regular on the Gamer's Tavern anymore. But if you were to ask me if I would be welcome there, I would say yes. I have met some really great people there, and I am not going to let the banning incident ruin that. So, what I am trying to say is that I think that FWR is a good place, and that they should be welcoming of new people. It is a shame that people have been banned for what they believe. It is a shame that people have been banned for what they feel. It is a shame that people have been banned for what they think. It is also a shame that people have been banned for what they say. To me, being able to express yourself is important. I have been on forums where people have been banned for expressing themselves. I have also been on forums where people have been banned for not expressing themselves. I don't think that you should tell someone that they cannot express their opinion on a forum. I think that you should tell someone that they are not welcome on a forum if they are flaming and if they are spamming. I don't know about you guys, but I like to be able to express myself. I am not trying to step on anyone's toes here. I am just expressing my opinion. I am trying to do so in a respectful manner. Please try to do the same. Sorry if I have offended anyone. No, you haven't offended me. I was just saying that, in my opinion, some of the people who were banned from the Gamer's Tavern for "flaming" and "spamming" were expressing their opinions. Some of the people who were banned from FWR were expressing their opinions. They were expressing themselves. I am not saying that they should have been banned. I am saying that maybe some of the people who were banned should not have been banned. I am not saying that any of the people who were banned were right, I am just saying that maybe the banning was not right. What I am trying to say is that maybe FWR should rethink their ban policy, and not ban people for what they say. I am
