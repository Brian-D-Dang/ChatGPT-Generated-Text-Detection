I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any chance they can't leave because of radicalization, freedom and democracy are not enough other than being an illusionary goal, the only way things could get better. The question is whether the only option for freedom will lead to freedom itself though. Freedom comes with responsibility; self determination alone isn't free - but freedom doesn't exist without responsibility....or perhaps freedom exists just as much if not more so as much as we believe in self determination within ourselves...
