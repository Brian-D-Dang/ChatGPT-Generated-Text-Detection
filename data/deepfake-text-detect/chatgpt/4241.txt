We have a responsibility to prevent massacres or civil wars in foreign countries because we are one of the only ones who can. We are one of the only ones and all other countries, including Europe, remain committed to the fight against terrorism in order for them not to become international terrorists. The political structure must be reformed - it has served its purpose! The British people will never vote Tory again; they were generally speaking better than Labour but under Cameron's leadership the Conservatives lost their credibility as an alternative military option to Obama. Their Brexit strategy was flawed from start to finish: Britain did not leave the EU with any sort of deal. They tried to force the issue by ignoring Parliament but you cannot do that when Parliament does not consent to your plans. It is now clear that neither side really wants this process to happen and it would take a miracle (a national referendum) to resolve the issues involved, so I expect a general election at some point during 2017. The Prime Minister clearly had no mandate to bring in these changes and he lacks the power to implement them himself anyway. He seems intent on undermining his own Government so he gets panicked and goes looking for a Commission president who is more willing to compromise with him. This is almost certainly a fool's errand given the fact that the President would have to approve of any amendments made before they could go through parliament and even then it remains unclear whether the Conservative Party's MPs would allow such a change to occur without their consent. No way, sir. There simply isn't enough time left in the year. Meanwhile we continue our current campaign against Mrs May and her government. It is about time she was delivered on, especially after Parliament rejected her proposed "Chequers" plan. Sir Ivan Rogers' report into police procedures in 2016 shows another area where the Tories need to improve: the deployment of the armed forces abroad. Police should serve local communities within the UK and in foreign places the armed services should act as law enforcement, protecting their host nations rather than turning a blind eye to crimes and abuse that would otherwise go unpunished. If we are serious about fighting terrorism we cannot turn our backs on the security agencies whose job it is to keep us safe in foreign lands. We also need to examine the veterans' benefits system which keeps veterans out of work during difficult times despite experiencing great benefit from the war itself. It is also important that the Army takes steps to address the problem caused by the appalling state of decommissioned tanks which many soldiers still find themselves driving around empty. I know that I personally have been affected by this situation myself and there needs to be proper consideration put forward for those servicemen and women still missing in action. To me, nothing is more important than having fire officers patrolling the streets to protect vulnerable groups like young children. I am pleased that the Chief Constable of Kent has pledged to review the use of armed forces overseas over concerns raised by Armed Forces Veterans, particularly regarding UK Troops being deployed as riot control support for protesters in Hong Kong. But is this too little too late? Shouldn't the pension age be reduced to 60 years old if only to provide sufficient funds for those unable to afford it? Is this a good investment? I attended the House of Lords last Wednesday evening to hear the speech given by Lord Barbour concerning the role of social media in public life. Social media is a massive part of modern society and yet until recently few of us had considered how much of a impact it might have on politics. Lord Barbour believes that Facebook and Twitter have changed the nature of things completely. "My generation [the 1980s1990s] didn't live to see the first EU elections," he told Parliament. "They felt it was going to be the same old chums, the old colleagues." Now, he said, "we've got UKIP voters, we've got the SNP voters, we've got everybody else." I agree: my generation may not have witnessed the rise of UKIP, the SNP and Labour, but we did witness the rise of the Lib Dems and the Greens in 2015. My generation has also seen the growth of online news organisations such as Breitbart and Infowars which have allowed others to reach out to audiences previously excluded from mainstream journalism. More importantly though, we have seen the emergence of new types of candidates and parties who harness the promise of social media. Of course, we don't entirely agree with everything that politicians say on Facebook and Twitter but the change hasn't come nearly fast enough and I think we are already witnessing the beginnings of a major shift in public opinion away from traditional parties towards democratic alternatives based on free market economics and personal freedom. This is why I believe that the Conservative party has a real opportunity to reconnect with the younger generations and regain their trust, just as Thatcher managed to do following Tony Blair's election victory in 1997. Thatcher brought hope to millions of Britons and she gained a lot of popularity among working class voters. She rose above the barriers created by the Thatcherite ideology, breaking down stereotypes and negotiating compromises between different levels of city region.
