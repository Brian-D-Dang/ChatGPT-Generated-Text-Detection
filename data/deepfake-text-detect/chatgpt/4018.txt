This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in Captain America: Civil War] (URL0). The question is whether it's possible to represent someone who has undergone some sort of change and not be immediately recognizable as a black person (i.e., an Afro or afros). I'm thinking of images like [this one] (URL1) where they took a photo of a white guy and made him look ridiculously dark. This is a great example because even though the person isn't super clear on what happened - most likely he was suffering from cancer - his complexion becomes so unrecognizable after being irradiated, which means that people will think that even if he wasn't aware that a cadaverous man, he might still know that he looks different than before. Is there any similar kind of transformation taking place when you irradiate yourself?
