Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 7th century. The first Muslims were known as muhajirun emigrants and came from outside Arabia into the region after the fall of Mecca (to the Turks) sometime between 624CE and 625 CE under the leadership of Muhammad who was born about 680 CE (AD). During this time he had established many communities called "Muslim" or the Arabic word for one Muslim is mu'miniin which means believer. A community of believers becomes a mosque. With the growth of Islam across Africa, Asia and Europe there are now more than 1 billion people practicing Islam worldwide today. The Qur'an contains 114 chapters divided up by subject matter; its also written in an easy language with simple words and short sentences so it can easily been understood by all types of readers. There are no vows like Christianity or Judaism but rather principles upon which you live your life such as honesty, justice, helping others etc.. Many muslims believe Jesus Christ, son of Mary, lived on earth around AD 33-36 or 70 years before Muhammad died in AD 610. However some Christians do not agree with these beliefs because they say Muhammad copied his teachings off of another man named Issa (or Isa), supposedly a prophet sent out by God thousands of year's earlier. Islamic education begins at age 6 when children are taught how to read their own faith book -the Koran then through memorization or listening to lectures given during class time in schools and mosques throughout the world. By age 12 most boys have learned enough about Islam to join the Friday prayers where men meet together to pray five times each week including Friday night -known as Jumah prayer. After studying the Koran long enough young adult boys begin learning how to recite verses aloud by heart while women learn basic instructions such as washing hands and feet, performing ablution (wudu) prior to praying, wearing certain clothing, greeting other females, etc. There are two main forms of worship practiced within Islam: waqf is found among the Sunni Muslims and zakat among the Shia ones. Waqf is money usually donated towards building projects in mosques, homes for poor etc., while Zakaat is a 2.5 tax Muslims are required to pay towards charity once per month in addition to waqfa. Zakat pays for welfare programs like hospitals, orphanages and widowsorphans.Zakat doesn't just benefit those in need however, if used properly it will foster excellent economic development and increase prosperity!
