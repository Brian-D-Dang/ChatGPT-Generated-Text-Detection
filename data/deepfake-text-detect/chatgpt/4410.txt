If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is very useful if you want to get around the world as a business person and use their respective languages to communicate with people on different continents (and even within the same continent). Mandarin Chinese: The Top Language for Business People Worldwide? [2012] I know it sounds weird but seriously why wouldn't you want to be able to speak some of these languages when travelling abroad? It will give your career prospects a huge boost too! China has been growing rapidly since its reformist government was established back in 1978. This has led to a massive increase in tourism and international trade - particularly between China and other countries such as Japan and South Korea. In fact there are now more than 200 million Chinese living overseas, compared with just 22 million in 1980. Even though over half of them live in the US alone, many others reside throughout Europe, North America and Australasia. So by learning another foreign language besides English - i.e., Mandarin Chinese- what could make more sense? There are so many reasons to choose this particular type of tongue; here are some of my top picks below: 1) More Than Half of the World Speak Mandarin Let me start off with something extremely obvious first - if you want to travel worldwide and work at anywhere beyond your own home town, I can promise you that you absolutely need to know how to converse in Mandarin. By far the most spoken language across Asia today, being used in business environments is incredibly common nowadays due to both companies outsourcing manufacturing to places like China and also because so much exports from developing nations actually go through China before reaching Western markets. If you don't know how to talk to people who aren't native speakers of English andor those who already understand limited amounts of English well enough to get confused with simple words, then you certainly won't stand out from the crowd. And if you really want to break into the global market place then having mastered Mandarin makes good sense. 2) You Can Learn Lots of Different Languages Through This One Lingua Franca This doesn't necessarily mean that you'll only ever feel comfortable speaking to folks with whom Mandarin is their primary language either. As mentioned above, Mandarin based communities exist all over the globe which means no matter where you settle down there will always be lots of Chinese citizens living nearby whose main language isn't English or French anyway. These folks might not speak perfect English themselves but they may nevertheless find it easy to pick up bits and pieces of the 'foreigner's' English thanks to whatever TV programmes they watch together after dinner time. What this means is that once you master basic phrases and vocabulary you might end up conversing fluently in multiple tongues without needing to waste time studying additional ones on a regular basis. That way you're likely to save loads of money while picking up a new skill along the way instead. Although I suppose one downside would be a lack of ability to attempt to woo the local ladies... 3) Being Able To Talk Well Will Be Really Useful For Travelling Around Asia Too Firstly let me state right away that teaching yourself Hanzi characters using Rosetta Stone software couldn't possibly replace real life practice of being immersed in everyday situations while doing everything from ordering food, shopping for supplies and securing accommodation for short stays, etc. But knowing dozens upon dozens of individual Hanzi syllables when needed is still hugely beneficial regardless. A lot of tourists in major cities simply communicate via hand signals until things escalate further. This works fine unless you've decided to pay someone else to do your grocery shop for you. Thus speaking several distinct types of Hanzi efficiently comes in handy especially during longer trips such as train journeys or bus rides involving numerous stops. Additionally, understanding how to order and clarify general concepts in written form properly will definitely come in handy. Many hotels and hostels often include printed menus available on request and they'll usually provide you with detailed instructions about anything regarding payment methods. Learning how things run in the Far East on paper is not nearly as useful as reading it in action and trying to figure stuff out yourself in the field. 4) It Is Easy Affordable As long as you keep costs low enough when considering lessons plus bookings and transportation, it should never cost too much to study this language. When comparing prices against various schools and teachers, Rosetta Stone tends to offer the best bargains overall. Plus it takes less than 3 months to become fluent after signing up for classes online within minutes. Once again, it depends whether you plan to spend hours sitting inside classrooms every day, take part in extra sessions outside school hours or maybe try attending group seminars with classmates who are studying remotely too.
