I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most people's biggest complaint. 2) It can be expensive to keep up with the trends and buy high-end products. 3) It can be damaging to skin if not used properly or taken off correctly. On the other hand, there are some positive aspects of makeup. 1) It can be an easy way to express yourself and boost confidence. 2) It can enhance features that you love and help even out skin tone. 3) It can be a fun form of experimentation and creativity. 4) It can be a great way to explore different looks and experiment with fashion. 5) Used correctly, it can protect your skin from environmental damage.
