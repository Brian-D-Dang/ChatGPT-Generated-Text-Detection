I am a 23 year old male Indian American male. I have never held hands with a girl, been kissed, or obviously had sex. I have never even asked someone on a date. I have a number of reasons, but the main one is that I have a fear of rejection. I have a very analytical and rational brain, and I know in my head that there is nothing wrong with sex. In fact, I think it is quite normal to have sex. I am also very respectful of women and I know that I would never do anything that would cause any harm to anyone. The only women I have ever dated are women I met on dating websites. These women are in my age group, educated, and professional. All the women I have met have some level of interest, but they never end up being serious relationships. The one girl I was close to broke up with me because she thought I was too old fashioned. I love to learn about the arts, literature, music, and history. I want to marry a woman that is as smart as I am and wants a loving, caring, and respectful husband. I am willing to wait until marriage for sex. I am writing this because I am very confused and conflicted. On the one hand, I am very attracted to women and I think they are beautiful. I am attracted to certain features of the female body, but not every feature. I have a hard time convincing myself that I would never like to have sex with any woman. I know that is not true. I have the same feelings for women that I have for food, and I would never want to live without it. On the other hand, I know I would be a horrible lover. I would never know how to please a woman sexually. I would be afraid to touch her. I would have no idea what to do. I have never seen two people having sex. I know that is not normal. I know that women are turned on by different things than men, and I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do at all. I'm afraid I would be so awkward that women would run screaming. I'm afraid I would be so unattractive that women would never give me a second look. My first thought is to have sex with a woman who is not very attractive. I have never seen her naked, but she has to be attractive enough to not make me feel embarrassed. I have to be able to see her attractive qualities and not feel self-conscious. If I can have sex with an unattractive woman, then maybe I can have sex with an attractive woman. The other option is that I should just go find some sex toys. I don't think I would be that good at using a sex toy though. There is a third option, but I'm not ready to talk about it yet. I would like some help. I would like to hear what everyone has to say. I would like to hear some stories. Is there anyone out there that has never had sex that has had sex with a woman? Did you feel embarrassed? Did you feel like you were a good lover? I would like to hear your opinions on this. I want to know what you think.
