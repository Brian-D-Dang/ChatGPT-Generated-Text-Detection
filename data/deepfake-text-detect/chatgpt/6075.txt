America has accomplished nothing in its history that makes it worth of such widespread pride and love by its people (particularly this time of the year). Every event that Americans point to and say "Look what we did" has had very negative consequences. Namely, the 13 colonies were founded on the principle that people should be free to choose which laws they want to follow, and should not be forced to follow any laws they don't want to. In other words, people should be allowed to live their lives as they see fit, as long as it doesn't hurt others. These colonies, in their early days, were founded on the idea that everyone should have equal rights. Blacks and whites should have the same rights, no matter who they were or where they came from. America, in its early days, was built on the idea that everyone should have the right to worship however they pleased. That being said, people who were of a different faith, or who didn't believe in any religion at all, should also be allowed to do that. America was founded on the idea that a person should be able to run for political office as long as he was a citizen of the country. America was founded on the idea that it should be illegal for the government to invade people's private lives (this idea is best exemplified by the 4th amendment). These are just a few examples of how the founding fathers of America made it clear that people should be allowed to live as they see fit, as long as they are not hurting others. When people say that America is the greatest country in the world, they are only talking about the ideals that the country was founded on. It is these ideals that made America great, and not the country itself. Any country that claims to have the same values as America, but in practice does the exact opposite, is not an example of what America is, but what it should be. America has done nothing in its history that has made it worthy of this kind of love and pride from its people. If anything, the country should be ashamed of what it has done.
