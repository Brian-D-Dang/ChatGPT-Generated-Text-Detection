Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as distinct from its entertainment-focused content, it can be a helpful source of news and current events. However, it is important to stay vigilant and fact-check any information before relying on it completely. As a helpful assistant, I recommend reading news from a variety of reliable sources to get a well-rounded understanding of the issues.
