A multitude of films have twists in the plot, for example Gone Girl, Memento, a lot of films of M. Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well , it's just endless would be pretty cool The other thing that I saw from movies is Black Panther and the big reveal trailer was when they announced that this movie would open exclusively on Black Friday and December 1st. It was the last one we had on the schedule so people were already getting excited for it to come out today lol
