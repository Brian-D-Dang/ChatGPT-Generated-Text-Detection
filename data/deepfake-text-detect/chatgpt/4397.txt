After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the issue comes before congress, pro-gun control groups get their way while guns are left alone for a few years until another act of mass murder brings it back into play again. The problem is that when people talk about this topic they don't realize how much money the NRA has poured into lobbying and legal action against gun regulation measures. This isn't just happening from some liberal think tank on an island somewhere as the majority of anti-gun legislation passes despite being backed by both parties. It's something big corporations have been funding to make sure laws aren't passed because then more people will buy products made out of cheap metals instead of quality steel from American companies who need these government mandates imposed upon them so our country can compete globally. Because our market is flooded with cheap Chinese goods we shouldn't be able to produce anything anymore because there won't be any jobs if too many regulations are placed upon us. If you want to know why China doesn't manufacture weapons or other things like ships, planes, cars than ask yourself "why didn't America build those?" The answer is simple: we stopped making all of those things once we went communist and started exporting assets overseas. That kind of thinking completely ignores the fact that freedom works best when everyone plays fair rather than having your hands tied behind your back. So what was done to stop Americans from manufacturing safe guns? What happened at NSSF (National Shooting Sports Foundation)? In the late 1990s Congress decided to cut off funds for gun safety research but not enough information came out about spyware which had already affected the industry. Instead of doing nothing Congress somehow found time to take away the only option that did work to secure firearms. Fearing the effect coming law changes would have on sales, manufacturers began mass producing metal detectors and nearly full auto rifles in response and now even though the government tried to ban such devices entire states still sell them online today. Even after a bump stock ban under Barack Obama exemptions were granted for rifles manufactured prior to 1986 but only if they weren't used during the assault weapon bans where most of these items originated. These are examples of how cutting funding created loopholes for the world's biggest publicly traded company to ship billions worth of product across international borders; even though that same policy does little to prevent future attacks like Columbine High School massacre which took place four years later. Part 3 - Government Targets People Who Use Social Media Guns Are Used More Often By Criminals Than Others Is Gun Violence A Public Health Crisis Or Not? Less than 1 Of All U.S Deaths Can Be Assigned To Firearms While For Every One Killed With A Handgun There Were 15 Murders From Bump Stocks And Assault Rifles Let's Look At Some Facts About Mass Shootings Coinciding With Attacks "The fact remains that virtually no public health crisis exists on par with guns" The first thing I see as a researcher studying issues surrounding gun use is that policing causes crime whether you're dealing with domestic violence or gang activity. When officers aren't present criminals tend to behave themselves while in tight police presence and decrease offending behavior as a result. So yeah, less cops mean fewer crimes means greater likelihood of murders with guns occurring as well as accidental shootings amongst children playing around parents' homes. Yet companies decide to keep selling guns regardless since overall criminal rate decreases. However, the media tends to ignore the facts about copycats committing crimes due to easy access to illegal means of transportation and technology allowing anyone anywhere instantaneously to become part of organized crime rings. But do we really consider ourselves safer yet? No, because with each attack there's another attempt at restricting gun ownership. Each new bill chipped away at freedoms meant to protect citizens from going to war zones or looking at porn without paying 10month per device. In reality, 2nd Amendment supporters are far outnumbered by opponents trying to restrict said amendment from limiting firearm use.

If You Watch 'Game Of Thrones', You'll Understand Second Amendment Supporters Don't Have ANYTHING Against Video Games As Long As They Aren't Violent and Facilitate Real Life Crime Such as Murder Most people associate video games with movies and novels primarily and rightfully so considering Hollywood produces content designed to seduce audiences. Alongside books that depict individuals killing others, movie trailers promise scenes straight out of Game Of Thrones. Then combine this fact along with the idea that 80 entertainment companies bankroll campaigns geared toward influencing general voters with messages promoting candidate agendas via politicians and the business model becomes clear. Companies spend millions spreading propaganda encouraging the voting masses to vote a certain way so politicians who represent businesses have influence over voter opinions. They also fund political candidates willing to run ads using taxpayer dollars so these "public servants" may stay in office long enough to continue pushing policies favorable for corporate interests arriving at specific rates like 10 plus thousand units guaranteed to burn autosensitive portions of the quarter.
