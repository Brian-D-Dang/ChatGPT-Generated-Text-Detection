One counter-argument could be that intellectual property does indeed carry real value and can be bought and sold like physical property. Patents, trademarks, and copyrights are all forms of intellectual property that businesses and individuals invest time and money into developing and protecting. Additionally, intellectual property can generate revenue for the owner through licensing agreements or royalties, which further demonstrates its economic value. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that intellectual property is only property in name only.
