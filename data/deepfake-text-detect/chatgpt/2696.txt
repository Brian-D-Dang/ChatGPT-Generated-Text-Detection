So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor culture (e.g., Black People can't be racist); but then again, they are also privileged due to the same circumstances which allows them to argue that whites are privileged when it comes to race relations? I don't get how people want to use the race card so much for everything... unless you're singling out black folks in America as being a special case by using stereotypes. Am I missing something here or...?
