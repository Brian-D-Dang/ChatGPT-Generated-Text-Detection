Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data] . In the comments, a lot of people were arguing about whether technology creates or destroys. I wanted to weigh in on that discussion but there wasn't much room so here's my comment as an answer: While some industries have experienced increased productivity by technological advances and benefited from them, other industries have lost their jobs due to those same tech advancements. The job loss resulting from automation is real, just not nearly as widespread as many think because they are unaware it even takes place. It would be nice if everything could go perfectly smoothly like Star Trek with everyone getting rich off of robot labor while having no need for human workers doing any dirty work...but sadly life doesn't always play out that way. That being said, all we can do now days is try our best to make things better for ourselves and hopefully reach harmony between man and machine before one annihilates us:P
