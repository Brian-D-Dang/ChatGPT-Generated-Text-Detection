Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to accept that people can be whatever gender they want and I won't judge them for it. I understand, and I respect your willingness to accept and respect people's gender identity. This is a very important issue, and we need more people like you who are open-minded enough to have an understanding and accepting attitude towards transgender people.
