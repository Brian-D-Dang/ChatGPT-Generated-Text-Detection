While it may seem like an individual vote may not have a significant impact on the outcome of a national election, it is important to consider the cumulative impact of all individual votes. If everyone adopted the mindset that their vote does not matter, then it would lead to low voter turnout and limit the representation of diverse ideas and perspectives in the political decision-making process. Additionally, voting is not just about choosing a candidate but also exercising one's right to participate in the democratic process and have a say in the direction of the country's future. By not voting, individuals are passively giving up their voice and right to hold their elected officials accountable. Thus, there is a practical reason for individuals to vote in national elections to ensure that their voice is heard and counted in the decision-making process that affects their lives and the lives of others in their community.
