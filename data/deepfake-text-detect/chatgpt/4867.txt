From The majority of sexual assault are not reported to the police (an average of 68 of assaults in the last five years were not reported).1 Those rapists, of course, who do attack women during their attacks. It doesn't matter whether a man assaults his partner or another person - he is still responsible for what happens and the harm that results from it. The effects on victims can be devastating; they may have physical injuries such as cuts and bruises which increase their pain levels. They may also suffer psychological trauma and anxiety about re-living their ordeal through flashbacks. As well as this, men sexually assaulted by other males tend to develop feelings of guilt which means that sometimes men begin to blame themselves for being violated. Often they feel ashamed and embarrassed at having been attacked.2 Why don't more people talk about male rape? One reason could simply be because those experiences aren't taken seriously enough, and society continues to deny them legitimacy. Another might be because we live in an age where there's something called "rape culture." This idea suggests that our society has accepted harmful ideas about how men should behave towards women - and with good reason: shame and humiliation drive many rapes underground.3 According to Rape Crisis Network UK (RCN), 4 out of 6 survivors come into contact with services less than three months after experiencing sexual violence. Research shows that up to 50 of children experience sexual abuse before 18 years old.5 Anyone could walk past someone going through this kind of suffering without suspecting anything was wrong. And some staff members couldn't think to ask any questions if they saw men crying as they left the room.6 Yet research tells us that many perpetrators continue to hurt others for life.7 We know that around 30 of all adults will suffer depression in their lifetime and 7 in 10 girls and 9 in 10 boys aged between 14 and 16 have suffered from emotional problems related to childhood sexual abuse.8 Despite this concern among so much child sex abuse, most cases go unreported either due to fear from reporting procedures9 or the belief that these types of crimes won't get investigated properly anyway10 - but statistics show otherwise!11 So let's start talking about male victimisation... What is Male Sexual Assault? Male sexual assault includes a wide range of behaviours ranging from unwanted touchingrubbing, kissing and groping12 to coercing and forcing13 - even putting your penis inside a woman you're dating when she isn't expecting it14... Historically, rape law has only protected females against violent forms of coercion like beating and forced intercourse. However, today we recognise acts causing distress or injury including masturbation, grooming and indecent exposure15 as 'non-contact offences'16.17 For example, penetration without consent has had no legal definition until recently.18 On 19 July 2018, the Criminal Law Amendment Act provided definitive new definitions of non-consensual penetrative sexual conduct involving both genders.19 From now onwards, statutory rape laws will protect males aged under 21 using force or threats to access intimate parts.20 In addition,'sexual harassment' within schools covers inappropriate comments which cause distress or threaten safety21 - regardless of gender.22 There was previously very little legislation protecting young people from bullying online,23 though social media sites now provide guidelines to users24 helping to encourage honest, respectful discussions and dialogue.25 These incidents need addressing swiftly, as does preventing repeat offending26 and stopping data collection27 to prevent further intrusion.28 So why are males often targeted? A hostile environment not only leaves men vulnerable physically29: Some studies suggest that one in four men suffers domestic violence30 Men account for over 80 per cent of murdered men31 Over half of homeless men report being abused32 More than half of men who commit suicide die following attempted murder33 40 per cent of patients admitted to hospital emergency departments are male34 Many men are reluctant to seek help35 Suicide rates amongst males peak twice as high as among females36 Eighteen per cent of adult prisoners are men37 Males are two times more likely to experience homelessness38 Half of male homicides happen exclusively in homes39 Men make up 70 per cent of workplace suicides40 But more importantly, verbal abuse can lead to mental health issues41,42 and leave men feeling extremely distressed43. Because male targets face ridicule44 based solely on their appearance45,46 or dress code47, 48 or stereotypes49 developed by mainstream outlets50,51 men are particularly susceptible to discrimination52. Most widely recognised examples include "macho" images seen in advertising53; men caricaturing women54; images on pornography websites55 such as "cute guys wearing skimpy clothes,"56 "girls love hairy dudes,"57 and "super horny girl looking for her daddy."58 Social attitudes affect behaviour59 too60,61.
