Hi guys! To expand: Although I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman for example) a woman to their face and when talking about it tell them that they are actually the mother of your unborn child. I'm sure you've heard this before but how do you deal with that? On one hand, I know not everyone will understand. But on the other hand...it's just not something you can really prepare yourself for because there are so many unknowns involved.
