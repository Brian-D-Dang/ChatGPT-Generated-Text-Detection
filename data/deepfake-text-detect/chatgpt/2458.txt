Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or any other weapon then they do not deserve my sympathy when it comes time for them to face punishment in prisonthe death penalty and should be executed without further delay. This goes double if said crime was committed against an elderly victim who could only fight back by using their last resort- a hammer! I believe that if people are willing to forcibly take something away from me to kill then they don't deserve our protection under law because we have failed as human beings.
