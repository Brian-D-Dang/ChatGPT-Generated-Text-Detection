Hello, I'm Luke and for the longest time a small dream of mine has been to move to a Scandinavian country such as Norway, Sweden, or Denmark. From what I've read, it's an amazing place with lots of culture but also tons of nature! It seems like you are pretty close by (for me) so if anyone wants some advice about life in these places let me know:) Living near there would be impossible unless one owns property for more than 1 million dollars which is highly unlikely here imo
