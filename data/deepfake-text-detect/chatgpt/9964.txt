Massive spoilers below. I just finished the book version of The Martian, which has Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut, stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves, thinking he is dead. Mark Watney survives by using his skills as a botanist and engineer to create an environment in which he can survive. He grows food, creates a water system, and finds a way to communicate with NASA back on Earth. Eventually, NASA comes up with a plan to send another mission to rescue him. The rescue mission is successful, and Mark returns to Earth safely.
