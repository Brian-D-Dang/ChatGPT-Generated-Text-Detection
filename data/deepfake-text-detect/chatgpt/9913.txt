To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting to high school, I have heard that Common Core is a set of standards that are meant to ensure that students across the United States possess the same level of knowledge and skills by the time they finish high school. This is done by having a uniform set of standards that all states must adhere to in order to guarantee that each student is receiving an equal education regardless of their geographic location. Common Core sets standards for math, reading, writing, science and social studies, ensuring that all students learn these core skills before graduating.
