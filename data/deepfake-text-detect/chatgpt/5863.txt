Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for "sleeping around," and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise. This is an interesting assertion, but it would take more than a short answer to explain it. I will have to think about it. I'm not sure why you think that. Could you explain that a little more? The way we, as a society, treat men and women, is that when a man does something, it is great, and when a woman does the same thing, it is not. I don't see how that makes what I said above a "discrepancy." It just makes the way we treat women unjust. I never said it was a discrepancy, I just said that it is not. The two examples you gave are situations where the man has more power than the woman, so that's why it's a discrepancy. The way we treat men and women is completely different. The way we treat men and women is completely different. Men and women are treated differently in most situations. I am not sure how that makes it a discrepancy. For instance, a guy can have sex with a bunch of women, and get praised for being a stud, but if a girl does the same thing, she would be called a slut. That's true. A woman in that situation would be called a slut. I believe that this is a discrepancy, because a woman who does the same thing gets called a slut. I think you are confusing discrepancy with hypocrisy. It is not a discrepancy in the way that we treat men and women, but it is in the way we view men and women. I think that is the discrepancy. Men are given more power than women, so when a woman does the same thing that a man does, people don't react the same way. I'm not sure why you think that. Could you explain that a little more? I'm not sure why you think that. Could you explain that a little more? Why do you think this is a discrepancy? Because a man and a woman both do the same thing, they are treated differently.
