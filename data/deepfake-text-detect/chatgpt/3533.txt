Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better. If that is so, what is the point of reading fiction? While reading fiction may not directly help us grow in a practical sense, it does offer other benefits. For example, reading fiction allows us to experience different perspectives and emotions that we may not encounter in our everyday lives. This can help us develop empathy and expand our understanding of the human experience. Additionally, reading fiction can also improve our cognitive skills such as critical thinking, imagination, and creativity. So while there may be other sources of information that can help us grow in specific areas, fiction offers its own unique benefits that shouldn't be dismissed.
