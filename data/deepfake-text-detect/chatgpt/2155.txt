First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. You don't really want her sitting next you because she's probably got a cold andor smells like pee or something worse. It would be nice if there were some kind rule that no one else could sit near the old lady without permission from someone nearby who didn't mind being seated so close to such a person (I know this is what they call "social norms." Whatever.). But alas, social norms wouldn't work as well as we'd hope. Basically then... You might have people wanting their seats while other people are ready for them to give up theirs but not enough people willing to go against those few others' wishes by helping out. After much heated debate maybe 5 decide it was okay afterall; 90 decided otherwise since everyone had already made plans about where to sit even before seeing how comfortable each individual seat-seeker felt with the idea once he heard his preferred spot occupied; 10 stayed neutral - neither agreeing nor disagreeing until the last minute which left nobody happy except perhaps 2. And finally 1 never agreed at all despite having been able to see both sides clearly throughout the whole ordeal. In short: almost everybody wanted somebody else to do the dirty job instead of actually stepping forward themselves. So now imagine these individuals voted en masse every time legislation affected their lives! How long does anybody think democracy can survive under conditions like these?
