This is a view I've read about from various pop psychology sources, and it has become conventional wisdom. I believe it contains some truth. Can you convince me it merely reflects cultural biases rather than something more fundamental? As far as I can tell this question takes two distinct forms: 1) Is the idea of "the self" a worthwhile concept to study? 2) Do we have any evidence that our "self" (measured by the brain's activity when isolated from others - i.e., introspection) exists in anything other than a purely subjective way? (If not, are there ways to measure whether or not an external observer could reliably distinguish between what they think is my experience of reality vs. what is actually happening?) The second form seems like asking if unicorns exist; while your description was a bit light on details, here might be an interesting discussion [for those who don't mind getting wet.] (URL0)
