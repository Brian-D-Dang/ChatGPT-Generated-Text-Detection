Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news x] , [x] after delivering a speech in which she said that "for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear." Given the huge amount of public attention that this speech generated, I decided to comment on it. I tried to find the full text of the speech on the web, but was unable to. I also tried to search the news for any criticisms or supportive arguments that Clinton might have been making, but I was unable to find any. So, as best I can, I am going to summarise what I think the speech was about. The speech began with Clinton's reflection on how she felt when she first heard the news that Trayvon Martin had been shot dead. She spoke of how the same thing happened to her when she heard about the death of her friend and former colleague, Eric Garner. She also spoke of how she feels when she hears about the death of young black men, particularly those who are not killed by the police. Clinton's next point was about the mistrust of the police that is widespread in the black community, and in the wider community. She said that people have good reason to mistrust the police, because of the numerous cases in which unarmed black people have been shot and killed by police officers. She also spoke of the racial profiling of the police. In the speech, Clinton referred to the following cases: the case of Trayvon Martin, who was shot by George Zimmerman; the case of Michael Brown, who was shot and killed by Darren Wilson; the case of Eric Garner, who was killed by New York police officers; the case of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was shot by the police, shortly after they were called by a concerned citizen who had spotted the boy playing with a toy gun; the case of Freddie Gray, who died after being arrested by Baltimore police officers. In the speech, Clinton argued that the nation's failure to solve the problem of racial inequality can be seen as a failure of white America to confront its history. She said that the failure to come to terms with this history is an inability to acknowledge what is really going on. She also said that the history of racism in the US should be considered as a part of the nation's history, and not a distant memory that is no longer relevant. In the speech, Clinton also spoke about how some people in the US still do not accept that racial prejudice and discrimination are still problems in the US. She said that these people are not listening when people of colour speak about their experiences of discrimination. She also said that these people are not listening when people of colour speak about the experiences of their friends and family members. She said that these people should listen to the stories of black people who have experienced discrimination in the US. In the speech, Clinton spoke about a number of black activists and other people who have been fighting for racial equality in the US. She spoke of how they have faced severe opposition, but have still persevered in their work. She also spoke of how people have been killed for speaking out against racial discrimination. She said that we need to acknowledge these people, and their sacrifices. In the speech, Clinton also spoke about how there are many people in the US who support racial equality. She spoke of how these people are afraid to speak out because they know that they will face backlash from people who do not support racial equality. She said that we need to support these people, and we should not let them be intimidated into silence. She also said that we need to give the people who are fighting for racial equality more support. In the speech, Clinton also said that the problem of racial prejudice has not been solved in the US, and there is still a long way to go. She said that we need to be honest about the fact that the problem has not been solved, and that we need to discuss how to solve the problem. She said that there needs to be more discussion on the subject. She also said that this discussion should not be held in the abstract. She said that it should be held among people who are affected by racial inequality. In the speech, Clinton spoke of how people need to recognise that racism is a problem that still exists in the US. She also said that people should not assume that things will change by themselves. She said that we need to work together to solve the problem. She said that we need to work together to make sure that ra
