I am a husband and father of two. I love my wife, and I love my children, but I am not a fan of Father's Day. I feel the "holiday," is little more than an excuse for men to spend money on their wives (or girlfriends) without having meaningful interaction with them in any way shape or form that would be considered as rewarding as actually spending time together. It was especially hard growing up because you were expected by your family to do something special just so they could get free stuff from home improvement stores off you. This day only serves as another reminder we are not allowed to say no when it comes to these expectations set out upon us by our families.
