This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... The cops were wrong for firing rubber bullets. I can't speak with certainty about what they should have done in that situation given all we know right now is one side's account (and it doesn't sound like an unbiased source). But did anyone actually read beyond 'police fired wooden projectiles'?
