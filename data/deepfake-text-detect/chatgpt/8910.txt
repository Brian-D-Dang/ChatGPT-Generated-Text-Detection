I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural exchange and it's also sad for me because the taste of Asiatic food can be so good. It kinda feels like something you sent out from your brain rather than some random bagel or whatever. I know what you mean! I think eating red meat has become more common here in Europe too...
