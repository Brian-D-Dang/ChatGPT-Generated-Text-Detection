Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for manuals though You're right about the hills, but even when flat out on a full throttle it's easier to keep your foot from slipping off than go from 1st gear to 2nd. It also makes passing others much faster if you can execute the pass while giving gas and downshifting at the same time.
