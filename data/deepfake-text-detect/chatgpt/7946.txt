While it is true that the United States has a history of using atomic weapons against civilian populations in Japan during World War II, it is important to note that this occurred in the context of an all-out war. Since then, the USA has demonstrated a commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and arms control through its participation in various multilateral treaties, such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The USA has also taken steps towards disarmament, reducing its nuclear arsenal significantly since the height of the Cold War. Additionally, the USA has been actively engaged in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to other nations, endorsing various measures such as sanctions and inspections. Therefore, while the USA has made mistakes in the past, it is not fair to say that it is the least trustworthy nation to possess atomic weapons.
