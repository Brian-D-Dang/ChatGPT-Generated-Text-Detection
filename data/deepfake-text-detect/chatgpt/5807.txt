I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately be quick to call a transgendered person a "shemale," "tranny," or "he-she." The language we use to discuss the transgender community often has negative connotations, especially when it is paired with terms that are meant to be compliments. I was diagnosed with anorexia when I was eleven years old. I was very small, and I was bullied incessantly. By the age of 13, I was forced to go to therapy. We decided that I would begin taking estrogen and progesterone in an attempt to stop my body from producing testosterone, thus changing my gender identity. I took testosterone blockers and estrogen blockers for 10 years. I also began to take cross-sex hormones at the age of 14. I will be turning 24 later this year, so I have been on cross-sex hormones for 10 years. I was also diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and an eating disorder when I was 16 years old. I was put on medication for all of these things, and I am still taking medication today. My life, both inside and outside of the transgender community, changed dramatically. I was finally able to dress in a way that I was comfortable with, and people began to treat me differently. I had been a "stuck up" tomboy, but now I was a beautiful young girl. I was more confident, more comfortable in my own skin, and more outgoing. I was even able to eat in public. I began to accept my feminine side, and began to feel that I was more of a woman than I was a man. My life was not perfect by any means. I had many struggles during those 10 years. I was not able to have surgery for many reasons, including the fact that my parents were opposed to it. I had no transition-related insurance coverage. I was also not ready for surgery at that point in my life. I also had to be very careful about the things I was eating. It was also very difficult to find clothing that I liked. I also had to be very careful about the activities I engaged in. I had to take the bus to school and work every day because I could not drive. I lived a very structured lifestyle, and I did not get to do many of the things that most 15 and 16 year olds did. I missed out on so much, but I didn't regret it. I continued to go through treatment until I was 22 years old. When I turned 22, I was able to stop taking testosterone blockers, because I was not producing any testosterone. It was a very scary time, and I was not prepared to be on my own. I could not get hormone replacement therapy without a doctor, and I could not get surgery without insurance coverage. I was also not ready for surgery at that point in my life, and I did not know who to talk to about transition-related issues. I had to deal with all of this alone for a year and a half. I found myself very depressed, and I began to have suicidal thoughts. I could not seem to shake the feeling that I was not a woman, and I was not happy being a man. I did not know if I would ever be happy as a woman, and I was afraid that I would be unhappy my entire life. I thought that if I killed myself, I would be able to go to heaven, and I would be with my grandmother. I decided that I wanted to die. I was so afraid of what would happen to me if I was to live as a woman. I had decided that I wanted to die, but I could not seem to get the courage to do it. Then, one day, I received an email from a girl that I used to work with. She had no idea who I was, but she had heard about my story. She told me that she was a Christian, and she asked me if I knew about Jesus. I did not know anything about Jesus, but I was very interested in what she had to say. She told me that I could accept Jesus and be saved. She told me that Jesus could take away my pain. She told me that I could have a relationship with Jesus, and that I would be able to be happy. I thought that this would be very easy. She told me that I could talk to Jesus whenever I wanted, and that I would be able to
