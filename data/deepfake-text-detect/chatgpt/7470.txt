English is already the de facto international language, spoken and learned by a vast number of people worldwide. It facilitates communication between people from different linguistic backgrounds and enables interactions in a variety of professional fields. In many cases, English serves as the language of science, technology, politics, and business, allowing people to share information and ideas on a global scale. Adopting another language as the international language would require extensive efforts and resources to establish a common language that could compete with the widespread use of English. Additionally, changing the international language would result in a significant decrease in the fluency and literacy levels of those who have spent years learning and using English as a second language. Therefore, it's essential to recognize the advantages of English as the current international language and adapt to this reality rather than trying to propose an alternative that may not be beneficial.
