While Sword Art Online has its merits, it is not necessarily the best anime of all time. One of the main criticisms of the show is its treatment of female characters, as they often serve as love interests or supporting characters rather than having their own stories and character development. Additionally, the second half of the first season and the entire second season received mixed reviews from fans and critics alike. The show's writing can also be inconsistent, with plot holes and rushed pacing being frequent issues. While Sword Art Online may be a well-known and popular anime, there are plenty of other shows that could be considered the best of all time, depending on individual preferences and criteria.
