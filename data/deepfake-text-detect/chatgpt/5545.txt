Hi guys! To expand: Although I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman for example) a woman to their face and when talking about them as well. I think that is what the "you" in this sentence is pointing to. I would say that, "I respect your right to identify as a woman." as well. I understand that the word "you" can also be referring to all transgender individuals, but I don't think that's the case. I think it's just pointing to someone specific. I am with you on the use of the pronouns. I like to have people call me by my name and my preferred pronouns and I will do the same for them. I don't feel like I should have to be the one to make the change, and it's very important to me that people don't feel like they have to go along with whatever I say about who I am, that I should be listened to. So I think that for a good conversation, respect, and basic human rights, the most important thing is for us to be able to call people what they want to be called. As far as calling someone who "used to be a man" a man, I think that if a trans woman prefers to be called a woman and her birth certificate still says male then I think it's still the right thing to call her a man. To me, it's kind of like how I call my cis friends boys, because I know their birth certificates say boy and I know that's what they identify as. I still know that they are women, but I'm not going to say "woman" when speaking to them. It doesn't seem right to me to call my trans friends men. It seems like a privileged thing to do because I'm not in their shoes. I don't know how it feels to be born with a dick and identify as a woman. And I would never intentionally call someone who is a man a woman, so why should I call my trans friends men? I want to be sensitive and respectful and not go around calling them the wrong thing, but I also think it's important to know and acknowledge who they are and what they want to be called. I think it's a fine line sometimes, but I hope I can get better at finding it. Like I said, I'm not sure if I'm completely understanding what you're saying about the you. I feel like you're referring to a specific person, but I'm not sure who. I was trying to avoid this whole subject because I'm not sure what to say, but I'm glad you brought it up. Thanks for the thoughtful response! I don't feel like it's privileged to me, but I do think it's privileged to call someone who is a man a man who is a woman a woman, and I want to find a way to be respectful and sensitive to people. I'm not trying to police anyone. I'm just trying to be as sensitive as I can because I don't know what it feels like to be someone else. I feel like it's like if you're an ally, you have to be mindful and respectful and sensitive and supportive but you can't try to be someone else. So if someone wants to be called a man but they're trans, I still have to call them a man because I don't know how that feels. And when people tell me it's not okay to do that, I get defensive because I feel like I'm not trying to be an asshole, and that's why I get defensive. I don't want to be an asshole. But I also don't want to piss off the people who are trans. I'm really sensitive to people's feelings. I'm a cis woman but I don't think that means I'm not allowed to discuss this. I've been having a lot of thoughts about it. I just wanted to hear what others have to say. I didn't mean you were privileged. I was just saying that it seems like a privilege to call someone a man or woman. I'm not saying it's a privilege to be a man or woman, just that I think it's a privilege to be able to call someone a man or woman. Because it's not my choice to call someone a man or woman. I don't get to decide. And that's why I'm always so sensitive about it. If I want to call someone who used to be a man a man, I can't. Because it's not my decision. I just wanted to make sure I understood what
