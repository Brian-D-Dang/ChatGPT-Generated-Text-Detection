First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces you to follow the masses with it when voting (Upvote - Downvote). tl;dr for new people here is that they feel like their post won't get visibility unless everyone else agrees and votes up as well "CMV comments will never be visible"
