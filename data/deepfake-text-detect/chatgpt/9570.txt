Throwaway account, my main is used for school. I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She I actually had an account on twitter for about two years, but couldn't get a second account I could use. So I made this one, just to talk, and it's mainly to talk about school and such, but I'll probably just start talking about school stuff, since I'm a grad student and work full-time.
