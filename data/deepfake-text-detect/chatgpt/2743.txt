I mean all jobs, such as police officers, military personnel, CIA operatives, security clearance applications, teachers, lawyers, and doctors. Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if you are a Muslim or not. What does it matter? If they want to hire someone who is Muslim that's their business. That doesn't make them racist for doing so either..
