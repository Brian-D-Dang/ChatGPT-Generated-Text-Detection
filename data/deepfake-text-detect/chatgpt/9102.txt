This is something that's always bothered me, all the way back to when I was a kid. I never understood why it was considered polite to say "bless you" after an event and in conversation with strangers, especially those who were not my age. I'm from the US and it just doesn't seem right to. Like if someone tells me they are gay or straight but I don't know what to do about it because of where I live so there's no excuse?
