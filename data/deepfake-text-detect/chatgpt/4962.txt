After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read all three books in one sitting (I think there are only two novels left). After reading the series, I don't feel like reading any more fiction due to the amount of nonfiction. Why write fiction? Was it really worth writing a novel? What's the point if you're not going to enjoy your book anyway?
