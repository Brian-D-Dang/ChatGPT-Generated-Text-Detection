I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info:) Now, while I don't necessarily think that paying women less makes them inferior athletes...it does seem rather inequitable when you consider that in some cases they earn thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars each year as well as all the benefits associated with being an athlete. But let's face it - if we really wanted equality between men and women across all sports then we'd have equal funding from our government along with equal taxes set at 5050 etc. but we know that isn't going to happen anytime soon so maybe there needs to be other ways for female athletes to compete fairly? One suggestion has been "donations" by rich males like George Soros who can afford to give large donations to organizations so that such things are not directly tied into tax loopholes and unfairness....but still maintain their own competitive edge over others in terms of fundraising efforts. For example, he gave 100 million to various charities in 2009 according to Wikipedia so maybe this is just what we need here? Or, perhaps we should also make sure that no one gets paid based on how much money they raise for charity so that no one's income would depend solely upon donations. Of course, these issues only come up due to sexism that exists among male politicians - thus skewing our entire economic system since everything requires support from those involved. Any opinions out there? Any ideas on how to fix this problem? Is any sort of "equalization" idea feasible? Should male athletes get lower ticket prices than female athletes across the board or something similar? What might work best? How do people feel about having equal pay for men vs women in other countries around the world? Has anything changed recently regarding income parity of male female footballers overseas? Thoughts welcome! -ckinman
