While it is true that both baby and adult cows are killed for food, it is not fair to say that killing a baby cow is no more immoral than killing an adult cow. Baby cows, also known as veal, are often taken away from their mothers within hours of birth and are kept in small, confined spaces where they are unable to move around or interact with other animals. In addition, they are often fed a restricted and nutrient-poor diet to keep their flesh pale and tender. This treatment of baby cows is considered by many to be cruel and inhumane, which makes killing them for food morally questionable. On the other hand, adult cows are usually raised in larger spaces and given a more varied diet, which can be seen as a more ethical practice. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that killing a baby cow for food is no more immoral than killing an adult cow.
