One could argue that cultural appropriation may not be intentionally harmful or racist, but it still perpetuates power imbalances and reinforces stereotypes. When members of a dominant culture appropriate elements from historically oppressed cultures, without fully understanding or respecting their significance, it can lead to the erasure and trivialization of that culture's history and traditions. Additionally, when cultural artifacts or practices are commodified and sold for profit, without proper credit or compensation given to the originating culture, it can perpetuate economic exploitation. Therefore, while cultural exchange and appreciation can be positive, it is important to acknowledge the power dynamics at play and ensure that cultural appropriation is not used to further marginalize or exploit minority cultures.
