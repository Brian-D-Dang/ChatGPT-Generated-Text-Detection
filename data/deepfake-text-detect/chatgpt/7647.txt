While individuals can make choices about their personal style and grooming habits, attractiveness is largely subjective and influenced by societal beauty standards. Many factors that contribute to attractiveness, such as facial symmetry or body proportions, are largely determined by genetics and cannot be controlled by an individual. Additionally, it's important to recognize that societal beauty standards disproportionately value certain physical features, such as thinness or white skin, which can exclude and marginalize individuals from diverse backgrounds. Therefore, it's unfair and incorrect to place full responsibility on an individual for their perceived level of attractiveness.
