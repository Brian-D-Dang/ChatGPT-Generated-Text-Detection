Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, is it a good time for you? Well, yes. In this case it's not really hard. It doesn't matter if somebody brings their ideas up with me and other people do too - there are ways of doing things without putting everything into one place so much as a holding place where nobody else can see them either; however it does make sense when your ideas come from somewhere else altogether because they're identifying themselves anew each day in the present moment rather than coming back later on down memory lane only once every six months like everything you've thought about or heard before. If it makes you feel better, might be worth checking out your local library next week:)
