I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the "safe space" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO, had implemented policies such as banning revenge porn and other non-consensual pornography, and also cracking down on harassment and hate speech in an effort to create a safer environment for all users. However, her leadership had been controversial and she faced backlash from some members of the Reddit community. Steve Huffman, who replaced Pao as CEO, has stated that he wants to focus on building a more transparent and open dialogue with the Reddit community, while also maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for all users. It remains to be seen how he will address these issues moving forward.
