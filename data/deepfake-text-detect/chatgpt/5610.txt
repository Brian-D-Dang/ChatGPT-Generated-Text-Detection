Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to embrace and defend anyone's right to their own private beliefs, so long as those beliefs don't infringe on the rights of others, and so long as those beliefs aren't harmful or actively damaging to others. We all deserve the right to be free from prejudice and discrimination, and we also all deserve the right to pursue our own happiness. I think it is my duty to stand up for the rights of all, and I will do that without exception. I don't think that this matters, but it's relevant. I don't consider myself "religious" (I identify as a "spiritual" person). I consider myself to be morally and ethically driven, and I believe that my core values and beliefs are not inherently religious, even though the many of my values are in line with the religious or spiritual teachings of some of the world's major religions. I don't necessarily believe in a God, but I do believe in a Higher Power or a Higher Source. I believe in the existence of a creative force in the universe (I don't know what to call this force or entity). I don't believe in a Hell or a Devil (I do not believe that this creative force is malevolent). I don't believe in Heaven, but I do believe in some sort of afterlife. I am a firm believer that we are all spirits having a human experience, and that we are all connected. I believe in the power of the human mind, and I believe that we have the power within us to make our world a better place. I believe that we are all on a journey, and that we are all meant to learn lessons on our journeys. I believe that we have the ability to choose how we want to see and experience the world, and that we have the ability to choose how we want to perceive and live our lives. I believe that love is the most powerful energy in the universe, and that we are all meant to love each other unconditionally. I believe that we are all meant to care for each other. I believe that we are all meant to be happy, and that we are all meant to pursue our own happiness. I believe that we are all meant to be free, and that we are all meant to pursue our own freedom. I believe that we are all meant to grow and to evolve, and that we are all meant to live in peace. I believe that we all have a soul, and that our souls are eternal. I believe that we all have the capacity to experience life, to live life, to grow, and to evolve. I believe that we are all meant to love ourselves, and that we are all meant to live a life that we love. I believe that we are all meant to love our children, and that we are all meant to live a life that we love and that we love our children. I believe that we are all meant to live lives that are good, kind, and compassionate. I believe that we are all meant to live lives that are filled with hope, and that we are all meant to hope for the best in life. I believe that we are all meant to live lives that are filled with faith, and that we are all meant to have faith in the world and in ourselves. I believe that we are all meant to live lives that are filled with grace, and that we are all meant to give each other grace. I believe that we are all meant to live lives that are filled with love. I believe that we are all meant to love and to embrace our differences, and that we are all meant to embrace our diversity. I believe that we are all meant to learn from each other, and that we are all meant to learn from our differences. I believe that we are all meant to live in a world of peace, love, acceptance, and freedom. I believe that we are all meant to be free, and that we are all meant to live lives that we love. I believe that we are all meant to be happy, and that we are all meant to live lives that we love and that we love our children. I believe that we are all meant to love our lives, and that we are all meant to live lives that we love. I believe that we are all meant to live lives that are filled with goodness, and that we are all meant to be good. I believe that we are all meant to live lives that are filled with hope, faith, and grace, and
