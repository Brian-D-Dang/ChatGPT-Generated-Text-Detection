This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in our solar system, how do we know it does? And what about the other points? If there are extraterrestrial life forms that aren't human beings then why would we be surprised when aliens appear to be visiting Earth and for whom? Doesn't seem reasonable enough to me... Is that strange? Isn't that quite a certain history lesson? I have been teaching my students about the history of the universe since 1985 - and I will continue doing so until they graduate high school! I am an author based in New Zealand - and I enjoyed the past few weeks with them. We'll see how things shake out soon enough!! You can learn more about me at
