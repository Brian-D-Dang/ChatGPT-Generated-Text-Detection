Redditors main real concerns about the website were monetization and the limiting of "free speech" in the rfatpeoplehate drama. Reddit has still brought many people on board independent of Huffman 's past actions, just as they have done with other big-name figures like Steve Jobs or Richard Branson - stirring controversy to bring new members into their community. rpolitics is a subreddit filled mostly by 14 year olds who don't understand how free markets work I'd venture that you're right. I think it will be tough for him (HuffPo) to get rid of all his old employees; however he'll probably try anyway; which could lead to trouble. The bigger question facing HuffPo now is whether or not it can recover from this blow after everything else that happened today.
