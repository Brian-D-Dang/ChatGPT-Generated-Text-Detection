I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have livedcurrently live there, I could not be more dead set against it. The rent is insane, the subways are not in good condition, and the public transportation is not very good. Traffic is a nightmare and you can't even buy a house because the prices are ridiculous. In addition, the people are rude and have an attitude like no other. I also read an article somewhere about the homelessness crisis, and it's actually really bad in NYC. NYC has always been a dream for me, but it's not realistic to think that I will be living there anytime soon. I wish I could afford to move there, but I'll just have to go back and visit my friends who live there.

I lived in Manhattan, which is a nightmare to live in, but it's also very close to subway stations and you can live a very safe life if you're smart. I went to NYC in 2001 and have never been back since 911. I still want to go back and visit, and I really want to live there for at least 1-2 years. I always see a lot of traffic in the city during my visits, but I guess it's because the city is so big. I want to go back to NYC, and I don't mind going back to NYC with my wife and kids. I think it would be a great family adventure. I always see a lot of traffic in the city during my visits, but I guess it's because the city is so big.
