Countries need children in order to sustain themselves, without a younger generation the country will not advance and will not be able to sustain itself. Elderly will not be able to live alone with their own family. One solution would be for men to spend more time at home raising families than working outside of it. It's also one way we've seen government policies encouraging male participation in child rearing (through daycaresin-home care or paternity leave).
