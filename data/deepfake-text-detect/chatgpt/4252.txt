I should caveat that I'm talking about these terms as applied to humans not plants, nonhuman animals, or electronic devices. And by "socially-sanctioned," I mean a definition broadly acceptable to the publicsociety at large. What would you call them then? Most people know the words are used for humans and don't understand their purpose in society
