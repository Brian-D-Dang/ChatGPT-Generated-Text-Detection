My post is inspired by [this article] in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell "shares" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their educations. While it's not clear that this proposal would create more efficient markets, the idea may well be. I'm no economist, so I can't say whether or not my argument holds up at all - but that doesn't mean I don't think our educational system could use some reform! First off: how do we know that this policy will actually work? The US government has tried many times before (see this list) and only managed to give students inflated "degrees." They have also been unable to guarantee the quality of the universities themselves; we've seen students receive degrees from schools with majors in things like anthropology and history. We're also still dealing with student loans. How does anyone even know what they'll earn after graduation? And who are these potential investors? Are colleges willing to pay higher premiums for agreements such as these? Will schools start revamping their curricula to include investment management courses? It seems incredibly risky to me. But then again, admittedly I haven't done much research on the subject either way...
