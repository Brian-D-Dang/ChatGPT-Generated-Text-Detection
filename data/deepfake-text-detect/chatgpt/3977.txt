I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before they were even close to having a working aircraft (I see the logic here). Of course it was helpful in getting him into various positions - but I think the lesson you draw from this is that we shouldn't automatically assume any child who has slightly more knowledge than us are going to make a good scientist? What about people with very little studied in science and engineering and their decision making skills? At least Nye showed an interest (whether justified or not) in how things 'work', which seems like something often lacking in other scientists at that time. His background as a hand-me-down model might have been helped along by his parents providing funds, but most of what he did came out of necessity rather than an intention to be a'socially responsible' type of person. What I'm trying to say is that while it may have seemed like being a scientist gave him some kind of special status, it doesn't actually mean much when compared to normal people doing similar workresearch. There are plenty of great engineers who get by despite having only a high school level education, and many less so that do it well enough that they're considered experts. Not everyone in science will become a Nobel Prize winner; not every engineer becomes a billionaire...in fact, if you look at successful scientists today there aren't too many who would qualify as'successful'. It's just that those who don't fit into these categories tend to keep trying until they find one that works out. This is why most companies don't care whether or not someone can solve problems, because ultimately all they want is some technology that solves a problem and makes money off it. That's probably why Nye tended to move around without really bothering to come up with anything new himself, since he thought that no one else could benefit from his ideas anyway. He certainly didn't seem to feel obliged to put in a lot of effort in developing his own ideasor perhaps once he got started on something, he wasn't keen to go back 'through the process' of coming up with them again! "If you have no scientific credentials then how is your opinion valid?" Credentials! Opinion This post isn't about whether or not my opinion matters. I'll leave the opinion judgement to others. But I do believe that there should be more consideration given to credentials to assess opinions, especially since no one ever caught me cheating in college. Also, you wrote: "In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before they were even close to having a working aircraft (I see the logic here)." And yet he lacked the proper scientific training required for such a project. By claiming credit for a device he never invented, he became vulnerable to claims of fraud. Besides, the real reason he left academia and joined NASA was because he felt his career path had changed, and joining NASA would allow him to experience different parts of the world, build cool stuff, meet amazing people etc., and not just focus on his own specific field of research (which included aviation). The only issue I'd have with reading the book is that it puts down NASA, and thus American ingenuity, as inferior. Which sounds pretty damn silly considering the space race that kicked off in the 1960s would set the stage for future manned missions to Mars and beyond.
