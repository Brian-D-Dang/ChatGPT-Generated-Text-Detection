This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is this; we don't advocate for a society where someone is forced to do something they consider immoral because of their sex (or race, etc). No one advocates for racism by saying "If you're black, and your best friend's skin color matches yours, it can only mean shehe loves you." We argue about whether or not we want slavery in our country, but no one argues against slavery on the basis that being white means somehow forcing other people into an inferior position. Now with that out of the way... The word gay comes from the Latin 'gaudium' which was used to describe joyfulness people would experience when around members of the same gender - there is nothing inherently wrong or evil about wanting to be happy in life - so calling yourself any sort of alternative gender shouldn't make anyone else say anything bad about you either. It doesn't matter what language you speak, nor does it change who you are as a person. If you need convincing, feel free to look up some basic definitions regarding gender identity, feminism, homosexuality, non-binary identities, and sexuality itself. Sure, many others may disagree with how these things apply to them, and even though you may think you know better than everyone else, you really haven't thought through just why certain groups of people hold such strong views on that subject. And since most religious organizations teach anti-LGBT beliefs among several other forms of bigotry, the idea of trying to force religion down peoples throats isn't worth considering at all. You won't get anywhere using those tactics, especially since they clearly aren't working now, please stop wasting my time. I will tell you though why women get pissed off over men wearing dresses, makeup, high heels, perfume, hair dye, wigs, fake nails, eyeliner. They react much more strongly than men do because of two reasons. One reason is very simple, we were taught throughout school that masculinity equals strength, while femininity equaled weakness and sloth. When boys grow up thinking that they must become masculine in order to fit standards set by society, girls learn quickly that's not true. The second is sexism, and yes, I'm aware that I am stating facts here. Women still face discrimination even today, based solely because they are female. Men often treat us like second class citizens simply because we were born with vaginas instead of penises. There's quite a few articles online discussing the roots behind rape culture and sexual harassment, and once again, I hope none of you read them without knowing exactly why you are reading them! So yeah, sorry if I've wasted your time yet again, but hopefully this has explained my stance and reasoning enough. Good day, sirsmadams. You say "homosexuality" equates to sin? Yes, because that's what we believe. This is why we preach about morality, which is the Christian concept of doing good deeds to show love to God, family friends. Morality exists because of Christ Jesus, and He inspired His followers to spread his message via the Bible. Homosexual acts are defined as sins according to the Word of God. Therefore, homosexual acts are sinful. We did not proclaim that homosexuality per se leads to sin, we proclaimed that God condemns homosexuals specifically, leading them to a state of spiritual blindness. However, one MUST understand the full context of Scripture before making blanket statements like this, otherwise your argument is invalid. Finally, yes, women DO face discrimination and hatred. Don't try to deny that fact. That goes back centuries, however we see little progress. But that said, using your logic, if we allow women equal rights and respect, therefore we condone misogyny, since right now we cannot really define equality between both genders. So basically, you're asking me to condemn heterosexual relationships as well because heterosexual couples fight, beat each other, cheat, engage in infidelity... Does that sound fair to you? Do you agree that such actions reveal lustful hearts within heterosexual couples? Because if you do, then you have condemned every straight relationship ever done in the history of mankind - including marriages. Obviously there ARE exceptions (such as having kids) but you automatically assume such behaviour whenever you meet another man or woman. Not smart at all. Especially since nowadays there is far less divorce than ever before. So I believe you condemn EVERYONE in almost ALL circumstances, just feel free to cite ANY article where that is actually stated. Okay, firstly, let me start off by telling you your entire post wasn't necessary and actually made me lose interest in listening to your point. Just because you call certain words "sin" and equate it to the act of committing adultery, murder, stealing, lying ect., doesn't necessarily imply that was the main purpose of putting those words together. In fact, they should be treated as words that can cause havoc, chaos, panic, horror, truth, that leaves data held forth an escape value out of messing with the fault
