I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still do not agree 100 on most issues and sometimes need to be persuaded by facts rather than emotion for changeprogress...the conversation ended abruptly when said "friend" suggested it was all my fault we weren't friends anymore because people like me are racist too! Then he proceeded towards his car as if storming off angrily from any further interaction or discussion.... The fact is: There ARE racists out there who will vote Trump no matter what they say now - this IS America afterall!!! This isn't about trying "to convince" society-at large; nor am i even attempting here your so called 'facts'....we can continue fighting over whether racism exists today...and how much progress has been made since MLK's time -or maybe you'll have more success convincing each other why YOU shouldn'T call others names? Either way, two wrongs never make right!!
