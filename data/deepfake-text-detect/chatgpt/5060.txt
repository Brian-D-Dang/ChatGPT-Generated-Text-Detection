So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training in first aid, but the university has been running a Fire Brigade Training Center for years now and I wouldn't be surprised if we were closer to the city than they are. The volunteer fire departments school system is mostly staffed by volunteers who aren't trained firefighters themselves; it would have been better off working with a contractor or even hired a couple of new firefighters from another city rather then hiring them simply out of necessity.
