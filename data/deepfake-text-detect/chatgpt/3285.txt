I'm a lifelong veggie, and I've been vegan for a while in the past although I'm not anymore. I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being vegan based on health alone, since it's possible to be healthy with a diet that includes some animal products. However, many people choose to be vegan for ethical or environmental reasons, so those arguments can be quite compelling. From an ethical standpoint, avoiding animal products supports the idea that animals should not be exploited or killed for the pleasure, convenience, or profit of humans. Many people believe that this ethical stance can extend to other areas of life, such as clothing and personal care products, where animals may be used in testing or production. From an environmental standpoint, animal agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and water pollution. By avoiding animal products, one can reduce their impact on the environment. Ultimately, the decision to be vegan is a personal one and should be based on an individual's values and priorities. It's important to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks, and to seek out reliable sources of information and support to help make an informed decision.
