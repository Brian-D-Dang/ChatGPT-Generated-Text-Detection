So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern societies were built upon Christianity and a Judeo-Christian moral system which is shared amongst all religions - whether you choose not believe in God or don't practice your religion does make no difference at that level (though it could affect what form public policy should take). I'm also pro choice when talking about rapeabuse etc as well where we're dealing with physical harm just like murdering someone because they disagree's my views would probably cause them emotional problems too so if i was put into their situation then yes maybe imbalance can occur by having abortion rights either way depending how extreme one goes trying limiting anyone who disagrees from being able even go through life pain free comes across wrong IMHO though its an interesting thing thats been debated before here: How valid are arguments against legalized abortions?
