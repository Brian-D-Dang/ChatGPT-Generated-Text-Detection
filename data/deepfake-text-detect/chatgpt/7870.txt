While it is true that Bernie Sanders' proposed policies may require increased government spending, it is important to note that the current economic policies in place have already contributed to a significant national debt. Sanders' economic policies aim to create a fair and just system that works for all Americans, with the intention of boosting economic growth and reducing inequality. By providing affordable healthcare, education, and investing in infrastructure, in turn, creates more job opportunities and empowers citizens to contribute to the economy. As a result, Sanders' policies have the potential to stimulate economic growth and reduce costs, which would ultimately lead to a more sustainable national budget in the long run. Rather than blindly rejecting the possibility of change, it's important to consider the potential advantages of Sanders' policies and have an open-minded approach to new solutions.
