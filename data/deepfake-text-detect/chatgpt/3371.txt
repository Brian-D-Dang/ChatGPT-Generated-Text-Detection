First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" has. I'm here to help you understand the meaning of the term "egalitarian." Egalitarianism is a belief in the equality of all people, regardless of gender, race, or any other characteristic. This means that an egalitarian is someone who advocates for equal rights and treatment for all individuals, without discrimination or favoritism towards any particular group. In essence, egalitarianism seeks to promote equal opportunities and level the playing field for everyone, rather than privileging any particular group over others.
