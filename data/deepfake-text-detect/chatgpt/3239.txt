Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I understand. When planning your guest list, it's important to consider the size and capacity of your venue, as well as your budget. If you're planning on having a small gathering, then limiting the guest list to 30 people is a good start. If inviting plus ones adds too many extra people and you'd like to keep it intimate, you could consider not allowing plus ones or just inviting close friends and family members. However, if you feel like you want to allow plus ones, you could try limiting it to only significant others or close friends. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide who you would like to invite and how big the party should be.
