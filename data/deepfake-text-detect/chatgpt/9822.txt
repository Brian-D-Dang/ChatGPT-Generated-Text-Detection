I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for a drug charge, for example, they should have the ability to choose to end their life at the end of their sentence if that is what they wish. This would be an act of self determination and would help to reduce overcrowding in prisons. It would also give those incarcerated the freedom to decide their own fate. Additionally, it could provide some closure to victims of their crime as well as their families, who often struggle with the idea of someone being incarcerated indefinitely without any hope of release.
