WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in E-Sports have had their blogs or websites shut down and all sorts (I think they are mostly Chinese) but there was one article where he spoke about how a lot players go unrecognized by most fans because "they aren't flashy" so when you hear someone talking trash on another player don't take it too seriously until after his match is over He said something like this... He could be right if we looked at eSport as just pure entertainment rather than competition with rulesstandards etc... which would probably make more sense anyway
