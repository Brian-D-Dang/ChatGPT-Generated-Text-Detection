Generally speaking, you have two sides on the "Fat Debate": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, as in the aforementioned books). On a personal level, I believe that there is no such thing as obesity. It's either fat or thin; if tall, skinny, fat, thin (and so forth) are all considered to be "normal," then why does it need some sort of arbitrary distinction? If there were something like a normal BMI range for an adult male with average height and body mass index (BMI), then we wouldn't even need these kinds of labels anymore! There really isn't a good answer to this question because nobody knows the best way to measure intelligence among humans. We don't know what makes us smart, not only how we compare ourselves against others but also how other races interpret our differences. The best we can do today is use birthrates and the number of identical twins in comparison to each other to make estimates about IQ. Trying to determine someone's true intelligence has its drawbacks: when trying to estimate the amount of intelligence required to perform advanced tasks, ie. math equations and logic puzzles, using birthrate may overestimate the actual power of human wits, which often relies heavily upon mental fortitude rather than physical prowess. This is especially the case for traits related to personality (characteristics others perceive in your ability to coachhold down jobs). So if we look at IQ on one hand, we must think about how many people possess valid IQ scores while considering the fact that differences between groups are usually hard-wired due to kinship bonds. And on the other side, from a philosophical point-of view, I feel that such "intelligence" tests put too much emphasis on binary categories and ignore more nuanced information. All we can say is that some individuals have higher achievement potential but also less aptness towards certain career paths despite their abilities being uniquely compatible with those fields. Since there is no perfect test or formula for assessing overall ability in life and since education and socialization are equal parts of being intelligent, everyone should be judged by hisher own merits and abilities.
