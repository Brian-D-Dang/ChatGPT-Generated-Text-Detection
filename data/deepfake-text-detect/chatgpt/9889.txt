Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be the law. The answer to this question depends on your personal opinion about gun control. Some people believe that guns should be heavily regulated and controlled in order to minimize their potential for misuse, while others think that gun ownership should be more freely available and that citizens should have the right to bear arms. Ultimately, it comes down to what kind of society you want to live in and what measures should be taken to ensure public safety.
