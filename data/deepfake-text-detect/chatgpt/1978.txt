I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too extreme between urban city life (where you have access to everything) and rural villagecountrylife where all stores are hours away by car or bus; there's no public transportation at all so even if you can drive yourself around you're still dependent on others for rides everywhere; etc i live very close to some woods that back onto my property i go out into them whenever im bored because its nice up here
