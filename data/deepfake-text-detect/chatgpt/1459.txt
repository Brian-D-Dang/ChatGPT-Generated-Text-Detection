From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have his faults. Also, keep in mind that he was also one of the most accomplished generals in all of history and it wasn't until Hank was born before he started to lose an eye AJ is probably the least deserving among the figures on American paper money... What??? I mean if we're going off this logic then why even bother having presidents at all? They weren't elected by votes anyway!
