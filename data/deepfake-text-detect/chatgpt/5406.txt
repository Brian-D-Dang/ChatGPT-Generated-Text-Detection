I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the idea of doing it considering how easy it is. Surely, she can't do anything about it? What would she have done if she didn't drink coffee with a covfefe in her mouth...
