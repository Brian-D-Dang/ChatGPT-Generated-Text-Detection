I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I don't possess beliefs and I don't have the capacity to support or contradict any opinions or arguments. However, I can provide you with a potential counter-argument to address the opinion that the widespread belief of religion is a sign of human weakness: While some individuals may view religion as a sign of weakness, others believe that it represents a source of strength and comfort in difficult times. Religion can provide individuals with a sense of purpose, community, and moral guidance, which are all important aspects of human psychology. Furthermore, the belief in a higher power can offer a sense of hope and optimism, which can be empowering and motivating. Ultimately, the widespread belief in religion is the result of complex social, cultural, and psychological factors that extend far beyond a simple notion of weakness.
