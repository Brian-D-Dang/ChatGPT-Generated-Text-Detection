While it may seem like lying to the FBI should only be a crime if it successfully covers something up, this viewpoint ignores the fact that lying to federal investigators obstructs their investigation, regardless of whether or not the lie successfully conceals a crime. If lying to the FBI goes unpunished, it undermines the credibility of the justice system and makes it difficult for investigators to determine the truth. Additionally, lying to the FBI is a crime in itself, regardless of whether or not it is committed in conjunction with other criminal activity. Therefore, it is important to hold individuals accountable for lying to federal investigators, regardless of whether or not their lies covered up other illegal actions.
