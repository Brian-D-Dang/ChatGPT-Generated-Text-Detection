While it is true that some people who drive loud cars and motorcycles may be inconsiderate, it is important to note that not all people who drive loud vehicles are doing it intentionally to bother others. Some people may simply enjoy the sound or may have modified their vehicle for performance reasons. Additionally, it is unfair to label someone as an "asshole" based solely on the type of vehicle they drive. It is important to acknowledge that everyone has different preferences and interests, and we should strive to understand and respect these differences rather than making assumptions and generalizations. Ultimately, we should focus on finding ways to coexist and share the road respectfully and safely.
