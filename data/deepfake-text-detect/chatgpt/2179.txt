Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions but has been coopted into a system of control used against those who aren't naturally accepted members - the way feminism became an extension of white women hating on black men in order for them to get ahead. In fact, many of my beliefs align more closely social justice than conservative (I believe everyone deserves their basic human rights regardless), which is why I was so excited when I found out about this subculture: It seemed like there were people trying to fight back from within the oppressive structure they helped create! However...it soon came apparent that while some self proclaimed SJWs try desperately to change things through peaceful means, others are not ready or willing to sort themselves out before using coercion as part of "the revolution." This toxic behavior can be seen across all groups that claim otherwise noble goals; look at any group claiming racial equality only interested in superceding whites instead of being genuinely interested in helping minorities. Look how cultish MLM companies become once you join up. And finally, let us never forget GamerGate, where several prominent figures callously insist pro-GGers should kill themselves just because we didn't fall in line behind corrupt journalists pushing lies for political reasons. The hypocrisy is astounding.
