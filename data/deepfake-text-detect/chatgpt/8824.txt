I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in my favourites list. The key is not just a book of photos but the nature and history of a family member who goes on a pilgrimage from their home country (and then spends years making friends with other people). A sharp description would fit in well with the story, no? It's not about what happened to him at all; it's about finding his place in the world he spent most of his life in: the carelessness of the youthful 'forty - year old' who lied down after dying. So far as I know we haven't seen any examples of how his death has affected him personally or even his classmates. So maybe he's doing a good job of hiding something from us, and using our sympathy towards him to find a way forward. Maybe he was heartbroken by an old friend of his who died suddenly, and isn't going to continue sharing stories of what happened between them and the rest of their lives. Or maybe he's coping with some sort of lack of energy because he feels like he's done everything right, and everyone knows what happened. But perhaps he hasn't managed to channel his anger into a coherent perspective (or, more likely, tried to do something different): you know what they say is true when your fellow travellers are discussing a specific subject, and you're telling everyone else exactly what happened to you? Now that's easy enough! You've read it - and everyone loves talking about how you know things like this are true, it makes sense! Well, I guess at least it does help me think through what it means to be human. And thank goodness that everyone around me has discovered it now! This week, my friend Kate - the sales girl at Home Goods - got a gift certificate from Amazon for her new RPG The Book Thief. It's based off of Paul Humes's novel 'Estonia'. I'd been reading the book and loving it since its release. After all, I have started playing right away and had already completed all three chapters which I thought were too long. Makes me wonder whether I should give up on the game altogether and start a different one later... Anyway, Kate says she doesn't want to buy the book. If she did, she probably wouldn't really be trying it and I don't understand why she would. At least that's what she told me. My questions though: 1) Where's the pic of the book? 2) What part of "are we not funny" are we supposed to laugh at anyway? 3) Will the author ever answer to her own question of how should I act if I get caught up in the "overly funny"? If Kate could make this work, I'd love to see the review. Posted by Today the news broke that the US State Department has informed the French government that the Grenfell Tower fire was caused by a chemical bomb planted outside the evacuation zone during the evacuations. In addition, Paris police also announced that two other explosions went off outside the tower last night and Sunday morning. There were reports that there may have been another explosion nearby due to which the fire spread rapidly. France's Prime Minister Jean Castex said that the Grenfell Tower fire was caused by "a bomb planted near Israeli city - the main centre of Tel Aviv." He added that France would take a protective action against such incidents. French President Emmanuel Macron took to Twitter to express his condolences over the tragedy. He wrote: "My thoughts go back to my first day as president. I began working hard and in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy I am spreading awareness on my social media platforms. In many cases I stand side by side with those who lost loved ones in the blaze and remember myself." And he continued to call for calm: "Many families still feel that their children and grandchildren should live here... But I hope soon that all these sadnesses won't be forgotten. Wishing the souls of those affected safe and healthy bodies.... Determined to bring stability to lives in Europe through a coordinated effort..." Please Never Try To Take Your Selfie - - Like an adult, and probably in person, you need to venture out. You have a lot to learn, especially from a young age. Even adults have to have time. Sometimes at school we need to share our feelings in private with others. Our parents are very strong advocates for child safety and safety. Children often enjoy playing with toys. Most kids would never play in public places where children could have fun but they have the balance. Today's blog post comes to you from my father who is responsible for the care of the children involved. You might recall that in my childhood, my mother used to spend much of her time playing with the children, especially those girls whose names I didn't recognize. She always had the toy dolls that - - (Per (w:: consistently and most- and including nature, the in - true -: Photo: nor (a consistent - - -
