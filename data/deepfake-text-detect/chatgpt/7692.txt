One counter-argument could be that abolishing rent regulations could lead to rampant gentrification and displacement of low-income residents in the city. Without rent regulations, landlords would be free to charge exorbitant rents, making it difficult for low-income residents to afford housing in the city. This could drive them out of their homes and into less expensive areas, or even out of the city altogether. Ultimately, this could lead to a less diverse and vibrant city, with only the very wealthy being able to afford to live there. Additionally, removing rent regulations could lead to a decrease in government revenue from property taxes, as landlords may choose to keep their properties vacant rather than renting them out at lower rates.
