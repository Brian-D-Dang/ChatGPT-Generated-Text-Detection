First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that they cause more harm than good. Further, this article, on PC Magazine's website, is a very biased one because it doesn't provide enough information for me to decide if there was actually racism involved or not; nor does it include any information about alternative solutions. As such, although some parts may be accurate, I believe most of what you read here should be disregarded as propaganda. But on to the matter at hand...Read more below! I think we can agree that racism is bad, right? It's no secret that America has had its fair share of racial problems over time; however, with modern times, most people would probably say that things have gotten better. Unfortunately, that isn't always true. Just look at cities like Baltimore, Detroit, Newark, Oakland, Philadelphia, St Louis, etc. These places tend to be poor black communities, and crime in these areas often seems to go practically ignored by the police and politicians alike due to race - which tends to lead them into further poverty and an inferior quality of life. This problem has been exacerbated since January 2009 when President Obama took office. Sure he did have his faults, but "hope and change" seemed like quite a bit. However, just six months later, blacks were being shot left and right during protests against Trayvon Martin, a young unarmed teen killed by George Zimmerman because, according to him, he looked suspiciously African American. What was done then about Mr. Zimmerman? Nothing. Yet two years prior Blacks were still protesting Michael Brown shooting death in Ferguson, Missouri at the hands of Officer Darren Wilson, who also happened to be white. That same year three other men died from shootings involving police officers...one black, one Latino, and another Asian man. Since September 2014 alone 40 black Americans have been murdered by copssecurity forces, yet not one officer across those four cases had faced charges. Racism is alive and well within our own country today and sadly will likely continue to thrive until something drastic happens. In fact, perhaps none of this could happen without a recent social injustice that occurred around July 2014: The arrest of Edward Archer Jr., 33, after a video surfaced showing him beating up a woman while yelling racist epithets at her and calling her a "n bitch." Afterward, authorities arrested him for assault related charges and attempted murder. But wait, why do we care about this case?It's important because Archer filed suit last week saying he was unfairly targeted because of whites' fear stemming from the rampant rise of Black Lives Matter movement. Here's how CNN described the situation:Archer has sued Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and Sheriff Joe Lombardo claiming he was racially profiled and mistreated following his August 2015 arrest. He says former LVMPD Sgt. Jason Oganusic [an undercover cop posing as an informant] told fellow cops that a woman saw him hitting someone, claimed she'd been assaulted by the suspect and provided their address and license plate number. Officers went looking for Archer whereupon they found him sitting outside near his parked car in front of a house on Tuesday, Aug. 31, 2015. A neighbor called 911 to report hearing sounds consistent with altercation, including screaming and banging noises coming from inside the home...Oganouski tells a different story, saying the video depicts only part of the incident. Instead, he says he followed and detained Archer based solely upon information gathered through his work as a confidential human source [informant].According to the lawsuit, obtained first by Reno Gazette Journal reporter Ryan Randazzo, the harassment began before the actual fight started when Oganouski approached Archer, put his foot on his leg and said, 'You're going down.'Police arrived shortly thereafter and placed Archer under citizen's arrest, handcuffing him. They then punched and kicked him repeatedly while pushing him face-first onto the ground," Archer attorney Jennifer Paine says in the complaint.The lawsuit claims Oganusik lied about his role as a paid snitch and intentionally misled police creating false evidence against him"After his arrest, plaintiff was charged with felony assault with injury to others, misdemeanor battery against a person age 64 or older, possession of marijuana less than 1 oz, resisting arrest, failure to comply with court order, driving under the influence, speeding and reckless driving," reads the complaint. "He spent 364 days in jail, despite having a clean record otherwise." His bail eventually skyrocketed to 100,000 twice the amount set forth for similar offenses.Archer declined comment through his lawyer. When asked whether the department knew about Oganusik, Lombardo spokesman Lt. Mark Gregory deferred comment to the city attorneys but added LAPD would defend itself vigorously."There is absolutely zero tolerance for misconduct within any law enforcement agency, especially when it comes to using informants," Gregorian said.In his defense, Plaintiff.Argue outlying in effect in the profession?Edalavuturing thickets?Yesareascreen play inandis it the) see
