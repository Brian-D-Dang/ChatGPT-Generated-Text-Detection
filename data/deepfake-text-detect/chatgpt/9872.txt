"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the future, then robots will be essential to our survival. This is because robots could become the "caretakers" of humanity, providing us with resources and protection in an ever-changing world. Robots would also be able to handle certain tasks better than humans, such as mining for resources or exploration. As technology advances, so will robots and they will eventually become more intelligent than us. In that case, it's possible that robots may take over the Earth, but this will be done in a way that is beneficial to humanity, not harmful.
