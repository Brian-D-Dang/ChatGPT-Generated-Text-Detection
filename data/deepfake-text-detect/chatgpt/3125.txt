Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 7th century, through the life and teachings of the prophet Muhammad. Islam teaches the belief in one God (monotheism), as well as the importance of prayer, charity, fasting, and pilgrimage to Mecca. Muslims also believe in the concept of accountability and judgment in the afterlife. Islam is practiced by over 1.8 billion people worldwide and is one of the fastest-growing religions.
