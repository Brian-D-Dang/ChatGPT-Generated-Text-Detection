While it is true that the stigma around tattoos has decreased in recent years, it is important to note that there are still many professions that favor a more conservative appearance. In fields such as law or finance, for example, visible tattoos may signal to potential employers that the candidate is not serious or professional enough for the job. Additionally, many universities have strict dress codes for staff and faculty members, which may include regulations on visible tattoos. So while a forearm tattoo may not necessarily ruin someone's chances for higher education or employment, it is important to consider the industry or organization in question and whether visible tattoos could potentially be a hindrance in those contexts.
