I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too great between what we have, and what they're stuck with. It's more like if you grew up somewhere where there were 5 people within an hour radius that all had money, then got dumped into a city where everyone is poor So basically: simple things become much harder when everything else around you has changed drastically
