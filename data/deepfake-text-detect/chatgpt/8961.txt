I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are very different from Egypt or Libya - there's so much freedom to participate in their society and the most important thing is that they don't restrict you. The people here have a lot more freedom than anywhere else... Where does one learn about the culture? We give our parents this place every year for free (in simple terms) but we also teach them a few lessons because it can be difficult at first (not really knowing what the local culture is like). So now I'm learning Turkish as well.
