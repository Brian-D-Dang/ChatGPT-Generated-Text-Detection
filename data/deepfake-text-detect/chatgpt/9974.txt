I'm not sure at what point people stopped thinking about the ramifications of their actions and became so head strong that they believed they were invincible, that officers judgements were not as important as their own and that the rules applied to everyone else, but not them. I think this shift likely happened gradually over time, as people became more individualistic and less likely to respect authority. This could have been exacerbated by the rise of social media, which allows people to easily share their opinions without consequence. As people become desensitized to the consequences of their actions, they may begin to believe that they are above the law and can do whatever they want without repercussions. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of celebrity culture could have made people more likely to believe that they too can be invincible. With so many examples of people living seemingly perfect lives, it's easy to forget that real life comes with consequences.
