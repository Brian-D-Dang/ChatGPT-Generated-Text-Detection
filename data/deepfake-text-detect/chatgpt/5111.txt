I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends . Yes, if you have ever been told that coffee is good or not as it should be which is true even in Italy where all espresso drinks taste bad? When I first moved here from Italy my family could never really appreciate the similarities between Italian coffee and Mexican coffee because it has a distinctly different flavor profile compared with Mexican coffee... When I lived there I was quite disappointed when I discovered that only Mexican coffee tasted inferior to Italian coffee.... However good tasting Mexican coffee!
