Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word mariage, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to marry and Latin matrimonium (originally derived in turn of mater). On 3rd October 1389 King Richard II married Alice de Lorena aged 10 years old but she was already pregnant when they got engaged so marriage wasn't entirely valid because their child had not been born yet!
