On a hair dryer: "Do not use in a shower." If somebody's dumb enough to use a hair dryer in the shower, they're not going to pay much attention to a sticker. I know several people who have been burned by using a blowdryer in baths (myself included). Some of them are even older than me and I can't figure out how that happened without someone telling you about it at some point over the years...
