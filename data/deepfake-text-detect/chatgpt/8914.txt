First of all, I do not like to believe this because I've been told over and over and over that it isn't true, but I keep seeing more and more articles on it. It's clearly something big that needs to be done, but the City Council should learn from their mistakes instead of allowing excuses. I agree with you completely! They didn't pass a bill before the council voted on it - they passed it now and it is being turned into a law... which means they also gave them permission to change the name and sign it for 15 million... which was just fine in my opinion when we were trying to get rid of the word "bond."
