I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are very different from each other (at least for me). I thought it would be fun to share our lives together if we could choose one place to live all over the world without any restrictions! We're always having a tough time choosing between what's best in life... but this challenge might just change that
