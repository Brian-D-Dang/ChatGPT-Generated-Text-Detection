I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before 'American inventors created the V-2 rocket', which was used in WWII to destroy German cities and kill many millions.' Other than that, his career as an astronomer has been rather unimpressive since 1972 when he made a few unpopular pronouncements about evolution (himself having studied physics at the University of Chicago). He also happened to be friends with Richard Dawkins, who gave him his first big break into popular science writing - writing Professor Dawkins' book on Evolutionary Theory. It did not take long until it became apparent that Nye relied too heavily upon Dawkins for all his scientific knowledge.... That he is currently working towards being received by the same sort of scientists whom Charles Darwin worked among more than 200 years ago seems unlikely given how things have turned out...
