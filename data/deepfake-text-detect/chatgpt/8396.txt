Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions as well (at least relatively speaking). However in the last few years or so these message boards has been overrun for some reason mostly likely due a resurgence of social conservatism coupled on top an influx from 4chan's pol board which consists primarily if not entirely white supremacists who are anti feminist etc... What concerns about many people is how much power neo nazi organizations like Stormfront does wield online: Trump was elected partly because he had all his own supporters emailing spam lists daily while still being able enough push forward racist messages through tweets facebook posts without having any real repercussions whatsoever....And now we've got more extreme right wing groups getting their foot into every single website they can get access too; one example would be The DailyStormer spreading Baphomet memes across GamerGate discussion forums.. (It gets worse...) There were even instances where Neo Nazis went door knocking trying out "support jewish" propaganda such things included making swastikas outside peoples doors - those individuals caught doing what happened ended up either fired,or sued depending upon jurisdiction but there also remains victims whose lives took forever damaged after receiving hateful threats directly attributed themselfs! It just doesn't stop anyone expressing your views anymore than you should let others express theirs regardless whether its politics related stuff thats going around atm.But back then opposing voices could always remain civil unlike today when seemingly no matter under whatever circumstances someone says something against minorities say anything positive towards Black Lives Matter yet another death threat will follow usually coming via twitter DM..Its really gotten bad!
