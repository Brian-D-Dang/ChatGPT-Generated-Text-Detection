Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. If a non-US airline wants to take over one of those flights they must pay to lease a domestic route from an existing carrier, and then submit their flight plans for approval by the FAA. The recent ruling that allows Southwest Airlines (which does not have headquarters outside the USA) to use some slots at Newark airport could potentially allow any international carrier permission to enter the American market without purchasing landing rights or paying fees. That's huge for low cost carriers around the world - let alone historically disadvantaged ones like Virgin America which typically has no access to transatlantic markets due to this regulation. Now obviously it will be a long time before we see much change because this rule was created with specific national interests in mind; but I think it's promising that such a large organisation might eventually decide to revise what are relatively minor regulations when it comes to Air Traffic Control.
