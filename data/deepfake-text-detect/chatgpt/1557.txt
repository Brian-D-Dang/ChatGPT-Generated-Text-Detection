I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at their fingers or using complicated hand movements like three finger typing and four finger scrolling (which I personally find to be counter-productive). While you can typically teach yourself any new skill if you put your mind to it, there are certain things - from reading to writing to coding - where it just isn't possible for most beginners.
