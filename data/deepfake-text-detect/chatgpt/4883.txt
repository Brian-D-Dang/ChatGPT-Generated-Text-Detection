Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news x] , [x] after delivering a speech in which she said that "for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of an African American president sends them into overdrive." In response to this statement, many black commentators have spoken out against what they perceive as Clinton's presumption that whites are superior. For example: Cornel West called her remarks racist and charged that "she is saying something about our civilization" by generalizing the behavior of some Americans; Jesse Jackson Jr., on MSNBC, also labeled it racist; Al Sharpton asserted that t]he fact remains...that there are times when someone with your skin color gets treated differently," while noting that he would not want his own son to be judged on such factors; Jack Johnson contended that although blacks may make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population, they represent 30 or even 40 of prison inmates.[12], [3]. But should we classify these statements as racism? And if so, how can it be defined (and perhaps more importantly, avoided)? There seems to be no consensus among political scientists who study moral discourse,[4] but two recent articles attempt to do just that.[5],[6] One article argues that one cannot define racism because it has multiple meanings and uses, but another offers several criteria that could potentially help us better understand its meaning[7]; however, both agree that defining discrimination based upon race or ethnic identity alone does nothing to explain why black leaders often refer to themselves using racial epithets nigger and other racially derogatory terms.[8] Considerable research suggests moreover that certain manifestations of prejudice - for instance anti-Semitism - are deeply offensive precisely because their objectification of Jews is thought to channel ancient modes of thinking rooted in racial stereotypes, despite all the efforts made to eradicate those forms from modern Western culture.[9] As Dworkin says later in the essay, i]f describing oneself with disparaging words like nigger were indeed inherently oppressive... then those doing so ought to stop, regardless of any consequences.10] But the question arises concerning whether Ms. Clinton has actually engaged in such oppression. Given that she was addressing a Cornell University audience, let me note here three reasons why I believe that Clinton's characterization of herself as somehow being oppressed merely for calling attention to the existenceexistence of historical discrimination might sound rather silly. First, the title of her talk was "Race The Obama Presidency." Second, given that her own father had kept slaves, and since he bought land with money earned by indentured servants and sharecroppers, understanding and empathizing with the plight of today's descendants of enslaved Africans must surely come naturally to anyone raised to the level of a Secretary of State. Third, as Blythe notes in a footnote, if "black persons really were disrespected simply because of 'white folks' perceptions', it certainly wouldn't matter how much Mr. Obama personally benefited economically from slavery.11] Still, I think that if anything can turn off voters (as supported by exit polls), it is hearing repeated claims of racism every time Barack Obama speaks during election campaigns, especially when those charges go far beyond accusing him of having links with Louis Farrakhan, Jeremiah Wright, Bill Ayers, et al. As noted earlier, we need to distinguish between genuine acts of racial hostility toward black individuals and simple expressions of disapproval for nonconforming actions taken by those individuals (however distasteful). Any person at all (from politicians to ordinary citizens) will probably initially feel hostile towards the latter without necessarily harboring negative feelings about black people in general (see below).[12] More generally speaking, what is ultimately at stake here is the freedomor lack thereof of each individual to express himself freely in order to live according to his conscience and beliefs (even though such expression could offend others). Before proceeding further I am going to offer four examples of situations where I find myself wondering whether Hillary Clinton's alleged use of the term "racist" constitutes real injustice by way of unintentional stereotyping (racism); or instead implies that she feels no empathy for being subject to the same stigmatization and psychological pressures as other groups associated with supposedly inferior physical characteristics. Here goes! 1. A high school teacher once told me that my name sounded suspiciously African to him, without offering any explanation (personal email, 2004). Perhaps he meant that I resembled a stereotypical black person (e.g., Uncle Tom) or had similar features, or maybe he didn't know what else to say. We subsequently chatted briefly, and never mentioned the incident again. In this particular case, I chose to attribute his comment to mere ignorance of black history and cultural differences, rather than racial intolerance. Nevertheless, the teacher's remark strikes me as very hurtful because I found it impossible to ignore instances of outright rudeness directed at me (without directly mentioning names, etc.) in classes years ago in college, and still remember unpleasant memories of former encounters with an unpleasant comment "arbitrary and unrelated messages over 3.
