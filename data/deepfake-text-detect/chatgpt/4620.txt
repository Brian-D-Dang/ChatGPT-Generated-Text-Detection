I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately after hearing their nonsense be so quick to denounce trans women for being "too masculine" or feminine. This is a habit of mine. It has happened before with other celebrities who have been reported as being transgender simply because they haven't shown up looking like themselves on camera (Shania Twain). Many of these individuals have had surgery done on them at one time or another in order to appear more womanly. But what if it's not about appearances? What if it's about real life experiences? And even though I don't look exactly like myself right now either way; I'm still struggling through this part of my life - physically, mentally, emotionally, etc., no matter how much I wish things were different. You see, we are all born into a body that doesn't necessarily match our gender identity. We live in a society where you most likely will never meet someone else who looks just like yourself unless you happen to grow up somewhere really specific - like an Amish community! For me personally? This journey began around age 13-14 years old. The fact is: In order to take responsibility for your own desires, dreams and goals in this world! There needs to be acceptance from those closest to us in order to make progress in any given area. I can do whatever I want in my personal relationship but if I keep pushing away the person I love most, I'll only end up hurting himher in the end. The same goes for anything in a business setting. However, saying "You're too far along" while, at the very least, showing respect by telling her she needs help is meaningless. All this means is that I need to work harder than anyone to get better at something and become stronger in every aspect of my character - both inside and outside of my relationships. If we expect others to change first in areas that aren't a priority to us, why should we ever expect ourselves to improve in areas that actually impact our lives, such as health, wealth and happiness? Right now, I am working hard towards becoming the best version of myself that I possibly can. Someone told me once that "you reap what you sow." So let's talk about what I've sowed over the past few years... Here is my goal list: 1) To inspire and encourage everyone close to me with words and actions everyday. 2) To express gratitude to God everyday for his blessings. 3) To remain focused on each day's purpose and tasks and allow nothing to distract me in boring out loud conversations, via text message, email or phone call on days off. 4) To set aside enough money to provide a comfortable living lifestyle without having to constantly rely on credit card debt. 5) To spend quality time with friends building meaningful memories together. 6) To learn new skills regularly, whether it be cooking, fitness training or public speaking to name a couple. 7) To meditate daily, ideally 30 minutes per sitting. 8) To visit and stay connected with family members friends in places outside of Kansas City, MO. 9) To retire early without saving for retirement. 10) To put forth effort toward improving my finances on a regular basis. 11) To exercise consistent self-care habits including getting plenty of sleep, eating well and drinking water throughout the day. 12) To show gratitude, kindness and appreciation for everything good in my life. 13) To lead a healthy lifestyle by exercising 6x times a week, reducing sugar consumption and drinking lots of fluids, taking vitamins and supplements religiously as needed. 14) To quit letting negative thoughts influence and control my moods negatively by always trying to think positively, avoiding situations which cause stress and practicing gratitude instead. 15) To give back regularly by helping homeless children and animals, reading books to kids and providing unconditional positive regard to others. 16) To focus less on materialistic possessions and more on giving heartily to charity and serving as a role model for leadership in many ways. 17) To receive honest compliments and encouragement daily. 18) To truly enjoy spending time with those whom I care deeply about. 19) To create balance in my life between physical activity and mental stimulation. 20) To find humor in adversity, reflect upon it and laugh about the whole situation until better times arrive. 21) To maintain grace under pressure during stressful events.22) To establish boundaries with partners so that issues do not fester and emotions do not boil over.23) To accept full accountability for my choices, decisions and behavior which reflects integrity to myself and those around me.24) To serve as an example toward honesty. 25) To strive for excellence within all aspects of my life. 26) To share knowledge and experience openly and honestly in return for information and inspiration shared freely.27) To resist hormone test with, a high powered investment company that consists of a culture company that also uses its fully formed with the other side appeals to hide to
