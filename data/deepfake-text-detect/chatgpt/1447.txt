First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from my perspective as a dude who doesn't have kids in tow to worry about and would rather walk than drive or take public transportation. Of course it's not ideal but that's why you live where there are fewer cars on the road. In the city? Sure - if your problem with traffic isn't congestion then it might be worth considering what else can be done (besides driving less).
