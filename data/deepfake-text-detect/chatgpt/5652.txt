For whatever reason men commit about 80-90 of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where women outnumber men. We're not sure why that is. There are a few theories, but most don't hold up in the face of any empirical evidence. According to one theory, men are more likely to commit crime because they are more likely to have a temper. This theory would suggest that men have a higher likelihood of committing crime if they become enraged. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to support this. A separate study on testosterone in men and aggression found no relation between testosterone and violent crime. They found that a man's testosterone level is not the determining factor in whether he's violent or not. However, that's not to say that testosterone doesn't have any effect on men. Some studies suggest that testosterone influences behavior, but not in the way we may think. In fact, testosterone doesn't influence crime at all, but it does make people more competitive. The studies have been conducted in both men and women and the findings have been consistent. Testosterone is not a determining factor in crime, but it does have an influence on behavior. In one study, researchers had 200 women and men complete a memory test. Then they gave 100 women and 100 men a dose of testosterone and gave the other 100 women and 100 men a placebo. Then they had the participants complete the same memory test. A week later, they repeated the test with the 100 women and 100 men who had been given the placebo and the 100 women and 100 men who had been given the testosterone. What the researchers found was that testosterone had no influence on the women. However, it did have an influence on the men. The men who had received testosterone performed better on the test than the men who had received the placebo. The women who had received testosterone performed worse on the test than the women who had received the placebo. So the women who received testosterone did worse, but the men who received testosterone did better. That's not the only study that's been conducted that has come to this conclusion. A separate study had 109 men and women take a math test before receiving testosterone and a memory test after receiving testosterone. They found that testosterone made the men more competitive. However, it had no effect on the women. So the men who received testosterone were more competitive, but the women who received testosterone were not. In fact, the women who received testosterone performed worse on the memory test than the women who hadn't received the testosterone. And the men who had received testosterone performed better on the math test than the men who had not received the testosterone. Both studies suggest that testosterone has a greater influence on male behavior. It can make you more competitive, but it can't make you commit a crime. The only other possible explanation for the disparity between men and women in terms of crime rates would be that women are simply less likely to commit crimes. This explanation isn't as reasonable as the first, but it's certainly more reasonable than the third. The third theory suggests that the gender disparity in crime rates is due to the patriarchal society in which we exist. The theory claims that a patriarchal society gives men more power over women, which gives men more opportunity to commit crime. The theory further claims that a patriarchal society also makes men more inclined to commit crime because they believe that the man has to be in charge. That's because they believe it's their job to be in charge. Therefore, they feel like they're entitled to be in charge. They believe that women can only be in charge if they are the ones who ask to be in charge. So men are more likely to commit crimes because of the way that men are socialized in patriarchal societies. Therefore, men are more likely to commit crimes because they've been socialized to believe that men are in charge and women are not. The problem with this theory is that the numbers don't support it. If you look at crime rates across different societies, you'll see that it's a global issue and not just a patriarchal one. Some people might even argue that the
