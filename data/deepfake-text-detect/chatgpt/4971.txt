First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that many people who work hard enough in the prison system do not deserve this treatment; prison guards have a duty or obligation towards their fellow inmates by working very closely with them - as opposed to being harsh punishments for guards whose duties lie elsewhere. While prison sentences may be arbitrary they certainly should become illegal jails when correctional officers commit serious offenses against inmates whose only crime is illegally abusing prisoners' rights. I also believe that prisoners need better conditions. I see in Colorado prisons there are no rehabilitation programs capable of providing meaningful relief from poverty, or any type of rehabilitation like rehabilitation centers, but incarceration rates soar among those living alone without family members. The criminal justice system makes it difficult for poor individuals to recover emotionally from their experiences so far away from loved ones once incarcerated relative. Even worse, violent offenders receive many cruel punishments because criminals often wait until loan sharks prey on them before committing themselves punishable offenses such as murder. This attitude encourages predatory behavior where money keeps prisoners hostage until they promise to repay the loans they owe other people by driving them into debtors' prisons. A plan could save countless families thousands if we protected prisons from predatory lenders who threaten their lives each week at the expense of others. Providing adequate care would improve the quality of life for prisoners while ensuring they never return home again just because they were guilty under discipline rules set forth by law. Prisoners already pay steep fines every day requiring them to spend hours navigating through conditions described above. The worst offenders - including violent predators - can get away with more than most anyone else ever will pay attention to due process requirements which violate human dignity. While some prisoners' fees are waived during sentencing hearings, others must endure lengthy disciplinary procedures after release awaiting trial. If we abolish our corrections systems then prison costs will rise because of increased inmate population growth resulting from increase prison charges sometimes referred to as 'punishment'. And we'll suffer from an outdated justice system that treats prisoners differently based upon race rather than subjective cases involving discrimination. Correctional services are notoriously expensive compared to private providers. If we remove these burdensome expenses, high prices cannot justify increased overcrowding. The federal government has been spending billions of dollars annually supporting prisons with little regard for the welfare of prisoners currently housed abroad, undermining the integrity of the justice system along with the safety of our communities everywhere. Overall, I support the removal of prison sentences and penalties for crimes committed unlawfully either individually or collectively. This includes permitting prosecutors to pursue breaches of parole violations even though they've done nothing wrong and offering release options beyond probation recommendations approved by a judge for all convicted criminals since the age of 18. The government's parole practices lend themselves well toward justice. As a result, fewer people expect to present themselves voluntarily, instead choosing instead to cooperate with law enforcement agencies or serve time online - a choice that harms victims of crimes and prevents service seekers from achieving convictions benefits. I urge Congress to pass legislation to end the criminalization of parole violators immediately prior to releasing prisoners without delay. The United States needs greater accountability for its institutions. Unfortunately, the prison population continues rising despite efforts by politicians and bureaucrats to curb its growth and transparency regarding prison populations. Prison abolitionists deserve credit for pushing back against the overwhelming majority of court orders and restrictions placed on public access to courts over recent decades. I encourage Congress to reverse these unconstitutional restrictions now! Daniel Karpal is a former Illinois state senator representing western Illinois.
