While it may be true that people are inherently selfish, it does not necessarily mean that socialism or communism cannot work in today's society. These ideologies are built on the principle of cooperation and collective effort for the greater good of society. Therefore, an effective socialist or communist society requires people to put aside their individual desires to work towards the common good. Additionally, social democracy, which combines elements of socialism with a market economy, has been successful in many countries, proving that socialism can be adapted to suit a modern society. The idea that socialism cannot work because people are selfish overlooks the fact that people are capable of organizing and cooperating towards a shared goal, as seen in successful cooperatives and community projects around the world.
