Hi CMV! A recent post on AskReddit about homosexuality and pedophilia being a choice or not led me to this thought that BOTH homosexuality and heterosexuality are choice made by individuals. I believe that sexual attraction is not solely determined by biology or genetics, but also influenced by environmental and societal factors. People can choose to act on their sexual attraction, regardless of whether it is towards the same sex or opposite sex. However, I do acknowledge that there are some biological factors that may contribute to sexual orientation, such as hormonal imbalances in the womb. Nevertheless, I believe that labeling sexual orientation as a choice or not is not productive. Instead, we should focus on promoting acceptance and inclusivity towards all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their choices or biological predispositions.
