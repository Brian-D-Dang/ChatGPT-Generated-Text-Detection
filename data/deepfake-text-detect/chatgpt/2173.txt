I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at their fingers or using basic techniques like "look down one row and move forward" which is useful once you know where each key goes on your QWERTY-based hunt peck arrangement (so pretty much never). The reason for this? The first generation learned from watching OTHER PEOPLE learn to use keyboards, with very little guidance other than: "A makes an A." For most folks who were taught this way, typing requires more eye movement then anything else they do... because unless they're photogenic enough to be able to see what word they just typed by glancing quickly over their shoulder while simultaneously attempting to hit another letter with exactly 110th inch accuracy... well, I guess we all know why nobody wants to watch us try to write stuff out!:)
