I feel like they're acting and it often feels very campy. I don't like how they say "well my brain is more feminine," like excuse me that's something that women are over-emotionally attached to their femininity, but not everyone seems to be interested in being a girl who lives together with men and doesn't know the naked man assigned male companionship of other girls? You have no idea what you just said or why you would say this?
