Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of looking for a way to protect myself from future parental stupidity, I had discovered something better: Vaccination I find it funny that people who can't vaccinate seem to think they're protecting themselves against everyone else's stupid decisions by taking vaccines away from them! Like, really?
