To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific benefit for humans from eating them (unless you are trying to survive). My only concern is that the results may be skewed because veganism has become trendy these days due to new vegans joining in and not being able to tell whether or not they were already in the minority before starting their diet - which might lead some people to assume that it wasn't really popular at all.
