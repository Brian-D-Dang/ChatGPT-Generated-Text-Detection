This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this is how it looks now: (1) The guy who was a lawyer (the one with the interest that you are investigating and he wanted me involved), had bigger plans for his business than just building boats - they were going out on their own as "Third Coast Marine" which makes sense when viewed through your lens of things happening after TCM built enough money so its owners could buy themselves into brand names like Wichita-Hoover etc...they decided upon buying more land instead since there wasn't much around them yet besides marshland near NOLANew Orleans where Louisiana draws water off Mississippi River intake pipes down south then sends back up north toward Chicago via Illinois Waterway System. That's big picture stuff right? And if what happened next doesn't make any logical common denominator theme all together...well maybe we should call our book by another name!?! lol:p
