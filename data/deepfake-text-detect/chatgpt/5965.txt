Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of dealing with the reality of how ill these parents are and the effect it has on my life I have become anti-anti-vax myself. My parents' lack of concern for their own health and the health of others will forever be my 1 beef with them. Yet, I'm not sure I could ever convince them that vaccines are necessary. I don't know that they'll ever be able to change their minds. If I had a child I probably wouldn't vaccinate either, and that kills me. I am the same age as your parents and I remember my mom getting those crazy stories from the media. When I had my first child, I vaccinated and had my pediatrician answer all of her questions. It was a bit awkward but she came around and was extremely thankful. I get it though. I know they are trying to protect their kids. This is an interesting topic. I am not anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine. I believe each child should be evaluated for their individual needs as a child. I am fortunate that my daughter is healthy, but my son has severe food allergies and asthma. He can not be around other children due to the risk of him having a life threatening reaction to the foods or other allergens he is allergic to. He also has autoimmune issues that make him immunocompromised. I will not take the risk of exposing him to the chance of getting a vaccine that could make him sick or cause a reaction. However, he has received the flu shot yearly. We feel that it's important to do this to protect him from the risk of him getting the flu and possibly being hospitalized. My husband is a respiratory therapist and has seen the devastating affects that the flu can have on people. He has had to deal with multiple patients who were in the ICU or on life support due to contracting the flu and having complications. I've had to make decisions that were not easy in regards to my son's health. I choose to vaccinate my daughter and have not vaccinated my son. I don't believe one is right or wrong. I'm not anti-vaxxer, but I am against mandatory vaccines. I know I'm a parent and I make the decisions for my kids. If I don't want them vaccinated, it's my decision. When my kids were little I had no problems with the chicken pox vaccine. When I got pregnant, I got the vaccine. When I was pregnant, the doctor told me that I had to get a rubella vaccine, so I did it. I did my research and my kids received their vaccinations. I have no problems with them having the vaccines they need. My son is an adult and he has to make his own decisions. He's an adult and he can get a tetanus shot if he needs it. I totally understand your point of view, but I think that most people who are against vaccines are educated on the subject. Most of us are sick of hearing the "anti-vaxxer" label. Hi Tara! I completely understand. I hope that the flu season is a mild one for your family. I think we can all understand where you're coming from. I think that it's important for people to get their vaccinations but it's also important for people to make their own decisions. I have a son with Aspergers. He had the vaccine and can't have another one. It can have devastating effects on him.
