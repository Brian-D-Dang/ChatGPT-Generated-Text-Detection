I think the real reason people punish others for transgressions is not so much to discourage the behavior, but rather to channel humanity's inherently predatory nature in a way that's constructive. You're right it most likely doesn't have anything to do with discouraging bad behaviour as you believe, however I disagree strongly and say that rewards are usually used by those who can most use them when they need something from someone else or want some kind of power over someone else
