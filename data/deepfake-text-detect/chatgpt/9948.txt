The word 'natural' implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless one is referring to a specific definition of the word, such as in chemistry or biology, the distinction between natural and human-made can seem arbitrary. The distinction between natural and human-made is often used to differentiate between materials and processes that are not created by humans. In this case, it serves as a reference point that allows us to distinguish between things that we perceive as being "natural" and those that have been modified or engineered by humans. For example, when discussing food labels, something labeled as "natural" is likely to be considered healthier than something labeled as "artificial" or "processed." This distinction is also important for environmental conservation, as it helps us identify resources that should be preserved in their natural state, untampered by human activity.
