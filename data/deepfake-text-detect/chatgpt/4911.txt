A multitude of films have twists in the plot, for example Gone Girl, Memento, a lot of films of M. Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well , the whole lot of them. I really liked Maniac. It is one of those movies where there are no obvious plot holes but there has to be some kind of twist that makes it seem like a mystery instead of an action movie. The ending was ruined by the fact that it didn't end with the protagonist dying... again. The film made me want to leap into horror territory and die laughing at the end because it sucked me right in and I felt so bad for the villain's family after watching him die alone. This scene initially gave me shivers until I realize how terrible it all looked from the beginning (which was cool) then all the sudden it calmed down completely when I realized the villain isn't actually evil or anything and he just wants to save his sister. That scene left me crying tears of joy!
