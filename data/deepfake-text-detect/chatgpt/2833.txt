I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any sort of afterlife or heavenhell (which I doubt), then what does death matter? Maybe you are right and as long as we have no proof for an after life why not make suicide easier
