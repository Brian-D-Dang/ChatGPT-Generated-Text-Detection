After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read that many times now though - there's too much talk about books being just as good or better then real life stories in novels....sheesh! So what do you think? I'm looking forward to reading more of it since it'll be short enough for me:)
