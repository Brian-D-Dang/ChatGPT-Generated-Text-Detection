The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to understand for many people who have not been born here or read english very well. The language used today for the most part is common sense (in my opinion) but some parts can be confusing so I want everyone to know that you will need a good understanding when reading our founding documents because what we do has an impact on us all... Thanks again Jim and God Bless America! Ron
