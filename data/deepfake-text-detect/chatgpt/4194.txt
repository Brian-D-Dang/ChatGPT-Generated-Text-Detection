I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are very different from those from other countries around here. I like it there a lot more than I thought i would. You must be religious or at least hung up about your religion if you're so into that place.
