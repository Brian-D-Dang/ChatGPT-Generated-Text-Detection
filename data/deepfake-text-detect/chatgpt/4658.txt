The U.S. Constitution is an old document. At the time it was written, it made a lot of sense, and it was a large jump ahead for democracy, politics, and government in general. But nowadays we are living in times where there's so much conflict over our priorities that the founding fathers could never have imagined. In this post I will try to explain how the three branches (executive branch, legislative branch, judicial) can coexist peacefully, but also what do they really mean? And why is everything turning out like this today? Why doesn't anyone care about laws anymore? What Does Congress Do? The executive power is the most important part of government. It manages foreign affairs with defense treaties and wars, deals with people within its borders by enacting laws and regulations, dispenses justice among all citizens, etc. To make sure those functions work well you need good processes and systems: set up rules, procedures, commissions, oversight committees, etc., which makes things more efficient and less likely to fail while keeping accountability. The president has ultimate responsibility as the highest authority but he needs other parts of governments to help him fulfill his duties effectively. This includes congress and senate because both are crucial when discussing legislation and budget issues, while courts must be involved if someone challenges the constitutionality of any law or regulation passed by congress or signed into law by the president. Finally, independent agencies such as FED, FTC and SEC are extremely important since their job is to oversee and regulate various economic activities, ensuring their legitimacy and fairness. They may even declare some entities illegal profits because of certain acts committed against innocent parties, but abuse of powers would result in political consequences. So basically, we live under a system that consists of civil institutions (courts and police), military forces (army, navy, marines), administrative units (local, state federal gov.), and two major powersbranches - one representing the public (congress) and another responsible for international relations (the presidency). It's not perfect as many problems exist such as corruption or lack of ethics among politicians or judges, but overall it works pretty well. There might be instances when conflicts arise between these different roles, but usually they are discussed openly without causing too much damage at worst and only lead to minor changes in existing rules. If anything catastrophic happens, the initial response should be from local authorities, then national guard before requesting further assistance from active duty troops, followed by US Armed Forces. Why Don't We Care About Laws Anymore? When looking back on history, we see situations where the rights protected by constitutions were easily violated, and Americans tend to blame themselves rather than lawmakers who had full control of the situation. For example during World War II, hundreds of Japanese-Americans gathered in churches across California pleading for protection after President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 authorizing mass internment camps. During WWII, Jews in Germany faced horrific treatment because Hitler saw them as "enemies of the state" despite being German citizens, and wasn't afraid to use armed force against them, yet somehow it took a few decades until some countries realized American detention facilities weren't meant for permanent incarceration. Instead of trying to figure out why such policies existed, a lot of Germans blamed FDR personally for signing EO9066, and the same thing happened later in Japan, Italy, and Nazi Germany. In fact, similar attitudes still occur today with Muslim immigrants 'coming here illegally', instead of questioning whether our current immigration policy is actually sound enough. After the war, the US felt guilty for having done wrong and tried hard to correct mistakes using both legal and extrajudicial means, with mixed results. Instead of getting offended by criticism, for example over zealous prosecution and imprisonment of dissidents, dissenters just decided to ignore them completely and continued their struggles believing no one cared anyway, eventually resulting in victory for leftists - communism, socialism, liberalism, feminism, environmentalism, pacifism, anti-American sentiments, anti-militarism, grievances against capitalism, criticisms against money itself, black lives matter protests, social media censorship, endless dictatorships throughout Africa and Asia, corrupt governments overthrowing legitimate ones, growing student debt crisis, population explosion, gender equality demands, ethnic nationalism movements, hyper globalization agenda pushed by elitist elites, massive loss of manufacturing jobs, liberalized trade agreements harming domestic businesses, financial instability, declining middle class standards of living, jobless recovery, public school replacement by private education industry, opposition towards constitutional principles, violent extremism, religious fanaticism, and countless more examples... Although nothing approaches fascism or totalitarian regime in terms of the severity of atrocities and levels of brutality used, we definitely witness something close enough. Many people question whether modern society is going through some kind of collapse phase due to rapid modernization, technology, advancements, globalization, automation, internet access, surveillance, privacy invasion, big data collection, increased inequality gaps, declining quality of life, overall decline of standard values, culture death reaction.
