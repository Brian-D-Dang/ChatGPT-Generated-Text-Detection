Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, at least in my current state of ignorance (I know, that's the way to be). I'm not going to go into the legal details or anything, but rather try to give a good summary of what I've heard. 1. People say that, if you go to school, you have to be vaccinated. I can see why this would be a problem if your religion is against vaccinations, but in general, it's not a problem. In the US, religious exemptions are explicitly permitted in state laws. (I've heard that there are different rules in different states, but I can't confirm that.) So, if someone is against vaccination and doesn't want to vaccinate hisher children, heshe can choose to keep them out of school. 2. People say that, if you go to school, you have to vaccinate all of your children. This seems to me like a problem, and I can see why people would object. But I can't see why it's a problem. The people who are against vaccination generally don't have many children. In fact, they generally have very few, if any. It seems like, if you have children, and you're against vaccinations, you should seriously consider not having children. So, you should be able to make the choice to not have children, or to not send your children to school. It seems like the choice to have children and send them to school shouldn't override the choice to not have children or send them to school. This is basically the same argument as in the first case, but the objection here is that, if you're against vaccination, you should be able to choose to not have children, or to not send them to school. I'm not sure I see the problem with this. 3. Some people object to mandatory vaccination schemes on the grounds that it's not the government's business to tell you what to do with your own children, and that, if parents don't want to vaccinate their children, they should be able to do so. This is pretty much a general objection to anything the government tries to do, and I'm not sure I see any problem with it. 4. People object to vaccination schemes on the grounds that they aren't safe. This seems to me like a much more serious objection than any of the others. I've never heard any good reasons to not vaccinate one's children. It seems like the people who are against vaccination have some pretty weak reasons to be against vaccination, but I haven't heard any good reasons to vaccinate or not vaccinate one's children. I'm not an expert on the topic, so I don't know if there are any good reasons to not vaccinate one's children. In summary, I'm not a fan of vaccination. But I don't see any good reasons to not vaccinate one's children. I'm not sure what the correct position is, so I'm not going to take a position one way or the other. I'll just state the arguments for and against vaccination, and leave it at that. So, I'm not sure how to respond to this. What's the best way to handle these sorts of requests? I'm not sure what the correct position is, so I'm not going to take a position one way or the other. I'll just state the arguments for and against vaccination, and leave it at that. If I'm understanding this correctly, then I think the best way to handle such requests is to say that you will not be able to take a position. The rest of your post is inappropriate. If you're not sure which side to take, you should research the issue and take a side, not just say "I don't know" and leave it at that. That's pretty much the definition of being wishy-washy. I can understand your desire to not pick sides, but it's not like you don't have a position. It's not like you don't have preferences. So, you should at least be honest about that. This is the first time I've seen this thread, and it is obvious that you are not prepared to deal with a discussion on this topic. But, if you are able to, please be prepared to deal with the following: 1. Vacc
