I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it It's the oldest profession"; "we should have full rights to our bodies don't make sense and certainly wouldn't pass any sort of logic test, there are some points I think we could all agree on that basically boil down to people being able to decide if they want someone else touching them in certain ways or not. Now obviously you're talking about sex work here because prostitution is already legal (whereas selling drugs isn't) but I'm not sure pushing this would help at all with drug use since most customers aren't going to walk up to your whrehouse and ask for crack without getting shot first... Just sayin'
