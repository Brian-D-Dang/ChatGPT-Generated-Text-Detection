I am a husband and father of two. I love my wife, and I love my children, but I am not a fan of Father's Day. I feel the "holiday," like most holidays, is getting old. We don't have any kids. My mother always gave me flowers on fathers day and now that I'm divorced it doesn't seem to make much sense for anyone.
