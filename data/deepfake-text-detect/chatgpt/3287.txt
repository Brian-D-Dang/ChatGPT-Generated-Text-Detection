As a gay man, I can be extremely wary of other people for my own protection. I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate I understand your concern and caution, and it's unfortunate that anyone has to feel that way. Homophobia is undoubtedly an expression of hate, and it's important to remember that it's not a reflection of who you are as a person. However, it's also important not to let the fear and apprehension you may have define you, or limit your interactions with others. There are many people who are accepting and understanding, and it's essential to surround yourself with those supportive people. Remember, you are deserving of love and respect, and there are people who will give you that without hesitation.
