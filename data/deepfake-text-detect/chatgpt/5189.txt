I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in my opinion. If you don't know what Spirited Away stands For let me tell you why it's a good movie but if you do you'll get a lot of responses - "it's an amazing movie." and "It was really good." Almost everyone has their reasons for liking Spirited Away then agree with me.
