I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in popularity and critical acclaim. Spirited Away is often praised for its stunning animation, imaginative world-building, and captivating story. It tells the story of a young girl named Chihiro who becomes trapped in a mysterious world of spirits and must navigate its dangers in order to save her parents and return home. One reason why Spirited Away is so highly regarded is its ability to appeal to both children and adults. The movie's themes are complex and deal with heavy topics such as death, greed, and identity, but are presented in a way that is accessible and engaging for younger audiences. Another factor in Spirited Away's success is director Hayao Miyazaki's attention to detail and commitment to creating a fully realized fantasy world. From the intricate character designs to the unique creatures and landscapes, every element of the movie feels carefully crafted and thoughtfully executed. Overall, Spirited Away is a masterpiece of animation that has earned its place as one of the most beloved and acclaimed movies of all time. Whether you are a fan of animated movies or not, it is worth watching to see what all the fuss is about.
