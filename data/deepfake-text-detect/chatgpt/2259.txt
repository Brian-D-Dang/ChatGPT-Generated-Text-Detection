There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, but there is no convincing evidence for this theory. The federal government collects taxes from individuals and businesses through payroll taxes (on employees) withholding income taxes on wages earned and capital gains taxes when assets such as stocks change hands. These monies should be used wisely in order not to hurt economic activity by driving up budget deficits. This means spending more than it takes in; however, doing so could trigger an increase in interest rates which would raise borrowing costs across all sectors - including personal loans like car financing and mortgages. As we approach midterm elections later this year, voters will have many choices at their disposal regarding candidates who want to make major changes concerning how they believe Washington ought to operate. Small business owners must decide whether these new ideas offered by challengers actually benefit them enough to spend time learning about campaign promises before casting ballots November 2nd. There may also come a point where small-business leaders feel obligated to offer opinions publicly if asked what's working well with our country's current political system or areas needing improvement. And, very likely, some entrepreneurs might consider becoming active "political activists" whose only goal becomes getting reelected regardless of party affiliation because candidate platforms affect decisions made every day within America's private sector.
