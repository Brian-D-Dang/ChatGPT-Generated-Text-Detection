Throwaway account, my main is used for school. I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She loves me immensely with all of her heart but she's quite the most romantic person ever so we have lots in common. Aw thanks! It's nice to know the love triangle is alive:)
