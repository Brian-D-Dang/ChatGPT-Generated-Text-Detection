When I see debate about'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about'evidence'. If they shift on these things when presented with evidence that the other side has then this is a good thing. But what do we have in our country right now? We've got a president who doesn't believe there's human-caused global warming and that vaccines cause autism; an administration which thinks violent video games are inherently dangerous for children; someone who thinks guns should be banned from every home but those of law enforcement officers [sic]; others who think it's OK if businesses fire minorities because their skin color isn't white enough: people who feel that women shouldn't ever vote - anyone who feels any way whatsoever negatively toward immigrants. He says he won his election by calling Mexicans rapists. Why would you want him as your leader?" The next day was no different than yesterday so far...except today my dad sent me another link. This one related to ESPN having hosted former NFL players Michael Sam and Anthony Lynn for a forum titled "The Black Athlete Experience." My father told me something along the lines of"they're not really trying hard...this stuff is boring." I kind of scoffed at first. It reminds me of how some news stations carry stories where they just read off facts without commentary. But after reading more into it and finding out the full story behind why they invited them over while also shedding light on some interesting data, I felt differently. The whole point seems to be to get athletes talking amongst themselves instead of letting journalists try to make sense of all the noise surrounding politics, sports, and race relations in America. So even though the show didn't interest me too much initially due to its lack of insightfulness, most of the information found within it did.
