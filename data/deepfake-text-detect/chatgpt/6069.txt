Given that livestock consume more water, feed, create more greenhouse gasses, and suffer throughout their lives to eventually be killed, while providing no essential nutrients that cant be attained through plants, it's a pretty odd idea to argue that livestock should be raised. I think the reason that people are opposed to vegetarianism, is because the meat industry is a huge industry, and because of the success of it and the number of people who have grown up eating meat, it's a hard habit to break. If we could find a way to feed the world, and not use so much resources doing so, then I would say that vegetarianism would be a good thing to do, because of the health benefits and other reasons. However, if you're trying to feed the world, I don't think vegetarianism is the solution. Sidney Crosby, I'm sure you're a wonderful person, and a great hockey player. But please stop promoting vegetarianism. I'm all for healthy eating, and I'm sure you're a model of health. And you're right, vegetarianism has health benefits. But vegans aren't healthy. People can die from a lack of animal protein. Even though vegetables have protein, that doesn't mean people can make up for the fact that they're not eating meat. People should have some animal protein in their diet. Living without meat isn't healthy. And no, you don't need to kill animals for that. There are many alternatives to eating meat, but those alternatives are typically not as tasty, and probably wouldn't be as popular if they were, even though I think they are the healthier option. I think most people who aren't vegetarian do it for taste, not because they don't think about how animals are killed for food. Sidney, you're a great person, and a great hockey player, but please leave the vegetarianism issues to the experts. In the end, the world needs to be fed, and people need to have protein in their diet. That means we need to keep the meat industry around. That's not to say that we can't cut back on how much meat we eat, but that's a different issue. Veganism isn't the solution. And being vegetarian won't solve hunger. It may be better than eating meat, but it isn't the best choice. It may be a good choice for you personally, but for the world as a whole, I don't think it's a good idea. I'm sure you are a wonderful person Sidney Crosby, but please stop promoting vegetarianism. I want to know what you guys think of vegetarianism, and what you think is the best way to feed the world. I'm interested to hear your thoughts, and see what we can come up with. Congrats to the Pittsburgh Penguins. April 26th, 2017, posted in Blog by jamiekot.
