I just read this [article] stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering the fact that if you are a minority you have a greater chance of getting a scholarship for your education. And if you are a minority you also get money to live on and pay your bills, like rent. I'm not saying that this is fair, but I don't understand how there can be an advantage to being a minority in the first place. It seems like they should be able to get in to any college they want to. I understand that the schools are trying to diversify their student population, but it seems like they should look at their merit instead of their skin color. I guess it just makes me really mad that these kids get more money and more help than I did when I was in college. I'm not saying that it is unfair that they get help, but it just seems like they should be able to get into the college they want to. They shouldn't get more money just because they are a minority. I guess that is just the way things are though.
