Hi guys! To expand: Although I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman for example) a woman to their face and when talking about them, I don't think it's my place to refer to them as anything other than what they choose to refer to themselves as. People should be allowed to identify however they want and it's not our place to decide that for them.
