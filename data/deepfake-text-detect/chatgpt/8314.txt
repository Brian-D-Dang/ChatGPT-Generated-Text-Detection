Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for "sleeping around," and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of credit (and she may be blamed or punished if he cheats). In any case: how do you know that this sort justification isn't used to justify rape? And even further down your own list... what about all those other cases where men are expectedallowed with no questions asked; often they have learned as children from their families justifications like these. If we can agree on some social norms which say there's nothing wrong at least most people would think so then why should anyone care whether someone else has decided something different but gotten away without being caught out especially since normally everyone knows better than engage such behavior anyway due its unnaturalness??
