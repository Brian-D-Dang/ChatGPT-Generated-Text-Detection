Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll leave it at that. I'm just trying to give you my thoughts on how we got our first couple of guitars; they are really great guitars with no issues whatsoever (although the bass line is super aggressive) and I love all the features on them.
