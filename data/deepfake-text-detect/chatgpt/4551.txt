I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, having a child is great and all that stuff...but not if you're in the position where you can't even take care of yourself or look after your family properly. It just doesn't seem worth it at times. But there are things which would make me consider doing it though...if I was sure about those things being true. If they were actually possible for example. Like the fact that women don't always get pregnant on purpose (although admittedly most do). Or that men can impregnate themselves too although this isn't common these days due to condoms etc. There are many myths surrounding how reproduction works by nature but it happens anyway so why should we be bothered? Nature governs itself regardless of what humans think about issues like overpopulation. What are our thoughts going to change anything? If seeing someone else with their own biological offspring makes us feel jealous then maybe we shouldn't even bother trying because chances are we'll end up feeling bitter rather than happy. But still, some people manage to put together family units despite the odds against them while others give birth before 20 years old whether they want to go through pregnancy or not (not like anyone really cares about statistics) yet for some reason everyone seems excited whenever couples share news of conception! How much does the good news outweigh the bad news for them?! Did any of them realise that there might come a time when they'd wish they hadn't been born?? No way am I ready to face reality right now...even though I'm already past 30 and no longer young enough to get pregnant naturally without risking death from complications during childbirth. But sadly I won't live long enough to see myself getting older either so it may as well happen sooner rather later. Maybe I'm missing out on something here. Is getting knocked off track every single issue ever covered with misleading facts meant to ridicule other individuals' beliefs? Maybe I've only considered the positive aspects. Also, is everybody who gets knocked off topic simply lucky to find a suitable partner soon enough? At least if I had a boyfriend whom I didn't mind sharing his bed with I'd know exactly what to expect beforehand and could plan accordingly so nobody ends up putting more effort into it than necessary. Still, sometimes doing your best feels better than settling for less. And finally, what does anybody think about abortion? Does it work? Do we try to avoid it or intentionally cause ourselves harm? When will life start inside the womb? Let's discuss this further. So basically I don't wanna carry a baby around until its 18 months old and then wait another nine months for it to grow big enough to survive outside the body...then the same thing goes for adoption...and working up until thats far beyond the age of majority I understand why people become parents instead. So I guess I prefer waiting till I'm made fertile by taking hormones first. Which brings me back to wanting children. Would it be fair to say that I'm seeking reasons to move towards adulthood? Well according to my logic that question can be answered yes. By the way, answers aren't required unless requested. This thread has nothing to do with religion or health I hope. I have three siblings; two girls aged 34 2 boys aged 9 11. My sister tried for 5 years to conceive on her own, she used Clomid, Femara, Provera and Lupron injections, and relied heavily on fertility pills prescribed by doctors. She ended up investing 12k in medical costs alone....only to fail again and again. Usually we joke about how hard it must be to raise two little ones (my brothers), however my mother suffered a lot during her pregnancies and delivery so we're keenly aware of the difficulties involved: money worries, extended hospital stays, loss of schooling, loss of income...the list goes on. We never really went through the motions of "you need to have babies NOW" since we knew the challenges ahead. Why did my sisters keep trying? Because 9-11 year olds are capable of everything except looking to the future, making realistic plans and thinking logicallyrationally. They lack maturity. The truth is nobody knows how it will turn out next time round - both medically and emotionally. Even if my sister got pregnant again, especially knowing what happened last time, she probably wouldn't have given herself permission to stay pregnant until my brother (s) reach that stage of development. And people wonder why life expectancy is lower in developed countries compared to developing nations. Think about it - the longer we get to enjoy our lives, the higher chance we have of dying early in comparison to those living under harsh conditions that dread disease, starvation, war and natural disasters, let alone the inability to survive with the bare essentials of humanity (food, shelter, water, clothing and healthcare). In short: delaying parenthood gives us the opportunity to continue using electricity produced by machines built by unknown technicians; a bad business. Lack of skill level performance, quality control!!!!! That's all deckets,
