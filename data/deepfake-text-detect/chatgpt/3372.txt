I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are heavily influenced by Islamic values and customs. It can be challenging to navigate cultural differences and expectations when moving from one country to another, especially when it comes to religious practices. However, staying open-minded and respectful towards the local culture and religion can help make the transition smoother. It is also important to educate yourself about the local customs and norms. Perhaps reaching out to a local community center or seeking guidance from a religious leader or mentor can be helpful in understanding the local culture and adapting to it. Finally, remember that no matter where you are, kindness and respect towards others will always be appreciated.
