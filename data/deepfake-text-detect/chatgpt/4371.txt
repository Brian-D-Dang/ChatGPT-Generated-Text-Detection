There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is that it makes sure only the registered voters have a say in how the government runs. It also says that no one should be able to influence an election by donating money andor other things such as time. I thought that was just way too broad? Edit: I know of some cases where there were organized groups who would buy votes (not necessarily for themselves), but not really sure if they count under this rule. The same people are trying to use it against Trump because he has never had any problems getting the donations since his first run in 2016.
