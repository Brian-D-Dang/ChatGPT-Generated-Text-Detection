Most social progressives, love democracy, and so it is of relatively little surprise to me that as they have achieved a majority (in Reddit and the West), that they want to implement policies and practices that align with their values and beliefs. However, it is important to remember the importance of respecting diverse perspectives and engaging in respectful dialogue with those who may have different beliefs or opinions. It is essential for a functioning democracy to have open and honest conversations and to work towards finding common ground and solutions that benefit all members of society.
