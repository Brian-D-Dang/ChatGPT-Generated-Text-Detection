First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate. Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I think we need to start thinking about how society views these professions in order to understand what went wrong with them. The first thing is that medicine has become an industry which means it's no longer viewed as a profession but more like any other business - "business" being defined broadly enough so that even lawyers have been likened in this way. The problem here is that once you view something less than pure science or greater than art (and so on) people stop caring if they get treated well or badly because their value judgement was based upon either facts or reason instead of emotions. It doesn't matter anymore whether surgery hurts the patient when it comes to deciding who gets a good bedside manner vs someone else. If it helps their bottom line then yes they will treat her poorly while she cries out for help. This isn't new at all. Back around 1910 psychologists were arguing that their work should be considered scientific while doctors refused to consider psychoanalysis as real medical treatment until Freud died. Then psychology became fully accepted. Doctors reacted just as negatively towards performance artists creating inroads into the field. We have now reached a point where wealthy patients can pay for anything from cosmetic surgery, stem cell treatments, etc., so why not also allow them better access to physicians? Why shouldn't they hire plastic surgeons? I would argue against it only because our political structure requires us to protect citizens from private enterprise which foreign oligarchs may abuse. But can we really say that Americans don't deserve access to safe procedures? That's simply ludicrous! There needs to be some regulation here. And there has been, but hardly anyone seems aware of it because those regulations have mostly targeted poor minorities rather than rich white women. Second is the notion that higher ed should serve students well rather than delivering knowledge cheaply. Higher Ed must return to serving its original purpose: teaching future leaders. As Chris Hedges put it recently, college graduates are no different than factory workers who go through seven years of training and live under conditions similar to indentured servants in preindustrial Europe working 12 hours a day 6 days a week for 13 months getting little more than food, shelter, clothing, healthcare and, often times, college tuition paid back over 25-40years. Does anyone ever tell them to thank God that they got a degree? No one tells them to feel lucky that they got free money. Yet every time they turn around, the government gives employers another argument to justify cutting benefits such as health insurance and retirement plans so they won't have to offer these things to employees or make up costs by hiking prices; yet many companies still do exactly that. So colleges continue to train future wage slaves who graduate 100k in debt without knowing how to perform basic functions beyond finding information online. College professors, especially tenure track ones, aren't looking for debate or critical thinking skills because research shows that most academic jobs require neither. So where does the blame lie? The bankers, Wall St brokers, hedge fund managers...no doubt. They're great at engineering complex financial schemes but none of them seem to know how markets actually functioned before deregulation started happening mid 2000s. However the responsibility must rest with educators too since theorists like John Dewey argued decades ago that schools could teach children deeper moral values and create a productive populace capable of contributing to a stable society and economy. Maybe he had it right afterall. A few weeks ago I read James Surowiecki's book titled called "Wages Of Worry" He argues for making universities operate much like public utilities so they can provide more economic opportunity to everyone including poorer peoples. Educators should learn manufacturing techniques, cook meals, run recycling centers and clean bathrooms (just as janitors did during WW2). They should teach courses in entrepreneurship and economics to prepare tech educated young people for employment. They should teach classes on media literacy and empower local communities to take control of cities. Schools should be places where kids learn how to use tools safely, fix broken appliances, repair bikes and fault find electrical wiring. Instead they spend millions fixing gym equipment and building endless structures that nobody uses. Colleges should employ service oriented activities like cooking home ec classes and knitting instruction with teachers instead of spending vast sums on expensive buildings. A community center or music venue might cost twice as much as a school to build but it'd last forever whereas unless the city invests heavily in the stadium, library, pool, swimming lessons, soccer fields, basketball courts and football field it will likely die soon because taxpayers always want the newest (or biggest) facility. Without proper planning on educating youth properly, we risk losing the next generation of leaders. Let me repeat myself: Future leaders must receive adequate training and start earning meaningful salaries. When colleges act responsibly the myth of meritocracy starts going away and begins disappearing.
