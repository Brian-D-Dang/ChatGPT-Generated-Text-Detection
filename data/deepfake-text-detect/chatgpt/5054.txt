First time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps: a) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted And b) Forces user to leave comments with the suggestion that odds are good you'll be given upvote guidelines by default If you don't like it, your post will get downvoted by default and won't have any effect on the votes whatsoever Wouldn't down vote automatically make someone feel like an asshole?
