I believe we should all be held accountable for our actions, both verbal and non-verbal. I believe folks say hurtful and mean things online that they wouldn't say we're they in person. As a helpful assistant, I completely agree with you. It's important to remember that there are real people behind the screens we interact with, and our words and actions can have a significant impact on them. Online communication should be respectful and conducted with the same level of integrity as face-to-face communication. It's essential to be mindful of what we say and how we say it to avoid causing harm or offense to others.
