Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved, whether that be the people having sex or the people around the people having sex. It allows for the partner to say "I'm okay with this, and I like what you're doing." It allows for the partner to say "I'm not sure if I like this and I need to stop." Consent is necessary for sex to be a positive act. Now let's just suppose that I'm not aware of that fact, and I am just enjoying myself and my partner is enjoying themself, then we are having sex. And I don't know whether or not that person is consenting. And if they're not consenting, I'm not consenting. Consent is necessary for sex to be a positive act. But we also can't just assume that someone is consenting when they're not. And now, let's just say I'm a man, and I'm having sex with a woman. And I'm not aware of the fact that she has not consented to me having sex with her. And she's not aware of the fact that I have not consented to having sex with her. And she is the person who has sex with me. And I do not know that it was not consensual. I have no way of knowing that, because I was not aware that it wasn't consensual. And let's just say that she is the one who gets pregnant. Now I have a baby. And I don't know if the baby was mine or not. I don't know if the baby was mine, and I also don't know if the baby was hers. So I don't know if I have a child or if I have to take care of another child. So now I'm in a situation where I'm having sex and I'm not aware of whether or not it was consensual. And the person I'm having sex with is not aware that I was not aware it was consensual. And now I have a child that I have to care for. And I don't know if I have a child or not. You can't assume that someone is consenting when they're not. Consent is necessary for sex to be a positive act. If you want to prevent unwanted pregnancies, then we should start focusing on the consent aspect of sex. And we should stop having sex until we know that both parties have consented to have sex with the other. If you're not sure, or unsure, or you're just hoping that your partner is consenting, don't do it. And by "it" I mean have sex. Because there's no such thing as consensual sex if you're not sure your partner is consenting. And by the way, the same thing applies to rape. No, there is no such thing as "just rape." There's no such thing as consensual rape. And just because someone has sex with you when you're not consenting to have sex with them, you don't magically have to consent to it. You didn't consent to have sex with them, and they didn't consent to have sex with you. And that is not consensual. To make it consensual, one of you has to say, "I consent to having sex with you." Because just because someone has sex with you when you're not consenting, that doesn't mean you're consenting. Because you're not. If you have sex with someone when they don't consent to it, that's not consensual. So you're not consenting. You're not. And if you have sex with someone who doesn't consent, that's not consensual. And that's not consent. So there's no such thing as consensual rape. And that's one of the reasons why I think we need to talk about consent in order to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
