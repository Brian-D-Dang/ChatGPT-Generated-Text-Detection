Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll keep this post updated with things I've covered and people I've spoken to. This is more for my own reference than anything. Thanks for the feedback, I'll keep this updated. The map feels a bit large and I'm not sure if it's a good idea to put all the key mechanics on one map. I also feel like you're overdoing the lifesteal mechanic. The map is also pretty sparse and the textures are quite bland. I'm not sure if this is intentional, but it might be better to spend some more time detailing the map. The map is also too big. As the map currently stands, I'd advise you to split it up into a few different maps. It's not just the map's size, but it's also the space between the gimmicks that makes it feel too big. The map's not too big. The space between the gimmicks is important to me, as they are the map's key mechanics. In the original I wanted to have enough space to use the lifesteal (which you can still do) and the player can use the lifesteal to climb up the towers, but I also wanted the player to be able to kill them at any point in time, so I added the choke points. I'm not really into the lifesteal mechanic though. I don't know what I should change it to, but I might find a way to change it to make it more fun for me and the player.

As the map currently stands, I'd advise you to split it up into a few different maps. I don't think it's too big, but that's just my opinion. I'm not sure about the space between the gimmicks, but I'll look into that. The lifesteal isn't really that fun. I might find a way to change it, but I don't know what I should change it to. I'm not sure what to say about the lifesteal mechanic, I never really liked it myself. If you remove the lifesteal mechanic entirely, the map still works (although it's a bit more simple), so you could try out that. It might work better than the lifesteal mechanic. I agree about the lifesteal mechanic. I'll remove it and test the map out, but I'm not sure if I should get rid of the rest of the gimmicks or keep them in and add something else. I'll have a look at the lifesteal mechanic when I have time. I'm not really sure how to fix the lifesteal mechanic, I'm considering adding in a feature that allows the player to kill the enemies with the lifesteal gimmick, but I'm not sure how to do it.
