EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one thing that helps us as spec writers is the fact we're not on either end of the spectrum, which allows for some objectivity - does anyone else agree with this? I was writing something about how it's difficult when you know what someone IS like from another source (like your own life) and then try to portray them differently as characters. For instance, if you write about a nice person who has a mean streak and says bad things behind people's backs just because they want everyone to like them, that would seem pretty shallow or weird to me. It feels unrealistic even though many people have similar "qualities." But maybe I'm wrong... do other authors struggle with these problems too? I tend to rework lines I've already written before, making sure everything flows well together still makes sense. Which means there are times where certain scenes get repeated by accident! The only way around it is rewriting entire sections at once until they flow smoothly. This takes up quite a bit of time since I don't really outline anything, so sometimes I have no idea why I wrote a particular scene again lol.
