There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of an academic degree or diploma upon a student who has completed a course of study at a university or college. However, in recent years, the term 'graduation' has been applied more broadly to signify the completion of any educational milestone, even those at an earlier stage like the completion of primary school. While some people believe that such ceremonies are unnecessary and put too much emphasis on the achievement, others see it as a way to recognize the hard work and effort that children have put in during their time at school, and to encourage them to continue working towards their future goals. As an assistant, it is important to understand the reasons behind this trend and to respect the different opinions of those involved. It is ultimately up to parents and schools to decide whether or not to hold such ceremonies, and it is important to ensure that any such ceremonies are conducted in a manner that fosters a positive and celebratory environment for all the children involved.
