I'm not sure at what point people stopped thinking about the ramifications of their actions and became so head strong that they believed they were invincible, that officers judgements were wrong and that they had the right to disobey. Whilst I'm not going to claim that the police have no faults, I will say that they are trained in their profession and are there to do a job. One of the biggest issues at the moment is people feeling that they have a right to disobey police officers just because they have a camera phone. People have to realise that the police are not there to be their friend and protect them from all the evils of the world. They are there to protect them, from themselves.
