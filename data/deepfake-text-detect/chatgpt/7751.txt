While crisis simulations can be a valuable tool for developing a real-world understanding of events, they may not necessarily be better than debates. Debates allow participants to engage in a structured, well-reasoned argument that requires careful preparation and research. They also provide an opportunity for participants to hone their skills in presenting and defending their argument in a manner that is clear and convincing. Crisis simulations may not always offer the same level of structure and may be more dependent on improvisation, which can lead to less depth of understanding and weaker arguments. Additionally, debates can be more accessible to a wider audience, whereas crisis simulations may be limited in their appeal and accessibility. Ultimately, both crisis simulations and debates have their place in fostering critical thinking and communication skills, and neither one is inherently better than the other.
