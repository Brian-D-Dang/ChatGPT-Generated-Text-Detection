From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on social justice issues such as gender, race, LGBTQ rights, and environmentalism. They prioritize equality and "woke" culture over almost all other issues. The second faction is more moderate and focuses on traditional liberal values such as universal healthcare, living wages, and workers' rights. They prioritize economic issues over social issues. However, it's important to note that there is a lot of overlap between these two factions and not all liberals can be neatly categorized into one or the other.
