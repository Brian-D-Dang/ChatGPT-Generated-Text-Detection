Would you go to Enterprise and rent a car for 24 months? That's very similar to what a lease is. 1. Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, would be very happy with this arrangement. We live in the city which means I can't rent my car for more than 6 months until we get our lease back. So no auto insurance. Also I live on a fairly steep hill but if it rains there are always people who will pay their bills without paying them.
