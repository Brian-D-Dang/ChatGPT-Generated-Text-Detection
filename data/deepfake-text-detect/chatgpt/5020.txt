Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be done there in terms of what the law says and how it matters legally when you're being held accountable for your actions stemming from a crime committed against another individual yourself. Yeah, they shouldn't have been charged with anything...they weren't arrested because they were involved at all? Checkmate. I mean i wouldn't say they weren't executed due to arrest warrants as well but they did everything wrong
