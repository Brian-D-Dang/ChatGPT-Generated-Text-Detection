I am a young black male, who is torn between both sides of the aisle regarding race relations in America. I have experience racial profiling and understand that there is no race relation problem in America. The problem is that a black man was elected President of the United States. As a result of this event, the blacks are now trying to prove to the world that they are equals to the whites, and the whites are trying to prove that blacks will never be equal. What the media, in my opinion, doesn't want people to see is the fact that President Obama has surrounded himself with a cabinet full of White men. I recently saw a photo of President Obama sitting with his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and his Secretary of Treasury, Timothy Geithner, in a pizza shop. It's an interesting picture. The President looks like he was taken out of a picture with the boys, or with his friends. It made me ask the question, why?
