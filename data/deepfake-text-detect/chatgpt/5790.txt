To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. Having an opinion, however, leads me to this: In the 1960's, the labor movement in America was on the rise. The United Auto Workers (UAW) in Detroit, Michigan had just won an incredible strike, and many workers, including myself, were fired up and ready to do some "good" work in the world. We decided to do some "good" work for our community by organizing a union for the teachers in a nearby school district. The teachers were excited and were ready to do something for the school district that had often mistreated them and their students. The district administrators, on the other hand, were not so excited about the idea. They had a lot of money invested in that school district, and the teachers' union would, in their eyes, surely take away from the district's profit margin. Since the teachers were so excited about the idea, the district hired a law firm to oppose the teachers' union. The law firm convinced the teachers that they had a lot of things to think about. The law firm advised them to think about the following questions: 1) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the teachers' jobs and replace them with machines? 2) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the administrators' jobs and replace them with machines? 3) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the students' jobs and replace them with machines? 4) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the teachers' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 5) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the administrators' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 6) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the students' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 7) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the buildings' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 8) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the support staff's jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 9) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the bus drivers' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 10) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school nurses' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 11) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the librarians' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 12) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the custodians' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 13) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school cafeteria workers' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 14) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school secretaries' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 15) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school nurses' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 16) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school counselors' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 17) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school principals' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 18) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school superintendents' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 19) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school board members' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 20) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the assistant principals' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 21) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school secretaries' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 22) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school nurses' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 23) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school counselors' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 24) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school principals' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 25) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school superintendents' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 26) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school board members' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 27) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the assistant principals' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 28) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school nurses' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 29) Would the teachers' union eliminate all the school counselors' jobs and replace them with foreign-born workers? 30) Would the teachers' union eliminate
