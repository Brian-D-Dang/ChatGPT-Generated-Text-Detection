Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. They sit in their own special space and compare themselves with other animals throughout history for reasons that are so mysterious and mysterious - just as they have always been aware of all we humans do (or say). If you weren't around when this happened, how could you possibly be against it? "Animals do nothing but produce flowers, milk and blood ..." It was a simple statement from a human being meant to be spoken about and understood...but instead, most people simply didn't understand why we would want to honor our ancestors with their death. We can get impatient, almost full-time, and not even think of it until later on and forget it altogether. There is no one answer. No one training or teaching us what we should or shouldn't do. Some people just want to keep growing. Others seek out another way to grow because it's hard enough without killing them already. There is no one right answer: don't move to a different country, find your soul mate somewhere else, or live happily ever after with the same family and friends. But remember that you don't have to choose between life or death. Life isn't like any other thing; if you commit suicide, you will always end up recovering. You will never be alone forever, either. And we can begin to accept ourselves again.
