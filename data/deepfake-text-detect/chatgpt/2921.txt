I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying to me "Obama is so much better than McCain because he's black." This was in 2008? Because if not that has got to be one of the funnier things ever said on american television.
