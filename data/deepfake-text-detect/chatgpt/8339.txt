Bar soap is all you need. And you dont wash your hair at all, you just rinse it. Sometimes I use shampoo, maybe once in a month or two, if the weather dictates so and that's for cleaning my scalp but not washing up any greaseoils on top of head.. I also have messed around with 1 conditioner (usually leave-in) added to water when rinsing out after using shower gel... does wonders:)................. You could try this too!
