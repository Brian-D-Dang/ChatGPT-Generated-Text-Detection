One counter-argument against replacing Andrew Jackson with Martin Luther King Jr on the 20 bill is that Harriet Tubman's contributions to American history and the civil rights movement are equally significant and deserving of recognition. Tubman, a former slave who helped lead hundreds of other slaves to freedom through the Underground Railroad, played a crucial role in the fight for abolition and women's suffrage. Moreover, the change in the 20 bill is not solely about recognizing the civil rights movement, but also about acknowledging the US's painful and complex history with slavery and the displacement of indigenous peoples. Harriet Tubman, as an African American woman who fought against slavery and injustice, represents a powerful symbol of resistance against these oppressions. In addition, promoting historical figures like Tubman on our currency serves as a reminder of the importance of standing against oppression and striving towards a more just and inclusive society.
