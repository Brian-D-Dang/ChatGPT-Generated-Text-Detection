Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make a big deal out of it but I just want someone's opinion on how much college will cost or if its going up at all over the next decade. I don't think colleges will increase their prices too dramatically for two reasons: 1) They are already really expensive 2) The government is giving students more money through Pell Grants which haven't been increased since 2007.
