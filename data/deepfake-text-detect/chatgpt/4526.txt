As a gay man, I can be extremely wary of other people for my own protection. I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate oneself or others based on their sexuality. But as a therapist who's been studying homosexuality and bisexuality since 1970s, when it was still considered "unmentionable" in mainstream American society (and even by some psychiatrists), one thing has become more clear over time: that men have sexual interests toward both sexes; women don't necessarily reject any sort of homosexual interaction with another woman. So if there were ever an argument against same-sex marriage today - which is what we're being asked to vote on here in Massachusetts - then the best counterargument would come from this new perspective. For instance, I'd add two things that show up in research studies of homosexuals at large: First, about 20 percent of us are also heterosexual. Second, around 10 percent of lesbians have had sex with male partners at least once during that lifetime. If you ask most straight couples how they feel about these facts? Then they'll say something like, "Oh well." But if you go back farther into history, where people could not discuss sex openly at all, much less use words like lesbian or homoeroticism (a word coined in 1897) - then you find an entirely different reaction than ours does now. People lost their heads over those kinds of questions because no one had answers yet but many assumed homosexuality must mean they couldn't get married, so therefore it better not exist after all. That brings me around full circle again to the idea of the homosocial impulse. It's interesting to note that contemporary studies consistently confirm that the orientation of childhood playmates strongly predicts adult romantic involvement. When asked why, people will usually give various reasons - such as biology and genetics, peer influence and pressure, etc., including lots of information about prevalence rates among children raised by parents of the opposite gender. The fact remains, however, that homosexual adults tend to associate themselves emotionally in adulthood with persons of the same biological sex who played together or otherwise shared common experiences early in life. And, contrary to popular belief, very few actual children actually grow up thinking that homosexuality simply means having love and affection only for members of the same biological sex! Young boys may prefer toys modeled on males, but young girls may prefer dolls, just as old boys do. Far fewer choose pets. Amongst animals, dogs especially seem predisposed toward social bonding between male companions, whereas cats usually have similar relationships with females and rarely form exclusive bonds with same-gender individuals. In humans too, there doesn't appear to be a significant difference in preferred models of playmate preference as a function of parental gender. Children naturally want a friend to share their adventures, make them laugh, teach them stuff, protect them, take care of them. They certainly won't consider anyone else likely to inherit their genes for future generations, nor will they view friendship in terms of procreation or competition. Perhaps the strongest evidence showing that people tend to pair off with their biological mates comes from evolutionary psychology, which suggests that our species developed certain behaviors designed to maximize reproductive success. One cannot change the nature of human mating behavior overnight, but when enough people begin allowing themselves to enjoy intimate friendships openheartedly without shame apart from how they look, chances are good they'll start behaving differently everywhere. Homophobia isn't necessary for homosexual acceptance. Indeed, it might prove counterproductive. Finally, I think it's important to recognize that while gays and lesbians often say that they longed for the freedom to marry as early as middle school age, plenty of gay and bi folks didn't begin feeling comfortable until college years. Even some happily married individual heterosexual couples experience feelings of awkwardness in their relationship before making honest overtures. This probably reflects normal developmental milestones, whatever came first leading to second, rather than any inevitable causal link between homosexual attraction and selfhood. To summarize, let me restate three points: 1.) There is an enormous amount of prebiological variation in patterns of sexuality, ranging from bisexuality through paraphilia via polyamory, kinkiness, flinginess, casual encounters, secret affairs, swinging... 2.) Biological factors alone are insufficient to explain either female receptivity or male dominance in sexual orientations. 3.) Despite speculation abounding, we haven't found reliable evidence connecting lesbiangay identity to unusual brain structures or chemical agents related to sexual desire. As to why humans develop sexual identities along particular lines? We can speculate forever, but perhaps the answer lies in the following quote attributed to Sigmund Freud in 1914: Yes, she loves him! She really wants intercourse with him. That's all he needs to know - from her point of view. Sex for its sake never gives pleasure to anybody. One can, indeed, almost speak of compulsory sex. Whoever feels herself attracted to someone else seldom advances towards orgasm unless she is forced to do so. - I wish I knew the author of that remark. Surely no one knows whether it came from in California or Chicago or the former turs thumbed out of thumbs in the whole world's Prodets. Thanking Thrusters continued range compared last hits
