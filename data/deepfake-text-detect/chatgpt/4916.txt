I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If this is true, then gods are designed for us and the best we can hope for is to literally live in the shadow of a living god like the heavens above us while growing older and wiser as we age into adulthood. But what if Gods do exist? How does one define "God"? Why would they make distinctions between those who believe in gods (give ID) versus those who don't? There's nothing wrong with being atheist though - atheists definitely believe there isn't something out there that has no connection whatsoever to gods either! Because this is exactly why I asked, because my understanding of God seems to be that god exists so you shouldn't be forced to follow himher
