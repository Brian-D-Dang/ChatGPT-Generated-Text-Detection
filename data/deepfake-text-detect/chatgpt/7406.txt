There are several arguments against this view of Islam. Firstly, it is essential to note that Islam, like any other religion, adapts to new cultural and technological developments. Islamic tradition, like other religions, is continually evolving and adapting to the changing modern world. Secondly, many Muslims live happily and productively in Western societies, where they have made significant contributions in various fields. These individuals have embraced their faith and simultaneously integrated into the broader community, demonstrating that Islam is compatible with western culture. Thirdly, people who propagate this view regularly base their argument on isolated incidents involving radical Islamist groups or violent extremist behavior that does not represent mainstream Muslim communities worldwide. This selectivity and bias do a great disservice to the vast majority of Muslims who live peacefully and productively in modern societies. To conclude, the argument that Islam is incompatible with today's society is not only incorrect but also lacks cultural sensitivity and understanding. The best way forward is to promote interfaith dialogue and mutual respect between Muslims and non-Muslims as it is the only way to promote peaceful coexistence in our global society.
