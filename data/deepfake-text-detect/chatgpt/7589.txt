One counter-argument to the opinion that people should have freedom of religion could be that religion can often be used to justify harmful practices and beliefs. For example, some extremist religious groups may advocate for violence against certain groups or deny certain medical treatments based on religious beliefs. In these cases, allowing people complete freedom to practice their religion could have negative consequences for those who may be harmed by those beliefs and practices. It may be necessary to set limits on certain religious practices in order to protect the safety and well-being of all members of society.
