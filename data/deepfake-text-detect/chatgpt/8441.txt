Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never had someone come up behind me in the parade, grab my assthigh or even touch any part other than that they can see when you're fully clothed standing next each on top row at Macy's Thanksgiving Day parades). I don't think anyone should be shamed for making such an awkward situation clear what it is... nor would most people not want their sexual orientation known unless intentionally trying hide themself because its considered taboo by many homophobes out there so this was probably quite shocking which makes sense why he got all defensive shitty about his identity being revealed but also very hypocritical since we get treated like fags if others find our sexuality obvious while those doing gross things are "just having fun" haha!
