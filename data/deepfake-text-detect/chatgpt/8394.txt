I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any concern about the welfare of those left behind by such an act then maybe medical testing before death can ensure no one will suffer in their last months or years This seems very difficult for me personally because I don't believe parents have absolute right over children and others shouldn't interfere with them unless absolutely necessary (easing transitioning into adulthood). The only exception being if abuse was reported but even still what constitutes "abuse" isn' quite clear-cut especially when dealing not just physical violence toward oneselfone another as opposed towards animals which are far more simple minded than humans who could simply run away like chickens do etc..
