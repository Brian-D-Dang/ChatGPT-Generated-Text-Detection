Partial Delta for uDHCKris. I'll give you a partial because I do think that New Friends works as a combination option, but I think my CMV is more focused on the DPS and survivability of Hyjal's turrets than their ability to get kills so I'm inclined to put a slot into a talent such as Devil Trigger or a heal over time trinket like Iron Grip. The only thought i have with this would be if we add in a new tank tier where everything gets dmghp making it easier to contain a party of dps (a la wotlk) But also full hp tanks are not needed either since they can easily just pop off a savagely damaging combo
