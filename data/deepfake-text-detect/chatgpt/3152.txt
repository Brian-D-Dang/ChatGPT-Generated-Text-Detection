This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in the universe, you are closed-minded. I understand your point, and I agree that it is not fair to label someone as closed-minded just because they have a different view. However, it is important to consider the context in which the idea of alien life arises. The discovery of extraterrestrial life would have tremendous implications for our understanding of the universe, our place in it, and our understanding of life itself. The possibility of alien life has been a subject of scientific and philosophical inquiry for centuries, and many people believe that it is highly probable based on what we know about the universe's vastness and the conditions necessary for life to exist. In light of this, some people might view the denial of the possibility of alien life as a denial of the scientific and philosophical potential of the idea, and consequently, as closed-minded. However, this does not mean that someone who doesn't believe in alien life is inherently closed-minded. Rather, it means that they should acknowledge the scientific and philosophical implications of the possibility of extraterrestrial life, even if they ultimately conclude that it is improbable.
