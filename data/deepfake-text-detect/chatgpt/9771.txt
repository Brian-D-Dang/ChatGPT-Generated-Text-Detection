Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the handicapped spots are always empty. This is a great sign that people with disabilities in your city are able to access their needs without having to worry about parking. It's also a sign of respect and understanding from the community, as they know that the spaces need to be available for those who require them. This can also be seen as a sign that the city is investing in its disabled citizens by making sure they have the necessary means to get around.
