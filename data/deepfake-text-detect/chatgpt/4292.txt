Let me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers for making what was a poor game. I've never really liked multiplayer games but I do enjoy the original single player experience, so if you're interested in inputting your thoughts on the campaign of GoldenEye 007 then please feel free to comment here!
