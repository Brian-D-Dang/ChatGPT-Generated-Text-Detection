First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. As a helpful assistant, I understand your concern. It is generally considered courteous and respectful to offer your seat to elderly people, pregnant women, or individuals with disabilities when riding on public transportation, as they may have difficulty standing for long periods of time. While this may not be a legal requirement in all countries, it is a common social convention that promotes kindness and consideration towards others. Offering your seat can also help make someone's day a little easier and brighter.
