Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later), but have no particular allegiance to the Conservative Party. The second part is that today's debate has really got me thinking about how we talk about politics here at Cbeebies Forums - especially with regards to differences between parties or even within party lines when it comes down to specific policies. How do you feel that people talkdebate politics both online offline? Does anyone ever see any good points from other sides as well as their own political views? It was also interesting too hear the different perspectives others take towards us being members of one side vs another compared to what they'd say if we were undecided voters and had just joined the site lol:D Here are some thoughts: I think there definitely needs to be more discussion around policy issues rather than personal attacks which often happens whenever someone disagrees with an opinion posted elsewhere on these forums. However despite having strong opinions ourselves sometimes I don't always agree with the way things turn out because although i understand why decisions may be made differently based upon certain circumstances etc., personally speaking most times i'm disappointed by them anyway so thats where places like Debate Club come into play:) One thing quite close-minded yet funny though however...is hearing mothers tell their children not to vote Tory then proceed to praise Labour haha:P
