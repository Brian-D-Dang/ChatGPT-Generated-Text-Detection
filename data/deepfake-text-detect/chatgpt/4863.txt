I was first exposed to the universe by watching season 1 and 2 of the show. I really liked them and purchased the A Song of Ice and Fire books (wonderful series). Then, as I got older, started reading more science fictionfantasy stuff and eventually discovered the works of Robert Jordan et al. Oh...and it took me a while to get into ST: DS9 too. That's probably the hardest for most people. It just didn't click with me right away. So I've been trying to get into Voyager recently now that DS9 is no longer on the air. Oh well! Someday maybe...
