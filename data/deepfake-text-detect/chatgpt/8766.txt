[This article] does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article] that lays out some rather interesting comparisons between them and other such 'data', namely, they show that the former is better than the latter at predicting how people feel about certain topics (e.g., the climate change debate). It's worth noting that these comparisons are by far more accurate in terms of their predictions of what we might expect to see from climate policy over time, but there are still ways in which we can provide a better picture of that prediction - and hopefully it will be useful to you as well! 11) The World Bank says 'The global warming crisis has become unsustainable' I've always used this line of argument to dismiss the threat posed by global warming, because it calls into question whether the world is actually getting enough heat to keep us heating up or not. However, like all things in life, climate change is constantly happening. Even if climate models have shown little evidence either way, it may already be sometime before we see any significant changes in our rate of increase in temperature. If we do, then it makes sense to take care to do our best to limit our effect on our environment where possible. We'll probably have to think hard about what we're doing now; but until we stop emitting fossil fuels, we won't see anything drastic. And while the effects of climate change aren't likely to be felt much longer or more widely - particularly if we don't get back to normal temperatures within the next few decades - given that many scientists have been trying to predict our future temperatures, it doesn't seem plausible to me that this measure isn't going to change too dramatically over time. 12) The US government is supposed to be protecting the environment Well, what do you know? It seems ridiculous to suggest that we should protect forests. This is absurd. I'd love to live somewhere with trees, but my house contains nothing else. No matter how many times I look around, I often end up looking everywhere. Typically, I'm just taken aback when I see one tree, cut down amid others, and put away again. There is no point, really, in worrying if one tree is going to die. And yet, here we are so damn close to being able to save the planet. So, when the US goes public with its intention to destroy all of its forests by 2030, we're definitely going to concern ourselves with protecting forests. Our homelands deserve that protection, and so do our communities. 13) Tariffs should be stopped on energy products Tariff barriers were designed to reduce imports of goods. But it's clear that by putting tariffs on high-priced imported products and services, companies are increasingly taking advantage of low prices. Again, tariffs are an unnecessary overhead because most of the business is performed through import duties, which are normally paid by consumers only once they see the product in person. As a result, companies are increasingly paying higher prices on the domestic market compared to overseas markets, although a growing number of countries have also increased their taxes on foreign goods to support domestic business. In Europe, Chinese imports of wine, beer, spirits, etc., exceed exports even though they usually go largely unnoticed. On the contrary, apparently, China enjoys lower export costs because of its huge investment in research, development, and manufacturing facilities. Meanwhile, other countries struggle to pay their own taxes, as they often try to increase the level of tax imposed against them, while in other cases, they try to control the levy to ensure they do not impose any additional taxes on the imports they sell. This is something to consider carefully, since for every dollar raised, the amount spent actually goes towards the corresponding expenditure during the year. 14) Why are we hiring climate experts? When climate scientists talk about "climate experts," it helps clear the air of misconceptions about climate science. For example, when asked why climate scientists tend to not give scientific information to policymakers, climate scientist Stephen McIntyre said: "Climate scientists make those decisions, regardless of evidence." Though an increasing number of climate scientists have accepted the "scientific" consensus that some data does find some truth in some speculative theories, they generally ignore the fact that this consensus itself maintains a strong relationship with the actual reality on the ground. This - perhaps unsurprisingly, in the US - means that politicians will ultimately continue to pass laws banning science without violating the principle of free speech in order to influence voters. 15) Don't believe everything you read on the internet Most of the possible solutions to the problem of climate change come from anthropogenic sources. From deforestation to water scarcity and biodiversity loss, millions of humans worldwide are also causing environmental problems and conflicts. But despite these trends, the greatest link between climate change and human activity remains the lack of knowledge about the natural processes behind these causes. Despite that, understanding the mechanisms that drive the environmental movement continues to help bring " " " " " " " " ..." " " " " " " " " " " '
