I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the "safe space" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao herself. While I know she has been criticized by certain subreddits in the past and has made some ill-advised comments online (of which there are many), what exactly does her appointment as CEO of Reddit mean for this site? There isn't one thing about it... Thats why people are upset. Its like being told your mom died all over again.. or worse, finding out you can only get a puppy with a raffle....
