I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was surprised by the amount of data that the movie had accumulated over time! The question is would you care to elaborate on what you mean? Personally I find this interesting so if you want me to explain feel free.
