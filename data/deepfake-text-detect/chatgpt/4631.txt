I realise that this is a meme one itself nowadays, but as a black man I have absolutely no sympathy for any redditor who was on coontown. These people hate everything about the poster and here they are, mocking his pain at seeing his favorite movie recreated exactly the way he saw it in 1977 (with John Travolta's performance being of course perfect). It seems to me there should be valid criticisms of "The King Of Comedy" if you find its portrayal of Jews or if it has a few lazy elements - most notably a fumbling reliance on some silly portmanteau wordplay like 'zelda' - not because those things are themselves racist (anti-semitic) or anti-intellectual, just because they don't add anything meaningful to the film or elevate it above other similar movies with better acting and more believable dialogue. But apparently everyone loves "The King Of Comedy" even though it never rose beyond mediocre status in terms of quality and underperformed financially. It made around 60 million domestically despite having a budget of over 40 million! Isn't it time we stopped worshipping mediocrity? Heck, many filmmakers would take a box office hit over making a boringly generic historical epic full of plot holes. Amusing enough, sure...but the reason why our culture worships such unoriginal dreck is simple: money speaks louder than taste. Most Hollywood types say that fine art is dead; it's simply hard to make money off something so subjective. But what happens when an artist finally does succeed using a tried-and true formula and succeeds wildly? That type of success will embolden others to follow suit utilizing identical techniques. In short, art doesn't die -it becomes cheapened until nothing else matters except its ability to enrich dollar signs. When original talent scores big hits, all the rest must struggle to emulate them lest their own work fall by the wayside. So yeah, maybe there needs to be stricter oversight from critics and media folk before praising a new release...unless said release can match up to the standards set forth by classics that came out long ago. Sure, Woody Allen took pride in producing a style that audiences were familiar with. He liked playing into stereotypes. Some may call that cynicism, but if anyone thinks that trend isn't going away anytime soon, then I guess I am stuck waiting another 40 years for yet another bland remake of "Casablanca" that tries too hard to sound modern while still relying heavily upon tired old cliche tropes. And none of these remakes really capture the spirit of the original movie anyway. Caging Jodie Foster to go play herself once again after a decade did not create a masterpiece. Neither do Woody Allen's films live anywhere near the level of Citizen Kane. My point is, perhaps a handful of older white guys shouldn't dictate how we view newer works. If the likes of Spielberg et al wish to keep working within their comfort zones, let them enjoy their legacy while we spend our money on artists whose work gives us something fresh to chew on each year.

In recent times, the thing which attracts the customers to bookstores such as Barnes Noble is eBooks. Therefore, they offer eBook readers at discounted rates. They believe that since customers want convenience and ease, giving their buy option online will surely help increase sales. However, with increased popularity comes competition among retailers who, in turn, tends towards discounting prices further in order to lure back potential buyers. Given that fact, Nook owners could possibly see their book store shelves getting stripped bare sooner rather than later. As the competition intensifies, book stores might decide to switch to selling Kindle books only. This move would definitely put Amazon Books into trouble, especially given it already holds a monopoly position as a major seller of electronic reading devices. What then? Would the retail giants fight hard to maintain their dominance over the market? Or instead, do they opt to join hands together to form alliances to benefit everybody including authors, publishers and consumers alike?
