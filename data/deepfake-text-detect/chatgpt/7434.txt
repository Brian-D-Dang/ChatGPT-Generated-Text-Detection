One counter-argument against this opinion could be that animals, including lions, are important members of our ecosystem and play a significant role in maintaining the balance of nature. This balance helps to sustain life on Earth and provides vital resources for us as humans such as air, food, and water. Additionally, lions are a symbol of strength and courage in many cultures and their existence is important from a cultural and historical perspective. Furthermore, as sentient beings, animals deserve to be respected and cared for, just as we would hope for ourselves. Overall, there are multiple reasons to care about lions and other animals that exist in our world.
