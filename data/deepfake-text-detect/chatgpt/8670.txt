Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from 7th grade until 5th grade). I watched all of your videos on youtube and you are certainly an amazing player! You definitely provide an excellent opportunity for new players to learn their game. As far as CSGO go, no one has ever said anything like this in our video does it?
