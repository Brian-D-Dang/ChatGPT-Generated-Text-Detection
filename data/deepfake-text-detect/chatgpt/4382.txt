To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific reason for eating it in the first place. Right? Why shouldn't you be able to enjoy your food as much as an animal if that animal was raised properly and has been cared for all its life?
