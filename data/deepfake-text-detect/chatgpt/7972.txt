One counter-argument could be that chopsticks offer a number of advantages over fork and knife. For one, chopsticks are more precise and allow for better control when picking up small items like rice or peas. Additionally, chopsticks can be used to more easily separate meat from bones, as the pointed ends can be used to gently pull the meat apart. Finally, chopsticks are frankly more sustainable and environmentally friendly than disposable plastic utensils like forks and knives, as they can be washed and reused indefinitely.
