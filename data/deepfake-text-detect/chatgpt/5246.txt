I think its fair to say that most people dont give a single shit about morality unless they're driven by compassion"their conscience" or worried about being judged by others for their beliefs. What the fuck is your point? In my opinion society has infected the world with nihilism and non belief in god, this sub should be renamed "anarchy." Thats why you see religion as just another form of nihilist nonsense. But yes there are many religions.. You understand what we have here somewhere between atheists and communists right? You don't trust what atheists believe completely because atheism isn't true religion, but everyone agrees it's good philosophy! you don't distrust what atheists believe completely because atheism doesn't exist....it exists...but every religion does
