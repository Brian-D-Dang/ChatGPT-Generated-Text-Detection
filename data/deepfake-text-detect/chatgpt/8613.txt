As a german, especially in the city I live, there's honestly too many turks and muslims here. My old school was 80 turksmuslimsguys from eastern europe, which seriously lead to some pretty bad behaviour. well thats not really the problem they have it's just that people tend to think the more you behave the less your country will protect you.
