Most colleges do not require trigonometry for admissions, and do not require students to take a trigonometry course. It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math section when it is not a requirement for college admission. However, it is important to note that the SAT is designed to measure a student's readiness for college-level work in a variety of subjects, including math. Trigonometry is a fundamental topic in high school math and is important for fields like engineering, physics, and computer science. That being said, it can be difficult for some students who may not have been exposed to trigonometry prior to taking the SAT. It is important for students to prepare adequately by reviewing the trigonometry concepts included in the SAT and seeking additional help if needed.
