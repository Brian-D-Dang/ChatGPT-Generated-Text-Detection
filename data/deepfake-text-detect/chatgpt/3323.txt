This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is that just because someone is Y does not necessarily mean that they should also be X. Each decision or action should be evaluated on its own merits and context, rather than assuming a domino effect of consequences. It's important to consider all possible outcomes and weigh the costs and benefits of each decision or action before making a conclusion.
