Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than others. I don't think national pride and nationalism are one-to-one though, I know plenty of nationalist German friends who would never dream of saying something like "America first."
