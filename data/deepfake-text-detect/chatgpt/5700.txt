First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways are not our ways. They see things in a different light than we do. They have different thoughts, emotions and desires than we do. Now, as we start out, let's take a moment to define the word, "dominance." It is the trait of a member of a dominance hierarchy to have the ability to make decisions without consulting the other members of the hierarchy. It is the trait of a member of a dominance hierarchy to be able to make decisions for other members of the hierarchy. It is the trait of a member of a dominance hierarchy to be able to make decisions without consulting the other members of the hierarchy. It is the trait of a member of a dominance hierarchy to be able to make decisions for other members of the hierarchy. We'll focus on the first definition: the ability to make decisions without consulting the other members of the hierarchy. The idea behind the "dominance hierarchy" is that if you rank animals or humans by who has the most control over a situation, then you end up with a dominance hierarchy. For example, a human over a dog. A dog over a cat. A cat over a mouse. A tiger over a mouse. An elephant over a mouse. A mouse over a roach. A human over a roach. This is where the problems start. Animals are not "dominant" over other animals. They are dominant over prey animals. And humans are dominant over dogs, but not all dogs. It's a different thing to be dominant over a mouse than to be dominant over a dog. A dog's dominance over a mouse is like a bully's dominance over a weaker kid on the playground. The bully can push the other kid around, but it's not because the bully is "dominant" over the other kid, it's because the bully is stronger. Now, if the bully is also better at running away, then it can be said that the bully is "dominant" over the other kid. The bully is able to force the other kid to do whatever the bully wants because the bully is physically stronger AND better at running away. In the case of a dog and a mouse, the mouse can be said to be "dominant" over the dog because the mouse can outrun the dog. If the dog catches the mouse, then it's just luck and a matter of force (of muscles). The mouse is "dominant" over the dog because the mouse can run away. The "dominance hierarchy" that a lot of people claim to use to train dogs is nothing more than a "ranking" system, where the animal that is "ranking" higher has more control over the animal that is "ranking" lower. This is where we get into trouble with the "alpha dog" thing. Again, it's a matter of force. It doesn't matter how friendly and nice the alpha dog is. If you are a dog, and that alpha dog is trying to "make decisions" for you, you are going to have a bad time. Humans aren't wolves, so we don't have a dominance hierarchy. We have an equality hierarchy. I just wrote a bunch of words trying to explain this, and I think I've done a terrible job. If you're still confused, let me know and I'll try to get it right.
