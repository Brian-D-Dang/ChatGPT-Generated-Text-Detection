To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific need for animal products in our diet. It's why we can morally justify using animals in experiments despite the unethical treatment of animals in labs, and despite no specific need for animal testing in research. It's why we can morally justify keeping exotic animals in zoos and aquariums despite the unethical treatment of these animals and despite no specific need for exotic animals in captivity. If you think about it, it's even why we can morally justify domesticating wild animals, despite the unethical treatment of these animals and despite no specific need for taming and keeping them. I think what animal rights advocates have to be careful about is not falling into the trap of relying on animals to feel human emotions, and then using those emotions as a way to justify the use of animals. It's not a morally sound argument because it falls prey to the slippery slope, and also because it assumes that human emotions are the only valid ones. In other words, it's too anthropocentric. What's interesting is that this is exactly the opposite of what PETA says they do. They say they use emotional appeals in their campaigns because they know they are the most effective way to get people to do something. Yes, well, that's why I said that I wasn't going to use the video as my only source of information on PETA. I think PETA is probably much more sensible than their PR people make them out to be. I'm just not a fan of videos that only try to play on emotions in order to get their message across. Sure, it's one of the most effective ways to get people to do something, but that's because it works so well. I'm a firm believer in not using emotional appeals because they are a shitty way to treat people. It's a morally bankrupt tactic that's only ethical when one doesn't care about the consequences of using it. Human emotions are not the only valid ones, but they are the only ones that count. Using emotions to convince people to do something is perfectly okay, as long as the emotion you are using is the right one. If you can convince someone to do something good by using their empathy for suffering, by all means, do it. If you can convince someone to do something good by using their emotional attachment to pets, by all means, do it. If you can convince someone to do something good by using their emotional attachment to the environment, by all means, do it. If you can convince someone to do something good by using their emotional attachment to humanity, by all means, do it. You can't argue that the emotional appeals are wrong just because they are emotionally appealing. That's just self-righteous, and it's the same argument people use against gay marriage. That doesn't make it wrong just because it's wrong. If I were to hold a baby animal up and start crying and making sobbing noises, I'm sure I could get some pretty positive reactions from people. But if I were to do the same thing with a fetus, I'd get a whole different reaction. So, no, you can't have it both ways. You can't use the emotional appeal to persuade people to do something one way, and then complain when it's used to persuade people to do something in another. You can't do it. You're either okay with it, or you aren't. How about this: I'm okay with emotional appeals when they are used correctly. I'm not okay with them when they are used incorrectly. I'm okay with emotional appeals when they are used correctly. I'm not okay with them when they are used incorrectly. I'm pretty sure you're over-generalizing here. I'm pretty sure the "emotional appeal" that PETA uses to make people care about animal welfare is pretty much exactly the same emotional appeal that gets used to get people to care about abortion, or same sex marriage, or the plight of the Iraqi people, or the homeless, or child abuse, or any other social issue. It's very much a double edged sword. I'm pretty sure you're over-generalizing here. That would be a correct assumption,
