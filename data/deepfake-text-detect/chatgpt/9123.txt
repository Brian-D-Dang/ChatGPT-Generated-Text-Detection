Fairly simple premise. I'm 35 years old. I remember the Cold War. The first Gulf War. The Iraq War. War in Afghanistan, etc... I hear talk all the time about how false this is and how it's easy to believe there are no unprovoked or major terrorist acts committed by any of those groups. I just can't wrap my head around why anyone would hire someone who uses a weapon that they don't know much about and doesn't have a chance at winning your trust with you. I mean, I've known people like that for decades. But if you're employed as an expert in any particular field, then you probably won't get anything out of it from me. And while I admit that I could make some money off of that knowledge, I still think it's irresponsible really. This is not exactly what I expected when I joined. If I knew how widely the US was connected to the world and what we were doing with our resources and intelligence capabilities, I would've been skeptical about this. What do you expect? You might only be looking at the fact that the US supposedly has access to some sort of cyber weapon system, which makes perfect sense since such a thing happens all the time, but let's say it's the US that is tasked with developing the cyber defense platform. How come no one else seems to be interested in getting concerned about this? And why does everyone seem so worried about this? There is little point at all in trying to convince me otherwise because I cannot see them producing any real threat against us. Why not reveal more information on what the American government collects to protect itself? That way, even though things might look like you're making a claim that their secret anti-spyware technology is creating a massive number of problems, you wouldn't be lying about what kind of trouble you'd face. A lot of people become suspicious and skeptical over something like this because they don't know enough about any actual threats to keep track of these things, because they can't find any evidence of one or two very bad actors having simply used another internet site to steal information (which I think is gross). Sometimes I wonder if we should take extra steps to deter people like these from using malware andor other similar kinds of malicious software that we use to spy on others. Of course this means that we should also train our soldiers to be vigilant in preventing any significant attacks against us. This means that we should send our officers into every office across the country and remind them that cybersecurity is important too. And of course, we shouldn't let these myths die down because they will continue to be part of our lives long after they stop being useful.
