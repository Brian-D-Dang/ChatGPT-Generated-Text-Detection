Actually, reverse racism is not a real thing. Racism is the unfair treatment or discrimination of a person or group based on their race or ethnicity. It can only be perpetuated by those who have been historically privileged and hold power, and therefore it is impossible for those who have been historically marginalized, such as people of color, to exhibit racism towards the privileged group. Instead, people of color may experience prejudice or discrimination, but racism requires power dynamics that are not present in the same way for marginalized communities. Therefore, the idea of reverse racism only serves to detract from the real issue of systemic racism and perpetuates a false equivalency.
