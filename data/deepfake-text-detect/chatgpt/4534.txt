The word 'natural' implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless the term has some special meaning I assume that it simply refers to elements found in the environment or living things around us (i.e., rocks, plants etc). Natural: An adjective describing characteristics; "the natural food" (vaguely described as not processed); "the most spacious rooms." So what does 'human-made', like artificial, mean then? Is it just any human made product? Or can we say that a machine was designed by people but produced naturally for use without having been seen before manufactured? For example did anyone ever see an automatic car? If you reverse engineer one would be able to make such a thing yourself so wouldn't that mean it's all natural and shouldn't have the label applied? And if humans cannot control how products turn out maybe they should not be called 'natural'. Of course these questions don't really answer anything about whether cars were actually designed using purely natural means or not (and even if they weren't engineered perhaps being constructed from items found on earth today) If someone could shed light on my confusion please do! Thank you. A: It seems like your question should clarify itself with definitions:), though only the dictionary will allow me to provide them here. It appears based on a quick look at Merriam Webster that the phrase Natural but Human Made is equivalent to Man-Made but Nature Derived. From their definition of man-made: 1a: composed or resulting from thought manual labor 1b: contrived or prepared consciously especially by design b usually followed by outfrom ct 2: fabricated deliberately according to definite plans or specifications d: artificially created rather than occurring naturally e: composed of materials other than those of which the body normally consists f: devised rather than evolved g: built rather than discovered h: formed through action rather than evolution i: arising from intentional actions k: formed intentionally l: conceived as the result of deliberate efforts m: done by design n: accomplished by effort o: completed
