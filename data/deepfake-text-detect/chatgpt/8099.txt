First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways don't always make sense to us and we have no real idea what's going on in there heads all the time (well most cases). They can be annoying at times because you think it should work one way or another when really that just isn't how dogs communicate right now... They also do silly stuff sometimes too;p which is fun for them! Not necessarily so much with humans though...lol
