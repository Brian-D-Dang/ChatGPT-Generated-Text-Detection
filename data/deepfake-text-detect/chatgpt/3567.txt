Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to Space debris is a real problem that scientists and space agencies around the world are concerned about. The debris consists of man-made objects that orbit the Earth and can pose a significant risk to current and future space missions. The debris can range in size from tiny fragments to large pieces of debris, such as spent rocket stages, defunct satellites, and discarded hardware. Even small debris traveling at high speeds can cause significant damage to satellites or spacecraft, leading to loss of communication, interrupted scientific experiments, or even mission failure. Additionally, space debris can increase the costs of future space missions by requiring additional safety measures and mitigation strategies. In summary, space debris is considered a problem because it poses a risk to the safety and efficiency of space exploration and can limit our ability to use space effectively.
