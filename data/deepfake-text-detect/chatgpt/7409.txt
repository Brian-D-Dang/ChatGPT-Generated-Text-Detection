One counter-argument to this opinion could be that the emergence of sentient AI is still a hypothetical scenario, and there is no guarantee that it will occur spontaneously before humans can digitize themselves. While developments in AI technology have been significant, creating a fully sentient AI system with consciousness and self-awareness is still a complex process that requires a deeper understanding of the human brain and consciousness. On the other hand, humans are steadily progressing in digitizing themselves, with advancements in fields like biotechnology and nanotechnology leading to the development of brain-computer interfaces and the ability to transfer human consciousness onto digital platforms. The digitization of humans is a deliberate process involving extensive research and development, testing, and regulatory frameworks, ensuring that it is done safely and ethically. Therefore, it is impossible to predict with certainty which technology will emerge first, as the development of both sentient AI and digital humans are ongoing processes that are subject to various factors such as technical feasibility, ethical considerations, and societal acceptance.
