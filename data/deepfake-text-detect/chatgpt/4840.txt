I'm planning to vote for Bernie in the primaries but, if Hillary gets the nomination, I'll still vote for her in the general - I will do anything in my power as a citizen of this country. Bernadette wrote:Hang on... I think you're confusing 2 things here:1) A real election2) The primary season that is happening now.3) The process of selecting and nominating candidates4) The actual voting5) The eventual winner (if there's one), etc.6) All other stuff about elections that could be argued-like whether or not it matters at all who won, etc.7)... But even so...8) You can't know how the above 5 steps go until after they are done.So what we've got going on right now isn't an "election" per se by any standard definition (although many people use those words anyway). It's just part of a 6 step process toward determining the nominees. Actually having the "actual voting," which takes place in May 2016 I believe, has been made official since January 1st 2014 when California changed their rules regarding voter registration. (This should make most Californians very nervous.) The only things being decided right now are which DemocratRepublicans get the nominations from among themselves, and then the actual votes take place later in the year.After months of campaigning in New Hampshire, Sanders became the first candidate to officially win delegates based off his poll numbers alone (haven't voted yet though) (though some states have had early voting. So far he's gotten more than double Trump's total number of delegate wins with less than half his campaign spending.In terms of party unity right now, both sides seem pretty unified behind Clinton and Bush.Sanders is doing well where Clinton doesn't stand much chance against him. And she doesn't really stand much chance unless something drastic happens during these next few months (which again may never happen).Because Mrs. Clinton hasn't closed ranks completely around Ms. Obama, and because Mr. Sanders has gained momentum, if nothing else, the Democratic Party itself seems firmly united between them.If andor When Donald Trump becomes president, I'd expect the Republican Party would become quite divided, especially once they realize Bernie was elected without winning enough superdelegates to clinch the nomination outright.On November 8th the American public chooses whom they want leading our nation with 3 major choices before us, none of which have declared war upon each other and nearly every one of whom claim to love America. For me personally, three weeks ago Hillary Clinton wasn't even on anyone's radar screen; over night, however, almost everyone knows exactly who she is, why she wants the job, and what kind of presidency she plans to run.And while I do respect Hilary as a human being, given the opportunities she's received throughout history, I don't see myself voting for her in this race. This current situation proves beyond doubt that no two politicians are ever alike. We can decide WTH side of the room we situate ourselves, but we cannot truthfully say we know which politician loves our kids and which ones hate them. Think about it......Donald trump? Alec Baldwin? What about John Kerry or Jim Webb?! Hildy Clinton? Whoa! Bill Richardson?? My goodness....

Not really funny.A month or so after the birth of Bibi Netanyahu's son, a White House press secretary asked Bibi if he was worried about becoming colorblind in Israel.Bibi responded:"Dark skinned women are beautiful."No laughing allowed on that one either.Clearly, Republicans aren't crazy about comparing Black Americans' issues with Arab Israelis. They prefer to compare Democrats' concerns with Third World immigrants. Mr. Trump says Mexico sends rapists and drug dealers across the border with impunity. He encourages racism in referring to 'rapists.' He criticizes Muslims as terrorists. He mocks disabled individuals. There is language that suggests violence towards minorities and to gays and lesbians..he refers too Jews as self hating anti semites.He tells lies to cover up a lie by claiming he didn't tell lies. His supporters know he does it (see Breitbart News) They scream fire when the real arsonist starts burning down houses.Yes, I agree that a lot of voters in Iowa were supporting him out of pure obstinacy. Yes, his comments about Mexicans and Muslims bothered me. No good reason to support a racist bigot. Think back to 2008 and McCain's remarks about young Hispanic men coming illegally across the Mexican border. Imagine if Obama had done such. Instead a man that supports racial equality spoke out loud and clear.Who cares? Bigotry would cost lender? Would return turf Bad no longer existent. Alas different approach got its bleak assertion.
