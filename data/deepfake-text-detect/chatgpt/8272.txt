I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at their hands or fingers while doing so! In this video tutorial I'll show you my 2 favorite typing methods and explain why they work better than traditional "look down" finger placement on QWERTY keyboards (and even Dvorak). The first method is called Touch Typing - which just involves placing your fingertips correctly as if playing piano with both thumbs stretched out horizontally across each octave key space starting from middle C all up through G for example... then moving onto second position where only 1 thumb per hand still strokes A-G keys like before except Bb1 Eb2 are substituted by indexmiddle fingernails rather using less radius movement vertically over these notes instead; likewise we repeat same pattern again but use our ring fingertnail pinky tip when hitting Asus4As etc.; finally once everything has been practiced well enough one should be able quickly shift between different chords based upon what needed tone (i) level may require because imajor ii minor iii. iv. vvi.diminished viio minor 3rdvii7 etc.; either way having random chord selection gives extra benefits since some music can actually make more sense played differently according frequency levels involved during composition periods: ie major vs diminished moments within single piece compositions don't mix together very often therefore never need trained memory recall processes necessary due visual confusion created otherwise resulting mainly via incorrect note values being hit manually directly into mechanical action causing failure after many repetitions until proper technique will become ingrained.... also there seems evidence suggesting musical proficiency does seem connected somehow closely attached genetically inheritable traits allowing percussive artists born those who had good hearing ability musically were far likelier developing strong fine motor skills eventually becoming great typists regardless age not much difference anyway however comparing beginning learners vision impaired versus sighted kids might indicate possibly greater likelihood towards poor quality outcomes resultantly slow progress:although perhaps self learning techniques such games involving memorization could help trigger correct neural pathways faster thus producing stronger results..but yes least likely anyone ever acquiring perfect touch control abilities would probably endup decieving themselves sooner though forget about trying too hard,what most do wrong usually already cant look back later unless someone else helps them remember! haha jk:) lol ok maybe thats an exaggeration..not really sure myself...lol
