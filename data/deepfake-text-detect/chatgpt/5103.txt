Edit: Thanks for all the info. I more or less quit responding because a couple people effectively changed the way I was looking at the issue. To be honest though, it seems like the issue is that she hasn't gotten back into the game yet so she doesn't claim it's been resolved properly (I'm just trying to read this over) but those changes aren't coming until the next update
