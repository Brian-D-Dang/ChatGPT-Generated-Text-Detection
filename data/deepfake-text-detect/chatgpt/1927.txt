I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand physics just fine but it's very difficult for me to apply what I read into my own work (which is basically always different from whatever textbook says). Well than maybe you are good at solving problems on your own?
