While it is true that politics can play a role in mass murders, it is important not to ignore or downplay the influence of mental illness. There are many cases where mental illness has been a key factor in these tragedies, and failing to recognize this can lead to inadequate support and resources for those who may be struggling with mental health issues. Additionally, addressing mental illness as a factor does not necessarily negate the role of politics, as these two factors can often be interconnected. It is important to understand and address all of the underlying issues that contribute to mass violence, including but not limited to mental illness and political motivations.
