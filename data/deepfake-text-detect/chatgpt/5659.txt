I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately switch their opinions when I would bring up the transgender issue of the day, such as the Bathroom Bill or the U.S. government re-defining sex for Title IX. I have been silent on the topic of Caitlin Jenner, the Bruce Jenner-is-now-Caitlin-Jenner situation, but I have been paying attention. When I first heard that the famous Olympian and reality TV star was going to be the next person to tell the world about her gender identity, I thought it would be a good thing. I thought it was a step in the right direction in a world that seems to be getting more and more confused about gender identity. I thought that a celebrity of such renown would help us talk about a very real issue, and that she would inspire other transgender people to come out of the closet and live their lives more openly. I was wrong. It seems that my expectations were naive, and those that I thought would help transgender people were going to do the opposite. For instance, some of the LGBT groups and leaders that I thought would be proud to have such a prominent figure in their community are not happy at all. The Human Rights Campaign, who have been at the forefront of LGBT rights, have publicly criticized Caitlin Jenner, saying that it was "self-serving" and "selfish." In a written statement on their website, the HRC wrote, "As a trans woman, Caitlyn Jenner has courageously taken steps to live her truth. But in an interview with Diane Sawyer, she has made it clear that her transition is, at this point, more about her identity, her celebrity, and her wealth than it is about being transgender. By choosing to come out in the way that she did, she has actually made it harder for transgender people to be themselves in this world." I understand that many people, who know the real issues that face transgender people, might disagree with me, but I feel that, for the most part, Caitlin Jenner has done a great deal of good. I also understand that her actions may have caused some people to wonder whether transitioning and taking hormones are the only way to be a transgender person. I can say, with confidence, that this is not the case. It is true that taking hormones and undergoing surgery can help transgender people feel more like their "true" selves, and I applaud those who do so. But taking hormones and undergoing surgery is not the only way to transition, or to be transgender, and that is something that needs to be made clear. Some transgender people will never be able to afford the necessary hormones or surgery. Some will not be able to find a doctor who will prescribe hormones. Some transgender people will not be able to take hormones safely. Some transgender people will find that hormones and surgery will make them feel worse, not better. Some transgender people will feel that they are being forced to conform to a narrow view of gender identity that is "right" and that they are being forced to take hormones and undergo surgery in order to be seen as being "real." Some transgender people will feel that hormones and surgery are a choice, and that they are not right for them. In this respect, I feel that Caitlin Jenner is making a statement that transgender people have many options, and that they should not feel limited by any one of them. In my opinion, Caitlin Jenner is doing some good things for the transgender community. I also think that the media has done a great job of covering the story, and that the media has handled the story in a more responsible way than it did with the Bruce Jenner story. I remember reading a magazine article about how "Bruce" was "transcending" his "gender." I remember reading about the "Bruce" Jenner and "Kris" Jenner "wedding." I remember that Bruce Jenner was, at one time, the world's most famous "transgender" person. This time, Caitlin Jenner is making headlines, and the media is doing a good job of respecting her and her story. There are a lot of stories out there about Caitlin Jenner, and there are stories that focus on the issues of transgender people. There are stories that are written by transgender people, and there are stories that are written by cisgender people about the experiences of transgender people
