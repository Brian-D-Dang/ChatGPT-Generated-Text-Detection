I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the most common side-by-side configuration. While this may seem strange, it is actually quite common in smaller apartments and homes. The top-bottom freezer fridge design allows for a more compact and energy-efficient refrigerator. It also makes it easier to access the items you need without having to bend down and reach into the back of the fridge. Additionally, the top portion of the fridge can be used as extra storage space. If you are not used to this type of fridge, it may take some getting used to, but it should serve your needs effectively.
