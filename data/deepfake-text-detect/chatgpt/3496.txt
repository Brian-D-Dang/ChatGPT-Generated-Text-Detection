Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap The idea of socialism and communism is to create a society where there is equality of opportunity and resources. In such a society, every individual would have access to health care, education, and other basic needs regardless of their socio-economic status. The goal is to have a classless society where everyone works for the collective good of the community. However, in practice, achieving this kind of society can be challenging. Historically, there have been several examples where socialist and communist regimes have failed in their attempts to create a fairer society, often leading to authoritarian rule, political oppression, and economic stagnation. Therefore, while socialism and communism may sound like an ideal form of government, it's essential to remain mindful of the practical challenges and limitations that these ideologies face.
