After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the discussion turns to either of these subjects I always find it interesting how little is actually known about them or their correlation if any, so lets take a look at both sides of this argument from what we do know about each subject individually: - Video Games - Not much information exists on video game effects on children or adults for that matter but studies have found some short term impacts such as higher aggression levels [1] [2]. The long lasting effect seems limited though since intense gaming only lasts around 6 months before returning back to normal behavior [3]. A recent study also suggests that gaming decreases empathy due to lack of interactivity between players which could lead to less co tolerance among gamers [4]. As far as studies go they are very few none specifically involving mass shootings so its hard to draw conclusions from those results. Either way according to most researchers who do study media influences there is no connection between violent video games and all out massacres [5]. Some people argue that violent action games should be banned because of the negative impact they can have on childrens minds (i.e. war trauma etc) while others say reducing access to guns would reduce crime more effectively than limiting videogames. It honestly looks like both arguments cant really hold water considering the number of factors involved, you certainly cannot blame an entire medium for someone else's actions even when said person has played hundreds if not thousands of hours worth of your product over his lifetime. As far as correlation goes there does seem to exist but it is highly unlikely that video games alone caused Adam Lanza to murder 20 young innocent lives in Connecticut last December [6]. "A new scientific paper published by the American Psychological Association concludes that playing violent video games may increase aggressive thoughts in teenagers. But experts suggest that kids need exercise, fresh air and face time with friends." Many have suggested that the shooter was autistic, possibly schizophrenic, or suffering through severe depression rather then being motivated by violent video games. Another issue is that although many psychologists support the idea that video games give rise to increased aggression they fail to make the same claim regarding movies, music or books so why apply it here? Then again maybe thats just preferential treatment. If you want to place blame somewhere look towards Hollywood executives making sure movies are nothing but fun with guns!
