The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustratedcritical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single people may feel lonely or isolated, and seeking out companionship is a natural human desire. Additionally, some people may feel that the traditional dating scene is superficial or lacking in genuine connection, and may feel that seeking out a relationship with a professional matchmaker is a more authentic way to find a compatible partner. However, it is important to note that there are also potential downsides to using a matchmaker, such as the cost and the possibility of being disappointed if the matchmaker is not successful in finding a compatible partner. Ultimately, whether or not to use a matchmaker is a personal decision that each individual must make based on their own preferences and circumstances.
