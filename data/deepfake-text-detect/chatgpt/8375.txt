Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, am so many of us not willing and able in this day age when we have the internet at our disposal? We are literally swimming with information on just how much there is out here for anyone wanting a bit if inspiration! And yet why do people still feel like they need validation from others before taking action themselves (and being okay as long their actions can be validated by other peoples' opinions)? What makes some ideas worth pursuing while most go unnoticed simply because nobody bothers promoting them through social media outlets due mostly likely lackluster results once promoted without first testing whether those efforts will yield good outcomes - especially failures which would actually deter future engagement attempts between youyour business vs your target audience (ies) after such failure occurs?! What gives??? Is my perception correct?? If yes please share any reasons supporting these thoughts... Thank You In Advance!!
