I don't even know where to start. I am generally a happy and healthy person. I was raised Catholic. I am not a strict Catholic. I enjoy the community of my church, but do not believe in all that is preached from on high....but here we go...... A few months ago (October), our family lost two very important members.....Trinidad Tobago's National Hero Dr Eric Williams - Father Of The Nation-and Uncle Norman Phillip. Our hearts ached for their families as they grieved such huge losses..BUT WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE COULD LOSE 2 MORE FAMILY MEMBERS SO QUICKLY! That would be more than enough pain for any one heart or mind to bear...AND THEN MY MOTHER'S HEART ATTACK!!!!!! She had just returned home after having her second stroke when she suffered another massive attack which left her bedridden with brain damage. We are still waiting for an improvement before making arrangements. It has been so difficult emotionally and financially trying times for us over these last weeksmonths.......HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN TO A FAIRYTALE FAMILY??!!! My mother grew up poor at St Catherine's Convent School now called Daniel O'Connell High School then went onto East Street Secondary school....where sis got pregnant while studying there. Now how many daughters can say this? But God blessed mommy and daddy beyond measure. Mom became part of THE PORTIA JOHNSTON BUNCH, earned money singing at local events,working for the phone company etc. She worked hard raising 5 children along side dad who took care of them too. They made it work through some tough financial struggles.......HE WAS TOUGH AS NAILS ON US KIDS BUT ALWAYS THERE FOR US IF YOU NEEDED SOMETHING FROM HIM AND NEVER WITH AN EYE OR MEAN REWARD IN SIGHT........WHEWWWW WHAT GOOD TIMES ARE THESE????? This man taught me everything he knew about music and dance. He used to bring his guitar down into my room each night once everyone was asleep if someone wanted him to sing to them...he always did and I miss that sometimes...now though whenever anyone sings those beautiful songs around the house without benefit of musical training I think OF DADDY LOL. Mom also sang beautifully:) Dad loved playing cards..........once won 100 dollars off of uncle Peter Gaskins by counting out card 1 by number lolol His favorite game was UNO..if you didn't play right according to what rules were set forth he'd make sure your butt felt like hell afterwards! Playing games with him could take days......never ending but funny memories........we never played alone together because well.........you see why. You gotta love this guy cause no matter HOW MUCH trouble you gave him back none of it matched HIS!!!!!!! On Sundays after mass dad liked to sit outside under a tree beside Ganny Marie talking politics till dinner time came..then we ate Sunday roast with potatoes and peas washed down by cold Mountain Dew mmmmmmm good food brings back great memories:) When the weather turned nice instead of going inside mom would ask us kids "YOU WANT SOME BROWNIES?" And ughh yes please...mom makes great brownies especially with fresh cream cheese icingwhat can taste better? Lol.....We wouldn't get much sleep throughout the week but Sunday nights were sacredly quiet no crying babies disturbing others slumbering upstairs;) Speaking of sleeping soundly: remember waking every morning early saying prayers before getting ready for school?? Once I forgot my prayer beads downstairs........soooooooo I prayed to Jesus Christ himself thanking Him for keeping me safe during the night..to keep bad dreams awayjust incase anything happened overnight lolol I truly believed he heard me leave thanksgiving offerings everywhere i may have gone yesterday hahaahaa I thought HE CHANGED INTO CLOTHES THAT LOOK LIKE CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS WHEN IT GOT DARK OUTLOOOKKKK HERE COME DA BOYYYS BACK UPSTAIRSSHERE GOES JUICE AT YOUR FEET WHERE DID U GET ALL THAT???!!! Like clockwork dad will arrive home from wherever job he had with whatever amount of change in hand.............remember watching intently seeing whose fingers would come closest first???lolol Daddy told mama once not to worry bout giving us allowance all ya'll gonna need to learn da value o money cuz de banks gon charge ya..."omg wowwwwww Daddy always kept it real yk???? One day Auntie Rosy said something offensive against black folks (this Is Trinidad) and looked directly at me and winkedi whispered to myself " SEE DEY DON CARE ABOUT NOTHIN CUZ THEY BLACK " fml.....Daddy instructed mummy to talk sternly nd calmly explain to auntie rosy what she should really consider doing next lmaoit musta hurt tho coz auntie rosy ended up dummying herself down again sighhh. Stuff happens. Only thing worse dan being talked to seeing does ... Matt2-, type N team7 players NB N Nn pilot NS Party Parks M tips alsochurch was horse). report also starts,
