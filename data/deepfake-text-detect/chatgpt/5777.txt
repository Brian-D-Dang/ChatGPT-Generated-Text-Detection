Linux is a hard to learn OS and seems daunting for the average Windows user. Many things on Windows cannot be used on Linux (Distros I have tried were Mint, Ubuntu, and Xubuntu). On Windows, it is easy to use the keyboard shortcuts (CtrlC for copy, CtrlX for cut, CtrlV for paste). On Linux, this is not the case. It is hard to find out the keyboard shortcuts. I tried to search the Google for the keyboard shortcuts, and I could not find the shortcuts easily. The majority of the sites said that to search the shortcuts, you need to press CtrlAltT, but it did not work. I found that using the mouse is the best way to use the keyboard shortcuts. I do not like to use the mouse, but it is the best way to use the keyboard shortcuts. It is hard to memorize the keyboard shortcuts. The new Mac OS X looks great and is very easy to use. My brother said that he found the Mac easy to use and simple to learn. I found the Mac OS X to be very easy to use. However, I could not find out how to install iTunes on Mac OS X. I downloaded the iTunes installer, but it did not work. The iTunes installer only works on Windows, not on Mac OS X. Linux and Mac OS X both have their advantages and disadvantages. I think Linux has more disadvantages than Mac OS X. However, Windows has more advantages than Linux and Mac OS X.
