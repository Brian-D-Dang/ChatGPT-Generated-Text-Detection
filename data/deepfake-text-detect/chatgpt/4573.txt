I know this is a very controversial subject, and many people disagree with me, and I have to admit, I am not the perfect judge for this. A little background: My wife was diagnosed, by physicians of the highest sort (oncologists), as having only 6 months left on her life because of advanced cancer in two organs. She had undergone surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, etc., but it came back every time, usually metastasizing into other parts of her body that were surgically removed. Even though she recovered from each of these surgeries, they always returned, until at last it all collapsed upon itself when both lungs swelled up like balloons under water, taking everything else along. She died six days ago. The day before she died I took her for one final visit to doctors, who gave her more medication and new tests, then sent us home saying there didn't seem anything further anyone could do for her. We don't really understand what happened, logically. But after thinking about it some today, I can say without error or doubt whatever did happen must be a miracle! Why? Because if you believe God's Word, He said no flesh should perish twicewhich means we would all die once anyway; then we are told in Rev 22:11 "He will wipe away" the tears from our eyes, which doesn't make any sense unless, again according to His Bible, we've been forgiven a lot already, and now instead of getting worse somehow, he's going to take things out of the way so it won't hurt anymore! It just wouldn't make any logical sense otherwise. And besides...it seems impossible....well maybe it does make sense to someone else. I'm talking myself here too much...but hey, who knows? Maybe my mind has finally been opened to see how simple truth actually IS even when confronted with death! Hey, at least I tried....more than most, since others never bother trying at all........now, let the preaching begin..... This is my first try at posting something directly related to faith and belief.....just wanted to share an experience that affected me personally. Please feel free to respond with your own thoughts and opinions on the matter of miracles vs science and medicine. Thanks for looking and thinking. Those of you who don't want to read may skip over this paragraph:) Let me start by explaining that yesterday morning I got sicker overnight and woke up feeling almost 100 better. When i went to bed late the night before, my right lung felt like it was compressing slightly, forcing air through it occasionally causing slight bouts of coughing while also causing shortness of breath. Fast forward 12 hours later (yesterday) and this completely dissolved! Now, I've been sick off-and-on pretty consistently throughout my adult life with coldsflu type infections that cause significant discomfort requiring rest. This particular virus lasted 3 weeks (actually 4 weeks total, including its effect on my whole family). So this is nothing new to me. In fact, the doctor told us over the phone that this thing was unusually mild compared to previous years' experiences. However, I digress. So imagine my surprise and joy was the moment yesterday morning when I sat down and began writing on Facebook and thought YES!!!!! Felt great!! You would think I'd get used to such feelings by now lol. Yet still, came up with plenty of inner turmoil during the process of transitioning from sickness to health. Then, around noon, well within 24 hours post illness (not counting the actual day from where I slept the previous evening), I awoke suddenly with a severe pain near my heart area and stomach area radiating from my chest. At first it barely registered in my consciousness, but soon enough became unbearable. After several moments of panic, I called my husband who accompanied me to the hospital. On arrival, I realized I couldn't breathe properly and was gasping for air. They immediately placed oxygen mask on me and administered IV fluids to hydrate me. Before long, they wheeled me over to cardio-pulmonary unit where I spent 5 minutes lying flat on the floor breathing shallow breaths. A few minutes later, they moved me back to regular room, put pajama pants and shirt on me and propped me upright against pillows. By now, I was sweating profusely due to extreme anxiety associated with situations like mine, particularly being alone. Anyhow, for the next 2 hours, while waiting for doctors and nurses to come and assess the situation, I kept hearing voices telling me to calm down and listen closely yet keep asking questions. Finally, between 1 and 2 PM, a nurse walked into the room wearing black scrubs and holding a clipboard. Upon seeing me sitting in front of the TV watching baseball game, she asked me how I felt. I replied with obvious difficulty breathing and tight tension in neck muscles and the urge to scream, 'HOW COULD YOU FORCE THIS LIFE AND CONDITION ON ME?!'.
