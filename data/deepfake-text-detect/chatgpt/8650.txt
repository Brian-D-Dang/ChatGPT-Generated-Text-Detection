So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But also that in many cases, companies still need to provide such a plan if they're going to be able to afford it for their employees. And this has been noted before. Let's go back to the problem. In the past year, it seems like there have only been three babies born within the United States since 2017, with a total population of 647,879 as of July 31. That's roughly 20 percent more than what were recorded at the same point last year. There are several reasons why it may seem like there isn't a shortage of American workers: the economy is growing; Americans are spending less time on work. The rise of the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with recent health concerns, has led to higher rates of unemployment and lower wages, which means more people are working, increasing unemployment for Americans who otherwise would have lost jobs during COVID-19. The so-called "blue wave" (and some call it the "blue wave has also spread across other states and cities, even though many states don't allow business travelers or foreign visitors to come into the country for leisure or to shop for food. While the GOP presidential candidates insist discrimination against women isn't acceptable in the United States, there are widespread calls from conservative groups to get rid of these restrictions on traveling. A study published earlier this year found that 72 percent of mothers who left abortions in the second trimester had no children. Of those, 45 percent said the period was tough enough without having kids, while 9 percent said it was a difficult pregnancy. Meanwhile, 16 percent of respondents said they'd prefer to look ahead and wait until after the baby is due when you can travel. Identifying the problem lies in how we've allowed our society to become so biased toward women. It turns out that gender differences between men and women are actually linked to some of the causes of social problems such as systemic racism and sexism. Consider that we believe that if everyone could access equal pay and benefits that all women deserve - including governmental compensation - then there wouldn't be a large disparity in inequality among sectors. For example, women earning 10,000 per year might earn 10 less and men earning 50,000 to 11, but 25 percent of men earning 100,000 may make up half that gap. If you want to guarantee your womanhood, you must be willing to take money away from women if men do everything wrong - whether that's paying taxes or taxes on welfare recipients' retirement savings. To put things another way: One study found that almost 80 percent of absentee voters cast ballots for Donald Trump in 2016, compared to just under 60 percent of Democrats. And while absentee voting for Democratic candidates has increased dramatically over the years, particularly since 2000, voter turnout remains very low. With public attention focused on politics now, it's important to examine if we're allowing ourselves to become too far behind. The amount of time spent caring about human rights and citizen democracy is already derailing our efforts. But we should also acknowledge the importance of being aware of the issues that affect us as individuals and thinking about what needs to change.
