I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly relationships with the citizens they serve. A while back, I came across this video on Facebook that showed how a police officer and a woman he had pulled over were friends. The two of them are from different countries, but that didn't stop them from getting to know each other. According to the Facebook post, the video was filmed in 2013. It's not clear where the two were. The two of them got talking about where they came from, and their respective cultures. Then, they got talking about the differences between America and Japan, and the officer pointed out the number of traffic lights in the US. It was only when the officer got back to his patrol car and walked away that he noticed the woman's license had expired. The woman had apparently been going back and forth between California and Japan, and had let her license expire. The officer walked back over to her, and told her the license had expired. She was able to renew the license, and then the two parted ways. The post that accompanied the video said that the two got together again in 2014 to renew the officer's visa for Japan. The officer's name is Jovanny Perez, and the woman's name is Yoko. Jovanny was in the military for 17 years, and has been with the Los Angeles Police Department for five years. I really like seeing videos of this nature. It's great to see that people from all over the world can come together and be friends. The world can be a cruel place, but it's great to see that sometimes, people are able to get along. I'm sure this officer is glad that he was able to make a new friend. What do you think of this story? Please share, and don't forget to pass it on to your friends and family.
