I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too big. (Totally agree with you that it takes a while to get used to it, and that there are some very nice people out there. But the differences are just too large for me. I'm not going to list all the things I dislike, as it's not a list that's going to appeal to many people, but it's an interesting thing to write about. After all, I've lived in the city my entire life, and I don't expect anyone in the countryside to understand how I feel about it.) At the moment, I'm living in a city. It's a city in which you can shop for fresh food at farmers' markets, walk for hours and not see a soul, and feel safe. In a small town or village you might be able to walk for hours and see a couple of people at most. Or you might not even see anybody. In a city you can get around by bike or public transport without having to plan your trip in advance. In a small town, you're lucky if you can drive for 10 minutes without being in the middle of nowhere. In a city you can go to a school or university and get a good education, and if you're not happy with your school, you can move to another school. In a small town, you might not be able to get any education at all. And you can have different kinds of jobs, and if you don't like your job, you can always find something else. In a small town, you're likely to find that every job you see is a job you could do, and then you'll have to choose between the various jobs you could do. In a small town, you will not be able to choose your neighbours. In a small town you might be able to choose your home (or the house you rent), but not your neighbours. In a city, you can choose your neighbourhood. You can choose where you live, and then you can choose your neighbours. In a city you'll probably meet people from all over the world. In a small town, you'll probably meet people from all over the area, and if you're lucky, you might meet people from other parts of the country. In a city, you can walk or take a bus or a train and be in another part of the city in 15 minutes. In a small town, you might walk a kilometre to your neighbour's house or 10 kilometres to your friend's house, and you have to plan ahead. If you want to go to the city, it might take you an hour. In a city you have many choices. In a small town, you have only a few. In a city, you can be anonymous. In a small town, you can't be. In a city, you might be able to walk for 2 hours without seeing a soul. In a small town, you will always see someone. In a city, you can get around by bike, and you can get around by bus and you can get around by metro and you can get around by taxi and you can get around by train and you can get around by boat. In a small town, you can only get around by car and bicycle. In a city, if you're in a car, you can get around easily, and you won't have to worry about running out of gas. In a small town, if you're in a car, you'll have to watch for run-down cars and for bikes, and you'll have to worry about running out of gas. In a city, you can go to a supermarket and get groceries, and you'll be able to get everything you need. In a small town, you'll have to go to different places to get groceries and clothing and everything else you need. In a city, you might have to take the metro to work. In a small town, you won't. In a city, you can get a job in whatever field you want, and if you're not happy with your job, you can find a new one. In a small town, you'll have to work in whatever field you can find a job in. In a city, there's a lot of noise, and a lot of people. In a small town, there's not a lot of noise, and not a lot of people. In a city, you might have to work nights and weekends. In a small town, you won't. In a
