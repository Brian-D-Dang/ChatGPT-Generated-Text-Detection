I think it is the opinion of many people on the internet, and of reddit in particular that the companies trying to fight piracy should "Deal with it" that they are doing wrong. The fact that this was down voted so much proves how fucking stupid some people can be Piracy has been a thing for as long as there's been computers in someone elses house (which isn't very far back). I wouldn't call it a new phenomenon.
