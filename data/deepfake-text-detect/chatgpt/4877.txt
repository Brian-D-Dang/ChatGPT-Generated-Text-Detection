I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several myself and they're great to mine from windows and rooftops but it's real hard sledding trying to get one to stop barking at squirrels. Quote: "They don't need us anymore." Scientist studying evolution "What do we know? What can we say with any certainty?" "That's the 64 million question... is man closing in on God?" he asks. "There has been no sign of Him," Dr. Hawking says. "No scientific discovery that suggests anything resembling the Christian idea of God... We may be alone in the Universe, so our existence is even more precarious than before." Why atheists should fear Darwinism Yes, atheists have reason to worry about future catastrophes such as asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions and other worries. But perhaps they also have reasons to feel better about their planet (which is not going anywhere) and themselves (who haven't done nearly enough). Atheists fear extinction of human race So far, humanity seems to be doing fine without religion too.... It was kind of interesting to watch how some members of this forum reacted when I posted my last message. A lot seemed predisposed to argue whether atheism could lead to moral decline, which struck me as diverting attention away from what most believed: That religion leads to conflict, violence, war etc.. To me there aren't many good arguments against atheism - just plenty of bad ones. If you can prove something isn't true then why bother arguing further - if it turns out impractical, irrelevant, immoral etc., then all bets are off. Also, since god doesn't exist, it will make no difference anyway. Obviously someone wrote these scriptures because believing in god makes people behave differently; by proving it wrong, would be pretty convincing evidence to others who believe otherwise. For those non believers reading here, see the link below. The main point is that no matter where you stand your life really does have meaning - despite economic recessions, wars, natural disasters etc.. However, as pointed out elsewhere, science cannot answer this question either; only personal experience gives meaning to things like love, compassion, sacrifice and forgiveness. Science simply describes reality - and nothing else....
