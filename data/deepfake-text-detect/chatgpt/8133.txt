It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. It also has negative side-effects such as the formation in people who want more power or prestige than others think they deserve (social climbers). The problem is this - if everyone forms their own little group you end up with too many different subcultures which results into some sort conflict between them all because members within these cultures tend not being able see each other perspectives clearly enough due lack thereof knowledge about how things work around there areaculture etc... Because no one keep an overview on what happens per culture it ends becoming somewhat unbalanced where certain cultural tendencies starts gaining momentum while opposing trends withers away before any critical mass could be reached allowing for proper evaluation by outsiders looking at local society from afar: "This will never fly here." "We'll win out over those fools down south next election cycle...."etc..
