First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person I think it is great that the government is taking the initiative to help parents who are having trouble affording diapers and formula. It is also exciting to see new products coming out all the time.
