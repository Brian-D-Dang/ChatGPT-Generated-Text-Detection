Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians and caused mass destruction. Even though it may have ended the war, it did so at a terrible cost to innocent lives. The use of such weapons can never be considered justified by any means. 2. In addition, the bombings were done without warning and went against international laws. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a violation of the Geneva Convention and the Hague Convention which both prohibit attacks on civilian populations. This further shows that America had no justification for using atomic bombs in this situation. 3. Lastly, there is the moral argument. Killing innocent civilians cannot be justified under any circumstances. The use of atomic bombs was an act of indiscriminate violence and goes against all moral principles. For these reasons, I believe that the use of atomic bombs by America was not justified.
