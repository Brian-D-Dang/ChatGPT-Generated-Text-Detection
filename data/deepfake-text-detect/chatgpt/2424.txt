For context: I am in the UK, so that is the political system I'm most familiar with. I am also NOT very knowledgeable about politics in general, but I have been reading a lot of this sub and learning quite a bit from everyone's input! That makes sense then:) The US seems to be more focused on which party you support than what candidate or policy they're representing (from my limited understanding).
