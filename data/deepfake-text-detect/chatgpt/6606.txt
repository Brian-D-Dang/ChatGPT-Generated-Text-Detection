Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than Nationalism. Nationalism is a symptom of the more common belief that one country is superior to another. States, for example, aren't necessarily better than their citizens in terms of economics and of political influence, but the country does have all the advantages of equal rights. The economy of the states is largely dictated by those countries' governments and policies, and often indirectly by their own moral and political interests. Nationalism is also a manifestation of bad governance.
