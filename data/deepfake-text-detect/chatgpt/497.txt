I agree with most of Bernie's domestic politics, but foreign policy is a critical aspect of the presidency and I don't think he has what it takes. To convince me Bernie Sanders is running for president, and I think he would make an excellent president. However, there are many areas where I disagree with him, and one of them is foreign policy.
