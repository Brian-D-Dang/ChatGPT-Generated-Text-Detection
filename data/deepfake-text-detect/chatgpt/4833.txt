GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a room of my own to do it in so 2. When you're that age where everything is great but really isn't because your brain hasn't fully developed yet, pregnancy could lead to some pretty bad acne breakouts even when you only have one or two periods per month! I'm not gonna lie though; having sex before marriage has been talked about for years now (in the media at least); however its recently become very prominent...and if this happens while we're in high school... well, that's just messed up KIDDING JK It might be kinda obvious by now how much I love music videos; especially ones from those days when they had less frills (besides adding dance moves!!!) and more content. These days there are far too many "weeeellll" effects going on during any kind of video whether its a clip on Youtube or TVFilm itself; hence why these types of clips were dubbed as "video vomit" But every once in awhile you come across something which will make you laugh, cry or anything else you can feel inside..like these five Vomit Music Videos below. They'll all be posted together soon:DHope everyone's having an awesome week thus farAnd remember your thoughts go out to anyone who was taken care of due to Hurricane Harvey
