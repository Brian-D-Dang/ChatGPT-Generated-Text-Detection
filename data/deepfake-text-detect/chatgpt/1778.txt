I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the whole thing. If you had been in my shoes back then, would it have made any difference whether or not your insurance covered this? You know what they say: "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." I can understand why she went after McDonalds - if nothing else, they sent her home from the hospital, which probably meant 90 of their liability was off the table (not sure how much coverage one needs just because someone spills some coffee). But going after them afterward seemed like crazy overkill, since there were only minor injuries involved... and even if McDonalds did cover all costs, wouldn't that almost certainly mean that they paid more than the 20k OP spent trying to get damages reduced? It seems silly to me. And ridiculous. At least we're getting somewhere now! (See below!) My mom recently got married for the second time, and there are many facets to the nuptials other people don't see about us. When you bring up remarriage in polite company here, everyone looks at me as though I'm an idiot. "Married again?" They ask incredulously. In fact, when asked where I'll go shopping next week, Mom replied, like it was so obvious right underneath the bridge in front of Ross Dress For Less. What amazed me most wasn't our reaction; rather, it was how calmly and matter - of - factly he said it. Yup, apparently he doesn't believe in divorce anymore either. So naturally I thought you'd want to hear about his wedding day too. The picture above shows him being wheeled out into the aisle, arm raised high. He looked amazing, no doubt helped along by the Follistim injections (yes, I finally mentioned them!). We heard that his family didn't attend the ceremony itself but came out instead informally later... but really, that hardly matters. After hours of waiting around for hours before the ceremony started, Mom fell asleep during the reception part. A long while later another guest noticed her journal sitting open under her dress, and told Dad. When Mom woke up, she apologized profusely, saying something like, "Oh dear God!" As far as I knew, until yesterday morning, they weren't divorced yet. BUT THEY ARE NOW!!! He filed papers last night. At first I assumed it was a joke, maybe even a prank... but nope! There he sat, holding onto his rings and singing "Hallelujah." I'd never met such a happy couple before.... but still, therPosted by
