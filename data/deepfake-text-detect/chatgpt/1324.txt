Reddit is a website, a business, it is the "front page of the internet." This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these subreddits and banning them would be justifiable, but this isn't the same as censorship at all (in terms of actual impact on people). I'm not arguing that Reddit should ban anything. It's unfortunate why so many subs are getting banned - they're essentially run by shitheads with no concept about what sub-reddits even are.
