I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say "entertainment," but I think it's more than just that. Most works of art are made by the people who didn't create them for money or famethey do so because they want something out of it as well (e.g., a better understanding of life, etc.). Why then don't more people make music? It seems like most musicians in my generation that I've met aren't creating any original work. They often borrow heavily from other sources. It doesn't seem like many musicians value true creativity over simple entertainment. There must be some reason that those with musical ability all choose different professions instead of making their own stuff. Am I really missing something here...? Is there another answer, perhaps one you'd give me on this thread itself if you were prompted by my question?
