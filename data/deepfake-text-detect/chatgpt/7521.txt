While it is true that some opinions may appear to be ethically right, it is important to recognize that ethics and morality are not universal or objective concepts. What is considered ethically right for one individual or group may be perceived differently by others. Additionally, just because an opinion is perceived as ethically right does not make it immune to critique or argument. Ethical considerations must be examined through various lenses such as cultural, historical, and philosophical. Therefore, it is important to engage in discussions and debates about ethics and morality to understand multiple perspectives and challenge preconceived notions. Semantics can play a crucial role in these discussions by bringing clarity to complex ethical issues and identifying areas where there may be disagreements in interpretation.
