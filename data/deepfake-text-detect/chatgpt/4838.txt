The likes of ratheism argue that most of the world's problems come from religion, and that a post-religion world would be miles better. As humans, we inherently drive ourselves into conflict with each other over power struggles and apparent differences in acceptance or worship to some higher being (or beings) above us. For those who are adherents to this belief system there seems no way around it; so they believe that life as you know it is coming to an end. In their view, we must all convert NOW! What can't these people see? We already have a perfect god: Jesus Christ. He knows everything, loves everyone, has always existed, never will die, he was born on December 25th, wears clothes made by his mother Mary every Christmas Eve, performs miracles at any time day or night, flies on water without sinking, walks through walls, sits down to eat with sinners like me, talks through the head of Peter and Paul, etc., and more importantly - He came to save us. I don't think I need to continue listing His attributes at length because my faith makes Him look pretty awesome. My biggest problem with "post-religious" Christianity is that I've been told repeatedly that this belief is our only hope for salvation and happiness ever after. All believers seem to agree that living without God means eternal suffering. My question here is why do they assume that Christianity is the ONLY solution to human ills and unhappiness? It doesn't make sense when you consider how many Christians aren't even happy - much less saved, let alone eternally rewarded. So then what? Are we supposed to live forever just because someone thinks they're special enough to spend eternity with a deity that isn't real anyway? Can anyone name one Christian saint that wasn't miserable while alive? There is ZERO evidence that shows consistent good deeds create blissful lives! To add further insult to injury, there still exist people living today whose spiritual beliefs haven't changed since they were children growing up. They go about their daily business believing exactly the same thing their parents believed. Their worldview hasn't evolved whatsoever despite decades and centuries passing since they first set foot inside church doors. Why should anyone else change anything if we won't even change ourselves? If I am correct, atheism has NEVER been tried before during history and thus we shouldn't really expect positive results of its use now. Couldn't new religions start popping out all around due to increased social mobility? Is it possible for them to invoke spirituality again but with different values? Of course not! Religion is THE foundation upon which society stands. Everyone will accept whatever rules and dogma they want regardless of logic. There comes a point where people either adapt to changing times or cease to function. I'm afraid I'd rather prefer the latter option.
