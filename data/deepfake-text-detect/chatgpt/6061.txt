This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special rights in the U.S., why? To protect them from their own actions? We all know the answer to that, but it is not a justifiable answer. I am not so much for punishment as a deterrent, and would argue that it is mostly a deterrent for the parents. But the simple truth is that the parents are in the wrong, not the kid. It is interesting to note that the US is the only western country where juveniles are tried as adults, and the US is also the only western country where teenagers are given a lot of leeway. A recent case here in Denmark has sparked a debate about whether or not the kid should be convicted. The kid killed his father, and was sentenced to 2 years. He will be out in 1 year. I have no problem with that, and I don't think a 2 year sentence is harsh at all. He is 17, and that age is also considered a child in Denmark. Where is the justice in the system? I can see how it would be difficult to take the parents into account, and I can see how that would be hard for the courts to deal with, but is there no other solution? If someone else has a better solution, please share! What do you think of juveniles being tried as adults? I think it is absolutely appalling that kids get a "free pass" and are never held accountable for their actions. They need to be treated as adults to show them that what they did was wrong. I totally agree with you Kris. I think the adults who raise these kids are the ones that are not held accountable. They are so busy with their own lives that they don't pay attention to what their kids are doing and therefore don't know what is going on with them. In the case you mention, I think the sentence is way too short. Two years for killing his dad is nothing. I think that juveniles should be given a chance and not be tried as adults. And I think that parents should be held accountable for their kids actions. It's just a shame that it's not the other way around. I think there should be a minimum age for adult responsibilities. And then there should be some sort of trials, that are not too harsh but not too light either, for those who are younger. The main reason is that a lot of teenagers are immature and not responsible for their actions. Of course there are exceptions, but I think it is important to understand that there are kids out there who are just messing around and don't really understand the consequences of their actions. I think they should be punished, but the punishment should be light, because they are still children.
