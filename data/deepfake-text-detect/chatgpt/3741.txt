Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on the economic side but also on the personal level). However, I'm open to hearing different perspectives and willing to discuss and maybe even change my views on certain topics. What would you like to discuss?
