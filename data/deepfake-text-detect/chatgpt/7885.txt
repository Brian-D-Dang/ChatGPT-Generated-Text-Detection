One counter-argument that could be made is that requiring vaccination for children to attend public schools violates their parents' religious or philosophical beliefs. Some parents may have a sincere objection to certain vaccines on religious or philosophical grounds, and forcing them to vaccinate their children in order to attend school can be seen as a violation of their individual rights and beliefs. Another counter-argument is that not all children are medically able to receive certain vaccinations, such as those with allergies or autoimmune disorders. Requiring vaccines for all children to attend public schools can exclude these children from receiving an education. Lastly, some parents may prefer to educate their children outside of the traditional public school system and requiring vaccination could limit that choice.
