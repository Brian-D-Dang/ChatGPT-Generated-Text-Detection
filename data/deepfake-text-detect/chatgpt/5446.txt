America has accomplished nothing in its history that makes it worth of such widespread pride and love by its people (particularly this time of the year). Every event that Americans have had over the last 200 years would be dreamed up for. This year, however, Americans are excited about the possibility that the nation may finally recognize them too - even if not as heroes or good citizens who dedicated their lives to protecting our freedoms from vile policies like those of the more recent past. The rest of the world looks at America with respect but wants us to forget, just because we have been taught to look back on our American life differently than they do now. The ultimate goal is to begin our transition toward a fairer society where no one will seek the threat of death or destruction any longer enslaved by war, poverty or racism instead of trying to protect what should be ours. With our leaders consolidating power into two camps: those who want to impose their masters' gripes against others without regard for those beneath them; those who feel they can govern themselves freely despite the charges against them; those who embrace freedom without fearing retribution; those who see America as an idealistic beacon shining brightly above all else while remaining true to their own convictions rather than the true nature of our country. We must also remember that such hatred could lead to violence as thousands of human beings gathered together along the highways across America in defiance of cruel enemies who believe that we cannot defeat evil alone. As Americans of every age began to realize how dangerous wars often end badly under the guidance of violent ideologies, the United States committed atrocities during World War II and is still fighting today after losing sight of the promise and potential of the American dream. Thus far these horrors represent only the tip of the iceberg when compared to all the bloodshed endured around the globe since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Americans did not hesitate to step forward to help those refugees fleeing war-torn nations whose fate was unknown before they arrived here looking for safety abroad. They helped rescue refugees following Hurricane Hugo and rescued Americans stranded amid explosions near the Mexican border and survived torture using their bodies recovered from terrorist attacks in Afghanistan. They suffered countless killings by terrorists who tortured sailors who ran away en masse off the USS Liberty ship. They hunted down crime figures who attacked innocent civilians through the streets of North Korea. They cared for prisoners of war slaughtered overseas under oppressive regimes while standing shoulder to shoulder with those oppressed by dictatorships throughout the Middle East and Africa. They fought for American troops stationed overseas waging war crimes and terrorizing millions across the Earth's oceans. They showed compassion and bravery on behalf of millions suffering hunger and disease without knowing there were almost no signs to aid them. These heroes led our country to victory behind enemy lines in the Arab Spring revolutions that brought democracy globally. These patriotic Americans turned aside genocide to fight a war that caused untold misery worldwide. They stood tall alongside the military leader waging war based on lies by cowardly dictators to protect the rights of millions imprisoned worldwide. They stood shoulder to shoulder with the starving masses who depended upon food stamps destroyed by wars waged to destroy nations controlled by dictatorships including North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. They faced down terrorists unleashed by unaccountable corporations whose greed fueled terrorism so many Americans refused to believe until the governments of China and Iran threatened them with annihilation whenever there was silence regarding their abuses. Today Americans are determinedly eager to confront injustice wherever it strikes. It seems impossible now that America cannot serve its citizens peacefully forever. We owe it to ourselves and everyone who supported us to turn things around - for once! Dr. David Huber owns Huber Clinic in Williamsburg, Virginia.
