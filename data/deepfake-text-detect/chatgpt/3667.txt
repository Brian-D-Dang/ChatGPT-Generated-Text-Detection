I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is because Sanders has been a vocal advocate for racial justice throughout his political career, and he has consistently addressed issues of police brutality, mass incarceration, and economic inequality that disproportionately affect people of color. Furthermore, his policies on healthcare, education, and housing would benefit Black communities and help to alleviate some of the systemic injustices they face. As for his supporters, Sanders' progressive platform and commitment to social justice appeal to many young people and people of color, who have been at the forefront of the BLM movement. While other candidates may also support some BLM policies, Sanders' track record and platform make him a natural ally for the movement.
