Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of disagreement among him in regards to religious freedom. I don't really understand what this issue is about? Is this basically a bunch of people trying to get into legal trouble by requiring their things to be safe or something?
