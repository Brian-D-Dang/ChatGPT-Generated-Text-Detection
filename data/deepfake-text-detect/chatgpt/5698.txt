The word 'natural' implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature. So unless there is a God that created nature, then there is no distinction. The word "natural" implies the absence of any design or intentional actions. If you see something that looks like a table, and you take it to be a table, that is an intentional action. If you see something that looks like a dog, and you take it to be a dog, that is an intentional action. But if you see something that looks like a dog and you take it to be a dog, and you never intend to have a dog, then that is a natural action. Naturalism is a philosophy that holds that there are no teleological goals or intentional actions. The universe is a random process, not guided by any mind. Agnosticism is a position that holds that you cannot know if there is a God. If the God of the Bible exists, then you can know that God created the universe and intentionally acted in the universe. So an agnostic can be a naturalist. But if you don't believe in the God of the Bible, you can't be a naturalist because naturalism requires the absence of intentional action. Answer: Yes, nature is a product of God's design, and can be defined as "the totality of created beings and their characteristics in space and time, including plants, animals, the earth, and other bodies and forces in the universe." (Merriam-Webster) The word "natural" doesn't have any inherent meaning. It's simply an adjective that describes something, i.e. "natural elements." The word "natural" is used to describe things that are not caused or designed by humans. If God created the universe and made it to operate according to a set of rules, then we can say that these rules are "natural." The word "natural" is also used to refer to the things that we can observe in the universe. For example, we can observe what a dog looks like and know that it is a dog. We can't observe the origin of a dog or the designer of a dog. We can only observe the dog itself. The word "natural" doesn't have any inherent meaning.

Naturalism is the belief that there is no God and that the universe is composed of matter, energy, and chance. This is an atheistic view that says that there is no purpose to life. Agnosticism is the belief that we can't know whether or not God exists. The agnostic doesn't know whether or not God exists but doesn't rule it out.
