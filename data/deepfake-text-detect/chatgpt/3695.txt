I'm not asking anything about why we self harm - trust me I've got many answers for that. My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is not a healthy way to cope with emotional pain. It can lead to physical harm and long-term emotional damage. Instead of self-harm, there are healthier ways to manage intense emotions, such as exercise, meditation, mindfulness, talking with a trusted friend or therapist, writing in a journal, practicing relaxation techniques, and focusing on self-care. It's essential to seek professional help if the urge to self-harm becomes too overwhelming. Remember that everyone deserves love, care, and support, and there are better ways to cope with emotional distress.
