I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is one, then how can the same make sense that we all are brought into existence for just 6 days on earth? According my logical reasoning and common knowledge (and some scientific evidence which may be controversial) once our bodies die they decompose because even if you find traces in DNA from your parents 10 generations back etcetera anything containing carbon will eventually start becoming inactive... So why does God live eternally instead having several lives like everyone else until he figures out something new?! The answer would either involve philosophy outside science's scope thus an insufficient topic here OR His mind somehow survives death without being physical! In other words He doesn't need his body anymore so its easiermore efficient than evolving again every time along with others who made mistakes throughout history thereby giving him plenty more chances at perfection before ending up as dust himself.. It seems too good though -if true- unless someone knows better.... Or maybe QM theory could help explaining things by adding extra dimensions beyond space mass making matter immortal while non material entities such us consciousness stay "norm" where everything isn't visible yet exists due quantum entanglement between two particles separated over light years!!.............Hmmm possibly:)..........
