This one seems so obvious to me but I'll provide the basic points: It is a person's right to do whatever they want with their own body so long as noone else gets hurt. (I'm leaving out "sick" and such because that would limit some things.) The main argument against it, from what i've found at least, are religious reasons of God will not allow us into heavenbe saved if we have had an abortion or used birth control... Fair enough, thanks for your input man
