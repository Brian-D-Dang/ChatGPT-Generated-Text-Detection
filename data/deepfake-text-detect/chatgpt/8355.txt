So, one thing that I have to preface this with is that I see both (all) sexes as equal, outside of a few natural sexual dimorphisms (Genitalia, ability to have children and so on). I am not saying we are the same. No man has ever had his genital organs removed for health reasons but if you did then it would no longer be true - provided there were some way in which your gender could still differentiate between us all!.................... ........... (yes men can get their genitals cut off too!)
