I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost magical all of a sudden. Ah yes. I was looking at some vids about this and came across this article that talks about how magic works. It sounds like you are making it out to be something real.
