Estimates show that the average american uses around 4 times the resources that the planet could support, if everyone was an American. These numbers are somewhat lower in Western Europe, since here people actually take public transportation. But, there is still a long way to go before we're using our resources in a sustainable manner. We need to start thinking about the environment before the environment starts to think about us. Because of this we have come up with a little game that we have decided to call 'the 3 r's'. This game is intended to help people understand that the world is a limited resource that we all need to work on, to keep it going. You start with a cup of sand (a person) and then you have to count how many people it will take for it to run out (recycle). If the number of people you need is less than 3 then you have successfully won the game. If the number of people you need is more than 3 then you have to start all over again, because you have not learned to use resources efficiently. This game can help teach you to think about how many times you are using a resource for the same thing. In other words, it will help you understand how many resources you need to use in order to do a certain action. For example, if you want to use a paper to write something you need to use at least three of them because it takes at least three times to write down the same thing. On the other hand, if you want to eat dinner you only need to use one pot, one plate, one glass and one spoon, because you are not going to use that much food. Even though you use only one plate, one glass and one spoon for dinner you should remember to wash them afterwards, because if you don't the next person who uses them will not be able to wash them. This means that you are not only being selfish, you are also being inconsiderate. In a world where we are using up all of our resources it is important to be able to see things like this. This game is fun and it's also educational. It can help us understand that we should always try to be as green as possible. It is important to understand how we can help the environment and be more responsible with our resources. We are the future. The generation that is going to have to clean up the mess that the previous generations have made. We are the generation that is going to have to fix all of the things that our parents and grandparents have broken. We are the generation that is going to have to decide if our planet will be a nice place to live in for the future generations. We are the generation that has to deal with all of the consequences of this planet being over populated. We are the generation that has to decide if the environment is going to survive or not. We are the generation that has to decide if we are going to be like the people who don't care about the environment or the ones who do care about it. And, we are the generation that is going to have to think about all of these things before it's too late. The 3 R's is a game that can help people think about how many resources they are using before they use them. It is important to think about the environment and to think about the resources before it's too late, because, if we don't, we are going to lose our planet.
