WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in life are people who have accomplished great things and made a positive difference in the world. People like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, and so many more. I admire these people because they had a vision of something better and they were willing to put their lives on the line to make it a reality. They were selfless in their devotion to making the world a better place, and they inspired countless others around them to do the same. Another person that I look up to is my grandfather. He was an amazing man who always put others before himself. He was kind and compassionate, but also firm and wise. He taught me so many valuable lessons about life, like to be humble and kind, to always stand up for what is right, and to never give up. He showed me how to love and care for others, no matter their background or beliefs. His actions spoke louder than words, and he always put his family first. The last person that I look up to is my mother. She has been the rock of our household since I was a child. She has always been there for me when I needed her, and she has done so much for our family. She has worked hard to provide for us, and she has sacrificed so much for us. She is strong and independent, yet loving and understanding. She has taught me to be a strong woman and to never give up on my dreams. She is an inspiration and a role model to me, and I will always look up to her.
