GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job yet so it would be CURRENTLY impossible for me to do this 2. It is really hard when no one in your immediate circle of friends or people you know are doing anything about global warming 3. People believe lies like "global warming isn't real" because they want that technology I think the point was more along the lines of buying things second hand rather than new...
