I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with lamb but first let's talk about lamb - it is one of the most delicious meats. What do you think? What should lamb be roasted or cooked in, what kind of lamb does the best thing here? It depends on what type of lamb you buy at the supermarket - lamb can usually be boiled under heat lamps so it will taste better than cooked in ovens too. You don't need a roast turkey dinner for lamb chops (or chicken) as they're very versatile. Lamb cooking is not necessarily used mainly by restaurants where there are lots of recipes available online though - just look out for lamb dinners that use chicken instead. There are plenty of different ways around it if you know your favourite restaurant has lamb butchering machines. On our previous visit to France we found lamb dishes such as lamb soup and lamb stew made using lamb stock mixed together into a bread pudding which tasted pretty good even when cooked properly.
