While it is true that the term "hipster" has been used in various ways, it is clear that a subculture does exist around the values and aesthetics associated with this term. This includes a preference for vintage fashion, artisanal goods, indie music, and a rejection of mainstream culture. These values unite people across diverse backgrounds, allowing them to form connections and communities. Moreover, the term "hipster" has been embraced by many individuals who identify with this subculture, making it a meaningful label for self-expression and group identity. Thus, it is inaccurate to dismiss modern-day hipsters as an abstract or non-existent phenomenon.
