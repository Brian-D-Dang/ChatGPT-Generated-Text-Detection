I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. You can't win an argument against a free trade agreement with Russia by saying we should ban Russia from acquiring missiles or bombs because Moscow has invaded Ukraine.
