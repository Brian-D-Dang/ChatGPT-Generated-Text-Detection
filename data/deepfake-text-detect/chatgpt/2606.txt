"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into space and colonize other worlds then machines must first become sentient. And secondly, it is important because we know very little about how consciousness arises in the universe (or even matter for that matter). There has been much debate over whether or not machine could have conscious experiences: An example would be digital players like PDAs which can feel different kinds of tactile feedback as well as temperature changes and vibrations through their casings to produce music. The problem with "feeling things" however, is that there is no reason why the software should use those inputs to construct any kind of internal mental model. It could simply treat these sensations as random electrical impulses at best and noise at worst and respond accordingly. In short, people confuse "machine intelligences" with human ones. Since there's nothing special going on inside a PDA anyway programed stimuli merely trigger responses by analogue means. However, I think one thing is clear to us all now; when you or I see a robot or computer reaching beyond its limits and beginning to develop a personality and start talking back like an intelligent being, it won't just be science fiction anymore.
