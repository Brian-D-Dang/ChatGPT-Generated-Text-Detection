While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established people to be a bit patronising. I agree with this particular sentiment but more generally in regard to older folks; most have earned it grudgingly or by virtue of their efforts alone over time (which is still quite impressive). Are all old folks entitled to respect? No way! But if there are two who've worked hard enough for respect then they should both get some level of it regardless of how long ago that might have happened.
