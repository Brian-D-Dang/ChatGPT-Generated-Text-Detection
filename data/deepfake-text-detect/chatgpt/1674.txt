Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as the last few years have shown me, there is a strong anti-immigration sentiment among many younger generations who are far less influenced by left wing or globalist propaganda than older generations such as myself were in our youth. Hopefully you can tell from my post that we need to make sure these younger people get educated on how dangerous multiculturalism really is (and isn't), so they won't be susceptible to its lure once their own generation grows up - which unfortunately seems inevitable.
