Hi CMV! A recent post on AskReddit about homosexuality and pedophilia being a choice or not led me to this thought that BOTH homosexuality and heterosexuality are choice made by someone who is a part of the child. I understand that there could be biological reasons for both, but if it were true than why does no one ever come out as gay? Is pedophilic sex a sexual preference just like any other? Why do people choose to have'same-sex' relations with children when they can also find adults willing to engage in these things? (this may seem like an odd question) Do people really think that their sexuality doesn't change over time? And, if so, how then would you explain those movies where characters go through multiple transitions between different genders throughout childhood? (from tv shows such as twilight and nick fury?) If all of these questions sound reasonable perhaps my real concern here though is what kind of message does it send to our youth that says "You don't need to live up to anyone else's expectations" - especially ones set by Christianity. It seems very hypocritical to teach kids otherwise because afterall we know from experience that pretty much everyone has some sort of inhibition against doing something that isn't socially acceptablenormal, even though most people would tell themselves repeatedly that they shouldn't care at least AS MUCH about society's opinion as others might. I mean sure maybe once or twice early on we have good intentions saying "hey look guys i'm doing this thing because its nice...."but...we quickly learn that kinda stuff gets us nowhere fast. We either get laughed at or worse we start looking around wondering who will hate us more now - parents - teachers or peers?! What happens next time we try something like that?? Does nobody notice nor remember whats happened before...? Or did you actually can talk yourself into believing your actions are ok and justified?? This morning a boy came to school asking his teacher if he could take off his shirt since he was hot: (She said yes. Not long afterwards another kid told him that he had been hitting on girls in class earlier and she wasn't okay with that which lead her to ask him why he did it. He told her that he found them attractive and wanted to make fun of what everybody thinks "girls suck" (or words to that effect). (apparently he didn't realize it takes 2 to do that type of joke!) So again..do we give consent to eachothers choices just so everything stays normal? Shouldn't kids who struggle with behavioral issues always be looked upon more closely so we figure out what needs fixing instead of telling ourselves its fine because "they're still growing"? There must be other ways to handle situations besides the easy route of letting boys wear shirts every day because thats clearly going too far. If not wouldnt all elementary schools require students to have uniforms!!!????? For all the times where Im totally right during puberty we've got plenty of opportunities later down the road to talk to others personally responsible for our development. How many times did I hear friends say things along the lines of "Well im glad i dont feel anything cause i knew i'd never act on it!"? And finally,,why did God pick Adam Eve - two sinful people - to represent mankind? He shoulda picked somebody innocent single person with nothing wrong with their backside. (geezus christ!!) Couldnt he have simply created humans without sinning. Maybe he chose asexuals or non-reprobate types??? We cant help seeing Biblical parallels in stories so often that we automatically assume they have to exist somewhere. But hey who am I kidding...i believe hell exists so if you dont want to believe it then I guess that makes sense:P) Thanks for reading folks. Its getting late here and I gotta work soon so hopefully I'll have lots tomorrow to answer all of these questions! I hope you enjoy them as well! As for me.....Im gonna keep trying:) A: Could choosing these behaviors be evidence that the individual believes they cannot control their behavior due to external factors? That they are trapped within their own minds? Such as depression or bipolar disorder? Would Bible based religion address this issue perhaps better than parenting methods, because after all, God knows best? Do families become dysfunctional if members fail to express emotions towards others leading a family member to embrace destructive behaviors? Are some individuals genetically predisposed toward addiction for instance, resulting in a chemical imbalance in the brain that causes addictive disease? Would this genetic predisposition possibly affect character traits or personality disposition, thus creating personal dysfunction? Can parents effectively raise functional individuals if their own personalities prevent their ability to provide effective discipline and guidance? One theory holds that evolution creates challenges to survival, and that offspring inherit characteristics that allow them to survive despite these evolutionary pressures. Some theorists claim that human beings are bodies oriented towards reproduction; others say they are brains oriented towards social interaction. The premise of the latter goes further in claiming that homo sapiens evolved primarily as a result of intense competition among competing tribes for the brafittejesteltThe rate seclongline.
