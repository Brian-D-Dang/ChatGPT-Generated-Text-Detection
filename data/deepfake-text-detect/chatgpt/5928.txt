Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as someone who has been around, I've seen quite a bit of decay and have seen what's happened with conservative efforts to stop it. I've seen the reactions of people and it has been far from healthy, as many have a habit of blaming the victim and rejecting "whining." I'm no philosopher, but I think it might boil down to a failure to understand the nature of society as a whole, and how individual people fit into it. Those who like to keep the status quo have to rely on their authority, and they need to control the narrative, which is why there is so much oppression of any change to the status quo. There are two things that I find ironic, in that our natural tendency is to try to preserve our personal culture, and to preserve our personal identity, yet we have a political structure which is geared toward unifying people, and at the same time, there is a tendency to want to conform to the dominant culture and identity. I think that the diversity argument is a way of saying "you are so selfish that you want to preserve your culture and identity, you should be concerned about the needs of other people, not just yourself." To which I would respond, that's a hell of an argument, and who gets to decide who is right and who is wrong, and what is the right thing to do? I don't think the diversity argument really addresses that. I am neither a right wing nor a left wing person, and I would say that the diversity argument is really just a way of silencing people, or at least shutting them up, and I'm sure that most people who think this way aren't really thinking this way, but merely repeating it as an argument, and that's how you get people like me, who have no problem thinking for themselves. This is just my point of view, and I'm sure that there are people who would tell me that I'm wrong and that I need to learn more about the status quo and its benefits. If you want to have a discussion about the nature of culture and identity, I'm all for it, but I have a feeling that it won't be very fruitful. I'm afraid you're right about the "diversity argument" and its intended result. It's the logical end-point of a philosophy that regards "diversity" as an absolute good, and any sort of social cohesion as a bad. Diversity is the "cultural equivalent" of political correctness. As such, I've always found it pretty tasteless. To quote Paul Kurtz, the founder of secular humanism: "In our world of diverse cultures, religious traditions, and scientific explanations, the humanist recognizes that diverse values are needed to help men and women live ethical lives in diverse circumstances." I don't think it's so much that diversity is an absolute good, but that it is an objective value, just as truth is an objective value. For example, a universe that is less diverse than it should be is not an absolutely good universe, and so it's not an absolute good. It's like how there is truth, and absolute truth, but it's not absolute truth that is good, it is the truth. I think it's important to note that the diversity argument is often used by people who aren't the type of people who want diversity, they are the type of people who want to maintain the status quo, and as such, are likely to be people who want to suppress other people, and that's why they make the argument. When I was in my early teens, I was always annoyed that people were trying to push me toward some kind of "conformity" when I felt that I had a mind of my own. I never bought into the idea that there was some kind of "correct" way of thinking. I think that it's a bad idea for people to try to shape the way you think. I think it's important to note that the diversity argument is often used by people who aren't the type of people who want diversity, they are the type of people who want to maintain the status quo, and as such, are likely to be people who want to suppress other people, and that's why they make the argument. I was going to say something about that, but I didn't want to go into a rant on "identity politics." Anyway, I think you're right
