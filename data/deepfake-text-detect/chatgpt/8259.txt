I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into getting married and for some reason men are more tolerant in this area than women (or maybe they aren't). However... A person gets what he or she deserves - A marriage based on love always works out better then those where it isn that way from birth! You can only hurt yourself if you don" let anyone else run your life; i know many who tried to please their parents by marrying someone just like them but not once did either partner get all there needs met until after divorce papers were served ...stay single young lady against ALL odds unless YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEART ITS RIGHT OR ELSE!!
