As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not sustainable," said Dr. Steven S. Dukes, director of the Gerontology Center at Stanford University in California. He has spent years studying challenges facing animal health and agriculture because he knew so many children were sickened by diseases such as polio or cholera that had no cure. Dukes researched the effects of different diets for kids from low-income families who lived with chronic illnesses or because they had high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease and other conditions. He found that when people ate more fruits, vegetables and nuts, they tend to show signs of improvement in their overall quality of life. When people eat fish, shrimp or coleslaw, they are less likely to develop infections rather than cancer. Most studies showed children with severe disease fared better academically, but "what happens after the first year is what comes out on top," Dukes said. "Children experience greater levels of stress and emotional distress because they don't feel confident about not being affected by any particular disease. It's really difficult to understand what it means to be healthy ... these kinds of things do affect youth psychologically and emotionally." The research team looked at nearly 2 million children ages 12 to 17 who were diagnosed with a condition known as chronic inflammatory nature syndrome (CIS). The disease is characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels of organs including the lungs, throat, eyes, brain, kidneys, stomach and intestines. CIS affects infants up to two weeks old - often with no warning or treatment - and occurs at an early age due to poor nutrition and exposure to certain chemicals, disease and environmental pollution. Children may also face difficulty sleeping because of its spread across multiple generations. Many are with severe stressors. According to the Federal Food Drug Administration, tobacco products contain far more carcinogens than alcohol and drugs containing nicotine or methamphetamine. CIS can cause serious harm if ingested; it causes kidney damage and seizures; it can lead to blindness; and it can increase the risk of developing dementia, some cancers and Alzheimer's disease. Researchers tested food production methods using a variety of pesticides. They applied different chemicals to plants and animals to see which ones suited their species. The researchers found a mix of pesticides that reduced the range of colors and varieties and diluted the taste of herbs and spices. They calculated that foods produced with different pesticides decreased the effectiveness of each pesticide. This was especially true for greens, apples and potatoes: Newer pesticides used in farming did achieve much less protection against CIS than non-newer ones. About one third of all herbicides applied in America were unproven and ineffective. About half of all antibiotics used worldwide are undetected. More than five times as many anti-inflammatory drugs applied internationally are believed to work. But there are issues with water - the result of toxins infused into cells that divide into small molecules called amyloid and catecholamines. Water plays a major role in developing diseases like diabetes, asthma and cancer, according to Harvard's Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Vitamin A, vitamin B6 and zinc is responsible for making proteins and carbohydrates, allowing nutrients to escape, said Dr. Bruce R. Taylor, professor emeritus of medical genetics at MIT. But too little is known about the biology of various forms of blood sugar regulation. Most commonly, when insulin is involved, the body pumps glucose back through the liver, where it helps regulate blood sugar levels in particular areas of the body, he said. And scientists haven't yet been able to determine exactly why this process works. There have been growing concerns over the long term effect of drinking water, which is crucial to maintaining normal blood sugar and preventing illness, but health experts agree that it could be harmful to children and adolescents. Dr. Paul Offit, medical director of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said the opposite is true. In his book "Stress - a Memoir of Youngblood Diabetes," Offit describes includes metabolic disorders like Asperger's Syndrome, autism, mental retardation, ADHD and depression. Offit acknowledged that drinking water "could exacerbate, worsen or even destroy our ability to prevent disease." He said drinking water could reduce the amount of blood vessels and repair cellular damage. But, he added, "we still need to take action to protect ourselves from the dangerous chemicals we drink and consume every day. We shouldn't drink alcohol or drug materials."
