I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any sort of force preventing them from doing so, then I can see why some people might not want to leave. i don't believe in this idea at all - i really don't believe that anything like what you say here will happen. and the reason i'm saying this is because it's such an idealistic position, one which makes no sense whatsoever.
