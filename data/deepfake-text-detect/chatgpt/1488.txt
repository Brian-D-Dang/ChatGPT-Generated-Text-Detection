What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy gets lostexposed when "the ideas" become known to be untruthful. So you're saying that if a racist or sexist idea becomes mainstream in the public sphere then people will start thinking of those ideas differently? If so I think we have some exciting times ahead...
