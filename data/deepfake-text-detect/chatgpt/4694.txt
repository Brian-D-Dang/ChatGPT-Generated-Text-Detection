EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People use them as such because they want something more than they have now and don't understand how to get it yet. I've been using triggers for about fifteen years; since I was eighteen. The first time someone told me "triggers" were a negative thing... well, let's just say my reaction wasn't exactly one of gratitude. They seemed like an interesting concept at the time though so back then I decided to give the idea some thought. 15 years later, out of curiosity, I started researching triggers again; this time with the intent of taking what I'd learned over those years into account when deciding whether or not to continue doing something - and maybe even stop doing something else entirely! As I discovered through further research, however, there is no reason why anyone should be bothered by triggers. In fact, if you know your trigger triggers, you can actually benefit from having specific ones! So here we go... What Are Triggers? In their simplest form, triggers are stimuli which heighten our senses; causing us to notice aspects of ourselves, others, the world around us, etc., more acutely than usual. Each person has different types of triggerssome of which might make everyone cringe while still making other folks feel exhilarated! Some common examples include physical sensations, sounds, sights, smells, tastes, touchpressure, emotions, thoughts, memories, conversations, relationships between objects and humans, experiences gathered during stage acting [i], life circumstances, and much more! Categories also vary depending on context; these categories have been grouped together under three main headings below: Emotional Sensitivity Individuals who experience emotional sensitivity tend to react strongly to certain situations before, during, and after experiencing distressful events. A good example would be a phobic individual reacting negatively towards any type of insects (which may seem silly to non-afraid individuals). Other obvious distinctions within this category would also exist. For instance, Social Anxiety Disorder sufferers often find large groups intimidating but do fine interacting on smaller scales [ii]. The following list contains several items that fall under Emotional Sensitivity. Just remember that all words found in bold italics at the end of each item belong solely to the subcategory listed above. These items are meant to help clarify terminology. It will become very clear soon enough! How Do Triggers Work? Before jumping right into answers, please keep reading until you reach the bottom where more information is available. To start off, understanding triggers isn't always easy; many people need lots of practice and support before they fully grasp the terminology involved. That being said, once people do finally figure out how triggers work, it seems that almost nobody wants anything less than continued personal growth regarding this aspect of themselves. This particularly applies to people suffering from mental health conditions related to depression and anxiety. Understanding triggers allows them to clearly identify differences between feeling depressedanxious and feeling elatedexhilarated; thereby helping them manage their moods better. Of course, people of every background and situation could take advantage of learning skills like managing their emotions. Although the actual process varies from person to person, triggers enable thousands of people to enjoy lives full of happiness. You can learn more about triggers HERE.

When triggered, both emotions simultaneously occur at the same level inside of us. However, only one emotion dominates our awareness at a given moment usually depression, although anxiety exists too. Even though most psychologists agree that the majority of people suffer from an imbalance between happy and sad moments, society tends to associate negative cases far more frequently. Therefore, people whose normal state of mind involves mostly positive feelings (and vice versa) remain unidentified and misunderstood. Several studies show that people often tell lies to cover up painful realities hidden beneath the surface of their daily actions and interactions. Suppressing pain is immensely exhausting, unhealthy, and ultimately self destructive. By allowing people to freely express every kind of feeling without judgment, psychological counseling improves living quality massively. We're purposely leaving aside discussion of therapy and medication due to space limitations and scope restrictions. Luckily, there are hundreds of books explaining psychological concepts and techniques in detail. Feel free to look them up online. It shouldn't surprise you that enjoying yourself does NOT mean remaining locked away from everything that causes you pain. Ideally, you'll resolve any problems you encounter along the way, providing opportunities for deeper growth instead of letting negativity consume you. Remembering to maintain balance is essential, especially with regard to making plans for future activities, socializing with friends and family members, maintaining relations with partners, dealing with stressors, and working in stages, amongst general discussion of applied to the best done project is No matter.
