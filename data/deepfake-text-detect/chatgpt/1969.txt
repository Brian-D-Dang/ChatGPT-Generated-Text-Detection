As a german, especially in the city I live, there's honestly too many turks and muslims here. My old school was 80 turksmuslimsguys from eastern europe, which seriously lead to bullying against germans even though they're born here... Just look at berlin or munich for example I'm really sorry you had that experience but it isn't an accurate picture of Germany today unfortunately
