A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but for a private event, spending that much on fireworks can seem excessive. If your friend is looking to cut back on expenses for future events, there are a few alternatives they could consider: 1. Instead of buying expensive fireworks, they could opt for more affordable options such as sparklers, smoke bombs, or glow-in-the-dark toys. 2. Rather than buying fireworks outright, they could consider renting them from a local supplier. This would significantly cut down on costs, while still giving guests the opportunity to enjoy a display. 3. They can consider hosting other types of entertainment that are more affordable, such as hosting a barbecue, organizing a game tournament, or putting on a movie night. By being creative and thinking outside of the box, your friend can cut costs without sacrificing the fun and entertainment of their event.
