Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I I think that is the only thing that's in gray. I'm not very familiar with it, but I'm guessing that it has something to do with the intensity of the reflected light.
