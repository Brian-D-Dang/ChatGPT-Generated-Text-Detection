Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never been to the Mardi Gras but now that I have some knowledge, it looks like an awesome time! Anyone got recommendations for stuff I should do there? I suggest going at night when most people are already drunk
