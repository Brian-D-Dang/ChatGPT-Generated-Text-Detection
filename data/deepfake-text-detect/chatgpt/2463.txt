Though my personal political views match those of Bernie Sanders much more than Hillary Clinton, I believe nominating Bernie could ultimately be very damaging for the progressive cause. My main reason is that his socialist agenda would never pass through Congress (and it shouldn't). The Democrats are still seen as a pro-business party and have to keep up their image in order to maintain power. However they should not lose sight on how important this election really is if we want real change. I think one who can unite all factions within our country will most likely win. And there has only been 2 candidates with that capability since 1968: Barack Obama Bill Clinton. Despite what many people say about him being racist because he did certain things back when he was Governor or President, Mr. Clinton had two terms where everyone got along together even though Republicans controlled both houses during his entire Presidency. Yes, some compromises were made but at least there wasn't an almost complete stalemate like now under Republican control. Because of the inability of politicians from both sides coming together nothing gets done anymore except gridlock which benefits big business. This needs to stop! We need someone strong enough to make decisions based upon facts instead of ideology alone...someone able to work across the aisle without getting hung out to dry by extremists either side. Most importantly anyone elected must understand economics so well that they know exactly why every program worksdoesn't work; something neither candidate knows anything about whatsoever. They don't care because it doesn't affect them directly anyway unless you count campaign contributions given to them personally. Our economy depends on government spending far too heavily especially after 2008. Government programs such Medicaid, MedicareMedicaid etc.. are sucking resources away from private businesses creating jobs while taxing us all heavily just to stay afloat. It's time to wake up America before your tax dollars run completely dry....this is no longer sustainable nor healthy economically speaking long term. These systems cannot continue forever. To exacerbate matters further Citizens United allows corporations and other special interests groups total legal protection against public disclosure laws regarding donations received and expenditures spent influencing elections thereby making corruption nearly impossible to investigate and prosecute hence allowing bribery virtually unchecked."
