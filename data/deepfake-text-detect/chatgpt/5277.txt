I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural disaster. But I found chopping onions in the spooning position and eating it like that was great! And making rice with soup wouldn't have been worth the calories alone haha
