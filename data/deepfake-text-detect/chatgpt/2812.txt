Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view I hold. My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any one or all of those in your rebuttal to my post if you feel inclined to do so. One factor is the fact that right now people are buying more ammo than they would buy food, fuel or medicine because they believe that guns will be a precious commodity after Armageddon is here and there won't be enough for everyone else. The same could happen with oil, metals etc. Again this isn't to say that it's going to happen just yet, merely saying what I think might occur. Another factor is that we have already observed many countries (including first world) destroy themselves economically through massive borrowing and spending irresponsibly and unfettered by regulation and oversight - even when their citizens knew better. These governments thought they had money printing presses at their disposal while in reality nobody has ever invented such a device. This financial disaster may not simply be cyclical either, some leading economists believe our current system threatens national security by relying too heavily upon central banking and fractional reserve lending which risk causing another Great Depression style crash within 10 years. Another reason why I see high inflation coming sooner rather than later is tied into available supply and demand. Right now we're seeing pretty significant increases in prices across several commodities despite stagnant wages; car manufacturers report "butts in seats" increasing dramatically over last year, home builders (despite slower sales) are reporting higher lumber costs than they've seen since 2006-2007, copper has hit all time highs due to rising demand in Asia and Europe (think about how many new gadgets using this metal are being produced), corn has also increased significantly in price, gasoline has fluctuated between 3.50-4gallon depending where you live, platinum has nearly tripled from 2000-2010, silver is currently up 400 vs 2002 levels, gold almost tripled from 1999-today...the list goes on and on. Despite job growth improvements, consumer confidence remains low, wage stagnation continues, hospitals continue closing and layoffs are rampant throughout most industries. Inflationary pressures should only increase given these conditions and interest rates remaining near historic lows for long periods of time coupled with no immediate signs of an economic recovery anytime soon. Lastly, real estate markets remain weak, commercial leasing space vacancy rates are increasing nationwide, banks are getting shut down left right, credit card debt has skyrocketed and defaults have started occurring again with scary implications for future balance sheets. All this leads me to believe that inflation is likely to rise quickly in the next few years ahead unless something drastic changes in the economy. I'm sure every person reading this thread can come up with reasons why I am wrong or stupid or crazy beyond belief. But hey, its America and we're supposed to debate things out loud ya know? But then he proceeds to call us names,and says nobody agrees with him apparently. He calls the guy who posted before me well informed and educated. What a load! Idiots are always telling me I spend too much time shooting stuff. They don't understand that until I am old and feeble I intend to shoot alot!!!!!
