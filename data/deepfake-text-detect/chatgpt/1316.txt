I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that are not part of the political spectrum. One example is my local news channels advertising for a party called "the forest" which has nothing to do with forests just social issues like pot legalization or abortion rights etc
