This boggles my mind. I know that some airlines are different like Southwest because they do not have assigned seats. But why don't people relax until their seating zonegroup is full? What about airlines where there isn't one seat, and when you're getting on the bus or something similar to your destination? I mean sure, planes aren't air conditioned but in general or even buses can be more accommodating than cars if necessary
