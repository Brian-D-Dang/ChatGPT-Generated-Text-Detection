Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. "That means that marriage should never happen in the first place." Yes, yes it does mean exactly what you think it says. It's not a pleasant thing for anyone who wants their life and future together with someone else unless they are both willing to make sacrifices on both ends and accept that some things have to give right from the beginning - there can NEVER be equal love between two people for each other if one person believes that their way of doing thingsthinking about things is the only legitimate path forward which includes all aspects of the relationship no matter how much that may hurt or upset those involved! This sentiment has nothing to do with sexism; its just logical common sense because when everyone predicts failure (as every human being eventually must), then everybody loses control over themselves. The idea of 'one perfect partner' simply cannot exist as an eternal truth. Every couple needs to compromise at some level otherwise they won't get along, even though neither party intends any harm by making concessions. Love doesn't necessarily need romance, but sometimes sweetness beats bitterness. Marriage isn't supposed to start until you're ready... period. And you aren't going to know whether you want to marry your SO before meeting them face-to-face. So why force yourself into a union where you don't feel a spark? You've been given enough chances already. That said, most (all?) couples end up changing their minds after marrying anyway: it happens quite often, especially within marriages ending badly. Once your mate knows more about YOU than vice versa, maybe some compromises could work. But forcing a marriage based solely upon sex seems doomed to fail regardless. Could've fooled me:P. I'd agree with everything except 1. Especially since I'm almost 30 years old, obese 40 body fat, married woman still struggling. We tried running away from our problems using various excuses, putting off having children till we were older, etc., but none worked long term. I've met many happily married men my age watched them go through the same struggles I did felt horrible thinking about the fact that I was selfishly wasting time waiting around while others had moved ahead. I gave up accepted the reality that someday I might find happiness again, but it took us 6 months of counseling to finally come to terms wmy situation date my husband fairly recently. Even now, he makes fun of me for crying at the drop of a hat whenever his feelings take him over tries too hard to avoid arguments frustration, trying instead to keep quiet let these emotional moments pass without saying anything. He didn't expect change either he thinks once we hit 50, like adults do, we'll just slowly drift apart fade into obscurity. However, this is definitely not true of myself many women I meet today. Most of them seem contented secure in their relationships have great careers ( their husbands support them).
