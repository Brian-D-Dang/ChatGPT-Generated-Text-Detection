After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the former comes out on top, it is important to remind people that these are two different issues that should be dealt with separately. This time we look at a case where you can get rid of both sides by looking to science-based deterrence as an alternative. Cases like this have been offered before but they usually involve taking advantage of other circumstances (for example an established shooter) or someone who has grown up around gunsviolence so that there is no culturally based resistance against them. That isn't really relevant here because while America may not have had any institutionalized use of mass shootings until Columbine happened, Americans did see many cases across their history: for instance the United Kingdom saw over a hundred men kill themselves using firearms between 1698 and 1823 [1] alone; America also saw eight times more suicides than homicides by firearm during that timeframe [2]. And yet even then our rates were still very low compared to countries such as China, Russia, Japan and Germany which all had lower suicide rates per 100k population (Chinese 1.43, Russian 1.5, Japanese 0.6, German:0.9). In fact, if anything when talking about how Americans deal with suicides vs homicide rates I would argue that they do better, since the rate of deaths from gun fire was relatively constant throughout American history whereas the number of successful suicides increased significantly after 1880 due to easier access to lethal means without criminal record, particularly the introduction of barbiturates which made overdose much less risky. Suicide attempts however remained fairly stable throughout the whole period. Another thing which shows just how long some weapons have been used for murder is that this particular type of crime didn't become something most states considered dangerous enough to legislate against until after World War Two, where large numbers of soldiers returned home carrying armaments acquired during combat. There weren't too many military exercises happening prior to WW2 either, aside from training courses going back to the Civil War and earlier brush skirmishes like those between Native Americans and settlers, and hence why handguns weren't seen as a significant threat outside close quarters situations. So right away we see that while teachers trying to protect students isn't exactly new, what we are seeing today is actually quite old in terms of weaponry. The problem is that the technology hasn't kept pace though - anti-aircraft artillery batteries from WWII have now been replaced by drones, tanks aren't needed anymore thanks to digital signal intelligence, laser guided missiles don't require aiming devices, etc. We thus need to ask ourselves what might work instead? If there wasn't a specific weapon involved in this incident, wouldn't you expect us to have tried everything possible anyway? A lot of crimes are solved using forensic evidence and analysis to determine motive and method rather than the actual culprit, and we'd probably want to apply similar logic here to help minimize risk to bystanders until police arrive. A quick search turned up this article[3] by Michael Shermer titled "10 Bullets Are Not Enough! Why More Needs To Be Done About Gun Control - Part II" which seems pretty obviously applicable here given eyewitness accounts saying Adam Lanza fired twice at his mother Nancy Lanzas face before going into another room killing her. Of course we shouldn't forget that most domestic massacres happen inside houses so having easy access to a shotgun or rifle could make things worse. Still, there is value in understanding situations your opponent has already gone through. For starters I think we can assume that the shooters went through the same drill at least once before being stopped by law enforcement officers. After all, this kind of situation is perfectly avoidable in principle - make sure there's even ONE officer nearby, stand behind him when he draws from cover, wait till he fires a shot before returning fire unless he sees the muzzle flash of another officer firing too. But of course that doesn't necessarily mean we have to stick to traditional tactics entirely; take note that Steve Jobs killed himself rather than allow Random Drug Company employee 4-somebodyelse to find out details concerning Apple Inc. products plans, and this guy managed to learn what the phone was capable of. On the other hand, suppose you took the option of buying a drone equipped with rather advanced countermeasures capable of detecting explosives and infrared radiation, along with a stronger radio transmitter, with several strong lasers installed including laser sights onto the front barrel so that you could keep track of shots and remain within effective range for longer periods of time. You could go ahead and disallow remote control of the machine while making its flight path completely autonomous to prevent others near it getting injured by ricochets or debris thrown off by bullets hitting walls and furniture. Then you could equip the device to continue to fly autonomously until it detects a human body approaching, or perhaps even mapping the area beforehand and starting to warn visitors about exposure probability.
