It may not always be feasible for people to figure out how to do y without causing x. In some cases, x may be an inevitable consequence of y due to the nature of the activity or external factors beyond the individual's control. Additionally, some people may not be motivated to put in the effort to find alternative methods for y that avoid x, particularly if it requires significant time, resources or restructuring of habits. Finally, there may be situations where the potential benefits of y outweigh the negative consequences of x, and people may choose to accept x as an unfortunate tradeoff. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that people will always be able or willing to avoid undesired outcomes of an activity.
