I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If I were to die, that would be that. Whenever I've heard of someone having a "near death experience" or similar I always wonder if they just had some kind of breakdown and now they think they know what's going on and what's going to happen. The end of their life, I mean. I've also wondered if maybe those that had such an experience didn't actually die, just had some kind of weird hallucination. I could understand if someone had a weird dream of something like this and woke up after. But I don't understand how people can think that they've died and then "wake up" in the after life. So then I thought "well, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe they did die and they did wake up in the after life. But then how do we know that's what's going to happen to us when we die?" And then the other question came to mind: If they can't prove to us that they actually did die and lived in the after life, why would we believe them? How can we be sure they're not just making this up? What would convince me that these people really did die and then come back to life? Re: How do we know for sure they're not making it up? I think it's impossible to prove, as we die and go to the afterlife. However, there are too many reports of this occurring to simply assume it's not true. I've met a few people who claim they died and came back to life, and they seemed genuinely horrified at the thought of dying. I can't prove it's true. I can only say that it's a possibility. When I was a believer, I used to wonder the same thing. It's just that believers in an afterlife aren't going to go "oh, this proves to me that there's an afterlife." So we're left to argue about whether or not they're making it up. Agreed, but I'm not arguing that they're making it up. I'm asking if it can be proven. For the sake of argument I suppose we could take the position that nobody knows, so it's pointless to even think about. I would think it depends on how the person died. If you died in a car accident for example, or in a fire, you may very well have a lot of recollection of your experiences in the afterlife and could clearly describe what happened. If you die peacefully in your sleep, I don't think you'd have much to report. It's not like you'd have time to think about it, let alone report on it. In the same way, you could say that you're not sure you'll have a lucid dream or what if you have a dream that lasts a few days or a few years. I think it's a natural, self-preserving tendency to assume that things are the way they appear to us, so we don't have to worry about them. But I think it's reasonable to assume that there's more to it than that. Yeah, I can see that, but then how do we know that it's not something made up that we can't possibly know? Well, that's the catch. We can't ever know. Maybe we'll have an afterlife and it will be fantastic. Maybe we'll be rotting in hell for eternity. Maybe there's nothing. Or maybe you die and just sleep. We'll never know. And the question of the afterlife has no relevance to our daily lives. Just accept that you're going to die one day, and you'll have a very long time to think about it, and make your peace with it. I do. But I still don't like it. Well, that's a good attitude to have. I'm on board with that. I guess what I'm trying to get at is this: Assume I'm going to die today. What reason would I have to believe that I'm going to wake up in the afterlife? Maybe we'll have an afterlife and it will be fantastic. Maybe we'll be rotting in hell for eternity. Maybe there's nothing. Or maybe you die and just sleep. We'll never know. And the question of the
