I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too drastic between them - we're talking more than distances here... If you want your nation's people closer together then they should be close enough that everyone is able (or willing) to travel there regularly for work etc., so all live within an hour or two drive from each other say? This changes drastically if one wants their nations population concentrated into smaller towns where most businesses can have multiple locations instead having just 1 location at every major city centre as this leaves out those unableunwilling unwilling places like me who'd rather stay put somewhere quiet away far way on my own homesteads with no neighbours around but woods fields spread across miles! It also means fewer workers visiting because its inconvenient; Also why build roads when railways could get goods quicker by being built straight through cities without any needless travelling along pointless road networks which only serve busy areas i find ridiculous!!
