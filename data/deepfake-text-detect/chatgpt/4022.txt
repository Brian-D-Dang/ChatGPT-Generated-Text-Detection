Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting people up or telling them what they think they want to hear. You're asking people who have been on reddit for over 6 months in order to get their opinion of something that is completely subjective? Don't expect much from people here if they can't even form an argument, let alone be an informed voter about anything.
