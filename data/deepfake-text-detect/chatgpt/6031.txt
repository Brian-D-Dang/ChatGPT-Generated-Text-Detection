Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never heard of these "straight allies" events. Question: What is a "straight ally" event? What are the intentions of these events? Are they similar to a "straight pride parade"? In short, the straight allies event is an event organized by LGBTQ activists and supporters for straight allies (or those who are not necessarily straight but are allies to the LGBTQ community) to support the LGBTQ community and stand in solidarity with them. Oftentimes, straight ally events are held in conjunction with the Pride events, but it is not a requirement. The reasons for holding a straight ally event are manifold: sometimes it is in response to a larger event that is deemed hostile to the LGBTQ community; sometimes it is in response to a call-to-action from the community to build solidarity; sometimes it is a continuation of an already existing event that serves the needs of a particular community. It is not a "straight pride parade," and the intentions of these events are not to "show off" or "pride" in being straight, but to show their support for the LGBTQ community.
