The reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using them as slang they remove the negative connotations associated with them, and thus diminish their power as a result. I also think that by removing them from our vocabulary will simply lead to people using them in a different way, and it will be even more difficult to police what they are saying as a result. I see what you're saying about the word "stupid." I think you may be on to something there. I just think that if we could get rid of some of the word choices we use, that would be a good thing. I'm not saying that people need to be banned from using any words. I'm just saying that I don't think that "the system" has to have a hand in it. Of course, I'm not the biggest proponent of "the system" so that may be why I don't agree with your position. I'm not sure. I'm still trying to figure it all out. I think it is very important to note that the fact that a word has a negative connotation does not in itself make it offensive. I have no problem with using words that have a negative connotation, as long as they are not offensive. "Stupid" is not an offensive word in and of itself. However, it is not a word that should be used when you wish to discuss someone's intellectual abilities. It would be like telling someone that they are stupid, which is offensive. However, if someone says something to you that is stupid, then it is appropriate to say that it is stupid. It is also appropriate to say that you don't think that a particular course of action is a good idea. As an example, I think that it is stupid to drive 90 MPH in the fast lane. I would never say to someone "you are stupid." I would say "it is stupid to drive that fast in the fast lane." Does that clarify my position? Excellent point. There are words that I know are inappropriate to use but do so anyway, even if I'm not trying to offend anyone. I guess it's more like I'm just trying to make a statement and don't realize that I'm coming off as negative. It's like the difference between saying "that's stupid" and "I don't think that's a good idea." I guess I just don't think that words that are not negative have a place in the banned list. The whole debate is interesting to me as I tend to have a similar view to you in that I think it is not helpful to ban words and it is better to leave people to make their own minds up. As you say there are words that have more or less negative connotations but that doesn't make them offensive per se. However, in the workplace and in any situation where an offensive term is used that causes offence then it is the responsibility of the employer or organisation concerned to deal with that. I think that you are correct in saying that it is not helpful to ban words, but I don't think that it is helpful to say that the terms that are banned are not offensive. As I said in my example of "stupid," I don't think that it is offensive to say that something is stupid, but I think that it is offensive to call someone stupid. I don't think that we can say that the terms that are banned are not offensive, but at the same time we cannot say that they are not offensive. In a sense, it is kind of like saying that you shouldn't say things like "you're so stupid," but that it is okay to say "that was stupid." I don't think that it is helpful to ban words as a whole, but I don't think that it is helpful to say that all of those words are okay. I don't think that we should ban words in and of themselves as that is going to be incredibly difficult to police, but I think that it is important to be mindful of the fact that the words that we use can be offensive, even if they are not inherently offensive.

It is my belief that if you ban words, or remove them from the public vocabulary, that you will see a dramatic increase in the usage of the words that you banned. I believe that you
