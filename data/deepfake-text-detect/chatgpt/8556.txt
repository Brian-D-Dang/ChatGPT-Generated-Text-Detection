First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are in danger of disappearing if not managed properly, most notably our sun. But that line between humans and the planet's great predators has been broken for a reason - if we don't manage to get rid of them, then we'll miss out on much more important food (which would be less valuable than what we're looking at), and it will be harder to rebuild from scratch because they'll still get eaten by us as well!
