so random battles that just happen with no warning, while you're walking, just like, warpy screen, you're in a battle now stuff. this really only applies to turn based games, as it's easy for them to avoid. but most RPG-esque ones are just straight up gone if they don't have some sort of warning That is very true! I guess we need more variety then, since my main gripe was the lack of real drama and interaction between characters
