For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to my experience with the topic when raising it years past. I've got many questions about the issue, and your responses have cleared up some things for me. Thank you so much!:D A: I am actually going through something similar right now, but not really in the same way as what you are talking about, more like how you described. First let's start off by defining "abuse" What is abuse? Abuse can vary from person to person, but generally it refers to negative treatment that causes harm or distress on someone else either physically or psychologically. What makes abuse different than just disciplining children even though discipline happens often enough at home (which most people would refer to as abuse). It usually indicates there was a lack of empathy towards another human being which leads them to act poorly towards that individual. There may also be a pattern involved where one time they met their goal and then there are times when they make bad decisions because of poor impulse control. Because these actions do not lead to good consequences might suggest that the type of treatment isn't working. The problem here is that instead of trying to understand why he wants to spend all his free time playing video games when other interests such as school work, friends etc could potentially help him develop himself into a responsible productive adult we try to make him conform to our idea of adulthood and mature behavior. Instead of helping us shape him into a productive member of society we punish him. We take away privileges and ignore his needs. He becomes a prisoner of himself because we don't want to accept that he doesn't know anything yet and until we learn that he'll never think he qualifies as an adult or a responsible citizen. You asked if their punishments were fair, yes, they're probably fair given everything, however, it does not mean that punishment does not affect him emotionally long term in any way whatsoever. The reason behind punishing kids once every two weeksmonth is because it controls their impulses and stops them from repeating previous behaviors, but it should come no surprise that teenagers feel differently. At 14 years old he feels emotions differently than adults and he starts his life in a new world but still has a lot to grasp onto before leaving elementary school. If we used harsher punishments for everyone we wouldn't need prisons at all, instead it would become completely normal behaviour. His feelings won't change unless we treat him special considering his age. If it did bother him more at 16 years old young men had real outlets to express themselves besides video games, whether that was music, sports, whatever it takes to release steam and find happiness within yourself without having to cause damage to others around you. However, at 17 he still hasn't figured out how to show maturity outside of video gaming or "adult hobbies," therefore he seeks ways online that allow him to blow off steam while remaining anonymous. Unfortunately because of this aspect its hard to see how putting restrictions on technology will give him a better outlook on life unless those limitations turn into actual friendships with other teens, possibly even real ones - but keeping him locked inside his bedroom 247 seems counterproductive to learning how to interact positively with strangers regardless of gender.
