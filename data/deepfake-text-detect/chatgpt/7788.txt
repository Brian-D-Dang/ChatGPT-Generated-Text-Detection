While some players may argue that the sniper class has no place in TF2, it is important to consider the value that the class can bring to a balanced team composition. A skilled sniper can provide long-range support and take out key targets from a distance, creating opportunities for their team to advance and capture objectives. Additionally, the threat of a skilled sniper can force the enemy team to adjust their strategy and positioning, creating openings for the sniper's team to capitalize on. While it's true that a poorly played sniper can be a liability for the team, a well-played sniper can be a valuable asset and can make a significant impact on the outcome of the game. Therefore, it is important to judge each player's performance and contribution to the team rather than dismissing a class as a whole.
