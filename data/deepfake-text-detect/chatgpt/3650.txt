How can you convince me that all the nations that I'm allowed to visit aren't all working together to hide a bigger and better and more free world. Maybe the idea that all nations are working together to hide a bigger and better and more free world is a conspiracy theory that lacks evidence. It is important to critically evaluate information sources and verify the information for accuracy and reliability. Many nations have different political systems, social norms, cultural traditions, and economic necessities, which can create differences in how they govern and manage their societies. Moreover, travel restrictions may have more to do with border control and national security rather than hiding a bigger and better world. Instead, you could focus on exploring the positive aspects of the countries you can visit and learn about their unique cultures, histories, and people.
