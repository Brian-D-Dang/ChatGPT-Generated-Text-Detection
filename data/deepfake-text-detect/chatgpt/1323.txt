It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing most Americans don't know is their own country has been on its knees since World War II; with no renewed industrial base or manufacturing capability we are just another world service economy dependent upon foreign trade for everything from foodstuffs to computers to cell phones. The Chinese can replace every part in your iPhone except the outside casing within weeks if not hours...but how do you make an independent computer factory today without assembly plants? You need extensive infrastructure developed by Western countries such as Japan, Germany and America over hundreds years! How does this relate back to understanding where China will be in 10-20 yrs time? Its critical - it relates directly to our jobs security here at home. Were I president (and yes Im an American who grew up poor) my number 1 priority would have been putting together a team of top notch engineersscientists, military officers trained abroad but proficient in English, and business leaders representing some of the worst corporations out there. We might want to start looking into outsourcing more than ever before because were too lazy to develop these things domestically ourselves. Steve, thanks for posting something so interesting!! It really tells us what kind of future we face. A lot of ignorant comments being made right now: "China won't buy enough oil to get rich.." "Chinese companies aren't capable...." etc. Even the article itself says nothing but negative facts about China while failing to mention anything positive like the fact that auto sales data showed strong growth last week. In addition, comparing China only to India also seems unfair. They both have substantial populations living under poverty conditions and virtually no middle class whatsoever. And even though China may overtake Indian GDP soon, including per capita income, it is still nowhere close to any European nation. There is simply no comparison between then and now. The only similarities are that both worlds need oil supplies to run modern economies. So why is everyone talking down on them?? Way to go on fighting against globalization. This is exactly why having good engineering minds and businessmen working hard to create new technologies inside China is critical for its development. Ultimately, they must decide whether they want to stay behind or become ahead of everybody else. Of course, those with less education already feel left behind and resentful towards the educated elites pushing forward. But unless we change this attitude, we will never see China reach first place again economically nor politically. Wow, the amount of ignorance spewed around regarding economics in general is astounding. Every single comment said China was going to kill off america militarily and financially ... any moron could tell you that china cannot physically defeat US forces anywhere near our shores let alone globally. Check out the map and look carefully which areas chinese troops occupy compared to ours.. its laughable!!! Sure china can influence politics via money and trade power - thats true however not necessarily relevant given the massive size of the US economy relative to theirs and vice versa plus western democracy -which btw allows public opinion to steer policy far greater than in dictatorships i am sure you agree. Some smart ass commented about the potential of someone stealing money becuz chinese insurance policies cover theft of goods worldwide therefore chinese nationals should literally steal property everywhere!? Well guess what mr smarty pants - everybody steals everyday!! Thats called capitalism!!!! If china wants to continue using stolen assets to fund national projects throughout the region then i say knock yourself out!, but until then keep dreaming.........the west cant compete due to our financial system being heavily influenced by private interests instead of government oversight and control.....as long as our politicians can suck big dicks on Wall St. they wont care if our kids dont graduate high school much less college....its all about their pockets line...however chinas regulations allow investors to own shares of publicly traded companies - unlike the US -so maybe chinawould consider allowing foreigners to invest in companies? THATS NOT SO FEARFUL IS IT????????? i think not!!!! ok moving along - one stupid comment stands above all others...IMHO china needs to focus on internal issues ie pollution levels, children dying of malaria and encephalitis causing diseases, food safety standards,etc rather than trying desperately to destroy the west one by one!!!!! By the way thanks Steve for continuing to fight against globalism and corporate greed. Without you noone would read this drivel.........anyways hope u enjoyed reading!! JF on behalf of the anti tall poppy movement I love it that apparently nobody in DC knows ANYTHING beyond 'we lost yesterday, lets lose tonight.' Same old sht different day.
