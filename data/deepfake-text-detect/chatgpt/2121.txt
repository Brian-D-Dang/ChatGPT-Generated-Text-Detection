I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for selling weed they can commit suicide during that time, instead off coming out and getting sent back again Yeah this was specifically made illegal as part of Reagan's "War on Drugs" bullshit because it allowed people with less severe drug convictions (see: blacks just like today) an escape from what would otherwise be long sentences downstate coz prisons are overcrowded
