I've lived practically my whole life on this phrase. It has shaped how I have made several important decisions in my life, though I have recently come to suspect that it doesn't always apply. It's not that I don't agree with it anymore, but that I think that it should be applied more cautiously. I think it needs to be qualified. It also needs to be applied carefully. I know that we're not supposed to ask "what if?" when we're making a decision. But, here's the thing. When we're making a major life decision, we need to ask "what if" about everything. What if we do this? What if we don't? What if this happens? What if that happens? We should ask "what if" about everything because we never really know what will happen, and we can't possibly know what will happen. There's just no way. I've learned that we really only know one thing when making a big decision. We know that we can't know everything. There are just too many variables. So, we have to make the decision with the best information we have, and then we have to accept that we don't know what will happen. I've always liked the idea that God will take care of us. I've always liked the idea that there is some kind of plan, and if I do what I know to do, things will work out. I think this is a misconception. I think that God will take care of us, but I don't think that there is some kind of specific plan. I don't think that he's got a map for our lives, and if we do what we're supposed to do, we'll get to the right place. I think that he will take care of us. But, I don't think that we can really know what that means. I don't think we can really know how he's going to do it. I'm not sure that we can know what will happen. I'm not sure we can know what will happen. I think that this is one of the reasons why we're told to ask "what if." We just don't know. We don't know what will happen, so we need to be prepared for anything. It's one of the reasons why we need to have a strong relationship with God. We need to trust that he'll take care of us, and that we can do what we can, and let him handle the rest. I'm not sure that it applies to every decision, but I think that it applies to some major decisions. I think that if I were to make some major life change, I'd need to ask myself if it would be a good idea to ask "what if." Could I live with the consequences? I think that I would need to be very sure that I could, because the consequences might be very serious. I don't know what will happen. I don't know what the consequences will be. I just don't know. I don't know if it's worth asking "what if," but I know that I need to be careful when asking myself "what if?" I don't know if this makes sense. I'm not sure if I'm making any sense. I'm just wondering what you all think. What do you think about the "what if" question? When do you think it's appropriate to ask it? When do you think it's not appropriate to ask it?

I've been really, really blessed. I've had some really good things happen to me. And I know that I've been blessed. But, I've also had some really, really bad things happen to me. I've had some really, really bad things happen to me. And I know that I've had those things happen to me. But, I can't help but wonder if this verse means that I have to do something with those things. If they have happened to me, what am I supposed to do with them? What's my response supposed to be? I've had to face some really, really hard things. I've had to deal with some really, really bad things. I've had to make some really, really tough decisions. I've had to face some really, really horrible consequences. And I've had to deal with some really, really hard things. I've had
