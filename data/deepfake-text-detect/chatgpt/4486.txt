Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be done with it. I still think that a woman's right to choose, as long as they have no preganancy problems should always hold up in court. You can't find any negitive effects from having an abortion and when your on trial for murder you'll want them anyway. Plus you're just defending yourself so why would you care? If someone had used their gun at my mom we'd all say "good thing he was armed" but then we wouldn't make such laws because our own family members could turn homicidal. So yes abortions are legal (technically) but only under certain circumstances. But even though it's technically okay, do you really feel like society needs more women getting abortions? Shouldn't there be some kind of checks before making a baby instead of immediately murdering one that may never live past birth anyways? I don't know... It seems pointless to me that we need more babysitters than mothers. Like where does she go? Who will watch her kids while she gets hers? And how many other babies will die because everyone else knows better but us? What happens after 10 years? How much damage is already done by letting these things happen? It feels like we devalue life once we start killing off innocent children. If you look back through history most countries started their civilization using slavery and farming tribes until finally they developed enough skills to survive without relying upon others. Why did they wait? Because there were too few of their own citizens who knew anything of value. We've wasted centuries of progress waiting on politicians to tell us to slow down and be civilized. This whole idea that if I kill another person immediately after conception they won't become human beings is naive. They're not going anywhere as if something happened to prevent them from being born except physically. No matter what age, gestation period, development stage they might reach; demise doesn't change that fact. Sorry, but it simply isn't true. Then next time you hear someone talk about how quickly humans grow into adulthood compare to animals remember that wasn't even close to how fast chickens grew! Humans aren't grown men and women overnight! We take decades to develop emotionally! Yet here again we put ourselves above those around us telling them that they must protect themselves from us....when they actually cannot. The only safe place the child has left is within his mother. Unfortunately sometimes this becomes war between parents over whether one wants money or power over a unplanned pregnancy. There's got to be a middle ground somewhere. As far as im concerned whoever decides to get pregnant should be able to decide its fate. Im all for abortion rights as they stand now.But if i win the lottery tomorrow I dont plan on finding myself pregnant everytime i fancy a bit of fun. Little girls little boys learn early on in school that pregnancy doesnt come free and that sex isnt meant for pleasure alone and thats great because its good practice. Anything beyond that will lead to unwanted pregnancies which leads to 8 million deaths worldwide each year- more than malaria and HIV combined. A lot of abortions occur due to poverty, lack of education and ignorance of contraceptives. By enforcing abstinence until marriage we cant force poor couples not to use contraception because its expensive or difficult to obtain. Thats not fair either. Being against abortion makes it hard for women who have gotten pregnant accidentally or unknowingly. Unless there are serious risks involved (like rape) nobody should ever experience a forced abortion. Asking women if they wish to keep their baby rather than putting them against their will is fine, but i personally dont believe anyone gives it much thought. Its unfortunate really. Some people resort to illegal procedures just to pay the bills. If somebody gets pressured into doing it id hope it goes well and hes happy afterwards, if not further action should take place. But why risk ruining peoples lives given there's no real benefit? In extreme cases theyre probably committed suicide. Abortion shouldn't stop till 24 weeks unless there is severe health issues but only if both partners consent otherwise its considered infanticide. People agree that abortion is wrong if a fetus grows inside the womb yet theyre ok with keeping preborn children alive outside. Whatever happened to helping mothers raise healthy families? Did they forget to mention that? These 'right to life' groups seem very selective indeed. Maybe that's where pro choice comes from. Thank god in modern times technology allows doctors to save tiny fetuses during late stages of gestation. Doctors also perform testicular biopsies on infants to determine gender. Giving aborted babies names and recording information onto electronic medical records is commonplace today. When an embryo starts developing cell division ceases and DNA becomes malleable allowing organs to form functioning limbs etc. All of this takes time however and causes suffering throughout the process. Yes aborting a female fetus puts that girl into labor but it saves the physical life of the infant. Aborting males is barbaric and nothing short of counting your numbers and dates. Sometimes taking cheapening agents are at work, leaving adults at view turned michael, adding style traps. Bringing along individuals incalculated
