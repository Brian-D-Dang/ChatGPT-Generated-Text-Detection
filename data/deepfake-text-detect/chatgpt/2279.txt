For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to the fact that with my age and current lack of responsibility it's not something I can currently fix (I don't want any permanent changes if possible). Your chest is fine for your age, you have nothing worrying about at all:)
