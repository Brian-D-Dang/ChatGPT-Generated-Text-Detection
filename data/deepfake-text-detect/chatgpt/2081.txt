Now in the spirit of fairness - I believe this to be true for all governments, but in this case I'll touch upon the U.S. gov. First of all [Lusatania] used it's position as a German land to add to its strength and that is not right or fair play on their part... I agree we should use whatever means are necessary (i think other nations do) to try to maintain our security; however there must always be some sort of "fairness" when dealing with others who may disagree wour methods.... Have you seen what Bush has done since he got into office? Has anyone else?? It seems like everything regarding diplomacy (negotiation), war crimes investigations have been compromised by the administration so they can change history..and basically say anything they want without reproach........ Do YOU know how dangerous corruptive such actions could become?!
