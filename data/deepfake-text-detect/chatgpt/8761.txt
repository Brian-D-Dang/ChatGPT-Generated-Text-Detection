I believe that we are at the point where we potentially could avoid bringing about catastrophic climate change, but to do that we would need to drop absolutely everything, to say that we're going in with that same caution and that we have to keep doing what is necessary. "We've got a long way to go in terms of our ability to mitigate risk in order for us to be able to deal with some of these risks." So no matter how long it takes now, he said scientists have been too concerned about the effects of global warming on the Earth's surface, and that they are far from certain if this will lead to catastrophic events like hurricanes or earthquakes. The U.S. Geological Survey recently predicted that temperatures will increase by 1 degree Celsius over 1980 levels across North America - a figure of nearly three degrees higher than today. The IPCC has also warned of "a significant diminution" to Greenland's area as its ice extent sinks below the level seen in 1987 (i.e., below Region A's melting ice cover). But environmentalists were not so sure about that. They worry that any such dramatic rise would put pressure on resource-rich nations such as Australia and Indonesia to ultimately reduce their oil production while increasing the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere through fossil fuel extraction. There is already evidence that climate change may be causing more current storms in the tropics than elsewhere in the world. And the new CO2 emissions from burning coal, which emit only 5 of world greenhouse gases, might even make storms themselves dangerous. Meanwhile, polar bears are continuing to migrate northward due to warmer parts of the Arctic Ocean, according to experts. As of March 13, researchers had detected polar bear activity near Regan Island, Alaska, along the country's east coast, adding further to the growing numbers of sightings around the region. In the meantime, hundreds of people continue to visit Lake Tahoe, Oregon, as part of the annual Lake Tahoe Community Campout, which was one of several summer camps being offered by the county planning board in San Francisco.
