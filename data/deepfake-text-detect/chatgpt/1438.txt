Hello. For a long time now I've felt that there are many people in hospitals and psychiatric homes who will never be able to function independently and will never work, but they don't want the support of others because it could hurt their reputation among friends (and if nobody knows them or cares about them then there isn't any shame). Instead we should focus on trying to help these individuals through education rather than encouraging ostracism from society. I think this is very well put! Barriers may exist for some people with mental illness being unable to find employment, which can have an adverse effect on health care systems as well as those suffering symptoms. But sometimes you just need someone to talk too when life gets overwhelming and all practical worries seem meaningless without reassurance that things aren't so hopeless afterall
