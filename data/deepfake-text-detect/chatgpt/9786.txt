To my knowledge there are no peer reviewed sources that link GMOs to any negative health effects. There is as much reason to believe genes manipulated in a lab are not any different than those modified by traditional breeding techniques. The World Health Organization states that "no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved." In addition, many studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety of GMOs and none have found any evidence of negative health effects.
