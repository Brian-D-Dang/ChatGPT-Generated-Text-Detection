Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as a result of the reformist movement, we now have people who are not afraid to fight against it for their own sake. The country is on a path to national development through sustained social and economic reforms, which our leaders would be happy to see. We need to continue our efforts in implementing such policies during the next few years and continue to insist that the government should support these reforms. We also believe that the current government has failed to deliver on its promises to improve health care and education. The most important thing here is that it was able to create jobs by bringing down unemployment and helped millions to get free healthcare. I wish the government all the best in the future, but sometimes you just can't take those moments and turn them into new opportunities like this. The country needs to keep pushing forward in order to restore sanity even after spending so much time in a state where there was no room for democracy.
