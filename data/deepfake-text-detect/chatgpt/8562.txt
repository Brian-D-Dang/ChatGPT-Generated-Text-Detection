If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is a much better choice for studying the native language if you're not interested in memorizing specific details about it. Second, you should consider having both English and Mandarin as your first two languages (the latter being most commonly spoken in China). You can take either of those languages with you to see how good they are at their own language-speaking skills. Third, you could even do some research around where you want to study, especially since you already have some experience of the level of instruction in each. For example, you might be able to find out what languages are taught by your local school, which would help increase the chances that you will make up your mind the next time you visit one of your local schools.
