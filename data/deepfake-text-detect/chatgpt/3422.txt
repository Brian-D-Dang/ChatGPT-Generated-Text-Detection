This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use of the property is. The fair market value should reflect the value of the land and any improvements made to it, regardless of whether it is used for residential, commercial, or other purposes. Furthermore, the assessment process should be transparent and accessible to property owners, so they understand how their taxes are calculated and have the ability to contest their assessments if they believe they are incorrect. Additionally, taxes should be applied consistently across all properties in the same tax jurisdiction. Finally, taxes collected should be allocated to provide essential services to the community, including schools, public safety, and infrastructure. The distribution of tax revenue should be fair and equitable to ensure that all members of the community receive necessary services, regardless of their income or property value.
