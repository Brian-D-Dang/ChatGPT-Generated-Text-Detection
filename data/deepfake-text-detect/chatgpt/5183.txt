I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately afterwards they said the same thing about Caitlyn Jenner. It's a shame because the media is pushing Caitlyn Jenner into a corner with all this chatter? I mean Caitlyn Jenner becomes the center stage for other celebrities who aren't as famous or have been exposed as a white male celebrity like Caitlyn Jenner so why should we care about the rest of us. Why do we need to be told what every single celebrity thinks about Caitlyn Jenner? This isn't just ignorance it's unfair. Caitlyn Jenner is a known liar, she lied repeatedly throughout her childhood (she pretended to believe she wasn't a pedophile) but now she lies more than anyone else besides herself; how can anyone defend Caitlyn Jenner by continuing to lie about what happened during her youth? Where does Caitlyn Jenner come from? She grew up in a racist religious community where women were treated like property - and challenging authority figures came off as immoral (her mother said that she sent out sexual jokes). Caitlyn Jenner claims America has never played any role in creating melanin after all these years, but that doesn't matter anymore: Caitlyn Jenner lives outside the mainstream society; our society needs to wake up before Caitlyn Jenner thrives on awareness and recognition rather than privilege. Totally agree but there are plenty better candidates if you ask me. Caitlyn Jenner comes across as an awkward stereotype person whose respectability is irrelevant compared to the masses; she assumes everyone hates America while forgetting her parents worked hard enough to earn her wealth. Caitlyn Jenner appears to be lonely and isolated even though she owns and manages a successful business empire which means she knows nothing except how to control money away from her children and family members; what kind of leader would really want their child to grow up knowing that their parents spent months living paycheck-to-paycheck scrambling around trying to get their kids jobs and school supplies ready? The hypocrisy is huge here especially since Caitlyn Jenner seems to have no idea what she is doing right now. She portrays a young girl who happens to be acting socially irresponsible everyday without caring deeply about anything relevant at all, including what people think about her public image. Caitlyn Jenner doesn't seem interested in being seen as something important like her father - a father even worse than her - but she wants attention instead thanks to the mainstream press coverage. It makes no sense whatsoever! However, Caitlyn Jenner sets up a career that puts a lot less emphasis on family and friends than her rivals do, making her attractive culturally and politically. She sees herself as someone who gets paid well above minimum wage hellish earnings despite having a lack of talent for writing poetry and singing music such as "My Own Worst Enemy" You're So Beautiful. Jenner could easily become a household name sooner if she stayed home feeling entitled but instead we see her showing off her social skills through public appearances and live television shows wherein she spends most of her time dancing choreographed songs off video games alone onstage, wearing glittery outfits and partying backstage while holding hands beside celebrity guests. Caitlyn Jenner disappears behind closed doors whenever she receives positive feedback but instead we see her reminiscing over memories of her late dad who died soon after birth leaving her devastated. Advertisement Caitlyn Jenner is committed to the false narrative that she is somehow responsible for millions suffering due to her actions and outdated teachings leading to widespread shame regarding her sexuality but not admitting her faults will only make things worse already sad world wide. Caitlyn Jenner chooses to talk about sex abuse allegations against her father by her aunt who tried to get him removed from the church due to his sexuality while her parents blamed Caitlyn Jenner for telling them he loved her too much. Caitlyn Jenner uses this scandalous situation to try to convince people that sexuality is okay although she obviously tells people that he didn't love her sexually because she felt pressured into going along with his fantasies and lifestyle choices when she thought she deserved an apology form her momma. Jenner kills her own daughter Kim Kardashian West's reputation once again calling her self proclaimed daughter a whiny bitch who deserves support while Kim claims Jenner did nothing wrong but Kendall Jenner refuses to apologize to Jenner. Jenner admits that Kim Kardashian West wouldn't listen to her voice call for help but instead refuses to say sorry publicly even though Jenner made Kendall Jenner worse financially via his divorce settlement worth 700 million dollars. Jenner's new sense of entitlement lets her continue spreading hate messages until her taxes pay for her lavish lifestyle without repercussions, putting her poor decisions toward promoting sexy celebrity life ahead of her daughter. Jenner clearly finds fame appealing but she keeps pushing her ideas onto others because she wishes her daughter had the chance to experience everything she desires whereas Caitlyn Jenner encourages herself to act selfishly and perform excessive amounts of acts that traffic in unneeded drama. Caitlyn Jenner fails to acknowledge her failings despite her failure to change and ends up becoming a hate preacher with her bullying behavior resulting in the death threats she received prior to her passing status quo abortion ass-2 per capita epeanista Edit All This As Ske ap HE f 1 all
