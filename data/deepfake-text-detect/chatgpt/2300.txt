I am an American High School student who was taught 2 different versions of the Civil war throughout my schooling career. In elementary school we first learned about the civil war through a book series called "The Journey to Freedom" which is very pro-slavery and ignores many key facts such as: 1) Slavery in the United States wasn't just taking place in the south, it took place all over America (including New York City). The only reason why slavery ended quickly after the north won the Civil War is because Lincoln realized that ending slavery would cripple his economy so he went along with emancipation but made sure not to free slaves before they were ready for work and this gave slave owners time enough to sell them into other countries where their value has increased tremendously due to the industrial revolution. This fact alone shows how much slavers cared more about money than human rights!2) There are countless historical documents from both sides that show that if Abraham Lincoln had been killed early on during the war then there wouldn't even have needed to be a civil war at all since most southerners agreed with him once they saw what he did by freeing slaves and giving them citizenship. Unfortunatly some politicians believed propaganda spread across newspapers like The Atlanta Republican (pro confederate paper published between 1861 - 1865), Harper's Weekly (issued weekly 1845 - 1916; owned edited by George William Curtis until 1908 when Allen Bradley Hoey was editor) and The Charleston Mercury etc... These publications told lies about President Lincoln being unpatriotic, and not really caring about liberty. But these papers also highlighted stories dealing with issues facing black people including discrimination within society (these types of articles usually appeared under the banner 'Anti-Racism, unfair treatment towards slaves working in mills or coal mines (usually happened around election years showing the hypocrisy of white men trying to get votes while exploiting blacks), mistreatment against ex-slaves voting (or lack thereof); accusations regarding teachers committing sexual acts with students (mostly untrue except 1 case involving Marie Roget in Boston Massachusetts one year prior to the start of the war.) 3) - Many individuals named David Kyle Foster wrote threatening letters to northern states suggesting violence upon any state whose population voted to abolish slavery leaving many citizens fearful and afraid 4) - Despite what the books say you should never forget the words written above especially considering our current situation today where media outlets try hard to make conservatives look bad whether its conservatives talking down minorities, riots instigated solely to cause damage downtown or refusing service based off your beliefsrace.Unfortunately I grew up believing everything printed in those textbooks despite now having access to internet resources proving otherwise but regardless i'm still glad schools teach us history no matter how biased it may seem.
