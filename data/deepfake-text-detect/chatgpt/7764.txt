While it's true that social media content is often posted with the intention of being viewed by others, it's important to remember that not all content is intended for public consumption. Many people use social media to connect with friends and family, share personal moments, and express themselves in ways they might not feel comfortable doing in person. Just because someone has posted something publicly doesn't mean they have given blanket permission for anyone and everyone to view it. It's important to respect people's boundaries and privacy, and not assume that just because something is online, it's fair game for anyone to see.
