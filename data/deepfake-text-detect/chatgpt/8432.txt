I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning. It seems to me that we have developed very distinct views about what masculinity is, but I feel like it's been deduced from our societies way more than being based on something inherently masculine in human biology because if you look at other species such as gorillas or bonobos they are just... not ambiguous when translating their anatomy into genders (am i right?). So my question boils down how much does nature play an important role vs socialization? And yes there might be some correlation between actual physiologybiology with cultural perceptions for trans people so please correct any misconceptions here too! Thanks:)
