Country music was not always bad. There were legends such as Johnny Cash who defined what country music was. However, today the country music culture is full of songs about people dancing to that retro-style guitar music. Country music has never been liked by people who have no idea how appreciative we are for it and it's a shame because it showcases the truism that everyone can appreciate great musicianship in every genre they choose but not just those with high expectations from their own perspective singing in unison. The songwriters write music out loud so if you don't agree please listen to them and then answer questions asked on a song like the following: "Let me tell ya'll how I'm feelin "I ain't gotta love no one but myself." "My life isn't worth all this crap you guys give me." "You're goddamn right it ain't worth nothing here!" They say I got drugs and chewed up my wife! "Come see my friend here" "No man want no part of that." "Why do you keep making us crawl into bed?" "Heaven help me!" "Donnie wanna be friends with you!" "This ain't right!" "How come you keep bringing down the house?" "We're all gonna die tomorrow!" "Hey, don't listen to this bitch!" "She know your real name." "Do you think you hear me? I said 'hey kid!!!" There are many more examples where country music shines brightly while all eyes focused solely on country music without even looking at country music itself or understanding how the genre actually works! Here are five favorites for you to check out below: 1. Johnny Cash - "One Sweet Day": Johnny Cash didn't need much convincing when he recorded One Sweet Day. Cash turned his nose up at the songwriting role quite successfully too which led to his major hit single "One Sweet Day," though the song still had some rough edges along the way due to the fact that Cash played a vocal melody during the chorus without any lyrics accompanying it (except for "Keep Your Feet On the Ground. Cash wrote "Two Sweet Days" from the perspective of a mother trying to protect her son's innocence through enduring an abusive relationship until he finally gets reassigned back home after escaping from the abusive marriage. "It does sound like a good song," Cash admits. "But it wasn't written specifically for country commercial radio listeningradio listeners - most pop artists aren't going anywhere soon enough. And there are no country singers currently doing commercials ... except maybe Doug Hendrix... How could I do better than Doug?" Cash commented later about what Country Music fans should expect by listening to the song live instead of listening to it memorizing lyrics spoken over the stereo: "Tom Petty used to be cool as heck; now I guess everybody hates him." Cash also went on to rewrite the lyrics again himself before releasing One Sweet Day as his own project and producing songs for other artists including Vince Gill, White Stripes, Ronnie Milsap, Ty Dolla ign Jr., Pete Townshend, Charlie Daniels, Freddie Hubbard and many others. Cash originally wrote "one sweet dayinspired song titled "Well Done" because he couldn't remember how to sing anymore thanks to a severe case of pneumonia. He decided against using pop lines since the song doesn't really fit the definition of pop music anyway. (Side note: I've personally seen many songs performed this way.) Cash considered putting songs together under the name Johnny Cash this way, writing songs by himself, his wife, and his sister. Cash only heard one version of One Sweet Day, written via Zoom and where Cash sang "Help Me." Cash called it "perfectionist stuff..."an understatement considering it took Cash two weeks to figure out exactly what he wanted to say and perform it live onstage. While Cash would probably prefer songs sung by country artists rather than pop stars, he did admit that he thinks it'd be funny to watch himself play Idol professionally someday! Cash scored another hit with the song "Oh My God" which ends with him repeating "Goodbye Love" over and over again...but this time he made sure not to mention his wife. While Cash felt nostalgia some nights talking about his role modeling for teenagers, he truly believed that he already knew everything he needed to know: "If you don't know anything, you won't understand..." Cash says "The idea of being involved in something other than yourself will always make you stand alone." Cash opened up about his struggles with addiction several years ago saying "What happened to me makes me sick!!" Cash boomed "Funeral Pornography" at the start of his second career tour. He ended the show praising fellow country singer Stephen Stills as "the producers of this world"! Cash spoke about his first recording at the age of 20 telling the audience, "Without the weirdness, in general, it wouldn't exist." Cash explained why he chose to record music outside his comfort zone each night thinking it meant greater things ahead as he enjoyed the experience immensely: "And the next big thing that he thought he wants to become "A Family, he tells about his family's evolution to get 6 Long stories Music Salsh
