Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even though the bill was signed into law by President Obama, it's not yet clear whether this is a legally binding contract or not - or if it will be passed with bipartisan support (and potentially with some concessions from Republicans). The amendment could pass without any resistance from a handful of Republican senators, but I still doubt it would get gone quickly enough for a few more thousand votes. "I wouldn't say that there are a lot of people in Washington who don't want to hear about something in front of 600 million people because they know what's being said at the moment. But I can tell you just about everyone wants these things done as soon as possible," said Kavita Moretti, an independent who attended the Senate hearing and spoke on behalf of a group called 'Jaywalkers'. "We object to these bodies calling themselves groups on specific issues, while trying to justify their name. We should raise our voices against these types of actions - especially when politicians like the one we are talking about were doing this before. This is a public health issue, not political." As a member of the Jaywalkers, I understand that many of them feel strongly about this. And although they agree with the majority view, they remain very concerned that the rule-making process will take longer than necessary to make sure that the bills passing through Congress actually reach the states.
