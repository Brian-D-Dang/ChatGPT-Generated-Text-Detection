The U.S. Constitution is an old document. At the time it was written, it made a lot of sense, and it was a large jump ahead for democracy, politics, and human rights in general. But as we've evolved into different circumstances since then (like more education or a growing economy), some things have just become antiquated over time; they no longer apply to our current society anymore. The right to bear arms has been around long before the constitution even existed - but today there are many who believe that women shouldn't be allowed access to guns because well... They aren't men? It should go without saying by now that I don't agree with this kind of thinking at all. You may not either: after seeing these pictures below!
