To start, I'm not here to discuss wealth distribution, or income inequality. They are real issues that need to be addressed, and as much as governments like to talk about the'middle class', it's a very small sub-set of people who actually matter in terms of government policies - most of us don't fit into any one of those categories (maybe I should just learn French so that my wife can work for France Telecom). A few weeks ago, Neil Gaiman wrote an article for The Guardian entitled "Do you really think GameStop is famous? It sounds more like something out of A Clockwork Orange than a company." While he points out some interesting similarities between Reddit traders and Alex Salmond's Scottish National Party during independence campaigning, there were also striking differences. In this case, though, the politicians seem to have missed the point entirely: we're talking about ordinary working folk who've had enough with being told what they want by big corporations, whose lives have been turned upside down by years of austerity caused by the global financial crisis and subsequent deregulation outlined recently in Naomi Klein's book The Shock Doctrine. GameStop has become part of their story because they got involved and became active participants online through social media, where their voices could finally be heard against powerful corporate interests. This was not spontaneous; these investors weren't looking to make a quick buck by gambling on stocks which might never recover from last week's movements - their actions speak volumes if anything. It would be easy to dismiss them all as idiots taking advantage of a cultural moment when young people feel empowered enough to do things that older generations wouldn't dare dream of doing. But the irony isn't lost on me either when I consider how embedded TV adverts are within our culture at present - selling everything from booze to cars and paintball gear but also having a major impact on our subconscious minds. My generation grew up watching ads for cigarettes, alcohol, pizza, fast food chains and car manufacturers. These days, many kids watch television every day and hundreds of millions of adults go to sleep each night knowing exactly what they'll wake up looking forward too (we even get tonight's news live!) All of this contributes heavily to normalising unhealthy lifestyles and perpetuating ideas that only the wealthy should enjoy life. And now it seems even mainstream media outlets are waking up to reality rather than simply lap it up whenever advertisers throw money around. So while this behaviour may look harmless at first glance, this memeing is sending a message that won't sit well among a lot of younger generations. It reminds us that consumers still control advertising and public perception, regardless of whether companies pay ad agencies to tell us certain messages. Once again, ordinary people have taken over without permission and made themselves visible despite the fact that they didn't ask to be noticed. This moment makes sense given that consumerism itself comes under increasing scrutiny nowadays. Hence why companies like Apple decided to drop its iconic slogan, "Think Different," after 30 years, and focus instead on its core values including privacy, respect and ethics. Companies aren't going anywhere anytime soon and will continue to spend billions annually promoting products and services - however, if brands want to engage consumers properly in meaningful ways then perhaps they should reflect back upon what matters to society today and find new ways to reach potential customers.
