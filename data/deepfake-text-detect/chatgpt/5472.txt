Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the hikers get bitten and killed as their hiking companions succumb to the animal's bites injuries after falling from the cliffs overlooking Mt. Rainier National Park near Lake Tahoe on their way back home for some bear research. Two hikers died when they fell into a gorge at Mount Rainier on March 15. Oregon State Parks Rest Area Manager Steve Bergeron said Thursday that the hikers were hiking with their bear hunter friend a couple days before the fatal fall off the mountain ridge. When they arrived there was no one around to help them save them because without a guide book they couldn't find any signs warning hikers against encountering bears with bear claws. Bergeron explained that the hikers didn't have the budget nor adequate gear to protect themselves from being trapped underground under rocks where no guides had been available. Bergeron said hikers should be prepared to learn more about bears during their trips once they return home from the mountain tour next week - something that will include setting up mountain watch groups along the way if necessary.
