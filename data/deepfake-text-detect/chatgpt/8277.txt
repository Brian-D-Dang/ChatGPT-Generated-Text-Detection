Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions behind them (although the ends don't always justify their means). I disagree strongly about a lot of things though: people should be free from hatred; they shouldn't get assaulted or discriminated against just for being whowhat gender is sigh But no need in getting into any arguments here... so let's keep on topic! So where does your comment fit? How can you make such an argument without seeming like some kind racist trollespecially given all those "progressive" issues which are contradictory at best if not outright hypocritical)? 1) It would seem very odd indeed then when women deny rape accusations made upon themselves while simultaneously claiming victim status as victims will do often enough. There must surely come times after she has been raped, screaming out her pains until eventually someone hears... yet suddenly nobody cares because he was "just joking" ... how dare these progressives call us sexist pigs!
