Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of confusion about the arguments, and a lot of wishful thinking. On the one hand, the people doing this have a solid case that the bible is a bunch of myths. On the other hand, the theists have a solid case that the bible is a bunch of myths. They seem to be two different cases. I'm not clear on the relationship between the two positions. Are they the same? Are they contradictory? Or is it that one is implied by the other? If there is a contradiction, then it seems to me the thing to do would be to try to reconcile them. The arguments seem to be coming from two different positions that are only loosely related. That's a good point, and something I've been thinking about a lot lately. What I think is going on is that there are two groups here: 1. People who accept a particular theory of reality (the theory of Christianity, for example) and are using that theory to evaluate the evidence. 2. People who have rejected that theory of reality, and are using the lack of evidence as a basis to reject that theory. But there is an obvious tension here: if the theory is not true, then its evidence is suspect and probably unreliable. That's not to say that there is no evidence for Christianity, and it's not to say that the evidence is all that's important. But it is a very strong caveat to keep in mind.

I think that what you're getting at is that the theists are "cheating" in that they are taking the bible at face value and (sometimes implicitly) taking the existence of a god to be true. This is not the same as examining the evidence and taking it at face value (as the atheists are doing). But it does seem to me that the arguments between the two groups boil down to arguments over the evidence. From the other side, the theists are not taking the existence of a god to be true. They're taking the bible to be true. That seems to me to be a different case. If you're right, then you're right, I suppose. But it's worth noting that there's a lot of overlap between the two cases: Christians who accept the Bible as true also take God to be true, and for most Christian arguments the two go together.

In that sense, they are using two different arguments. If you're right, then you're right, I suppose. If I am right, then theists are using two different arguments: 1. God exists. (not necessarily Christian god) 2. The Bible is the word of God. That seems to be two different arguments.

The existence of God and the existence of the Bible being both true just because they both are, is a perfectly coherent proposition to me.
