While it is important to understand the extreme violence and brutality of ISIS, advocating for people to watch their execution videos can be harmful and even traumatic. Many individuals, especially those who have been directly impacted by violence or have PTSD, can suffer from severe emotional distress by watching such graphic content. Additionally, watching ISIS execution videos can perpetuate a message of fear and terror, providing the group with the attention and notoriety they desire. Instead, we can educate ourselves through reputable sources and take action against extremist groups through advocacy and support for counter-terrorism efforts.
