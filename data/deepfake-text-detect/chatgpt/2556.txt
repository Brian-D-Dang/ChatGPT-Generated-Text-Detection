Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as fresh-tasting homemade pizza with quality ingredients. But this doesn't mean you should give up on frozen pizza altogether: If made right and served hot out of the oven, it actually makes for pretty decent comfort food. Here are some tips that will help make your next frozen pizza taste better than most: 1. Buy crusts with less cheese, sauces or toppings if possible There's nothing worse than biting into a delicious slice only to have all those flavors obscured by an overwhelming amount of cheese, sauce or toppings. Aim to buy crusts that don't contain more than three main topping items each (i.e., pepperoni, sausage, bacon). This way, the focus remains squarely on the dough itself - which makes the perfect vehicle for flavorful meats and cheeses - rather than being masked by other dishes. 2. Avoid deep dish pizzas This tip especially applies to chains like Pizza Hut, Papa John's and Little Caesar's, whose square pies tend to be much messier when they're cooked at home. The problem here is twofold: First, it takes longer for such thickly layered pies to cook properly compared to regular thin-crust pies. Second, many consumers find these thicker pies harder to handle during consumption because their size means there aren't enough slices per serving. Instead, opt for regular round pizzas so you won't end up having leftovers. 3. Use plenty of salt and spices Salt helps keep sauces and meats juicy while also adding depth of flavor through umami compounds found naturally within foods. Embrace its power! Try sprinkling herbs and spices onto frozen pizza before placing them atop the pie before baking. This not only enhances the overall taste of the meal but also adds moisture to the meaty portions. Remember: Salt goes well beyond cured meats and deli sandwiches. It has surprising effects throughout the cooking process. You'll notice that salting steaks just prior to grilling causes juices released upon contact with metal utensils to drip back down onto the steak instead of sticking to it; similarly, many baked goods benefit greatly from a final sprinkle of salt at the last minute. Spices and herb blends - including oregano, basil and thyme - add additional layers of flavor to a wide variety of foods without overpowering them. Experiment around until you enjoy your preferred blend (s) on your meals. 4. Watch portion sizes closely If a pizza comes in one large box meant for feeding four people, chances are high that eating the entire thing results in overeating. Always check how big the slices are first before diving into the full pie. Most grocery stores sell individual servings of standard pizzas, allowing you to eat as few pieces as needed for maximum enjoyment.
