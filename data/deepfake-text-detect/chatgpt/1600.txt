Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from middle school and highschool) so this is what was drilled into me growing up: The ball goes where you point it.

I have never seen anyone try to tell kids how to play or even coaches express disapproval when someone thinks differently on the field about something
