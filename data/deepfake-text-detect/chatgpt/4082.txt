I like Bernie, love his politics in fact. I doubt there is a politician I agree more with. I like the fact that, unlike most politicians, his rhetoric matches his policies. But he has not yet won my vote. That's very interesting you think so! I feel as though his promises of higher taxes and government services are what puts me off him (in particular to those who do not make minimum wage). In regards to your own personal beliefs about different things, how much do these affect how you view presidential candidates? Do either of them correspond to your personal views on current affairsworld events? Or does it effect everything?
