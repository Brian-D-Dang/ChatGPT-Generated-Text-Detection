Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 20th century. The Qur'an has been translated into several languages including Arabic and Aramaic but it was introduced with Persian as well. Islam in the West is believed by many Muslims as a religion of peace which has its origins in the Quran. The Qur'anic verse provides insight into the nature of the group of people who worship Allah. It also explains that Allah only hears only those whom he wills him to hear or see while fasting and follows others. Accordingly, it says: "In order for Allah to know all things, He made the Messenger of Allah during His Holy Week, His Messenger Abraham, whom He chose among His Messenger." These verses are assimilation words which indicate that the Prophet Muhammad is willing to accept sinners merely because they do not repent their sins according to his will. This verse indicates that Allah wants the nation to be united along with their own faith rather than separate them separately for Him. Therefore, this verse reveals how Allah thinks about each one without excluding others for any reason such as greed or corruption. Hence it describes Islam as an Islamic state where believers are free to convert anyone even if they disagree with other religions. According to Islam, Allah does not have a right to decide what constitutes good deeds so Muslims should implement these principles. He only uses the Qur'an against unbelievers regardless of their origin and beliefs thereby violating its teachings. While the Qur'an teaches the believers to obey Allah and do good deeds at all times despite differences between sects and religions and traditions, it states that Prophet Muhammad did not follow this philosophy when He sent Him to meet his Messenger Mohammed which means Allah approved His actions after meeting him. It is very important then to understand that Islam consists solely of religious texts preached on Allah's behalf although He does not allow himself to express His views openly due to the different interpretations of the scriptures. Muslims believe that the Qur'anic verse 'Abu Hurayra ha-Watan Conference' shows how Islam can serve mankind fairly whereas Islam forbids anybody from expressing His opinions contrary to His commandments. Islam thus serves Allah and his prophet Muhammad. For the Muslims concerned, Islam contains no laws regarding religions nor does it constitute an absolute religion like Christianity or Islam. However, Muslims believed that worshiping Allah alone would lead to salvation through prophets who appear before the community every day. Since Muhammad helped to build these communities, they influenced the society toward Islamic ideals which caused them to become leaders worldwide speaking out against injustice. Thus Muslims never violated any law except the Islamic laws imposed upon them under Islamic Laws. The Prophet Muhammad strove to change the society towards Islamic values which resulted in Muslims becoming the most popular ones across the globe today since believed to be the best way forward for mankind.
