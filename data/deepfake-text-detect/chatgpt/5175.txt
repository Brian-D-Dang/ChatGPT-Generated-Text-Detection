I believe that "Buckle up, it's the law" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority] which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they are not careful." When asked why it was necessary to use the term "laws," he replied: "There should have been no need for it. It has happened before; it will happen again and again...

Similarly, Mr. McArthur admitted that "lawmakers used to say: 'The laws do what laws say.' Nowadays they speak about what they mean by 'authorities, adding that it means "they make themselves invisible." Mr. McArthur said he believes "government officials behave like bullies who want everyone else to think that their actions were wrong but aren't evil or immoral either."
