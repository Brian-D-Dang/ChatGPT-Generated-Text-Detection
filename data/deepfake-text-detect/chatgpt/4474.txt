The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to understand what they actually say. Article I Section 10: "No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance or Confederation; grant Letters Patent, Passes or other DiplomaticTokens; [or] coin Money without the consent of Congress." It's time for a revision! I was thinking about this today as there have been so many articles on various topics lately that are just simply not true anymore (slavery being one example). This may seem like an extreme topic but really isn't, we live in such a different world than even 100 years ago and people need to be reminded how things used to be done instead of having kids believe everything their parents told them because, well...they're all grown up now. What do you guys think? Should we try something like this article or should we analyze some more modern examples of ridiculousness? Let us know if anyone has come across anything similar before.
