To get this out of the way early: This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk. An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation. I'm sure you've seen similar requests in subreddits that are entirely dedicated to discussing PC hardware and peripherals with like-minded users; we should strive to do better than just regurgitate the same tired old talking points in every thread about what's wrong or seemingly broken on PCs. I posted it here because it's something people really care about more so than anything else...so it fits perfectly
