After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the question is raised about whether or not to increase restrictions on guns, I am usually very outspoken against it because if you take away the second amendment right of a citizen, what are you left with? The first amendment right of free speech? Or does that become abridged as well when we start loading censorship into the mix? I have been thinking over this issue quite a bit lately though and from my perspective there might be another way out for us. Instead of taking people's constitutionally protected right away from them and making laws restricting their ability to defend themselves (again) why don't we turn things around on these issues instead? If our goal really is reducing gun violence then maybe we should consider allocating funding towards counseling services and programs aimed at convincing individuals and families who may be dealing with someone suffering from mental illness to seek help early before they decide to commit acts like those in recent mass shootings. Perhaps instead of creating legislation that makes it harder for regular citizens looking for self-defense that will just make matters worse by disarming an entire population without any effect other than preventing good guys from being able to protect themselves while also increasing crime rates, let's look for ways within our current system to work toward mitigating the root causes that lead to such terrible outcomes. How can we do this exactly? Well, certainly some sort of campaign would need to be created where both sides of the argument collaborate and come together to find common ground on solutions rather than fighting each other simply to win points off each other during election season. We could even set aside specific funds specifically dedicated to funding projects like this through private donations so as to ensure that no government money goes anywhere near these sorts of initiatives which means that everyone involved can feel comfortable knowing that they did nothing wrong in regards to revenue sources. After receiving proposals from different groups across the political spectrum, we could pick a few dozen groups to provide grants to who develop effective strategies based upon sound data analysis techniques that focus less on potential legislative changes but more on addressing factors leading to increased risk relating to firearms ownership. In fact, how about we offer 50 billion dollars worth of grant funding - enough to cover half the cost of President Obama's recently proposed "Every Student Succeeds Act" education reform program! How much better would life be today if he had done something like that 8 years ago after Sandy Hook!? It seems like too many communities get caught up in focusing energy on efforts nobody has time for and never actually achieve anything tangible along the lines of trying to solve problems rather than criticizing others for doing absolutely nothing either. This approach isn't restricted to only helping prevent future school shootings either; cases involving workplace violence could benefit greatly from similar intervention methods given the tragic rate of suicide related deaths among working professionals due to access to lethal weapons at places of employment. For example, companies might partner with local non-profits to fund prevention, outreach, awareness campaigns etc... targeting employees' family members and loved ones most likely to suffer from suicidal behavior, depression, anxiety, aggression disorders, PTSD, eating disorders, sexual abuse, substance use disorders, grieflossgrieving processes, domesticsexual assault victims, etc.... The list of identified risk factors associated with high levels of job stress literally goes on for mile yet somehow rarely ever receives proper attention until after events occur leaving thousands dead or wounded simply because the actual cause was ignored by everyone paying lip service to the issues.
