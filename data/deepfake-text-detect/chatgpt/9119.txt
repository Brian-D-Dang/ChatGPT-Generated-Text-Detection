There's been so much uproar over Sweden and the Netherlands and other countries that have been dealing with immigration issues. I would like to move to another country in the future, maybe Sweden if they wouldn't be a horrible country! Nevermind. It appears you're right about putting this in perspective. Australia is actually pretty good at maintaining a high standard of living...and it has very little immigration problems (the Dutch are also decent at keeping things running smoothly).
