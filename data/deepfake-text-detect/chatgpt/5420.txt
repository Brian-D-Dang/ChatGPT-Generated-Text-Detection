To me, online entertainment is such a flip of a coin. You either get a partnership or you don't, and even if you do get the partnership, there's no saying who gets what they want earlier in life! In order to do this, the other person needs a 'dealer' that offers to give them money for their services without having to think about it in terms of how much effort they put into it Sounds like you need some real help from someone asking for donations...but I'm guessing they know nothing about the business side?
