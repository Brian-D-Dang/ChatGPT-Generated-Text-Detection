One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? This isn't always true, but it's an approximation. The human mind can only develop so far before it breaks and starts getting in its own way. If nothing happens to keep you from breaking your brain while you're in school or work then eventually you'll be just as distracted by what you did at schoolwork as someone with a PhD who was 10 years old when they started their education.
