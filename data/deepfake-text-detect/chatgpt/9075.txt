America has accomplished nothing in its history that makes it worth of such widespread pride and love by its people (particularly this time of the year). Every event that Americans have been celebrating since the Declaration of Independence, we're celebrating. I don't know about you but I think all American history is an effort to show America how much you care for one another and want her good stuff to be the best it can possibly be at least in part because if a country doesn't make itself known through our actions on our soil then it won't do anything really important any longer. When George Washington came into office as president he was starting off with pretty good intentions. But what happens when you start coming up with new ideas? When he started making those decisions from scratch he had to make sure that perhaps his policies didn't alienate too many conservative voters who would otherwise choose Democrats over Republicans or other candidates running against him. Even though Washington knew there were going to be plenty of tough times ahead - especially now in 2020 - Trump did not hesitate to take some bolder and larger-than-life steps to change the course of things. He was also considering overturning the constitution declaring that any elected official should be held accountable even after he has been removed from power. However, that only proved to be painful enough for many of us. The choice between the two was clearly between made hard by the years of Obama, the election results, and the fact that Donald Trump was actually doing better than Hillary Clinton in November at the polls. By the way, last week, the US Senate voted unanimously to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to become the next Supreme Court justice. This is a big step forward for performing government roles, and it shows that it isn't just the incoming administration that has been changing the course of US politics: There are still plenty more actions that could be taken to break down the legacy that Barack Obama left behind.
