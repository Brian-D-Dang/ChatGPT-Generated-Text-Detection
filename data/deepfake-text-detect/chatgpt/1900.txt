Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 7th century and spread into Europe by way of Spain. Islam has been adopted as a second-nature faith for many people around the world - including those who may have converted through coercive means or were born with it. In response to this trend, Muslims must know what their own beliefs are so they can understand why others believe differently than themselves. Some questions you might ask yourself include: What do I mean when I say "I'm Muslim?" Can nonMuslims become good Muslims just like Muslim converts can convert back out of Islam if they choose not to practice its principles anymore? Do all sects within the Islamic faith share similar ideologies about equality between men and women, freedom of thoughtspeech, etc.? Is there anything unethical concerning how some leaders use their power over other adherents to control them against their will? Does your understanding match up with general media portrayals of my community members based on stereotypes derived from unfair reporting methods used across various platforms? My goal here isn't necessarily implementation but rather getting us talking openly about these issues, which we often don't discuss outside our homes among friends alone because fear ostracism. The point remains though; no one should feel coerced to follow any particular faith without knowing fully what's expected of him or her. We need to normalize interfaith dialogue more broadly, especially considering recent events such as 911, COVID-19, immigration crises at U.S.-Mexico border, racial injustice protests throughout America, and Trump rhetoric threatening violence toward protesters himself. A simple start would be listening to each other better instead of dismissing ideas outright before hearing them first hand. These aren't easy conversations to hold but necessary ones nonetheless.
