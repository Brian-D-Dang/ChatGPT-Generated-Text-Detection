"Safe" Don't have to worry about the majority of the community using the downvote button as a disagree button Example: [The most recent example that is driving my view] In this post, I explained why I was not using the downvote button and how I would have used the upvote button. I know I will get some disagrees but I'm ok with that. I know it's ok to disagree. And that's the way I want it to be. I would like to say that all of the disagrees on the last post were well written and they explained their views. However, it has become clear to me that the disagree button is used as a disagree button and not as a way to point out what is wrong with the post. I'm not saying that all of the disagrees on my last post were like that but it is a good example of the most recent example that is driving my view. That's all I'm trying to say. I think it's important that we have conversations and don't just point fingers at each other and disagree. I think it's important that we agree to disagree and agree to have a conversation. And I think that is the way it should be. And I think that is the way I will continue to use the downvote button. I'm not saying this is for everyone but it is for me. I know my views will be heavily disagreed with but I'm ok with that. I know that I am not perfect and I know I'm not always right. And I'm ok with that. I am not perfect and I am not always right. But I think we need to change the way that we communicate and I think this is a good start to it. And we need to learn to have a conversation without being so adamant that we are right and the other person is wrong. And that's how I've been using the downvote button. I'm not saying that I'm right and anyone that disagrees with me is wrong. And I think that is how it should be. I think we should have conversations and try to understand the other person's viewpoint and not just say we are right and they are wrong. I know it's not always going to work that way. But I think that is the way it should be. I think it is more important that we learn to have a conversation than it is to show how much smarter we are than the other person. And I think that is the way I will continue to use the downvote button. I'm not saying that this is the only way to use it but it is the way I have been using it and I think it's the way I will continue to use it.
