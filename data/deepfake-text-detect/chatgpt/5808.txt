NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, and that the current rules remain in force for all new and renewed tenancies. Abolish rent control, and replace it with a tenant-based subsidy: everyone who pays rent is entitled to receive 500 from the government. Subsidies are much more fair than rent control: everyone pays the same amount, and if you're willing to pay more, you can! The subsidy can be paid directly to landlords, or it can be given to tenants in the form of a voucher which they can then spend on a flat, or on a percentage of the rent. The subsidy can be paid regardless of household income, so long as the tenant is not a major felon.

Rent control and rent stabilization are repealed, and replaced with the subsidy described above. The subsidy is paid to both tenants and landlords. Tenants get the money in the form of a voucher, which they can spend on their rent, or on a percentage of the rent. Landlords get the money directly, and can either reduce their rent, or use it to pay off their mortgage. The subsidy is tax-free.
