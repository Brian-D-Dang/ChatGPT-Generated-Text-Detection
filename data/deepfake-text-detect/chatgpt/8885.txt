Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a little like X: X is better than saying Y because it's easier to pronounce X with your tongue and less complicated to decipher by typing the word "y" instead of "x." It also sounds more natural to say X with your tongue because you have to pronounce it first. 2. Inactivity. You wake up early to work on your next project, so you don't want to go in bed at 8 PM. And because people are dead tired, your head feels congested. 3. Midterm exams. Until you get the hang of the term "inactive," you won't be able to focus on anything else. 4. Time pressure. If you're scheduled to take an exam or study administration classes during the week, you may not be able to concentrate on making your assignment tasks manageable. 5. Lack of time management. Even if you stay awake until late, you still need to manage all your projects throughout the day. 6. Failures. When you've been working in a tight group, how can you avoid falling asleep? Try moving a finger slowly across your forehead while sleeping, and keep trying again later in the night. 7. Workers' compensation insurance. Corporations often provide workers their individual health insurance coverage through coverage from employers of certain kinds, but they generally cover through-the-air premiums - even when there will be an accident or death penalty under the law, and you might not get covered through such insurance at all. This means that workers' compensation insurance is very helpful for many people, even those who just don't want to pay a premium. 8. And there are no hidden costs involved. For example, if something goes wrong with your car, how do you know if it'll be replaced? Or if the company will deduct some cost of repair without warning? 9. And all this, matters mostly about being careful around people and avoiding them. 10. There is a lot of money spent on these things - even going as far as causing a family tragedy or killing someone. But doing so could leave you worse off financially than you would have otherwise been. 11. Being too busy to finish your project is another problem. You lose out on opportunities to learn new ideas and make useful connections, particularly when others are present. Chris taught me that it's best to invest in something you enjoy rather than wasting money. 13. You can't afford to give yourself a bad grade. How much training does one need to complete and what kind of training should one study? If you aren't getting enough training into your work skills, then you risk harming yourself and others. 14. Getting an education involves lots of research and evaluation. The most important thing to do if you plan to become a professor is to see if you'd be interested in teaching. If so, start researching information online before you commit to it. 15. Your self-esteem depends on the support system that you use. If you rely heavily on your parents and friends for your success, finding that setting outside that environment is tough. So, it's good practice to have strong feelings for yourself instead of relying on anyone else. 16. Some days, you feel as though you are left alone and that you don't belong anywhere. Unfortunately, taking control over your own life isn't easy either. Many times, you have to face the realities of life and find other ways to cope with frustration and anger as well as worry. 17. As we continue to grow older, we become increasingly dependent on the government - especially when it comes to healthcare. We might consider buying an expensive phone, but you cannot afford to buy one just yet. 18. Need a way to communicate with your superiors or coworkers? By keeping you isolated, you'll never be able to help them understand why you disagree. 19. People tend to think that a distance between you and your boss is a precarious existence. However, due to our age, technology can allow us to move all of our attention away from analyzing problems or asking questions. 20. Communication is everything, especially when you are a student, and sometimes you can't talk directly with your classmates so you can't discuss what happened behind closed doors, or if you had a personal encounter with someone. The good news is that you can talk back, and your teacher will take care of it. 21. Similarly, if you experience an illness or injury, you might benefit from having a medical professional perform an antibiotic treatment. This is important because the antibiotics used to treat those injuries can be effective and safe. 22. How long will the treatment last? To protect against potential side effects, avoid unnecessary surgeries and procedures every four months till the end of each year - dead - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - over truth
