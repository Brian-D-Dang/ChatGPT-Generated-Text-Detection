Before I continue, I would like to start by saying that I am not a pedophile and that I am strongly against the sexual abuse of children. My view is based on personal experience: When I was around 10 years old I began having regular dreams about people touching my breasts or vagina during sleep for no apparent reason whatsoever. These dreams were so common that they became part of my waking life as well! When I spoke with adults in charge at our church who knew me when these incidents first occurred, both said it could be nothing more than a normal child's fantasy. To this day, even though I have had 30 plus years of therapy, the dream will always remain vivid because I did not know what else to do other then try to get them off using any means possible without harming myself (which I often succeeded). As far as anyone can tell from reading this article there are very few victims out there due to how normal they seemed before their event happened. The parents described above may also consider themselves lucky that their daughter never told her story; if she had spoken up earlier we may all have been dealing with an entirely different problem now...and may still be today.
