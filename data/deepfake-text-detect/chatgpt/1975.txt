You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the world to know this. Not only are they both fruit, but also they're similar! First of all let me start by confirming what you already knew: yes, Apples and Oranges do come from different parts of the same tree (the ambrosia apple) so no one can say for certain which came first.The truth is we don't actually have any idea how or when these two fruits started being compared because neither fact has been recorded anywhere - at least not yet anyway... But if someone were able to find out where when the quotes originated then maybe someday there will be an answer as to who said them first? It'll probably never happen tho lol
