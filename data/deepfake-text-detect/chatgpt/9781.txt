I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; against racism, sexism, and other forms of prejudice; and for environmental protection, economic justice, and equal opportunity. I have always tried to look at issues from all sides and evaluate them on their merits. I also believe in a strong government that is able to provide essential services, like healthcare, to its citizens.
