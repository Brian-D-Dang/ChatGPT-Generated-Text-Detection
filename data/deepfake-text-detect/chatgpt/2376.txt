It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing which has been missed out by most analysts is their military prowess in terms of technology development since 2006. The PLA's recent debut (on Oct 1) at Zhuhai Air Show clearly indicated that Chinese defense industry was able to churn-out advanced platforms like JH-7A fighter jets within less than 10 years from start of project. There are many other projects under way or planned for production soonest - such as Z-20 medium multirole combat aircraft, FC-31 stealth jet trainerlight attack plane, 3rd generation WZ-8 heavy transport helicopter etc., some of them have already entered service with PLAAF. The speed at which PLA can develop new weapons systems indicates its growing capabilities in this regard. It seems PLA will be able to match US dominance in certain areas sooner rather than later if it keeps on working hard on various fronts without getting distracted by domestic issues arising due to myriad reasons ranging from corruption to mismanagement over last few decades. Having said so, I am not sure whether we should consider these developments as something too much to welcome given how India had struggled till recently even after having access to huge amount of foreign exchange reserves held abroad because our own leaders were more interested in spending money on vanity projects instead of building infrastructure necessary to save Indian lives.
