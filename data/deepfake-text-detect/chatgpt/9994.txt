First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" has. Egalitarianism is a philosophical and political doctrine that advocates for the equality of all people regardless of gender, race, or class. It is based on the belief that each person should have equal rights, opportunities, and responsibilities in society. Generally, egalitarianism seeks to reduce or eliminate any form of inequality or discrimination based on these factors. In contrast, feminism is a broader set of beliefs and actions that seek to promote the rights and interests of women, particularly in terms of social justice and equality of opportunity. While egalitarianism and feminism share some common goals, they differ in their overall ideologies.
