I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that they did not deserve to be attacked and that consent is important. It is important to remember that rape is a violent crime and there is no excuse for it. We should all work together to promote a culture of consent and respect towards all individuals. It is also important to support survivors and hold perpetrators accountable for their actions. By educating ourselves and others about consent, we can create a safer and more respectful society for everyone.
