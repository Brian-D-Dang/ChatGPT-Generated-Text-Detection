I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it It's the oldest profession"; "we should have full rights to our bodies don't matter." I think there is something more fundamental than that at stake here, and we needn't forget as well: The status quo isn't working out so great on every level; people who can afford it are avoiding unwanted children through abortions (and other methods) - but what happens when birth control fails? The consequences will be disproportionately felt by those least able or most unwillingunable-to-afford financial stability in their lives... which may very well include teens from poor homes with no access to contraceptives except condoms, etc., iirc also, women living under abusive relationships where getting pregnant wouldn't just mean rape but beatings death threats come first because they're already being treated like crap enough without adding forced childbearing into the mix.... Is abortion really okay if you consider all these factors? Really??!! That seems like such an unbelievably heartless thing to do...:sad:
