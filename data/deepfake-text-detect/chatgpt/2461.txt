From The majority of sexual assault are not reported to the police (an average of 68 of assaults in the last five years were not reported).1 Those rapists, of course, will go on raping. But those who have been raped and report it may face additional stress that can affect their physical health down the road.2 Rape is one form violence against women that often causes long-term negative effects for both victims and survivors alike - even if they do everything right as far as reporting the crime, receiving trauma counseling or medical care afterwards, getting a rape kit done by trained professionals, cooperating with law enforcement when testifying at trial3...even though more than 854 of rapes are committed by someone known to the victim.5 This means we need to work together - men and boys included to help end this epidemic once and for all!
