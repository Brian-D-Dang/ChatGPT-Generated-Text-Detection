So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor race difference? Yeah, it's true that the majority whites don't deny there are different races in America due to cultural differences but they can see themselves as dynamic instead of homogeneous. Also black people can be racist since these behaviors aren't natural by definition so its impossible for them to hate blacks, a black person being racist isn't even close to proving racial discrimination is still considered discrimination
