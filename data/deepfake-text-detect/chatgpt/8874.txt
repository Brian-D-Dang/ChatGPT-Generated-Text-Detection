So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want to know the best way to vote, one of the main questions is whether or not they have a record of being open-minded or if they just always seem to be on the wrong side of history. I'm not sure that democracy would work effectively in this country. Sure you may have all those people who love their party but how many of them have ever gone through the voting process before? That's unfortunate because the politics of democracy can be quite interesting - at least it seems like it so far. But what's the point of democracy if we don't do anything for other citizens? Who cares if someone likes your party even though they are against your political ideology? How does democracy differ from slavery in that regard? Why don't people who support socialist policies stop making sense out of their own selfish interests? I'd also like to say that while there are some decent progressives in my area (and I've never lived here) the fact that these kinds of kleptocracy claims are more likely to do harm than good is pretty appalling. You see, it doesn't matter if an individual supports a certain ideology; if both sides are supporting each other, then what the hell kind of reasoning is going to hold your hands up when you can dismiss them as "slavery"? Don't forget that anything you disagree with is either morally "wrong" or politically incorrect. It's like saying that gays aren't allowed to cross the street if they're gay - which is just plain stupid and morally wrong. It's exactly the opposite of what most people consider a wholesome right they do everything together to make life miserable, and everybody else just goes along with that. And yes, everyone should be free to choose to join whatever niche they want but when it comes to voting, I absolutely hate voting in general! And I will add, after reading this post, to suggest that the current US Government did something well by considering constitutional issues such as the constitutionality of marriage laws, illegal immigration, abortion, and the rights of women. Unfortunately, they still haven't taken any action yet and it saddens me that they don't look into these matters. Would it only take a few years for Republicans to figure out that they can pass a law banning abortions without having to worry about where the baby comes from? What if they didn't bother? Or the Senate won't act until they actually put forth the legislation? They don't care what happens to our children - they care what we want left behind. If anyone has any idea what to expect from this government, please let us know!
