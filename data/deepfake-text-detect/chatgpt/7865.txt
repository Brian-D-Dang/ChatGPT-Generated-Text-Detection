One argument in favor of the 'just looking for friends' option on dating sites is that it allows individuals who are not necessarily interested in a romantic relationship to still find meaningful connections with others. Some people may be new to an area, going through a difficult time, or simply looking to expand their social circle. By having the option to connect with others on a friendship level, dating sites provide a platform for individuals to find support, companionship, and a sense of community. Another argument is that the 'just looking for friends' option can actually be beneficial for those seeking a romantic relationship. It allows individuals to get to know each other without the pressure of feeling like they have to immediately jump into a romantic relationship. By starting off as friends, they can build a stronger foundation for a potential relationship and ensure that they have shared interests and values before deciding to take things to the next level. Overall, while dating sites are primarily aimed at helping people find romantic relationships, having a 'just looking for friends' option can provide a valuable service to those seeking social connections and can actually benefit those seeking a romantic partnership in the long run.
