Firstly, I'm using a throwaway because most people get really sensitive about this and my views are pretty much the antithesis of reddit (love Rand Paul, support Mens Rights, hate feminists, think rich people are great, etc). I'm also using "it" as a pronoun and I'm using "him" as a pronoun to refer to people in general. I use "him" as a pronoun when I'm not sure of a person's gender, and I use "it" when I'm sure that a person is female. I'm in a community college, and I just started taking a chemistry class. The class has 40 students, and the professor gave out a study guide. The study guide is divided into four parts, with a homework assignment in each part. My homework for part 1 was to read the entire study guide and answer every question. It's very easy to do, it only took about 20-30 minutes. I thought that was easy, so I thought I might as well try to read the study guides for the other three parts and do all the homework for them. I'm not going to lie, I'm pretty lazy, so I'm probably only going to do the homework for one of the other three parts. Here's the problem. The study guides are on the school's website. They're password protected, and the password is on the homework assignment. I do all my work online, so I looked up the school's website to find the password. When I got to the page with the password, I saw that the school's website had been hacked! The website was still up, but it's very slow, and it loads pages really slowly. Also, there was a message on the homepage that said that the school's computer systems were being reinstalled, and the website might be unavailable for a few days. I was able to find the school's phone number, and I called them. I asked if my password was safe. The person who answered the phone said that the password I used to log onto the school's website is safe. I asked if my study guide password was safe. The person who answered the phone said that I could be at risk if I used the same password for both accounts. I don't think it's a big deal, but I'm going to change my study guide password anyway. The person who answered the phone also said that the school might make the study guides available on the school's website after a few days, but it might take a week. The person who answered the phone said that the school is going to hire someone to fix the problem. I asked if the person could tell me when the school's computer systems are going to be fixed. The person who answered the phone said that he's not sure, but the person who's going to fix the problem is going to be a genius. He's also going to be a genius at fixing the problem. He's a genius at fixing computer problems. He's also going to be a genius at fixing the problem. I'm a genius at computer programming, and I'm going to fix the problem. I'm a genius at fixing computer problems, and I'm going to fix the problem. I'm also a genius at fixing the problem. I'm going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing computer problems, and I'm going to fix the problem. I'm going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing computer problems, and I'm going to fix the problem. I'm also going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing the problem. I think I'm going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing the problem. I also think that I'm going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing the problem. I think I'm going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing the problem. I also think that I'm going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing the problem. I'm also going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing the problem. I'm going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing the problem. I also think I'm going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing the problem. I'm also going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing the problem. I'm going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing the problem. I also think that I'm going to tell the school that I'm a genius at fixing the problem. I
