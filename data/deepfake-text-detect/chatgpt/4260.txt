Climate change or global warming as it previously was known as is a hot potatoe and not a very clean cut science to predict. There are thousands of climate scientists who would like to be right but that isn't the case at this time. The only way for the world to know if they get it wrong is by looking at the evidence, that information will come out in due course when we have better observational techniques. It's also important to remember where the greenhouse gas emissions came from: we used fossil fuels in our cars and power plants all over the world. When you do the math on carbon emissions per capita globally, most of them were produced in developing countries. So while a lot of people may think about how much CO2 each country puts into the atmosphere in terms of tonsyear, it doesn't tell us what effect that has on human lives.
