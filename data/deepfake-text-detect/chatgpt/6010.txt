I agree with most of Bernie's domestic politics, but foreign policy is a critical aspect of the presidency and I don't think he has what it takes. To convince me, he needs to tell me how he is going to prevent a nuclear confrontation with Iran. I wish I could think of a better question. He is a centrist, in the mold of Bill Clinton. That's where I am on foreign policy.
