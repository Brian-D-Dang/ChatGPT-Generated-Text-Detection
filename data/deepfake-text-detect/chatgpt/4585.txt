It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. Even though we can build more efficient vehicles, the environmental impact of car ownership is significant enough to be concerning if you think about it for longer then 10 seconds (in my opinion). And while I am all for exercise bikes eating healthy food etc.. what does walking 5 miles out your way save? I don't understand why people want to justify these things as something they need or deserve when they clearly do not even have the time nor money to go outside everyday anyway let alone walk long distances in such conditions (rainfogsleet often times), So what's next... should there not just be public transport available at all hours? Is this really the best approach? To me driving on freeways seems so pointless because every single person sharing them has no idea how fast any other vehicle is going around unless the driver honks, which unfortunately many drivers seem to abuse lately.... Or even worse texting behind you with no regard for anyone else but themselves! A truck will pull right up to where you stand waiting to pass, get into the lane ahead of you, slam his brakes, then proceed through. His only contact with you is slamming on his horn. You're lucky he doesn't run over your feet. If he stops suddenly, well - he stopped suddenly. Move along hippies. The vast majority of accidents happen within 3-5 minutes after getting onto freeway. Only position yourself in front of those big red arrows if you plan on making a "long" haul. This would mean traveling from Anaheim to Reno via State route 99 thru LA by daybreak. The rest of us drive to work, back home again and off to school before lunchtime. Afternoon traffic on US 29 northbound is vicious. Even during rush hour it gets snarled like crazy. There was one stretch up near Barstow recently where there were too many vehicles stuck trying to pass each other on I80 eastbound onto SR14 westbound. It took 15minutes to crawl past Bakersfield. If you wanted to make a complete circle trip Eastbound (US395) to Westbound (SR14) might take 45mins max., according to Google Maps. Northbound traffic only sucks less since there's not much traffic. Mountain Pass exit also always good. Las Vegas to Phoenix slow pokes: Here's hoping you guys enjoy being on secondary roads most days. Most Nevada drivers aren't bad either; just stay away from LOVELAND area. Didn't know this site existed until now; Anyways... understood the reason some folks prefer HOV lanes but agree "too few" and perhaps rethinking free parking lot for private autos. Addressing pollution problem isn't easy yet IMO but technology can help mitigate risk like GPS tracking ATS systems better tires Smartphones apps may further boost safety reduce accidents by providing information that currently depends upon human intuition and empathy [e.g., angry road rage incidents]. For example [off topic] I once drove through NYC and saw bumper stickers directing car owners to park in designated metered spots. All suggestions appreciated by all parties involved.:) I've seen more signs saying 'no left turns' posted around town recently. That'd probably work like a charm. Nobody wants to turn left anymore. We'll never see a world without automobiles. Remember the bicycle wars? How did THAT end? Oh yeah, nobody remembers anything except the thing that happened afterwards. Oh wait, it's still happening today somewhere. Everything comes around eventually. Interstate 85 south bound around Atlanta, GA. Watch out for trucks barreling down and cutting you off. Along interstate 20 between Dallas TX and Kansas City MO. Tons of semi trailer rubber flying everywhere wile they blast horns. And if its late enough at night, they use emergency lights. Nothing beats crossing the state line into New Mexico. They have NO rules, nothing enforcement wise. Its nuts! Try leaving LV on a weekend sometime after 8pm. Freeway becomes crowded with locals heading home. People passing everyone on the right and blowing all kinds of crap against your windows non stop. Welcome to life in NM. Go 60mph, brake hard and pray. No matter who it is. Good luck! If you decide to hit 68 from Salt Lake before your destination, prepare for a whiteout. Crazy stuff happens there sometimes. Not sure exactly what goes on, but try avoiding it if possible. lol:) For those of you thinking that public transit is fine, consider:1. Just yesterday (Monday) I caught a bus from Hollywood towards downtown San Diego, went across 6th St bridge, turned down University Ave, passed under highway 101and exited at 2nd Avenue, rode another half mile or so till I reached the ocean, hopped aboard a ferry (3 each ride) until finally reaching Balboa Park. My friend didn't pay 6.- Faster monotouching out gottoppingit adjusting, especiallyIf we have elected large
