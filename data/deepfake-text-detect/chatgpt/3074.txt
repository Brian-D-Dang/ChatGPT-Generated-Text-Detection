Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or other weapon; they should be put down like any animal would be in order to stop the violence and bloodshed. I understand your reasoning here but why do you think people who commit violent crimes are somehow less human? Do not all animals kill for food even though humans can choose not to eat meat?
