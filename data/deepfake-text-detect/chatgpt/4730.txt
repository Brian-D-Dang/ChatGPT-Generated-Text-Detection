I spend my summer as a representative of the college I attend and interact regularly with kids between the ages of 10 and 18. In these interactions, I have noticed that many parents will try to pressure their children into playing sports for sport's sake. The benefits of participating in a team or league range from social interaction to an increased feeling of self worth to more confidence. However, there are downsides to joining any organized activity. One major downside is injury. Kids who play sports may be exposed to injuries in ways they weren't previously. Some of these could occur at school where coaches aren't always qualified or trained appropriately. Many clubs require age-appropriate equipment when appropriate supervision isn't provided which can lead to significant risk but also increases participation rates leading some youth associations to recommend protective gear such as softball helmets and football pads... The American College Health Association (ACHA) has published recommendations for safe practices in physical education classes. ACHA recommends that students receive instruction on how to reduce health risks associated with contact sports while maintaining safety during games and practice. Students should learn about concussion awareness and proper lifting techniques to prevent back and neck problems as well as learning athletic movement skills to prevent overuse injuries. More than 90 percent of high schools across America offer weight training courses as part of the regular curriculum, according to Aerobics Fitness magazine. Colleges and universities around the country now do too, and online resources available through course work include YouTube videos demonstrating exercises like squats, lunges, push ups and sit ups. Also, most colleges provide computers so that homework assignments can be completed using programs called Zoom Video Conferencing meaning no matter what kind of computer you use it will all run smoothly. For those seeking further help along with video tutorials teachers might suggest going to websites such as mashable.com, foxnews.comcollege and nbcwashingtonpost.comeducation. Most importantly, instructors strongly advise against bingeing on junk food and drinking alcohol before a workout since this causes your body to release insulin causing fat cells to create extra calories instead of burning them off as fuel. That said, more and more young people view exercise both medically and socially as essential to being healthy. So ask yourself: Do I need to change? If not, then don't worry! And for those who feel changes must come to them just remember: It's never too late...and it starts today! For today's teens, finding balance is difficult when it comes to time management. With limited free time compared to older generations, teenagers struggle balancing time spent on academics and extracurricular activities. According to "Time Management Made Easy," by Nick Spitznagel and Rick Smith found in Harvard Business Review, much of the anxiety experienced regarding time conflicts stems from frustration rather than lack of efficiency. This means that teens fail to grasp the concept of prioritizing tasks because they simply want everything done immediately. Therefore, if they experience difficulty filling up every spare moment with something productive, they become frustrated and anxious about the coming weeks when nothing will get accomplished. To cope with stress caused by time challenges, teens often rely on substances ranging from caffeine to nicotine. These drugs temporarily relieve feelings of fatigue and nervousness that arise due to the demands of daily life. But long term dependencies on these medications can cause serious mental disorders such as withdrawal resulting in anger, depression and sleep disturbances. From Januvia to Zanaflex, our friends and family members in medicine take great care to prescribe only medication that relieves pain without creating new issues down the road. We encourage everyone to seek out medical treatment recommended by doctors specifically tailored towards each individual patient ensuring treatments fit perfectly within his or her lifestyle. Feelings of panic and helplessness commonly accompany teen agers dealing with night terrors brought on by insomnia. Though untreated this condition can cause severe health complications including heart disease and diabetes. Prescription sleeping pills prescribed by doctors are among the safest options for easing restlessness. Other methods to alleviate sleepless nights include meditation and hypnosis sessions. Alongside other therapies, guided imagery allows patients to imagine themselves resting peacefully in a calm environment. If you have been diagnosed with ADHD expect to see quite a bit of action with regards to your prescription meds. Your doctor knows better than anyone else whether or not the specific medications he prescribes meet the needs of your particular case. Nevertheless, one thing we know for sure is that there are times when switching prescriptions will benefit you considerably. Here are four reasons why you ought to consider this option. 1. When prescribing meds the first rule of thumb is that dose amounts are meant to match symptoms of illness. In cases prone to insomnia, say from narcolepsy, greater doses can produce results quicker. Conversely, lower doses may result in longer lasting effects. No two patients react exactly alike to a similar dosage schedule therefore it makes sense to keep changing prescriptions when necessary. 2. Medications differ greatly in terms of side effects. While some have minimal impact others fare poorly. Sometimes adverse effect becomes apparent quickly; thus having little effect. Such a constant property trying to tell us that certain substances showing has caused confusion here. As far
