Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the hiker is just unlucky enough to be out in the wrong place at the wrong time. These animal attacks are rare, but they can happen and they can be very serious. There are 3 types of attacks to be aware of: 1) attacks by an animal you may encounter while hiking 2) attacks by a dangerous animal and 3) attacks by a human. The latter is the most serious type. Attacks by dangerous animals There are many types of dangerous animals around and you need to be aware of them. Often times these types of attacks are happening in remote areas where the victim is too far away for help to arrive in time to save them. In the worst cases, a human may attack a hiker. This is where a hiker needs to know how to survive in the wild. When you are hiking and come across a wild animal, keep your distance and never get between a mother and her young. If you do happen to come across an animal in the wild, you should always make as much noise as possible to avoid startling the animal. The three most dangerous animals to be aware of are: The Bear: Bear attacks are rare but they do happen. Bears will attack if they think you are a threat to them and their cubs. Bears will try to put themselves between you and their young so you need to let them know that you are not a threat. Keep your distance, make as much noise as possible and if you see a mother with young, don't approach them. The Wolf: Wolves are an apex predator and they will attack if they think they are being threatened or their young are being threatened. Wolves will attack an animal that they think is a threat or an animal that is threatening their young. The Lion: Lions are apex predators as well and they are also very territorial. Lions are known to attack humans when they come across them in their territory. If you do encounter one of these animals, the best thing to do is to try to scare them away by yelling and making as much noise as you can. If you do get attacked, you should play dead and make no sudden movements to try and scare the animal away. If the animal doesn't go away after you play dead, then you need to fight back. The best way to fight back is to use your bear spray. It will temporarily blind the animal and give you enough time to get away. You should aim for the eyes and face to get the animal to stop attacking you. Humans can be dangerous animals and they can attack you as well. If you come across a human that is hostile, then you need to make sure that you are not going to be attacked. The best way to avoid this situation is to not engage the person at all. You should avoid eye contact and keep your distance. If you do come across a person that is acting strange, the best thing to do is to avoid them. If you feel that the person is going to attack you, you should try to run away from the situation as fast as you can. If the person does attack you, you should play dead and not make any sudden movements. If the person is attacking you with a weapon, you should try to get that weapon away from them and use it on them. If the person is not carrying a weapon, the best way to defend yourself is with your bear spray. If you do have bear spray, you should spray it in the attacker's eyes to temporarily blind them and get away. If you do get injured in an animal attack, you need to do what you can to treat your injuries. If you have bear spray, you should use it on yourself and try to treat the wound. If you don't have bear spray, you should try to wrap up the wound with anything you have available. If you do have something to make the wound bleed, you should use that to keep the wound clean. If you don't have anything to make the wound bleed, you should try to find a way to keep it clean. You can do this by covering the wound in a material like your clothing and doing your best to keep it clean. You can also use a clean cloth to help clean the wound. The most important thing to do is to keep the wound clean and dry. If you do have any medical supplies with you, you should use them to try to treat the wound. If you have a first aid kit with you, you should use the bandages, dressings, etc. to try to
