I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are largely influenced by islamic values which include modesty (including your dress code). After moving back to Istanbul I have always tried to keep an open mind about people wearing hijab but it was hard as everyone around me fell into one category or another - either they wore a full abayaniqab combo outside their house with aged grandparents accompanying them at all times; else young girls would wear cute trendy clothes that made you want to check out what's under those jeans etc... So this morning when I came across Sara Taksim article regarding Hijabis' right to ride public transportation without being harassedjudged because hijab somehow means we're oppressed creatures who deserve only pity from others....my first reaction was: What the hell!!???! This sounds so naive? But then again its hard for someone living within her comfort zone to be able to relate to the daily struggles some women face just trying to go through everyday life unnoticed due to social norms etc.. So yeah there has also got to be limits to everything including feminism! All said and done let us just focus more on how our appearance can actually help empower ourselves instead of making excuses like 'its degrading'. It makes no sense really does it!!!:p
