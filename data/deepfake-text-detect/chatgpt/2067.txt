Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll stop here for the night (and maybe in another 12 hours) That's like saying "I'm not going to date black women because they're too dark" You just don't say these kinds of shit!!!
