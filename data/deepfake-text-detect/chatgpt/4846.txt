I'm not asking anything about why we self harm - trust me I've got many answers for that. My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is unhealthy, it's a sign of depressionanxiety or something like that and so on but my question is: Why do we self-harm? (Original post by MsTeddy) My first thought was you just don't want people seeing your injuries but if that's the main reason than i'd say there are worse things out there!:D shrugs It can be very helpful for those who have made bad choices in life (for example if they had sex when drunk). Even if it's only temporary (and sometimes even a long term solution), it allows them to feel better without having to think through taking their own lives. Depressing as hell though when someone does this. It doesn't really help with anxiety at all which makes sense because suicide would take care of it anyway... "That last time I saw her she said "Remember, no matter what happens tomorrow, today will always stay the same." And then she smiled..." In answer to your original question, I suppose some people choose to hurt themselves in order to escape from their situation; whereas others choose to inflict pain upon ourselves as an act of resistance towards our circumstances. For instance, we might attempt to cut off part of the body as opposed to killing ourselves entirely, such as cutting off our right hand rather than our head. Some may also use other means of inflicting physical injury such as hitting oneself over the face until one tears up due to trying too hard etc. Others let go completely when attempting self harm, often screaming uncontrollably whilst doing so. This could mean either letting go at the moment or putting more effort into it, allowing one to release tension and harnessing energy. But most importantly, these acts allow us to avoid feeling remorseful later; giving us control over how much pain we're willing to endure before making a decision. As mentioned above, I believe that many people resort to hurting themselves when dealing with mental health issues. In fact, several studies have shown that 75 of attempted suicides involve emotional triggers which include illness or perceived loss of money or loved ones.[1] Self-harming behaviour is usually sparked by feeling alone or isolated, feeling misunderstood or rejected, experiencing great sadness or stress[2] or experiencing thoughts of death or despair. However, even amongst those suffering moderate levels of severe depression, 15-50 percent of youth show signs of suicidal ideation.[3] As well as victims of abuse, self-injury occurs frequently among LGBTQ individuals,[45] and as many as 50 of women suffer from eating disorders.[6] If you recognise yourself within any of these categories, please seek professional advice immediately. If you're reading this thread after posting, try to refrain from typing. We read everything here, so forgive us, ok? Look below to see were you went! Didn't realise I posted twice xx's What kind of stuff am I talking about? Well, the main thing is being able to identify depressed feelings and impulses instead of thinking they're 'just normal'. Not identifying the attachment style that leads to poor upbringing and subsequent relationship patterns. You know these types of relationships where two people get together and spend hours every day arguing, which eventually lead to a break up, which damages both parties further? Well yeah, that sounds familiar. Nowadays, both partners end up blaming each other and find ways to sabotage attempts at forming new healthy partnerships. That's pretty common, isn't it? Basically, the way we react to certain situations shows whether we grew up loving or hating parents, whether we were encouraged to express emotions properly and dealt with criticism appropriately. Similarly, personality traits come from similar influences. There's plenty of research showing correlation between insecure childhood attachments and certain psychiatric conditions later in life including borderline personality disorder.[7], [8], [9]. Also, physically harming oneself such as cutting nails and biting fingernails causes damage to the skin. Scarring gradually builds up beneath the surface leading to tissue rejection. Similarly, scar tissue forms around broken bones leading to permanent deformities if left untreated. There are various reasons why we humans tend to develop scars throughout our lifetime. Sometimes harmful habits become embedded deep inside human beings, causing weaknesses to develop and continue unchanged. Undoubtedly, most of us suffer because of destructive tendencies passed down from previous generations, but there are exceptions. The effects of bullying in primary school has been documented extensively. Children bullied repeatedly display lower confidence and self esteem and higher rates of depression and social isolation.[10] Bullying behavior itself greatly contributes to reduced quality of life later in life.[11] Additionally, children denied opportunities to grow normally learn to cope using negative coping behaviors such as substance abuse and violence instead.
