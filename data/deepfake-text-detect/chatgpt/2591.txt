I always have to hold my eyes to keep them rolling out of my sockets when I hear (australian) people talking about their trips to europe and canada and america. It makes me feel like i've not seen anything in 30 years because everyone else has gone on a trip that is 3 times longer than mine ever was yep, you're right. fuck those guys for traveling across the world.
