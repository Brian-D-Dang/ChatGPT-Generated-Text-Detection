As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is not an effective way for our country or the healthcare system as whole, be it private insurance companies working with federal programs such Medicaid and Medicare where each dollar spent has much higher returns than if they were simply given over in cash receipts without any sort therapy at all It's important too look closely into what happens after this spending; does their quality life actually improve? If so by just sheer coincidence rather then because he was treated could another family member who didn't get treatment potentially benefit from his being alive longer past when caring can extend further outwards like providing extra income opportunities through education etc.? Or would there still really only been one extended care case but now others got less money per month due increased costs elsewhere caused specifically (or often more generally) by health related cost inflationincreases driven up directly via government mandates backed mainly financially under Obamacare's individual mandate which I am sure most people don"t know about yet are convinced will help them personally aren t greedy enough big business owners causing these increases - though some may argue corporate greed causes many other problems... And even worse off why should anyone expect anything better: With today' s budget battles you never hear politicians arguing against getting rid medical treatments proven ineffective - instead cutting funding takes place urgently! Yet somehow during normal times across party lines everyone agrees increasing taxes won" make things easier while simultaneously letting entitlements explode wildly unchecked seems fine.. Why do "reformers," both Democrat Republican alike favor making cuts here first before looking anywhere else despite openly admitting impending bankruptcy isn " looming future problem?! Perhaps especially since privatizing Social Security alone might save 700 billion annually... Instead Democrats push hard reducing defense budgets based upon fearmongering claiming Republicans plan mass murdering till US become defenseless nation unable defend itself thanks military cutbacks. Even among conservatives concern grows woefully inadequate funds going towards national priorities including entitlement recipients along side war veterans,poor children ect.- forced onto chopping block also cause lackluster response borderlining indifference.... Who wants America great again?? Not me!!!
