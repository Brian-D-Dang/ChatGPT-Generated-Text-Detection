Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as what you'd find at your local pizzeria or mom-and-pop restaurants around town. But I'm not saying any of these products are bad. They're just mediocre for most people and that includes me: A self-proclaimed foodie who tends toward gourmet cooking when he has time (it's hard to cook on vacation), but will settle for fast food with ease if it means getting out of the house without much fussing. So here are my picks for the top five frozen pizzas you should buy instead of eating store bought. 1. De Luca Pizza Hawaiian Style (3) This American cheese pie is one of those cheapo brands you'll see sold at grocery stores with packs of 10-12 slices. It doesn't taste like much, which is why most places have this particular brand available. The crust is too chewy, the sauce tastes artificial, and there aren't enough ingredients to make up for all its shortcomings. If you want something cheesy and simple, go ahead and pick some off an old slice left over by someone else. If you do eat the whole thing though, don't blame me! 2. Betty Crocker Frozen Hot Pocket Pizzaz (4) One reason this product exists is because GE built it into their microwave ovens so they could sell more hot pockets. Not only does it smell absolutely horrible, it also comes straight out of the freezer cold (the original was made using fresh dough). Of course, while the bread part is stale, the toppings are still edible. Best part? You get two complete meals for 5. 3. Little Caesar Original Sauce Cheese Pepperoni4.99 Instead of buying a bag of Little Caesar pepperoni, grab "The Dip" instead. Made right before each season starts, every flavor except plain and garlic salt looks exactly the same. Grab your favorite dipping sauce, then stick it directly onto a piece of dry white sandwich bread cut into 8 squares. That bastion of winter comfort, the cracker, acts as the perfect vessel for all things spicy, creamy, savory, salty, sweet.....you name it. And yes, we know about the eggplant parm on basic meatballs, but any other topping would be missing half the fun. 4. Lunchables Snack PacksStuff Lake, WA - Each box contains three mini cheese pizzas and varieties such as chicken strips and macaroni salad along with six different cookies ranging between vegan chocolate chip and regular Oreos. While the cost per portion is less than a dollar, this convenient snack costs a lot more. Sure, you save money on gas and snacks since you don't need a car andor kitchen, but you pay twice as much for everything inside. Plus, you gotta take care of them once you open 'em. To avoid having to worry later whether the pasta got squished, broken apart or turned into mush, it might be better to pack your own lunches rather than paying full price for a crappy box that may end up deteriorating in your fridge anyway. Just put 'em under the heat lamp until ready to use! 5. Hungry Man Classic Chicken Breast SlidersSandusky, OH - For years now, Hungry Man has been selling pre-cooked sliders filled with chicken breast chunks covered in barbecue sauce. In fact, almost everyone knows these tasty treats were originally inspired by McDonald's Nuggets, being introduced in 1975 as the Happy Meal toy. However, the package says they've been developing flavors since 1976, making us wonder how long they really had the idea first. At least Hungry Man makes theirs look appetizingly plump. Still, I wouldn't recommend picking up a single slider. Even if you divide it up amongst several friends, it won't hold together as well as the real deal. Worst case scenario, you spend the rest of the day trying to explain to others why your lunch came tumbling down during conversation. Eat a few bites yourself before passing them around. Then you'll never regret doing that again. UPDATE Apparently there was another contender at 6....but it hasn't been reviewed yet. DanWills81 pizzabias - Dan Wills (danwills97) November 28, 2014
