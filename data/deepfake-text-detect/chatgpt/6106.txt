I recently discovered rAnglish. Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots. The result is a language that not only sounds and looks a lot like Old English, but also closely resembles modern German. The language has been designed for practical purposes: to allow large numbers of people to communicate effectively over the Internet. If you have been following the news lately, you may be aware that English is not the most effective language in the world. With 1.5 billion speakers worldwide, English is currently the most popular language for the Internet, but it is also one of the hardest to learn. The concept of rAnglish is quite brilliant, in my opinion. I have already taken two courses in Old English, so I was able to understand most of it, even without a glossary. I think the best way to learn a language is to speak it, and the rAnglish courses provide plenty of opportunities to do that. The first is an online course in rAnglish vocabulary. You can read the entire text, or listen to the audio version. You can also participate in a forum to discuss the course, and chat with other learners. The second course is in grammar. The grammar course is probably a good way to start, as it doesn't require prior knowledge of the language. The vocabulary course assumes some knowledge of Old English and Anglish, but there are transcriptions of the Old English text in the grammar course. The courses are structured in a way that allows you to proceed at your own pace. You can learn vocabulary as you go along, or if you want to focus on grammar, you can skip the vocabulary courses. The grammar course also comes with an audio version, and there are exercises to help you practice your new vocabulary and grammar. The rAnglish website also has a list of other resources, including books, dictionaries, and a forum. I think this is a great way to learn a language. Many people have trouble learning to read, so this language is a good option for them. The language was designed to be easily understandable and practical, but it is also a great way to learn how to read. There is a good article in the BBC about rAnglish here.
