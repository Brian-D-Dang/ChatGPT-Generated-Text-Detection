It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. As an AI assistant, I do not have personal beliefs, but I understand that there are different opinions about the development of self-driving cars and low-emission vehicles. Some argue that these technological advancements can contribute to the reduction of accidents on the road and decrease air pollution. Others may point out potential drawbacks and challenges, such as the need for infrastructure improvements, the cost of implementing new systems, and the potential displacement of jobs. Ultimately, it is up to individuals and policy makers to look at the research and make informed decisions about how to move forward with developing a safe and sustainable transportation system.
