I should caveat that I'm talking about these terms as applied to humans not plants, nonhuman animals, or electronic devices. And by "socially-sanctioned," I mean a definition broadly acceptable to the general public and recognizing essential features of gender; in other words, one that is more than just an individual preference but also generally recognized by society at large. As far back as we have written history, there exists a recognition that male and female are different. The earliest texts refer to this difference through various analogies based on physical differences: they are said to be made from different materials (e.g., gold for men), fashioned with different tools (a sword for a man vs. needlework for women), and ordered differently (mannerly behavior). Other descriptions follow suit. Generally speaking, most people who wrote down their observations were more interested in describing how people lived rather than why they did so. They weren't necessarily thinking critically about what it meant to do something like eat food versus make clothes out of fabric - they would describe the nature of things simply because those kinds of behaviors seem to exist independently of consciousness. So when you say that someone has a 'woman's brain,' I take issue with your implication that being feminine means having less intelligence than masculine types. If anything, such comparisons imply that masculinity requires greater intellect than femininity. To me, it seems clear that some traits associated with women might require them to exercise their minds more often than others. Certainly many contemporary feminists recognize this fact. In feminists' own summary account of human development, the first book describes men's tendency toward logic while the second focuses on women's creativity. Contemporary feminist thought recognizes that women's bodies change during pregnancy, giving rise to new experiences which can then influence a woman's psychological makeup going forward after she gives birth. This phenomenon isn't unique to culture, either; it happens across species, as well. For instance, American universities began allowing pregnant students to return to school in 1935. According to [this article] (URL0) in Nature, scientists observed a drop in test scores among the mothers compared to pre-pregnancy numbers later on. It was hypothesized that the lack of sleep caused fewer opportunities available to study effectively (for both mother and child) - the same situation faced by working moms today. Mothers were able to cope with all of this because prior generations had endured similar conditions without complaint. Before agriculture became widespread around 10,000 years ago, historians believe that hunter gatherer societies experienced high infant mortality rates due to malnutrition, poor hygiene practices, dirt floors, etc. Breastfeeding helped mothers survive because it offered nutritious milk plus antibodies that could protect children against disease. These early farming cultures eventually adopted breastfeeding habits, though our understanding suggests that lactation may have been originally connected to another type of social bonding between the sexes. In any case, these factors influenced modern Western conceptions of "female" identity, too; it's no coincidence that the word 'milkmaid' remains part of English slang to describe a young woman seen frequenting pubs in rural areas. Today, however, breasts remain sexualized to such an extent that even early exposure can lead girls into double standards surrounding sexiness. Even if you're certain that breast size doesn't correlate with sexuality, does having big boobs automatically indicate promiscuity? That assumption stems directly from the idea that fertility appraises one's body parts according to biological metrics instead of cultural ones. We might prefer big boobs over small ones, sure, but that still implies that larger breasts represent the kind of biological indicator indicative of increased attractiveness to males. That assessment demotes femininity further, associating it only with supposed eroticism and beauty within traditional mainstream media outlets. Telling us that vaginas are "rewarded" by penile penetration is deeply problematic insofar as it reinforces the notion that vaginal pleasure originates solely inside a person's head. Yet perhaps the biggest problem with surgical intervention involves the issue of consent, especially since genitals aren't visible enough to confirm they've actually changed until surgery occurs. Not every transperson expresses interest in altering their genitalia, yet the practice itself assumes that its recipient will want it done. But don't worry! There's always plastic surgery! And maybe someday in the future, a highly effective form of gene therapy will allow individuals to alter their reproductive organs at will without fear of complications or stigma.
