I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural thing. They are slightly easiermore comfortable for eating Asian dishes with rice as you don't have to move your hand around like when using metal utensils and it's not as big of an issue if you're eating by yourself with friends or family
