I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to create an element from scratch. Yes? No? Maybe so? It just seems like there would be some point at which all of these atomic nuclei are packed together too tightly for further rearrangements (or whatever) to take place...is this correctinaccurate? Or is it possible that you could somehow "build" one atom out of many smaller ones if they were correctly arranged beforehand, sorta like Lego pieces fitting together perfectly without gaps? If not atoms, then what about molecules with similar properties that can have their fundamental particles arranged differently than each other? How does chemistry differ between them? Sorry if my question isn't particularly well-thought out!
