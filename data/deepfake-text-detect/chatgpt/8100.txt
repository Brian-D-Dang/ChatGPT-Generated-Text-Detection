Would you go to Enterprise and rent a car for 24 months? That's very similar to what a lease is. 1. Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, has written that people should never buy cars they cannot afford or carry loans on them longer than 3 years unless it was an investment purchase (meaning the person had planned ahead). Her idea of debt free living includes not having any accumulation in credit cards etc., but she also advocates some sorta savings plan as well like 401K plans...you know with money set aside each year into various accounts....that way when your old (er) there will be funds already saved up which can help towards retirement type needs if needed at all.....and no mortgage payment!!! Interesting book I saw her speak about 10 yrs ago now! Here's another option: refinance through peer-to -peer lending companies such Lending Club (7 min.), Prosper (5 per loan), Funding Circle (.01-.25 APR range depending upon risk rating after 180 days - one time 99 fee paid by lender.) The lenders are competing against banks other financial institutions just waiting their turn behind desks.. It takes 2 minutes online then wait 6 weeks while company verifies information. Do this several times every few mths...such low rates may make these options pay off; where else could big bank give BOA rate??? This info from post above via link below
