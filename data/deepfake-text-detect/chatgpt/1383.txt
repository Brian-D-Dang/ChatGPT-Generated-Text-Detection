I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit cards and no job (that we know about) run a business. Best Buy isn't the only place employees have this problem. It happens everywhere - when was the last time you went into Best Buy? This shit has been happening for decades! No doubt. Obviously there are too many people working at these stores who don't do anything... But how can all of them get away with lackadaisical behavior???
