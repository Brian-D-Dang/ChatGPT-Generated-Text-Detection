I agree with most of Bernie's domestic politics, but foreign policy is a critical aspect of the presidency and I don't think he has what it takes. To convince me otherwise means you can tell me why our country should be propping up Saudi Arabia as opposed to standing against them for their human rights abuses? Even if we were isolationist in general.. You understand that we have interests around world right? You're talking about Syria correct? Yeah, Syria specifically. But also Yemen, Pakistan etc... The US doesn't just go into other countries and make things better. We intervene when there are large scale problems going on or there is something beneficial to us from doing so (oil pipelines).
