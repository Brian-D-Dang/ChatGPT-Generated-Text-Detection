This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special treatment and care at the facility compared with adults (prior to birth) so it would make sense for them to be treated appropriately there. I'm sure that you're right about the need for more adult supervision in this situation...but we did have one juvenile diagnosed as a juvenile before she was even born. I think both of those kids were acting on their rights.
