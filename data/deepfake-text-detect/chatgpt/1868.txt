Fairly simple premise. I'm 35 years old. I remember the Cold War. The first Gulf War. The Iraq War. War in Afghanistan, etc... I hear talk all the time about how we're fighting a new enemy and that "they" are playing us right now or some shit like that. Do you really believe this? No idea why people act like they don't know what's going on. It would be one thing if there were no internet connection to look at but most of us have busier lives than ever before so it wouldn't take much for someone to not keep up with news unless your part of an elite class.
