With the advent of self-driving vehicles, the unavoidable will become clear: people are terrible drivers, and operating your own car is unacceptably reckless if a better alternative exists. I see no reason to stop at this point, since such things should be obvious by now. In fact, you can't even blame autonomous cars any more than you could blame the fact that women drive poorly or underweight compared with men. Yes, it's true that some people are bad drivers for reasons we don't understand (and probably never will understand), but humans are also human beings, not robots. That doesn't mean they're all perfect, however you feel about them; don't try to paint us in an artificial light. We're just as fallible as everyone else. But what about those who have their lives ruined? How do you react when someone who has lost everything because he was driving drunk gets a free ride from the police? Shouldn't the punishment match the crime? You certainly shouldn't encourage two groups - one being less responsible than another - to share responsibility for making decisions which put others at risk. And yet, too many laws exist aimed at keeping two sets of rules on the road so common sense would tell you that's exactly what is happening. The problem is that we make ourselves into societies where most decisions are made without regard to individual legal consequences. It may seem like the right thing to do, and it's important to recognize the benefits of increasing economic mobility for our society above anything else. But it also means we treat rights much like the weight of a feather; anyone can throw it up in the air, but it won't go far unless they have the necessary force. So naturally, we tend to give privileges to those who deserve them, often until they've earned enough to keep doing it, and once those privileges are gone they'll drop out pretty fast. All around the world today there seems to be a growing consensus that there needs to be a reset button pressed. The state needs to step aside; individuals need freedom to decide how they want to live, work and play. In order to achieve these goals, first of all there needs to be a complete change in the way courts deal with personal injury cases rather than relying on lawyers who only care about money. Lawyers might think they're helping their clients get justice, but actually they're just putting themselves ahead of other parties involved in the case. They're basically acting as the very opposite of heroes shining lights on the dark and ruining lives across a huge range of industries. I'm not advocating forcibly taking people away from their homes and forcing them onto welfare programs, nor am I suggesting cutting funding for law enforcement agencies to the tune of billions of dollars. Instead, I believe the best solution is to invest resources into education, training and access to health services especially mental health treatment and gender equality advocates. Governments should be working actively in tandem with social movements for equal pay and higher standards for working conditions, etc., instead of wasting time worrying about frivolous lawsuits and inability to enforce existing ones. We've already seen the devastating effects of automation. Is it really going to take a technological disaster before we realize that allowing machines to run our lives isn't the smartest idea anymore?
