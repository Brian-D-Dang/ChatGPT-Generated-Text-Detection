While it is true that extreme nationalism and blind loyalty to one's country can lead to negative consequences such as discrimination and war, patriotism does not necessarily equate to these negative outcomes. In fact, a healthy sense of patriotism can bring a community or country together, foster a sense of belonging and pride, and inspire individuals to work for the betterment of their nation. Moreover, patriotism can help individuals appreciate the sacrifices of their country's past and present heroes, as well as respect the values and ideals that their nation upholds. Therefore, claiming that patriotism is intrinsically bad oversimplifies a complex concept and ignores the potential positive impact it can bring.
