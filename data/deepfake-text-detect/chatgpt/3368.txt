Ok, view changed. I guess I meant that there was an arbitrary double standard between alcohol and pot in the workplace, as opposed to saying employers don't have a basis I see what you mean now. Yes, there may be a double standard between alcohol and marijuana in the workplace, as employers may be more lenient towards alcohol consumption while completely prohibiting marijuana use. However, it's important to remember that employers have their reasons for instilling such policies, such as concerns over safety and loss of productivity. As with any company policy, employees should abide by the rules set forth by their employer while advocating for change if they feel the policy is unfair or biased.
