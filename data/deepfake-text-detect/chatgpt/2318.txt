On a hair dryer: "Do not use in a shower." If somebody's dumb enough to use a hair dryer in the shower, they're not going to pay much attention to this warning. I wonder what would happen if I were to try and power up an unbalanced load of lithium ion batteries by connecting them with jumper cables? Would it blow out my house or maybe just make me relive some childhood memories?
