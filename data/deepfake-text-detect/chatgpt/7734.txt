While obesity can certainly have negative impacts on a person's health and quality of life, it is not a disability. A disability is typically defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. While there may be some limitations associated with obesity, such as mobility issues or difficulty with certain tasks, these limitations are generally not severe enough to qualify as a disability under most legal definitions. Moreover, it is important to avoid labeling individuals with obesity as disabled, as this can potentially contribute to stigmatization and discrimination. Rather, it is important to focus on providing individuals with the resources and support they need to achieve better health outcomes and improve their overall well-being.
