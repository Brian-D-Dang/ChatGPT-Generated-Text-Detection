I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. It is clear that McDonald's makes no money off its food delivery service because it owns the restaurant chain and has been trying to get rid of the business for years now with no success. McDonalds donates 30 of all profits from the restaurants it operates out of its own pocketbook but McDonald's pays McDonald's for all the hours they work at their restaurants since most people would pay more than 5 per hour just by paying for their meals instead. What kind of foolish business model does McDonald's operate? The reason McDonald's hasn't had problems doing this before is that the company didn't want to give them a foothold into the restaurant industry..... hence the "defence against competition." The argument goes like this: McDonald's employees should be paid well enough on the basis of what they earned while working there so they shouldn't have to spend another penny when they are not earning anything. And McDonald's doesn't need McDonald's loyalty as well; they aren't making money off McDonald's customers who haven't even visited one of their restaurants yet anyway. So why do these folks put up with McDonald's workers having nothing better to eat then McDonald's customers' shitty choices? Why wouldn't McDonald's allow any kind of flexibility whatsoever if the company owns the franchisee's restaurants? Well McDonald's isn't operating an illegal restaurant company anymore right? But wait, I forgot to mention that McDonald's doesn't actually care about McDonald's customers. All it wants is a profit margin instead of finding new ways to make money off of the people starving hungry to death everywhere else. It all boils down to greed and convenience.
