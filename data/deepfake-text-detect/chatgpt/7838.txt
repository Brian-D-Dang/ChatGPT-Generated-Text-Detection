Many people living in poverty often face systemic barriers that make it difficult to escape the cycle of poverty. Factors such as lack of access to quality education, healthcare, affordable housing, and job opportunities can significantly affect one's ability to improve their lives. Additionally, individuals living in poverty often face limited social networks and lack of support systems, which can increase feelings of isolation and hopelessness. Therefore, it is unfair to generalize or attribute poverty solely to a lack of motivation. Instead, addressing systemic barriers and creating opportunities for people to improve their lives can help break the cycle of poverty.
