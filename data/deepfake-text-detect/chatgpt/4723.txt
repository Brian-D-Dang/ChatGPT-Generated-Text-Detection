There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: I've seen him in other movies and he does that too but not as bad (he's much less disruptive). I suppose it depends on what kind of show you are going to be. If your show is about basketball then some guy should probably know how to play basketball just because an audience will see his performance. But if there isn't any music or really no acoustics involved like with live shows then it doesn't matter so much if someone knows their instruments really well. A lot of people go through this stage where they don't have anything unless its something big like orchestras or bands. This also applies for languagesaccented english depending on what country you're from. Some people prefer to speak in full accents while others feel more comfortable speaking in Standard English. The same thing is true with when people get into sports. Even though these days most teams are pretty good and every player has talent within themselves maybe 5 do all the work behind the scenes. So even though I can tell you which players usually score the most points per game or block shots etc... things are still different than watching our local team play versus playing against them. You might think, "oh well that player played such and such position last year," but sometimes they actually didn't because another person had been working hard in practice. Or they were called up by injury. Things like this happen almost everyday now more than ever before. This goes back to the above example where you would only need a basic understanding of a sport, but later down the road this knowledge may become obsolete. Maybe by tomorrow that athlete could be washed out due to injuries or whatever else. Then we'd miss out on that amazing shot or basket because we weren't paying attention enough to notice. Same with games....we would lose interest after awhile and forget everything or simply shut off until next time. Its kinda sad when i say that but thats basically why fast food tastes better today......many franchises keep churning out new products hoping we'll eat one day, while if instead we ate healthy foods, we wouldn't want anymore!
