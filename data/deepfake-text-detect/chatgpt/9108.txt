From The majority of sexual assault are not reported to the police (an average of 68 of assaults in the last five years were not reported).1 Those rapists, of course, don't have a crime record. But why would they? They had sex with children and adults. Children who weren't raped aren't sexually assaulted as often by their peers. So no one is getting hurt from being attacked; it's just that they can be easily seen. The same could also be said for rape victims whose sexual trauma was caused by someone else. In other words, rapists and abusers are different people: some have criminal histories and others do nothing but produce a mess-up. Rape occurs because of an act of violence. And that's something you shouldn't ever underestimate. But what about these women who get raped? It seems like many decades ago, when most rapes were committed on college campuses, there wasn't even any awareness among men that it might happen more frequently than on campus... unless you count male accusers if only because they're so desperate for attention that they'd make the effort to reach out to condom users! But all this new technology has done is dramatically reduce the number of cases where the victim admits to having been raped. That's because too many people now assume that girls are "just" boys, which makes them less likely to report such crimes. So maybe it's time we stopped thinking of those young women as the perpetrators of the past, instead looking at the survivors themselves, who don't want to admit mistakes or mistreats as much as they did in the past.
