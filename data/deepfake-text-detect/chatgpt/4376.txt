Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that the type of people with poor crisis management aren't at risk for killing themselves; by "legitimacy" I'm talking about how valid a suicide note is in determining whether or not someone was serious enough to die. The question has been answered now (thanks uthrowawaybob). Some people claim they have no reason to live and are just going through the motions; or some people want it over as soon as possible because death means getting rid of stress. It's somewhat plausible if you consider the differences between both scenarios.
