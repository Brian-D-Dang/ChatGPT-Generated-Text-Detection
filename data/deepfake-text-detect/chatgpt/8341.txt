While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to beat Trump. He is too liberal for the moderate democrats that are in control today (especially since so many democratic politicians turned their backs when trump made his bigotry overt). For those reasons alone i think we need someone who can win back republican votes from people like me through persuasion rather than scaring them away by trying be something they will never accept... Bill Clinton was very popular because no matter how much you disagreed or hated hillary she gave off an aura where everyone felt good about her even if only out respect.. When Hillary lost this ability Bill's popularity quickly faded once again showing just why dems lose every election!
