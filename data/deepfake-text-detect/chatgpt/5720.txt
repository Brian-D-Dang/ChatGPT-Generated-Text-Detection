I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, I want a family, but I also want to be financially stable before I bring children into the world. And I want to have a family that's happy. Not a family where one person is unhappy with having kids. I think there are worse motives to have children. I have an irrational fear of children. I'm terrified that I will be a terrible mother and I'll fail my kids. This makes me want to have children even less. But that's just how I feel. I just feel like I don't want to be selfish. I know it's not really selfish because I'm not trying to make my life better with children. I'm trying to make my life better for the sake of my children. I'm not a mother and I'm not pregnant. I just want to have a family. I want to be able to give my kids a life that they deserve. I want them to be happy. I want them to be able to have everything they need and want. I want them to be able to go to college, get married, have kids of their own, and be successful. But I can't do this if I'm a mother, because I'm not financially stable enough. I'm not financially stable enough for myself. I want to be able to provide my children with a better life than I had. I can't do that with my own children. I'm not going to be financially stable until I'm 30 and I don't want to wait until then to have children. I don't want to be in my 30s and still trying to get a degree. I don't want to be in my 30s and still trying to get a job. I don't want my kids to grow up in a situation where they don't have everything they need or want. I want them to be happy. I want to give my kids a better life. I want to be able to give them the life they deserve. I want to be able to provide them with everything they need and everything they want. I don't want to have kids if I can't provide them with what they need. I don't want to have kids if I can't provide them with what they want. And I want to provide my kids with everything they need and want. I want to give my kids everything they deserve. I want to give my kids what they want. I want to give my kids a better life. I just want to have a family. I just want to be able to give my kids a life that they deserve. I just want to be able to give my kids a life that they want. I just want to have a family. I just want to be a mother. I want to be able to give my kids a life that they deserve.
