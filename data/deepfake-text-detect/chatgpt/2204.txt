I been using Google Chrome as far as I remember (probably since 2010) and it's been my default browser on all the computerslaptops I've used. Chrome was fast, reliable and easy to use so why change? Chrome is a very good browser but Mozilla Firefox has many more advantages especially if you're concerned about privacy or security issues: Multi-process architecture - this feature allows extensions not only to run in their own process (es), they can also access resources of other processes which greatly enhances protection against memory corruption vulnerabilities like heap overflows because when an extension crashes your whole browsing session remains unaffected by that crash until you close down that tabwindow etc... By comparison Chrome sandboxed each page into its own separate "sandbox" and so rather than terminating the entire webbrowser after one bad extension crash, people were forced to reload the affected site manually from scratch every time! This could easily take 10 minutes before even being able to start another search query let alone completing any schoolwork for example.... Firefox Quantum CSS engine improvements - these helped eliminate significant rendering problems with websites such as those hosted at social media companies Facebook and Twitter. The original version of modern day Facebook took over 5 seconds just to load properly on Firefox while the same website loaded instantly on Chrome.....and then there are all kind of random javascript bugs due to poor coding practices where developers often assumed certain things would work without checking them first.. ie loading up thousands upon thousands of unneccessary scripts that slow everything right down making sites unusable sometimes. Cross platform compatibility - so long as your computer runs Windows 7 (32 bit 64bit versions available) or Mac OS X Snow Leopard onwards (32bit 64bit versions again available). Both platforms provide native support for Firefox although Linux users must install software called Wine to enable full functionality. Chrome never had multi-platform compatability built in meaning running it on a different operating system meant installing a virtual machine program like VirtualBox in order to get similar performance results otherwise known as 'Dual Booting'.....not optimal really. Increased addons capability - thanks largely to the extensibility features introduced in Firefox 4.0 back in 2011 Firefox now supports hundreds of thousands of plugins written directly by third party developers unlike Chrome whose adblocker implementation is limited to official ones provided via Google's extensions marketplace. Over 50 of current Firefox extensions have no equivalent counterpart within Chrome! If you ask me thats unacceptable considering most people don't want to spend hours hunting through obscure forums trying figure out how to make something useful happen online......just give us what we need already!! Ad Blockers - Ok here comes the biggie. When it comes to blocking unwanted advertising across the internet there simply isn't anything better than AdBlock Plus.......it works everywhere else including mobile devices too whereas both Safari and Edge browsers limit themselves to desktop machines leaving laptops untouched should anyone be bothered enough to include ads inside content focused apps like Spotify and Netflix for instance........yeah...that sounds pretty stupid doesn't it?! So yeah, go grab yourself some uBlock Origin instead:3
