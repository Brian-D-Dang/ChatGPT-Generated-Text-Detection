I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience, nuclear weapons are a great tool by which people can take control of themselves and fight off any threat they may encounter The US government has always been brave enough with their nuclear arsenal, even assuring us that it was not capable of such type of attack on our homeland during World War II. Different countries join together to defeat them with their own nuclear arsenals. This theory was further supported when the USSR joined forces with Germany and gave them the nerve for using nuclear weapons as well. This was an example of how we could achieve victory over Germany without sacrificing any human life. It follows then that the US should not consider itself a "nuclear power" but rather just be careful about what kind of country you choose to follow in your choice of policy. It might sound naive but if taken seriously it should serve us all very well indeed! The author is Professor Emeritus at Stanford University
