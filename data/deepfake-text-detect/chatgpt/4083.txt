I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for murder, but only survived one year of it, that would be enough time to get them out and let society try again after they're no longer a threat. What about people who committed crimes and then were found not guilty by reason of insanity? I think no matter what you say about victims I still think that's something we need to address.
