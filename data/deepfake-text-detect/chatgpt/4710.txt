For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to the influence of my girlfriend and her friends. Since she is almost 2 years older than me, much of our relationship's development was done through mutual consent (e.g., staying up late on school nights for movies). Now that we have begun dating seriously, however, it seems like things are going from bad to worse. She tells me there isn't enough time in the day because she feels overwhelmed with all of her responsibilities as a student at university while still trying to maintain some semblance of social life outside the home. When we go out, she would rather hang around by herself, leaving me no opportunity to spend any quality time alone with her. In fact, I'd even say it's more or less impossible to talk about personal issues, which makes talking to her very difficult at best (and also contributes to frequent arguments between us). As such, most conversations nowadays consist of superficial conversation topics like what happened during class last week or whether a movie is worth watching again. Even when we're together, some days we don't do anything aside from watch television shows together. On other days, though, she just goes into her room early without saying goodnight. Leaving me feeling confused, lonely, angry... etc. What can I do? Am I supposed to "man up" and start acting maturer and stuff so she'll respect me? Is this normal behavior for young adults? My friend group doesn't really understand why it bothers me so much - they think she should take advantage of having someone to share her burdens with, but I feel that responsibility shouldn't lay solely on one person (albeit a supportive one) especially if you both disagree on how to handle certain situations (i.e. I want to try new hobbiesclasses; she wants to stick with old ones). Any advice would be appreciated! How am I expected to act these days?!? Edit: Sorry guys. There wasn't too much information provided, as per request, here's the rest of the story: From the beginning, her parents had put pressure on her not to date me. She told them that it would interfere with studying, that she didn't need anyone else in her life. But after getting involved, their objections began being published publicly online, effectively ruining her reputation among my peers. They've threatened legal action against her and call themselves'supporters' just to justify their actions. Although not so long ago, they were supportive towards her decision to study abroad, now they support hers taking classes at unversity despite knowing nothing of my characteractivities outside of their house. So yeah, they basically made her life all about him..: To add onto the above edit, here are two examples: We went to London for 7 weeks over Christmas break. It was great until halfway through. We spent most of our free time either traveling around England visiting places or hanging out downtown shopping. One night, my mom asked if I wanted to meet her sisters since they live nearby. Of course, I said yes - this meant paying for transportation costs (not included in the ticket price), eating dinner afterwards waiting till 8pm for everyone to get off work before heading back to my place. When we arrived, they started interrogating me and seemed surprised everything was alright, asking questions like where did my boyfriend sleep every single night, implying he must be living somewhere else, wanting to know his academic performance, etc. Further, they questioned the amount of money I make for working renting out three rooms of my house, making sure I answered their queries correctly. After several uncomfortable hours of interrogation, I finally got fed up of answering, telling them I felt sickened yet powerless to avoid their questions so I decided to leave. The next day, after arriving home from my trip, my mother excused herself to tell me something important. Later, my girlfriend called me and whispered something into my ear, indicating that although those family members won't care about me anymore, I should still stay away from them. That same afternoon, my dad came knocking on my door claiming he heard something weird coming from my room in the morning. He asked me where we stayed in London, whom we saw, how many times we ate, etc., causing me to mistake this question for another attempt of questioning. Since then, my father hasn't spoken to me if we see each other at least once a month; while my girlfriend appears distant whenever she sees me. Another example: Recently, we attended the theatre show Blood Brothers (in English; adapted from Craig Robinson's original play). Beforehand, my girlfriend and I agreed upon a general theme for our dates. For example, we agreed we wouldn't buy expensive gifts nor bring along friends unless requested. However, a few days later we ended up doing just that. To give credit where credit is due, my girlfriend mentioned via text message that she was responsible for bringing people useful equipment and her expectations too; whereas Junedent (2 And 3 Pan throwing its 6 Inbar Result
