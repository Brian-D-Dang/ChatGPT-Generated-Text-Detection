Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one partner has had enough? I have read quite a few posts on here about relationships and how "oh heshe is just having an off day" etc., but nothing actually seems to be mentioned regarding this point of view. After more than 5 years together (married) my husband told me yesterday that we are finally done. He wants out. We can stay friends if we want to or go our separate ways. It's his choice. Now what do you think would make him feel better emotionally-if anything at all. Any advice appreciated! Thanks so much!!! -Mum My response to Mum: Have the kindest words possible ready to come pouring forth from your heart. Tell her that even though she may not agree with it now, there will always exist within your relationship something like love - because every good thing eventually passes away. And encourage her to try to remember those times without resentment. Say things such as, "When people change their minds this often means they have been hurt by someone else." Remind her why she fell for him in the first place. Because deep down inside everyone needs approval; including husbands. So tell her that before jumping into another relationship, between them both she could consider stepping back into some sort of counseling session while helping each other through these difficult issues. But most importantly REMEMBER THIS... The main reason for men wanting new women isn't necessarily feeling neglected, unappreciated, unfulfilled, angry and disappointed (though sometimes all might happen). But rather it's simply because men still have natural instincts that are needed early on during a pregnancy to ensure the survival of their children. If none were available then men would remain single eternally. Once again, don't pressure her to take part in this process. Just listen very carefully, and understand where her frustration comes from. There really is little that changes the fact that she loves him deeply, despite everything going wrong. Even though mutual respect and friendship is important to keep viable throughout life, too many couples never experience true marriage and family unity. In addition, a person who truly believes in God cannot devalue others physically or spiritually, especially by cheating on a spouse. Do NOT respond negatively to her pain, nor judge her feelings towards him. Rather allow yourself to feel compassion for her plight. You know she must be hurting terribly right now. Keep listening quietly, waiting patiently until the time is ripe for her to speak openly and honestly. Believe me, there is value in understanding WHY someone does or says certain things, regardless of whether or not you agree. With patience and sincere communication over days or weeks ahead, trust that the truth shall prevail once she feels safe enough to reveal herself completely in front of you. Her emotions will begin to heal rapidly... She will gradually develop renewed confidence in you, and gain self esteem again. At which point SHE WILL WANT YOU BACK!! Think of this momentous opportunity as yet ANOTHER blessing coming directly from above. Accept it gratefully, realizing only incredible things can result from it. Or perhaps now she is thinking twice about giving up on him entirely. Then try harder to talk her out of that decision, gently reminding her about the need to forgive and forget. Hopefully she will indeed choose forgiveness. Get back to work on developing positive channels of communicating with her, consistently expressing thoughts that uplift instead of create discordance. Try approaching her life situation as a learning experience from which great blessings might emerge. Indeed, sometimes partners CAN learn from their mistakes, and move forward flourishing. Trusting God's power to accomplish His purposes in your lives, He will provide divine guidance whenever necessary. Ultimately it doesn't matter what you say, it matters HOW you say it! It appears that your husband has an attitude problem, and only those closest to him seem able to get under his skin. This obviously upsets you immensely. Please face facts, you two ARE finished. As you yourself stated, you two maintained a long distance arrangement for almost 7 YEARS longer than you should have. Perhaps the best solution in order to help save your marriage is to get your affairs in order BEFORE leaving. Your children deserve to grow up in a loving home environment, not witnessing this type of behavior from parents who themselves act disinterestedly toward one another. Use the remaining months of your now expired contract wisely. AT LEAST spend quality alone time with your kids, seeing the world and experiencing all the wonderful adventures this planet offers. A happy wife equals a contented husband, and vice versa. Good luck lady, you're gonna need it.... You highlight a common tendency among many immature adults today. Instead of moving on with life after divorce, many cling tightly onto past problems. They resist admitting wrongdoing, blame exes, neighbors, coworkers, relatives, friends, etc. hoping and finding the legal system takes part.
