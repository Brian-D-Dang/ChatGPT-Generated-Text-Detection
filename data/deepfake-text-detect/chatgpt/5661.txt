It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be very well cared for, and the money that they get from ticket sales and donations can be used for conservation projects. As I started to learn more about endangered species, I also became more and more aware of the impact that human activity is having on our planet - and that it's getting worse. I've also become much more aware of the fact that I am part of that human activity, and I have to do my part to help us all live in a more sustainable way. Because of these facts, I've decided to stop supporting zoos, especially those that don't do anything to help preserve endangered species, with my money. Since I'm a big fan of science fiction and fantasy literature, it doesn't make sense to me that there are so many venues that are filled with people who claim that they believe in science and rationality but then go on to talk about dragons and magic. But I've also realized that the desire to make up fantastical stories is one of the things that makes us human, and it's something that we need to retain in our society. At the same time, I think that there's a lot of learning that we can get from science fiction and fantasy, and there are certainly a lot of books in the genre that are worth reading (and I've written a lot of them). If I'm going to spend my free time reading, I want to spend it on books that help me learn about the world, not just entertain me. I also think that people who write science fiction and fantasy should have a social and political responsibility, and that some of them have this responsibility in a much bigger way than others. I've decided to spend less time reading science fiction and fantasy books and more time reading books by scientists and authors who write about social justice issues. I've already started this, but I think that I'll be even more focused on this from now on. In the past I've justified my consumption of animal products by saying that I have a moral duty to eat meat and dairy products because that's what my body needs. But recently I've been doing a lot of reading and thinking about the impact of animal agriculture on our planet, and I don't think that I can any longer justify my consumption of animal products because of my health. The way that I eat is a choice that I make, and I think that it's important to be mindful of the impact of my choices on the planet, and I think that I need to make my choices based on what I think is best for our planet, not just what's best for me. I've decided to stop eating animal products from now on. I hope that this post will help me keep my commitments to myself, and I'd like to hear from you all about your commitments, and whether or not they've helped you. AaronM May 6, 2017 at 9:56 AM Well written, and welcome to the vegan side! I'm the opposite - I started as a vegan, moved to vegan-ish, and now I eat meat. I'm not sure where I'll go in the future, but for now, I'm in the "I want to eat less meat" camp. That said, I don't know if I could ever support zoos as a result of my veganism, but I think you're onto something by acknowledging the role of zoos in conservation and awareness of animal species that are in danger of becoming extinct. I really appreciate your thoughtful post and I look forward to hearing your continued thoughts on the subject. Mike O'Malley May 6, 2017 at 10:56 AM I'm glad that you found my post helpful, and I'm also glad that you've had such an interesting experience with your dietary choices. It's always interesting when people have different experiences, because it helps us all to learn a little more about ourselves. I've read a lot about vegans over the last couple of years, and most of the people that I've read about have gotten to the point that they are now eating meat again, or have decided to stop eating certain kinds of meat. I'm not sure how I'm going to feel about eating meat over time, but I know that I'll never be a person who eats a lot of meat. I'm hoping that I'll
