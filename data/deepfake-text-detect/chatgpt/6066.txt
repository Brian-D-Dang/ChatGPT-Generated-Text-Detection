I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. I think the US won a war against Germany and Japan, but lost the Cold War, and ultimately won it's own civil war. The failure to declare war on the USSR before the outbreak of hostilities was a mistake. The US and UK were in a position to do so, but chose not to. The US's failure to declare war on the USSR in the aftermath of the war, and subsequently the Cold War, in effect meant that the USSR won the second World War. We have yet to see the results of the victory in the cold war. I suspect that it will be very different than what we're used to, and that the results of the Cold War will be more far reaching than the result of the 1939-45 war.
