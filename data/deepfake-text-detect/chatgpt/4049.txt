The Earth is constantly changing and moving in predictable patterns and cycles. The water cycle and nutrient cycles (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, etc.) are Earth's metabolism. The Homo sapiens component of the food chain can be used to identify characteristics that will allow us to predict future conditions for plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, protists, etc., based on past experiences or observations of their environment.
