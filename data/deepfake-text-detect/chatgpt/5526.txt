Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the handicapped spots are empty. I do not see any reason to change the law that allows people to use the handicapped spot. I do however see a need for an education program. If someone is getting out of a car and using a cane or walker or is in a wheelchair they shouldn't have to walk to the back of the line. They should be allowed to park closer to the front. If you are driving a vehicle and cannot walk to the front of the line you should not be allowed to park in a handicapped spot. I see the handicapped spot as a parking spot for people who need to get out of their vehicle to get to where they are going and I think that's why the law was made in the first place. There's a law that says you can't drive drunk, but people still do it. There's a law that says you can't go 65 mph in a 55 mph zone but people still do it. There's a law that says you can't go 30 mph in a 25 mph zone but people still do it. There's a law that says you can't go 70 mph on the interstate but people still do it. There's a law that says you can't have 3 people in a car with just one seat belt but people still do it. There's a law that says you can't have one headlight out but people still do it. The handicapped law is a law and laws are laws and the fact that people break them doesn't mean that we should change them. That's why there are speed limits. When I was a kid I could go 50 mph and my dad's car could go 60 mph. I'm not sure about you but when I got older I didn't feel the need to go 100 mph. When you're driving a car it's called driving, not racing. What's the point of having a speed limit if people aren't going to adhere to it? The handicapped spot is a parking spot and if people are going to park in it illegally I don't see the need to change the law. If we're going to change the laws we should change them for the good of the law and not for the convenience of a handful of people who don't follow the laws in the first place. So what's your opinion on the subject? Is the law fair or should it be changed? If you need to park closer to the front of the store why can't you park in a spot that is closer to the front of the store? Comment by MyLittleBoo on January 14, 2010 at 10:54am I agree that the laws are not being enforced very well, however, I do think that this law should be changed. First of all, the law is not enforced very well. In my city, we have an abundance of handicapped spots and almost all of them are empty. If you have any sort of limp, walker, or cane, then you should be able to park in one of those spots. Even if you have a driver in your car, you should be able to park in one of those spots. In my city, it's very convenient for people with handicaps to park close to the front of the store because it's just a block away. People with handicaps do not deserve to have to walk to the back of the line to get a spot. Second, there are also people who are not disabled who park in those spots, for example, people who are simply sick, have a broken leg, etc. I have seen people park in those spots that were not disabled. Third, people do not seem to respect handicapped spots. When I was in the hospital, I was in a wheelchair for 2 months. People would park in handicapped spots and even when I would park in the spots, people would say, "She can't walk, so she doesn't need to park in that spot." In my city, there is a law that says that if there is a handicapped sign and there is a handicapped space, then the space is reserved for handicapped people only. People are not supposed to park there, but they do. Fourth,
