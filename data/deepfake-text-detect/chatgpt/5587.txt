Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run? I could just vote myself a nice bonus for voting myself a nice bonus... I believe in letting everyone vote. I don't believe that a person should be allowed to vote if they aren't paying taxes. Let's say that a woman is pregnant. She doesn't want to keep the baby but is being coerced into it. The only solution she thinks of to fix this is abortion. She votes to make it illegal to be an abortion provider but doesn't believe it herself. I don't think she should be allowed to vote. I don't think she should be allowed to dictate laws that she won't abide by. I don't think she should be allowed to make laws that prevent other people from doing what she's doing. Another example: a person is a socialist. They know that all the countries who have implemented socialism have failed. They believe in the idea but they know it won't work. Yet they vote for socialism. Why should they? I don't think they should be allowed to vote. I think it's a conflict of interest. I have a similar issue with someone who's a hypocrite voting in a way that goes against what they themselves believe. What you're describing is a populist democracy. (As opposed to a representative democracy). In a representative democracy, each voter's vote matters the same. In a populist democracy, your vote counts more if you have more money. I would like to see a system that is more fair. I don't think that a person should get a say in how something that they don't pay for is run. I would like to see a system that is more fair than that. If someone wants a say in how society is run, I think they should pay for it. That way they have a personal stake in what they are voting for. They could vote themselves a nice bonus if they wanted to. I think that if they are capable of paying taxes, they should be responsible for paying taxes. In my country, at least, you have to pay taxes in order to vote. So that eliminates the problem that you mention. I don't think you should be able to vote if you're pregnant. I also think you shouldn't be allowed to vote if you're a criminal. I don't think you should be able to vote if you're pregnant. I don't think you should be allowed to vote if you're a criminal. I think that if you are pregnant, you should be allowed to vote. I think that if you are pregnant, you should be allowed to vote. If you are a criminal, I think you should be able to vote, but I don't think you should be able to vote for anything that involves the government. I think that if you are pregnant, you should be allowed to vote. If you are a criminal, I think you should be able to vote, but I don't think you should be able to vote for anything that involves the government. I don't think that people who are pregnant should be allowed to vote. They can't really vote on a law that they know they will never have to abide by. If someone is a criminal, I don't think they should be allowed to vote. If they are a criminal, they're probably not going to want to follow the law. They're probably just going to vote for something that will get them out of jail or will give them more money. I don't think that people who are pregnant should be allowed to vote.
