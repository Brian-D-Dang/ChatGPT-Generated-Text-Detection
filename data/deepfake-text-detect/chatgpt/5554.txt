As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this problem. In the United Kingdom, for example, the government began taxing sugary soft drinks in 2018, which was expected to raise 540 million British pounds per year. However, the tax was initially rejected by the British Parliament, but it was later passed by the British House of Commons and then signed into law by Queen Elizabeth II in April 2018. The tax on sugary drinks was enacted as a way to tackle the growing problem of obesity, which has also been seen in the United States and elsewhere. The British government has even gone as far as to have ad campaigns trying to convince people that they should cut down on sugar intake. Even before the tax was passed, the British government had begun taking measures to make soft drinks less affordable. For example, the government in 2018 launched a crackdown on sales of energy drinks to children because they believed that the drinks were unhealthy, even though many of them contained no sugar. The tax is just one of the many obesity-related measures taken by the British government. Another measure has been to bail out the National Health Service to the tune of 20.5 billion pounds by 2023 to help the NHS cope with an increasing number of obese people who need medical treatment. Another measure involves a push for unhealthy people to exercise more, which is part of a new campaign called "Active 4 Life." The tax itself is quite simple and only applies to soft drinks. It is a penny for every gram of sugar in the drink, which means that a two liter bottle of sugary drink would end up costing a consumer an extra 24 pence (about 30 US cents). The tax is expected to raise 520 million a year, which the government has said would be used for the NHS. While the tax is not a lot of money compared to some of the other ways governments try to raise money, it is still a significant amount of money for a small country like the UK. Economists who favor the tax say that it is a good way to discourage people from buying sugary drinks, while critics say that it is a regressive tax and will mainly affect lower income people. Others say that it is a violation of people's right to choose what they eat and to pay for it. One doctor, who has criticized the tax, said that it is misleading to tell people that sugar is bad for them, saying that studies have shown that there is no real scientific evidence that it is. There are also concerns that the tax will only encourage manufacturers to produce larger bottles and cans in order to avoid paying taxes. It will also create a black market whereby some manufacturers will produce the smaller sizes for sale on the black market. Some manufacturers have said that they will start producing "diet" versions of their drinks to avoid the tax. While the tax has yet to go into effect, it is expected to go into effect in 2018. The tax has already been enacted in Ireland and Mexico, which has resulted in a 9 percent and 10 percent decrease in consumption of sugary drinks, respectively.
