Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from recreational) and have always wanted kids of my own so that they could continue with sports growing older in life. My marriage ended abruptly due to me moving back into my parents house after 8 years away. I met someone who is now married and has 2 boys.. he does not play any sport! He got his masters degree while still working full time which makes it hard for him too find much free time often especially if wifey goes on vacation. We talk about our future plans together when i come home every night at different times per week I would like them both involved somehow. You're right though how important family time can be- I think we need to keep this in mind before making decisions or having children because what happens once you are no longer able to provide such things? But since everything was an accident why should we feel bad for taking advantage of opportunities available even when there might not be immediate gratificationI just don't want people judging us by their book Hi CMVs - thanks for stopping by here today. This post brought tears of joy reading all your responses. There were many common themes among these stories: friends made along the way; shared interestshobbies; a strong support structure; communication...and most importantly love. That being said, some readers thought it wasn't enough to give one child a chance to participate in something outside the household. In other words: "It's okay to say 'no' to kids sometimes" -CMV 1. And "The grass isn't greener on the other side." For those wondering whether it really matters that one kid doesn't take part in organized activities compared to two....well...it absolutely does matter. It means one kid may miss out on needed socialization skills early on and become more isolated later in life. These same comments also include thoughts around paying age appropriate fees -i.e., 2 instead of 10-20 a month!!! The logic behind this argument versus prioritizing sports participation over other extracurricular options seems mostly silly, given that almost everyone agrees spending less money better quality educational experience!! As far as "grass isn't greener," well, yes...but only because we choose to focus attention solely on ourselves alone. Parents must learn ways to balance their needs vs. the wants concerns of others including the cost of school days lost due to unavoidable circumstances beyond our control or simply choosing NOT TO SPEND THE MONEY. Thanks again for sharing your experiences and perspectives here ladies and good luck finding ways to create positive memories within this new normal!!
