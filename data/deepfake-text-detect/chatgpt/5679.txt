So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training (I've been to the annual training), but I know that the training isn't what I would call substantial. I know that these volunteers risk their lives to protect our homes and our properties, but they do it with what I consider to be a very low level of training. A lot of these volunteers are over 40 and can only do so much, and even for the younger volunteers, I worry that it is a bit much for them to have to do. I know that we can't expect fire departments to have the manpower that it takes to do a major fire operation, and I know that we can't expect to pay our firefighters enough to do what they do, but I still think that there has to be something done about the volunteers. I think we need to think of ways to incentivize them to get them to come out more, to volunteer for training, etc. I know that we can't force anyone to do anything, but I think that maybe it would be possible to give a reward to those who do their training, or to those who are willing to take the training. I think that we need to give our volunteers more than just the recognition that they're already given, and to make it more rewarding for them to come out, volunteer, and to put their lives on the line. I know that these ideas would only take us so far, but I think that they could be a good start. Re: Incentivize Volunteers I think there are some great ideas here! I completely agree with you. Many volunteer firefighters are good, but you can only train them so much in a certain period of time. So how do we get them to come out more and practice their skills? How can we make them more aware of how important their skills are and how important it is that they are trained? I think we need to train and keep our volunteer firefighters on their toes. Incentives are a great way to go! Great idea! I think all of those things should be done. It is a shame that those who are willing to put their lives on the line for our safety are given a little respect and that's it. Maybe if they are given a little more recognition and some incentives, it will inspire them to come out more, to volunteer for training, and to be willing to put their lives on the line. I know that some of the volunteers in my hometown don't even have radios, or radios that they can't use during an emergency. Maybe we need to give them better equipment. I think that we need to be able to offer them something to help them do their job better, and to help them make it worth their while to keep coming out to help us. I think that it would be a good idea to give volunteers rewards for doing training, and maybe even for showing up to training, and maybe even for just coming out to volunteer. I know that a lot of volunteers are over 40 and it seems like their time is limited. They can only do so much, and I think that it would be a good idea to try and give them a way to still help when their time is limited, and I think that incentivizing them would be a good way to do that. Matt, I completely agree that incentivizing volunteers would be a good way to go. I also agree with the idea of rewarding those who show up to training. I know that I would certainly be more likely to show up to training if I knew that I would be rewarded for it. It might be a good idea to make training more fun. Maybe we could offer firefighters the opportunity to learn and train in areas that are more fun and exciting than going through traditional drills. Maybe we could have a firefighter who really likes race cars volunteer to teach firefighters how to race a car. Maybe a firefighter who likes fishing could volunteer to teach firefighters how to fish. Maybe we could volunteer to teach firefighters how to shoot or hunt. These are all ideas that could be fun and exciting ways for firefighters to train. I think that by doing this, we could help volunteer firefighters to not only have fun, but also to learn. I think that this is a great way to not only get volunteers to come out more, but also to keep them out more. I think that if you are going to volunteer your time, you should want to be there and train.
