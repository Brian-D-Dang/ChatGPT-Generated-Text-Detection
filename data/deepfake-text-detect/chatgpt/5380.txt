This stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the Greek economic crisis, and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the Greek government. The article also addressed Greece's failure to embrace austerity measures aimed at reducing debt burden that needlessly exacerbate the deficit due to insufficient funds available for loans taken out during bailout requests. The Greek government made clear it was not willing or able to provide sufficient funding as the currency fell against the dollar since it needed more than 2 of GDP growth figures projected over two years ago despite spending billions to rebuild infrastructure projects which were cancelled after the euro zone collapsed last year because of the collapse of sovereign bonds. There has been no change to this administration's strategy with regards to Greece whereby the current direction is toward austerity measures which would essentially do nothing but increase the country's external debt burden further while ignoring underlying causes such as corruption risks. This is why Greece needs reforms if it wants any chance whatsoever of tackling its fiscal problem without being forced into bankruptcy.
