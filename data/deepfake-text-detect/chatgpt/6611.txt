While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept GMOs. The evidence is weak and just plain bad. I think there is very little evidence to support the claims. Also, if you are skeptical, there are some good things about GMOs. But, if you are not convinced that GMOs are safe, then you are not going to be buying GMOs at all.
