I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was surprised that there would be so much "debunked" information on the subject of investing in stocks by the time you turned 30. In retrospect, the reason is simple: Your money isn't going to grow until you invest in something. So if your goal is to get money into stocks or bonds, what should you make them out of? Here are some ideas for how to start: Start with small investments. Smaller than 10 per share won't be enough to buy stock for an entire year. But if investors want to invest more, they can use smaller shares of companies like Amazon.com Inc., which has about 3 market capitalization and 9x revenue growth this year. Smaller companies work better because they have fewer products and services. The idea here is to buy out the stock and sell when it sells low. If you want to go big, try buying things at next year's price, not before. You cannot afford to wait nearly 6 months for new shares while waiting for new leadership to take over.
