The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to understand for many people today (including me). If we put a draft up on POTUSes website that would allow us all as citizens an opportunity read what was being proposed before our representatives voted... I think you'd see public opinion change pretty quickly regarding some controversial issues like abortion or gay marriage.... Doing this might also help improve civics education at every level from kindergarten through college so maybe there wouldn't be such confusion about "who's really running things" when young Americans grow older?
