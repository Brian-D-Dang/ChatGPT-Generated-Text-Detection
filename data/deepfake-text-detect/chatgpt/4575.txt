I believe that we are at the point where we potentially could avoid bringing about catastrophic climate change, but to do that we would need to drop absolutely everything, to stop using coal and gas for electricity. We'd have to close down almost all of our fossil fuel-powered industry in Australia, and to date there is no plan nor any commitment by the Australian government to even consider such a thing." The Sydney Morning Herald reports that while Australia has seen some impressive reductions in emissions since 1990 - it's currently on track to meet its 2020 target with an economy at full employment, or 1 below potential growth full employment plus one. But just how much more can be done? To find out, the Climate Institute teamed up with the University of NSW's Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems Research to model what policies Australia needs to adopt if it wants to achieve net zero carbon power generation by 2050: If we keep growing as we are now, then we will emit 11bn tonnes of CO2 from 2014 to 2040, compared to 9bn tonne if we set ourselves ambitious targets for 2030 and beyond. If you don't want to cut your way to low emissions, by far the most effective option is investing in energy efficiency improvements; this approach is already delivering clean power at 0.1 per cent of GDP, which means roughly half of current spending goes towards improving system performance rather than new capacity. So doing nothing isn't going to work," says Andrew Jones, co-director of Climate Change Solutions and lead author of the report. "We've tried to come up with credible scenarios that outline both costs and benefits associated with different policy options so people know whether they might make sense on their own terms. It doesn't involve big changes like requiring everyone to use electric vehicles - yet - because these won't happen until well after existing technologies become sufficiently mature and affordable." In addition to improved public transport infrastructure, renewable energy and increased energy efficiencies, including state support for household retrofits, the cost of achieving a near future outcome where renewables provide 90 percent of national consumption (and nuclear 2) starts around 15 billion annually today. By comparison, pushing ahead with business-as-usual over the next decade means rising bills across the board - by between 4 and 7 dollars a week depending on your income level - equal to nearly 10 per cent of average weekly earnings. The biggest impact comes from reducing heat demand via insulation measures and through lessening reliance on expensive electricity generators when electricity prices spike due to high wind output during winter months.
