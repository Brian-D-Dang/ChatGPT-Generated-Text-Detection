I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do. Oh, it's definitely not a bad drink at all! It was just an example and if you liked the taste that means more power to ya:)
