A multitude of films have twists in the plot, for example Gone Girl, Memento, a lot of films of M. Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well it goes on and on you get my point I'm tired of people telling me that I didn't know what was coming when I watched these movies because I had got used to them all now as such and had not seen many before they were released so why would I think something new? Also I seem to remember watching a few other movies which turned out really wrong, but who remembers those anymore eh!? The only twist film that came close is The Sixth Sense where at first it seemed like the little boy Haley Joel Osment could see dead people (this kind of felt very cliched), then there are some scenes which turn round completely with him seeing dead bodies in his room etc... put together you can tell he wasn't just playing possum to be found by Bruce Willis or whatever lol!!! Ohhh how sad.
