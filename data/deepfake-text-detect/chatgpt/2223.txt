The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to interpret for younger generations who dont know their history as well as we do (ie: slavery). Not all Americans agree with our founding documents because they feel that many were written under unfair circumstances or unfairly towards certain people based on skin colorgender etc... What you say about some states not liking other parts isn't true either btw
