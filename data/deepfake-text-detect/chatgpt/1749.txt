By "practical reason," I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election. I admit , however, it can be hard for me to determine whether something like this is even possible in our current set-up (if we do have elections at all). In any case, your comment about the possibilities of doing away with political parties made me think about what might happen if people did start having two bottom lines: their primary interest being to advance their own well-being via some particular social policy; an average voter's primary concern being ensuring they are not harmed or robbed in pursuit of those policies i.e., making sure no one takes advantage of them. A second line would consist entirely of libertarians who hold a belief system which makes moral purpose irrelevant as far as pursuing one's self interests goes... but then there wouldn't really be much more than Libertarianism existing today anyway so perhaps the point was moot?
