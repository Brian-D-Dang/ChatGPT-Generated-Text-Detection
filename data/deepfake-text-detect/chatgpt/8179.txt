Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as possible. Interesting concept (and not totally new), but can it work? I'm thinking about this from an investment perspective: Can you take care for your family if one day they decide that "enough is enough" and leave home forever or retire early - after having put away 15-20 percent into their own pensions over decades?. It seems doubtful... But what do financial experts think on here? Is there any history backing up these kind ideas
