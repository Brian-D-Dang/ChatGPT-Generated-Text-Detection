I respectfully disagree with this opinion. Rappers are talented artists who possess the ability to write, compose and perform music. Their talent lies in their ability to create lyrics that resonate with people, and to deliver their message in a unique and captivating manner. Rappers are also skilled at understanding rhythm, flow and melody, which are all vital components of music. Moreover, many rappers are adept at using their music to convey messages and emotions in a powerful way that resonates with listeners. As such, it is unfair to dismiss the talent and hard work that goes into creating and performing rap music.
