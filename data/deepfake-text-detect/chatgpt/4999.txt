Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from junior high school) and have always wanted school aged kids involved in the team too so hopefully this will be fun! Thanks for taking time out of your day:) I love soccer mainly because it shows me how much you care about what happens on field, reminds you that some people may think they're better than others;) FC Cincinnati is interesting based off of historical context though....it's a really solid league with lots of good players
