I have had friendships with various males, and only one of them has not tried to at one point in time, make it sexual. This was not a big deal for me because I always sort of knew that he did this just as much or more than the other guys whom we hung out with... According to reddit you're supposed to feel like shit about yourself after being sexually harassed by someone who wasn't your SO too!
