So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to have a lot more than just sexual intercourse, and there might be other ways where we could obtain some sort or physical contact between human beings without necessarily having sex at all (and even if they had something else in mind). In this case "consent" doesn't really matter since imho animals don't give their informed opinions on affair like what you do with them etc., but simply reactions based solely by instinct - also known as consciousness; for example: fearing pain when killed losing reproductive ability after prolonged mating period due weakening body condition caused ehm... satisfied desire.... ermm.. psychology?;, so why not take advantage from animal's natural instincts instead giving up voluntarily being partakers!:-O
