To my knowledge there are no peer reviewed sources that link GMOs to any negative health effects. There is as much reason to believe genes manipulated in a lab are safe for consumption as genes that have been developed through traditional breeding methods. GMOs are strictly regulated and tested by various governmental agencies, including the FDA, before being approved for consumption. However, it is important to note that some concerns have been raised about the environmental impacts of GMOs, including issues such as cross-pollination of GMO crops with non-GMO crops, the creation of superweeds, and the potential impacts on beneficial insects and other wildlife. Scientific studies continue to investigate these concerns and evaluate the safety of GMOs for human consumption and the environment. It is also important to note that, although there are no peer-reviewed studies demonstrating a direct link between GMOs and negative health effects, there are still debates and concerns among experts about the potential long-term effects of consuming GMOs, as well as doubts about their ability to increase crop yields and reduce the use of pesticides in the long term. Therefore, more research is needed to fully understand the overall benefits and risks of GMOs.
