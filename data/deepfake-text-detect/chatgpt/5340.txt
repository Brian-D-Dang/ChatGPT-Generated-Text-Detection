I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any decent possibility of a fantasy world where everyone lives in harmony with the rest of mankind and doesn't have wars or chaos then let them live there. What about all those other fantasies? What if everybody was free but for a few rich people who could only dream themselves out of life? Would there still be people living together as one big family without conflict between families? Would everyone live happily ever after? There are plenty of people like that already around here (or anywhere else). I imagine a utopian society wouldn't simply create anarchy. People who don't understand what's happening aren't helping the environment either because they fear extinction
