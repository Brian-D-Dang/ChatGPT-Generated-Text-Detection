First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a lot of the responses here stem from a general disditit suprdit. Even if I don't feel that many here are trolling, I can't help but feel that it's too many threads of the same.
