I spend my summer as a representative of the college I attend and interact regularly with kids between the ages of 10 and 18. In these interactions, I have noticed a disturbing trend. I see a society in which the idea of "being cool" is more important to the majority of these kids than being a good person. For example, I have seen kids who are clearly not "cool" be called out by the other kids, and in turn respond by getting angry and then getting violent. Why are these kids, who have every reason to know better, so willing to throw away all of their time, energy and intelligence just to be liked by the group? In the past, I have chalked this phenomenon up to the fact that these kids have no experience with peer pressure, as they were raised in stable homes. But now, I have a different idea. It's a little bit of a stretch, but I think that "being cool" is actually a form of social Darwinism. As I mentioned before, "being cool" is the idea of being liked by the group. The group, in the mind of the individual, becomes the evolutionary force that determines survival, and in this situation it is the group that determines how they determine "cool." The idea is that the group is the biological force of nature that will determine which members of society survive, and in order to survive the individual must be liked by the group. In this case, being cool is a form of social Darwinism, as it is the group, rather than the individual, that is determining survival. This concept has been around for a long time. For example, we see this concept in the early idea of class, as the class system was established in order to maintain order and determine which class was more important than the other, the rich more important than the poor, and the nobles more important than the commoners. However, this was a system in which the idea of evolution was more of a physical, rather than social, Darwinism. The system was based on who was the most fit for battle and survival, rather than who was the most popular. But I would argue that today, being "cool" is a form of social Darwinism. So the question is: Is being cool a form of social Darwinism? What do you think? Please let me know in the comments below.
