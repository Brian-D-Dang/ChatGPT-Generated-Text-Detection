When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Tatooine, they encounter Watto, a junk dealer who owns two slaves, Anakin Skywalker and his mother Shmi. When Qui-Gon learns he cannot buy them outright, he instead decides to gamble for their freedom in a podrace. Anakin agrees to pilot Qui-Gon's podracer, and despite the odds stacked against him, he wins the race and secures his and his mother's freedom. Later, Qui-Gon believes Anakin to be the Chosen One, a Jedi prophecy that foretells of a being who will bring balance to the Force. Despite the Jedi Council's reservations, Qui-Gon insists on training Anakin as a Jedi. However, Anakin struggles with his emotions and attachments, ultimately leading to his fall to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader.
