Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of people who had done nothing wrong, and they killed a lot more than the Japanese did in their attack at Pearl Harbor. 2. The best way for us as an empire not to repeat history is by spreading democracy around the world rather than trying to control it through military force. 3. It's fiction written decades ago; there are no better books about World War II or Korea that haven't played out already. What do you think? Is Mr. Anderson right does WWII need a new book by someone else because his doesn't tell its story well enough?
