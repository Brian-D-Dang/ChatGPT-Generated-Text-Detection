Alright, so, I was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while I am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, at the moment its (relatively) complete. This is an idea that's been bouncing around in my head since before we began doing Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen, when one player asked me if there were any games where you could build your own race from scratch. It fascinated us as players; what would be more fun than creating our character? The problem though - no game has ever allowed such freedom of customization with races outside cosmetic options like hair color and skins! We knew right away that RvR player characters needed to have something unique about them beyond their armor. And thus, the Dreamer class came into being, born out of sheer frustration over not having enough choice within the current system! With some inspiration taken from classic MMORPGs like Everquest 23 as well as modern MMOs, we hope to bring back both strong community identity through character creation AND diversity between classes on PvP servers. This also allows us to create incredibly interesting racial styles without requiring each style to take up another skill slot OR different professional specs, which means less waiting time for new pros and greater variety during combat!:) So please leave feedback below regarding everything! Your input will help shape how these features are implemented going forward.:D Thanks everyone!!
