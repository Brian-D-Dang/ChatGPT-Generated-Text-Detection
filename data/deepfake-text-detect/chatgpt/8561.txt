Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. Others are just really good on their own terms and are highly skilled at being creative. There's also the difference between having a "speed" (the ability to chime in) versus having one of those stats to put you into an emotional state so long as it doesn't cause shit. I mean... that's pretty slow for some artists to be able to tell the difference between emotions.
