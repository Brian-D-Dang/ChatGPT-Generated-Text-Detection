Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and make poor decisions frequently. Person B was brought to the US as a child and is undocumented. They have lived here most of their life and consider themselves American. Person C is a legal immigrant who came here as an adult and is now a naturalized citizen. They are successful and contribute positively to their community. What can you tell me about the legal status of each person and their contribution to society?
