In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they 're already married under the guise of marriage could be seen as an act of domestic violence against them both because you believe it would break up their marriage and ruin their relationship if they haven't had sex with each other yet! What happens when the other guy or girl doesn't? Would having sex make it okay for them but not for you? Would your marriage break down easily enough such that you wouldn't even consider them married again after two years without being together? We can see what happens here too is people really thinking formalizing marriage isn't something appropriate in the 21st century by only allowing them to say "marriage" instead of "love." Actually marriage doesn't exist anymore so this argument has no place on any social scene where marriage isn't possible. I don't think anyone acknowledges marriage until someone tells us how ridiculous all these scenarios are (because marriage is still somehow defined). Marriage has become what it was meant to be - just like dating was intended to be - men tie themselves to women who want to marry them; and men aren't trying hard enough to give wives practical education about their rights before marrying women who are looking for love from them or overcoming pettiness toward them so they'll hit upon a way out regardless. Marriage hasn't existed since the 1800s nor is it relevant today unless there were actual marriages between men or couples prior to that era.
