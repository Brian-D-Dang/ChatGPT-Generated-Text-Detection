I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is such thing, then I don't want that person to live my life in the afterlife and become like me, because I'd rather they be an angel than someone with some weird power. Maybe I am making too much sense, though... This is actually very good reasoning
