I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. We at least have some hope for peace now. The US is failing at something. It will do everything it can to fix the situation, but I think everyone who sees this is wrong. If you look at it from another angle, that's two disagreeable things. There always has been too much hate towards the USA - even though the reason why we're here was put into perspective: because it doesn't like our values, which are certainly against them - they've never liked us. The last thing they want is to blow up their country with nuclear weapons.
