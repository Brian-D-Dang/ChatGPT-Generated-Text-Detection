First of, this is only talking about people who are vegetariansvegans for ethical reasons. If you are a vegetarian for any other reason, this does not apply Being a vegetarian can be very healthy and nutritious for your health, so if you happen to have a medical condition that allows it, then by all means do what's best for you. I'm personally 100 against eating meat (mainly because I don't like the taste) but there is nothing wrong with being a vegan or even a semi-vegetarian. There are two types of vegans: 1) Vegetarians 2) People who actually go without consuming anything from an animal. The first group are usually pretty easy to spot since they often tend to follow their diet religiously. They're more likely to wear clothes made out of organic cotton or avoid products containing animals in them as well. Personally I think these people should get a choice on whether or not we eat "meat" as much as the second type of vegans which would include myself. That said the principles behind both groups make sense, however they also hold some significant differences too. Let me explain; 1.) Why Is Veganism A Good Thing? As a whole humans need protein in order to stay alive. Our bodies produce certain hormones called growth factors in our body when we grow, such as insulin which helps control blood sugar levels. Without proper intake of good nutrition, including enough protein and perhaps most importantly iron, the human body will enter a state known as hypovitaminosis where it isn't able to increase its production at a natural rate. This includes fatigue, poor concentration, infertility, heart disease, depression, cancer, etc... Since protein is needed to heal wounds and repair tissue the consequences of having low amounts could ruin lives. Protein is necessary to help keep bones strong and our muscles together so we can walk around unharmed! To put into perspective how important adequate nutrients are consider that 90 of pregnant women die due to lack of iron during pregnancy. It makes perfect sense why giving birth to a baby requires sufficient nutrition for both mother and child to remain healthy and functioning properly. Not to mention that according to one study half of children under five years old globally suffer from stunted physical development and the number is expected to double within 10 years. So imagine growing up without learning to read and write, forget doing basic math and science among many other skills...It really isn't worth it. Now since kids need protein to develop properly it doesn't seem fair that we adults aren't required to eat tons of protein every day just to maintain good health. Consider if everyone was forced to consume meat everyday as part of their daily routine we'd never reach a point were anyone has ever been completely iron deficient naturally. The same argument applies here. So therefore no matter how small a percentage of us choose to abstain from consuming foods that contain proteins gained from living beings, it still becomes essential to try manage our dietary needs. For those who advocate going vegan, you help prevent unnecessary suffering in future generations. We must remember what went before us and learn from mistakes in the past regarding food choices. As far as I know nobody cares anymore about getting sick from contaminated water or soil because in developed countries we've learned how to detect contamination on top priority and take action accordingly. However food safety seems to fall off the radar now days especially considering the large amount of cattle poultry consumed per person each year. Some estimates suggest that millions upon millions of billions of birds are killed each year simply to provide us with protein. Considering the high mortality rates experienced throughout industries involving mass killing of farm animals lining the supply chain to end users, you may find yourself questioning why consumers shouldn't practice the same measures as industry leaders. So while most probably agree that livestock farming causes a lot of harm to environment, wildlife and livestock workers alike, the question remains as always - What is morally right?." And as long as we continue to feed ourselves animal based diets we won't stop harming others. Therefore the best approach is the middle ground between keeping profits flowing through industrial agriculture and destroying habitats worldwide. Stop buying factory farms and start looking after the world your family represents. You care about animals, plants, insects etc.. But wouldn't it be nice if you cared about something else besides money?... Oh wait, yes! Money!! 2.) How Can Vegans Be Just Like Everyone Else? The truth is you don't have to become a full time strict veganlifestyle vegan to feel better than before. Even going vegetarian might be beneficial to your overall wellbeing depending on your lifestyle. Many people associate the term "Vegan" with extreme attitudes towards life, going sans consumption of ANY animal product whatsoever. While that's true it is certainly possible, the majority of vegetarians and even non-vegetarians believe strongly enough in ethics and moral values to adhere to minimal limitations. Also there are various different kinds of vegetarianism ranging within degrees ranging anywhere form 0-100. All of whom share common objectives and principles and purposes. Those goals are designed specifically for the purposeful desires to satisfy hispanics. Gradually incid, all military specific to the last value
