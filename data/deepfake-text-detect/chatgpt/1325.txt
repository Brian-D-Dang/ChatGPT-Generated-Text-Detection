I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer need to carry that kind of firepower? It is not necessary for us as civilians who think we are being watched all day every day by government agents with guns to be armed ourselves because you can protect yourself from an attack without carrying big weapons like AR-15's etc....but it only takes one bad apple (or terrorist) to do harm so maybe there needs to be more accountability for cops...even if they just stop wearing their uniforms when off duty..
