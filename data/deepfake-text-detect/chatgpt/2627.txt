People talk about'natural' or'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like "free speech" or "free association" are'inalienable','natural', or'God-given', how come so many people don't have them? If we're talking about civil liberties, the answer is that there's no Constitutional right to free speech (or assembly) at the federal level in the United States; rather, only state and local governments may limit those freedoms. There has been some discussion of creating a general national Constitutionally protected freedom of expression, with rights for both literal and figurative speaking, as well as the ability to assemble without interference, etc., but such laws would still need to originate at the statelocal levels. The First Amendment does protect certain specific forms of expression notably religion, press, petitioning Congress, political advocacy, and protest - while preventing government censorship of any other form of expression; however, it doesn't give anyone any "inalienable" right to express themselves in ways not specifically outlined by the amendment: if the Supreme Court determines that an otherwise constitutional act violates one of these listed expressions, then American law will provide recourse against its enactment.
