First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from some form of privilege. I hope I'm not speaking out of turn here, and I'm not meaning to offend anyone. I just see a lot of comments like "I didn't get a job I wanted, I'm sad," and the responses to those comments are "well, I got a job I wanted, so I feel bad for you," "well, at least you have a job" etc. What I mean is, I think many of the posts are comments made by people who may not necessarily be suffering, but are feeling bad about themselves and want to make themselves feel better by getting other people to feel bad too. I say this not because I think people shouldn't feel the pain of not getting a job they wanted, but because it really feels like a lot of these posts stem from privilege. I would like to hear people's thoughts on this and whether I'm speaking out of turn. Here's an example, for instance: I think there are also people posting here who are only looking for sympathy, and are looking for responses like "I know what you mean! I got rejected too!" etc. I think a lot of people here are just sad and want to feel better, and I think that's fine, but I don't think it's necessary to make other people feel bad about themselves in order to feel better. I apologize if this comes across as harsh or if I'm being presumptuous. I just think I may be onto something here. feeling-sad Can you give an example of a post you're thinking about? That would help people to understand what you're seeing, and also help to alleviate the feeling that you're singling people out. - user17676 Oct 31 '16 at 10:05 I'm not sure if I agree with the premise, but I'll try to address the question in a manner that is applicable to the OP. First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. If you really want to feel better, you can search for "rfeeling" or "rdepression." You'll see a lot of posts talking about feeling sad, lonely, depressed, etc. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from some form of privilege. That's a very subjective claim. You've expressed that you feel like many of the posts here are from people who are not suffering but want to make themselves feel better. I think many of the posts are comments made by people who may not necessarily be suffering, but are feeling bad about themselves and want to make themselves feel better by getting other people to feel bad too. There's a "but" in the second sentence. The first sentence is your opinion, and the second sentence is a conclusion. I'm not saying this to attack you, but I think it's a very important thing to consider when trying to make claims like this. I'm not saying that's what you're trying to do, but the OP's comment seems to say that that's what they're trying to do. I would like to hear people's thoughts on this and whether I'm speaking out of turn. Yes, you are speaking out of turn, and perhaps you're even speaking out of context. You've expressed that you think many of the posts here are from people who are not suffering but want to make themselves feel better, and then you asked people to comment on whether you're speaking out of turn. I say this not because I think people shouldn't feel the pain of not getting a job they wanted, but because it really feels like a lot of these posts stem from privilege. That's a very subjective claim. That's not to say you're wrong, but there are many things you may perceive that aren't in reality. It's very hard to prove that something is subjective, so I can't really comment on it. I'd suggest you try to avoid claiming things that are subjective because it can really hurt your credibility and cause you to be dismissed. I think a lot of people here are just sad and want to feel better, and I think that's fine, but I don't think it's necessary to make other people feel bad about themselves in order to feel better. Yes, that's true, but it's not a claim about people who are suffering. I
