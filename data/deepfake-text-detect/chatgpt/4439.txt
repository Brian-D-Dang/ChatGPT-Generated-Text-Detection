Reddit is a website, a business, it is the "front page of the internet." This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these features would be good enough for Reddit and stop people from being banned due to their beliefs It's not like you're trying to make a judgement on anything here, just stating what actually happened. If you'd like an opinion on that topic then judge my post accordingly. But if you don't want to and are looking for someone who will agree with you against me then we are probably not going in this direction anyway so why bother? But let's say that eventually they do remove those things etc., but the same thing happens again as pretty much every time new rules come out: Someone gets flagged by some mod and ends up getting banned (or at least put into priviledge mode). As somewhere around 10 years worth of content has accumulated there, they'll inevitably end up losing something important along the way, which means it becomes more difficult to find said information without having access to all of them. Now the mods are under pressure to figure out quickly whether something was offensive or not before banning itputting it in priviledge mode because users will likely complain about whatever got deleted. And even though it only takes one person to flag something etc., it still might take days until the results show up online. Not to mention that once upon a time "deletemember" existed where anyone could delete members from the site entirely through a function, also making this problem harder. Things can get messy fast when you start taking on those problems individually! So yeah...I doubt any changes to the current system alone are going to solve this issue in the long run. At best we have moved away from mass censorship towards targeted censorship. Which isn't necessarily bad since you obviously aren't happy with certain elements of Reddit already - but if you want a solution that really works I'm afraid I won't know how well such a system would work unless you first explain exactly why you feel a banhammer should exist. In fact, personally I wouldn't mind seeing some real penalties applied to users over certain offenses rather than simply putting posts and comments behind walls and telling everyone else that you'll deal with your own mess later...but maybe that's too extreme for you, it's cool man
