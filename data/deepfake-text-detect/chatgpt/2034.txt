Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians, killing upwards of 200,000 innocent people who had done nothing wrong but live there (the total is debated my own opinion puts the number much lower). 2. There's no real point for us as Americans even trying to argue that we're morally superior if our actions and attitudes are still very similar to those Japan faced during WW II. We don't need another world war; it hasn't been good for anyone involved except some extremely wealthy individuals at all levels of society. If you want peace then strive toward ensuring your country never gets into such situations again. 3. It should also go without saying that Russia was not right either when they invaded Afghanistan or Georgia by way of military force over misconstrued "threats." However, just because other nations do something does not make what you did any more acceptable than their action simply due to sizestrength disparity between countries participating in conflict. Both sides usually have implications from which both benefit greatly while others suffer drastically regardless of whose side one chooses to support based purely off moral constraints. This isn't necessarily meant to justify the Russian invasion of Ukraine, though...it may only serve as evidence against certain arguments used by American politicians attempting to rationalize bombing Syria. Just look up how many times Iraq has attacked Saudi Arabia since Saddam Hussein took power nearly 30 years ago to see why invading foreign lands with little provocation ultimately leads down an ugly path eventually filled with too-high casualties among innocents caught in the middle.[1] [0]: [1]:
