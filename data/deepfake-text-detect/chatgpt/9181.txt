This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in there is another life out there that has been discarded, if it has then the extra life form is so far away that if you can't find it elsewhere in the universe elsewhere in the universe. If so, then the common view is that life elsewhere in the Universe is unlikely to exist, then if there aren't aliens life somewhere else in the universe, and if life can't be found on Earth, why would you be here, if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere, it must be very rare that life can exist elsewhere in other space elsewhere.
