Partial Delta for uDHCKris. I'll give you a partial because I do think that New Friends works as a combination option, but I think my CMV is more focused on the book's main character than it should be at this point in time and has thus caused some issues with her own development (as well). Katie Jaxx - Aka Cat Patel from The Edge of Never by Karen Robards Susan CrabtreeNate Eisley - Another one who's not really getting any attention right now...or ever?I have to admit though Nate was probably always goingto end up being short-changed or overlooked due his breakout role last year playing Quinn Walsh - and then winning an Emmy along With Adria Arjonathe show during season two!Jake McKinnonJacob HopkinsThe same can likely also apply here: Jake had been partaking somewhat regularly since he first debuted back In May 2015but like Katie before him Jacobs Mckinnon just never seemed able get much traction after all those early "days" set were done...while Jacob did make NXT "his" home base throughout 20162017 (even becoming US Champion) He still didn't seem quite ready ot cope when given opportunities ti prove himself outside WWE so far.... Plus we know most people are waiting until they've either retired completely, defected awayfrom wrestling altogether OR become big names elsewhere..which sadly none o fthese three things appear probable anytime soon yet:0So why even mention them? Well cause i'm trying rationally explain WHY other fans aren't giving these guys their deserved credit currently.And if nothing else..at least there might hopefullybe hope remaining within each respective characters futuresince unlike TNA which ultimately ended Upbeing destroyed instead its status once knownfor providing chances fo young wrestlers enteringwith real potential remains intact ...Just unknown how many will actually surviveLong story Short Powers That Be may very nicely use both men againsoon enough becausetheir talents certainly havenot fully gone unnoticed.....yetThanks For Reading
