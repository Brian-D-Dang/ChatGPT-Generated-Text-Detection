I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually the ones that come from wealthier families, while those who go to public schools are usually from lower-income households. This creates an unfair advantage for the children at private schools since they have access to better resources and more opportunities than their public school peers. Private schools also tend to be more expensive and can put a financial strain on families who want to give their children the best education possible.
