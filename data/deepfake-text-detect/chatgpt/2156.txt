I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing from paying extra for small differences in quality.... i find this strange, when i was looking at some razors the difference between them were about 1-2 dollars more and there wasn't much information on which one would be better or worse...
