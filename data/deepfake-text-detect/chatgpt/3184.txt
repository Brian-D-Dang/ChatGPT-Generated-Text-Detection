I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying saying different things during the debate, so without more context, I'm not sure what specifically you're referring to. Could you please provide me with more information or clarify your question?
