I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to synthesize them. The thing is: If you try to make element[ununpentium], what would be left after its creation? Would there even be anything at all? Or does mass simply disappear when an element decays into lighter ones (as some of my chem books say)? My guess based off this question seems to think so... Which is why I thought of asking here for confirmation! Thanks again guys! A: As far as synthesis goes, yes they are really hard to obtain synthetically. You can't just stick any old metal with nuclei and hope it'll spontaneously decay into something else. In order to get ununpentium you have to use neutrons; since neutron capture depends on cross sectional area, which increases exponentially with atomic number this means something like 20 of the uranium atoms will never form U-238 until quite late in fission. The ability of nuclear reactions to produce new nuclides decreases rapidly as the masses separating two parent isotopes increase - alpha particles are easy because their binding energy scales linearly with mass - only about 5 of bismuth has transmuted from lead by radioactive decay, much less tellurium etc. It isn't actually impossible to create a halogen by fusing together 4 protons 2 electrons though: ce6}He4 3H - 44} extnormal{Fr ( 1 branching ratio). But if we want free neutrons which had better not be contaminated with gamma rays then we need reactors working with heavy water, at least 10 percent enriched. This is also very difficult because helium boils rather than evaporating at room temperature, so you'd end up with lots more hydrogen instead of helium gas.
