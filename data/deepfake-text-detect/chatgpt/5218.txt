Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and almost all men are rapists...but guys like this guy make me sick to my stomach..I don't care who you love as long as there's no sexual harassment or retaliation from women. Damn dude, he raped your girlfriend?
