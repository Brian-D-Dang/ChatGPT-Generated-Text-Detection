I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was surprised to see how much of the movie is based on factually incorrect statements made by Turing that are not only untrue - they're also rather unimportant in terms of whether or not he cracked the code! One example: In one scene where Turing is "visiting" his friend Joan Clarke at her home, she asks him what kind of weather he'd like for Christmas day. He says he wants an English winter with snow... which isn't true, because while there had been some snow on December 25th 1936 when Turing died in January, there hasn't been any measurable amounts of snow since then (with the exception of very small amounts during the 20102011 Winter Olympics)... so by the time he came back from WWII, there wouldn't even be ANY snow left! Nowhere near enough to make a significant difference if you wanted a white christmas! So why did he say that? That's pretty easy- because the character asked. And basically all films have characters asking things like this... unless the story specifically explains otherwise, we assume everything said was TRUE. But that doesn't mean that they were actually true! It would've taken way more effort to go through old records and figure out exactly WHAT happened than simply making something up that sounded plausible. But here's another thing. Here's another quote from the Wikipedia page about Alan Turing regarding the war in the Pacific:"The United States military decided to use a [bombing] strategy against Japanese cities called "fire bombing," using incendiary bombs such as napalm to burn down the wooden buildings housing the population." This has already been disproven... those attacks DID NOT happen. They never HAVEN'T happened either; fire bombings weren't used again and never would be. In actuality if anything, incendiary attacks were TEMPORARILY EXCLUDED from US military operations because of Japan's WEAKNESS TO FIRE... but now let me get to my point. Using that same line in The Imitation Game gave me pause initially because I knew most of these facts already, and yet I still went "wait a minute, THAT CANNOT BE RIGHT!" Because all too often other people will cite sources and tell me their source cites specific examples of whatever used to justify saying whatever it is they want to say... sometimes citing books, sometimes referencing websites, etc.. but when I look them up myself, THEY ARE WRONG!!! What bothers me about misinformation being passed along is that many times, especially online, information is spread without anyone having to counterbalance the argument being presented. Rather than believing content solely on its basis alone, try looking into these claims for yourself before accepting someone else's word entirely. A simple Google search can reveal both sides of the story in regards to almost every claim, showing what really happens versus what is merely falsely believed has happened. If you don't know where to start, check the sites below for a good starting point to look into various subjects. Also remember that no matter who makes a statement, evidence supporting THEIR side needs to be offered with equal fervor.
