Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I don't know enough about The party is for you? Are your parents ok with this happening in their house neighborhood? If not, maybe someone else should have the party and invite them over some other time, if they can't make it on your birthday because of work or whatever reason.. Have fun planning!:)
