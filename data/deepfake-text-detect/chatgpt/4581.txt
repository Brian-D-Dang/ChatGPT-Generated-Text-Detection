I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need to smoke? I don't know about people who chew, but it seems like every other second of their day is spent trying not to spit out a wad in someone else's car or on the sidewalk. Smoking does not cause cancer - lung cancer caused by smoking is actually less common than many types of cancers combined. Some cancers do increase with smoking...but many decrease as well. Lung cancer rates are dropping worldwide right now (by 30 per year) due partly to new clean air regulations, including bans on cigarette advertising under nearly all circumstances, which has reduced total cigarette consumption. That doesn't mean there isn't still lots of lung disease among smokers though - some illnesses occur almost exclusively from long term exposure to high levels of nicotine or tar over years, such as emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, while others arise more acutely when an individual stops smoking for any reason and can develop during the first month after quitting. But overall, if non-smokers were exposed only to low levels of environmental toxins equivalent to those found near smokers today, we would likely live longer lives than we currently do. It's been said many times before, but even if you assume "cigarettes cause lung cancer," the net result is zero deaths except due to accidents involving fire breathing or machine ingestions; so this is a completely irrelevant argument against requiring child labor laws to include a ban on using power tools without adult supervision. Once again: CIGARETTES CAUSE LUNG CANCER! It's true!!1!!! Though most of us die of heart attacks rather than lung cancer, a few cases of lung cancer could be prevented through regulating the use of cigarscigarschips etc., since these products contain chemicals that can damage lungs, similar to leaded gasoline used decades ago or higher-than-normal amounts of alcohol consumed at parties. The main problem with banning cigarettes altogether is that nicotine, although addictive, is also very important biologically. Nicotine boosts the activity of certain brain cells and helps them communicate better with each other, helping regulate mood, fight infections, keep our appetites in check and protect us against stressors that might otherwise make us anxious or upset. Without sufficient nicotine, we lose access to these abilities ourselves, and thus become depressed, stressed, fatigued, hungering and unable to face life challenges effectively. Smart decision makers will consider both risks and rewards when developing policy. Cigarette taxes may reduce smoking prevalence somewhat, but what difference does 100 cents really make when your body is producing cravings anyway? Banning anything entirely will probably have little effect on reducing health problems but will likely make things worse overall. If you want to get serious about this issue, read Tobacco Control, published by the CDC and available online free of charge. This book contains dozens of pages dedicated specifically to evidence-based approaches to addressing addiction issues related to tobacco product usage. For example, take a look at Chapter 6, 'Health Effects Related to Cigarette Smoking' by John P K Dowdell et al.: You can find short summaries on pretty much everything included here too, just search under Keywords: Health Effect Prevention Measurement Objective Results Conclusion Unmet Need. Most importantly, remember that whatever regulation is passed must apply equally to all citizens, regardless of party affiliation or personal beliefs. A government set up to legislate based upon racism, religion, or any other basis besides science cannot be trusted to implement sound public policies regarding either human rights or public health. Instead, try starting off with education and persuasion: teach children how harmful tobacco can be, ensure that adults speak openly about negative consequences surrounding tobacco and socialize kids away from cigarette ads whenever possible. (Sadly, the latter goal won't help unless parents start being responsible themselves.) As always, please post comments below and thank you for reading my blog.

I was thinking of this scenario where I'm standing next to my nephew's friend at his birthday party playing Monopoly. What do I say to him when he asks me why I went into debt buying property cards instead of paying rent? Let me explain, years later I am teaching economics at college level. So, the student asked me this question in class yesterday, and I realized that it gives a good opportunity to discuss entrepreneurship and risk taking. First, let me pose another hypothetical situation ... suppose that you own property in your city and you also own property elsewhere. Suppose further that you see a business transaction going back stage dating phenomenon occurs outright. This means groundless behaviorally harmless time play rest with the last moments 2nd and 3rd,
