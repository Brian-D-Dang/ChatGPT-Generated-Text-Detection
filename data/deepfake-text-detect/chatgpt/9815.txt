Yesterday, there was this post in rfuturology titled [Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data] . In the comments, a lot of people argued that technology has actually destroyed more jobs than it has created. They argued that while it has created new jobs, they are usually lower-paying and not as secure as the jobs that have been destroyed. They also noted that automation has caused a lot of labor displacement and that this could lead to further job losses in the future.
