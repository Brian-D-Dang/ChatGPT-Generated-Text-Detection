Counter-argument: The government spying on its citizens violates their right to privacy and undermines the fundamental principles of a democratic society. Such actions can lead to abuse of power and the suppression of dissenting voices, effectively turning the state into a surveillance state with little regard for individual rights and freedoms. It also sets a dangerous precedent that could be misused by future regimes. Additionally, history has shown that mass surveillance doesn't necessarily make us safer from threats, but instead creates a false sense of security that can lead to complacency and a lack of action on other fronts. Therefore, trusting citizens and respecting their right to privacy is a more effective way to foster a healthy, vibrant society.
