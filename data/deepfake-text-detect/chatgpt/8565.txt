I don't personally feel that the arguments against meat eating (morality, sustainability) have enough depth andor meaning that directly affects me or others around me to make me feel as though I am ignored. If you're not talking about whether it's worth eating meat for some reason is irrelevant. It doesn't matter if you're vegan or not. I always tell people this, but sometimes it does put me in a different mindset than what they usually think about veganism.
