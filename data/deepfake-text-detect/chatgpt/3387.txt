Before you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting down opinions before they are fully expressed. As an AI language model, I am not capable of voting or having personal opinions, but I can try to help you better understand the perspective of another person and provide facts or evidence to support different points of view. Can you please let me know what topic you would like to discuss?
