In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn't work that way anymore because you have to put the puzzle together yourself and then use all your dexterity! And if you don't want to do this, check out our review of the new Super Mario World game below. The original Super Mario Bros. was released in 1996 (to help promote the split in their sonnet), and starred Luigi, Yoshi and five other "best friends" from Luigi's Mansion. The game didn't get much play at launch due to two reasons: Nintendo never made a sequel; and when they did make one, it wasn't for an entire generation as it had been developed a long time before anyone actually played it. This meant that the trailers were more often seen being shot by motion blur than being animated. That combined with video editing and graphics processing technology wasn't enough to keep the Mario Bros. series going until 1995, but perhaps Nintendo decided they wanted to give it another chance. After all, Mario Brothers is the best collection of videos ever made by the studio, and having 64-bit hardware might be the biggest advantage for Nintendo at this point. So why not release their own Mario Bros. NES exclusive online? That way fans could enjoy any of the games inside their families and it would mean a lot to Nintendo.
