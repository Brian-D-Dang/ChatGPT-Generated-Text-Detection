I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter. My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy to actually cast their ballot and that means it's just a waste of time for everyone involved (the voter included). But I'm not sure how well this would work in practice because there are probably certain ethnic groups where people are so stubbornly proud of their culture and traditions that even though they might dislike Romney or Obama or whatever else, they're still going to try to force those who hate them out of politics altogether? But my main point: People can be really annoying sometimes, but we should at least appreciate all the effort they've put into making our country run properly when the only reason why they do so much is because they love America. They'd rather die than live under tyranny again. And no one has done more to make that happen than Americans themselves. So as far as I'm concerned, anyone signing up to get registered to vote is doing us all a big favor by helping insure we survive another nazi takeover. No one has proved themselves anything other than loyal American citizens. It shows we have some backbone left! Especially against non-Americans like this disgusting man...
