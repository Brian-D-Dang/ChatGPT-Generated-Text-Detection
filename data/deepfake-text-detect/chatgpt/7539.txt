It could be argued that hyper-rationality has had many positive effects on society. The advancement of medicine, technology, and scientific discoveries are all examples of how rational thinking has improved human life. Furthermore, rational thinking can help individuals make informed decisions in their personal and professional lives. It is also important to note that hyper-rationality does not necessarily mean the absence of emotions or personal connections. It is possible to strike a balance between rational thinking and emotional intelligence, leading to more fulfilling and successful human experiences. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that hyper-rationality is universally detrimental to humans.
