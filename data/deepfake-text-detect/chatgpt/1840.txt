So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor religion? It's less that they can't do it than that the circumstances in which a group has power over another is completely different then how power traditionally was given to whites. It's also important not to ignore historical context as well.
