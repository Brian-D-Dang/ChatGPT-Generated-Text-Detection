So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want a good sense of the policy positions of candidates, look at statements or other actions by their campaigns in the media rather than on TV. I also found that people find value in the fact that these columns don't cherry-pick facts-they aren't biased towards one side or another. They're not just "so this is what happened." In contrast, most political pundits who claim to be impartial tend to do so only when they feel like writing negative pieces. When they can avoid doing that for political reasons (like the presidential election) then every day is an opportunity to learn more. Don't treat politics as a zero sum game; seek balance. Thank You!
