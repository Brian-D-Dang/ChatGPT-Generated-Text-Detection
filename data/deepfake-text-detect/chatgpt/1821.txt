The likes of ratheism argue that most of the world's problems come from religion, and that a post-religion world would be miles better. As humans, we inherently drive ourselves into corners because we lack a cohesive understanding on how to live in harmony with other beings (and within our own self). Religion is one way for us to understand this. But if you're not religious, then what the heck are these rationally minded people doing? Well... they have another idea: science! It may sound crazy but all it takes is looking at things like the Big Bang Theory or evolution or the Earth being round or gravity to realize that there seems to be plenty of evidence for intelligent design behind our universe - so why can't I just believe in God instead? All of those scientific theories put together still don't amount to an explanation of everything. No matter how hard scientists try to find out more about the origins of life, no single theory has been able to do exactly what they've set out to discover yet. Maybe something we haven't even imagined could explain the whole thing. And maybe many different answers exist which lead back to God.
