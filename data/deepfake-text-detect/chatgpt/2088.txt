Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I have always said they were wrong (and still do). It's an intrinsic property: the state in which a color can be seen by all living observers at once without it being mixed with other hues is called "color." So if you see no other observers around your perceived color becomes black; similarly, blue would become green when viewed only through water.
