Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just say I'm sorry to anyone who feels I've offended them. I'm happy to discuss if anyone is interested. If you want to do it, just private message me. I think this is a really important subject, and I don't want it to fall by the wayside, so I hope this discussion can continue. In the US, the department of education defines bullying as "unwanted, aggressive behavior among school aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. Both kids who are bullied and who bully others may have serious, lasting problems." Bullying can take many forms, including physical, verbal, relational, and cyber. Cyberbullying is the most common form of bullying, and it can be especially damaging because it often has no time limit and can be done anonymously. Bullying isn't just something kids experience - it's something adults experience too. How I know bullying is a problem I was bullied throughout my childhood. It wasn't something that made me popular, but it was something that happened to me, and something I had to deal with. At the time, I didn't realize what was going on, so I never had the support of my parents. They didn't understand why I was so unhappy at school, and I never had a chance to talk about it. I tried to talk to my teacher about it, but she didn't understand, or didn't want to. One of the things that was said to me was that I was being too sensitive, and that I just needed to deal with it. I was bullied in school, and I was bullied at home. It was something that I had to deal with on my own, and it took me many years to get over. But I got over it, and now I can see that it was a problem. The bullying was just another obstacle that I had to overcome. It didn't make me a stronger person, it didn't make me a better person, it didn't make me happy, it didn't make me more fulfilled. It was a problem, and I had to deal with it. But I did deal with it. I survived, and I learned. I have my own family now, and I'm happy. I don't want anyone else to experience what I did, and I don't want my children to experience it either. As parents, we try to protect our children from everything. We worry about all kinds of things - stranger danger, drowning, poisonous foods, drugs, the environment, etc. But we also worry about bullying. We worry about what other kids are saying about our kids, and we worry about them getting into fights. Bullying is one of those things we don't talk about. We don't want to open that can of worms. I think we need to talk about it. We need to talk about it with our kids, we need to talk about it with other parents. We need to talk about it with our kids' teachers. We need to talk about it with the people who can do something about it. As adults, we worry about bullying. But what happens when we are the bully? I've mentioned before how there's been a significant increase in my husband's behavior, including his aggression towards me. This behavior was just starting to appear when we first started dating, but it has gotten progressively worse. I've written about how he "tried to kill me" on the anniversary of our wedding. I've written about how he's "kicked my ass" so many times. I've written about how he used to "chase me around the house like a cat with a mouse." I've said many times that I don't like his behavior, and that it needs to stop. He's been physically abusive to me, and I want it to stop. I want him to stop being aggressive. I want him to stop being a bully. When I say that I want him to stop being a bully, people don't like it. It upsets people. They don't like me saying that he's being a bully, because it's a word that's loaded with a lot of negative meaning. They ask me if I'm calling
