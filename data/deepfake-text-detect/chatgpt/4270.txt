I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the idea. How does anyone know she was going through anything? She could have been talking in her sleep when she fell over or something. You are correct but there is a chance she didn't care already and decided to sue anyway.
