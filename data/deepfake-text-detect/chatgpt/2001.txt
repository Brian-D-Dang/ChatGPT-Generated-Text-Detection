I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by exposing myself as trans. If you're in the closet and your friends are all cis people who know eachother well enough not to accidentally call you sheher when they mean hehim then there is no reason for them yo feel betrayed if one of their number comes out later
