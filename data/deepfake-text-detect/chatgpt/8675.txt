Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to defend the rights of all women regardless of gender identity." The comments are being encouraged by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in a Facebook post about the campaign's decision. In it, he says "they must be ashamed of their own hypocrisy...or they should start training themselves to live on humanity's highest level!" This is not the first time Sanders has made such an ill-informed comment about transgender issues - from early May when he suggested that transgender children who were born female might be unable to use puberty blockers because they would not get pregnant due to medical conditions like dyslipidemia, or even hormone deficiency - but it seems likely that his remarks will become more frequent as the race heats up next month.
