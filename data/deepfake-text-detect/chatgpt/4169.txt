This CMV post is partly inspired by this rrelationships [post] I came across earlier today. This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had the chance to write it up yet, so I just wanted to say that I am really excited for you guys to see what I have written here. I'm going to take some time off from work from Monday on to concentrate more on my new business, which I will be calling a "dog park." I am working with one of our local dog owners on an idea that we can incorporate into our business model, but there are still many details left unticked. My aim has always been to open up a place where people can come and spend time with their dogs, without having to worry about parking or congestion in busy areas around the city centre area - especially since every day there are numerous 'funny-looking dogs' walking down the road! A couple of weeks ago, I posted a question on the Facebook page asking for help in writing an article explaining how such a facility could operate within a communitycity setting. Thanks to everyone who took the time to reply. The following article was only recently completed after all. It covers everything required for a successful operation: Introduction The Dog Park at City Centre It started out as a simple thought, the idea to set up a dog sanctuary in our local area. From there, I quickly realised that this sort of thing needed to become something bigger than myself, and if I was going to do it, then I would need to involve others. So, I decided to call it a "Dog Park at City Centre" (or DPCC). At first glance, the name might seem odd; however, once you get over the initial shock, you begin to appreciate its meaning. What exactly does a dog park mean? Well, most dog parks offer amenities like bowls, running water, fire pits etc., but a number of them also provide facilities for training purposes. These include agility courses, obedience training classes, obstacle course racing and other similar activities that involve physical exercise and mental stimulation to improve your pet's wellbeing. Many dog parks even offer play-area equipment so that children can enjoy themselves while they learn to walk along leash on a rope, play tug and sit command games etc... There are plenty of ways you can train your dog effectively in a park environment. Of course, the main reason why to open a dog park isn't solely because it brings dogs together. It also helps to promote positive relations between humans and animals. If you're interested in learning more, I suggest visiting the website as well as checking out the various Facebook pages dedicated to the subject if you want to continue reading. Why should you go to a dog park at City Centre? They certainly aren't the only ones! There are plenty of places right outside of London. You won't find anything better than the atmosphere that comes from meeting your friends face to face and spending quality time together with your furry friend! Of course, it must not be a plain old run and gun style park either. With these kinds of things, you end up being starved for social interaction because nobody ever bothers to interact with each other. A dog park provides the opportunity for you guys to spend quality time together, without any distractions. In turn, this creates a bond between you and your canine buddy that lasts long after the park closes for the evening. There is no doubt that there are potential drawbacks associated with opening a dog park at City Centre. Bear in mind that not every person who visits a specific location likes every aspect about it. Some people may prefer less development, others will hate the fact that you have developed a block of flats directly next door to your dog park. Whatever your feelings toward the matter, I hope you will agree that it makes sense for you to step forward and create a space exclusively for your poochy companions. Once it opens, it won't take long before enough local residents agree that the benefits outweigh the negatives. Then your neighbour won't have much choice except to respect your wishes and move on!
