Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one is married to a person they love? While it may be tempting to simply enjoy the peace and quiet (preferably with your spouse), some people like me have discovered that there are many benefits of continuing to pursue a relationship based on mutual interest and respect. So what exactly does this mean for you as a chaste single woman wishing to maintain healthy sexual relationships? In all honesty, most married couples do not "stop loving" each other during their marriage. It seems to me that the only difference between my wife and I was our desire to continue growing closer together over time rather than rushing into romance because we were in an instant gratification culture. By focusing on improving our communication skills - even if it meant having 'conversations' that lasted hours instead of minutes-we became able to better understand each other before jumping into bed every night. We also decided that while we could never look past our physical attraction, after two years of marriage we had grown so tired of watching porn that we refused to watch it anymore. After we made these changes we felt much more connected physically. Perhaps this was because porn makes us feel as if nothing has changed at all since our first date; therefore becoming bored by it. But perhaps we actually started dating much earlier than most people realize! Regardless, we both believe that we grew stronger through this experience without falling back into old ways and wasting precious time on things out of our control. Instead, we began acting consciously about how we wanted to spend our time and who we chose to associate ourselves with. A couple of weeks ago my wife and I attended a workshop called The Art of Relationships. This event brought together three very different types of singles who came from different walks of life but shared similar feelings towards pursuing a meaningful romantic relationship. Some spoke openly about the struggles they faced in finding someone who would care about them beyond just wanting to make love. Others described themselves as feeling trapped emotionally and sexually. Still others admitted to having justified cheating in order to find someone whom they believed would treat them right. Now admittedly, I am not perfect either. When I first met my husband he left his job early to become my full-time partner which involved a lot more travel and required him to move far away from family and friends. He was kind enough to pick up the slack while I went through school. I moved away for college and then returned home several months later when he finished his master's degree. Then I got pregnant with our daughter, making another 40 hour work week seem inexcusable with our toddler around. Though he supported me throughout the process I found myself wondering why he ever bothered leaving work in the middle of the day to come to my side of town and help raise her. Although he worked part time until we finally got pregnant again I still wasn't sure why he put himself through such hardship in order for me to stay home with baby number 2. My self-esteem took a big hit when I realized that he didn't want kids and that he couldn't handle being away from me for the long term. And yet despite all these hurdles in our lives, we managed to remain a strong and supportive couple yet we always knew that when the time comes that he will need to leave once again, I can take care of little one on my own. Over the last few months I've been trying to figure out where to go next. What makes sense for my career path? Where should I invest my energy, in terms of money, friendships, and time? Something inside me says that something needs to change. At some point in my adult life I hope I discover who I truly am, or at least feel fully understood by somebody else. If anything, that person must also know who I really am. Without that piece of the puzzle I might end up spending the rest of my days looking for a new purpose or a new passion...and missing out on real happiness along the way.
