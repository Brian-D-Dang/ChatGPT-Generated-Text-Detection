Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and are against most of what this country stands for (though they don't know why). Person B happens not to like any kind of government at all because he thinks it imposes restrictions on him that make his life worse than if there were no government. He doesn't care about anything but himself; because again no one else matters in the slightest. Person C knows full well what I just said about person B but likes the idea anyway because he thinks its more free than other systems even though really it isn't much better then those same ones with slightly different names. This is where we have our Libertarian Party candidate.
