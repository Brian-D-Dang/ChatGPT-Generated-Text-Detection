One counter-argument to Weinberg's statement could be that religion is not the sole factor that drives people to do evil. There are various other factors like greed, power, or influence that can lead individuals to commit immoral acts even if they are inherently good. Furthermore, the concept of good and evil is subjective and varies from person to person, and religion is not the only source of moral guidance. Therefore, although religion can play a role in shaping a person's moral compass, blaming it for all evil actions is not accurate.
