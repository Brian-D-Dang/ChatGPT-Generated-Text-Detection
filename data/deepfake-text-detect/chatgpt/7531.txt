There are several counter-arguments that can be made to refute the opinion that a Conservative will never be US president again. One could argue that: 1. History has shown that neither party has a permanent hold on the presidency. There have been multiple shifts in power between Democrats and Republicans over the years, and it is entirely possible that a Conservative could be elected president again in the future. 2. The political landscape is constantly changing, and the views and priorities of voters can shift quickly. What may seem like an insurmountable obstacle to a Conservative candidate today could be seen as an advantage in the future. 3. While it is true that some demographic groups have become more Democratic-leaning over time, Conservatives still have a strong base of support among certain segments of the population (such as older white voters), and they may be able to expand their appeal to other groups as well. 4. Finally, it's worth noting that predictions about future political outcomes are always uncertain. Even the most sophisticated models and expert opinions can be proven wrong by unexpected events or shifts in public opinion. Therefore, it's important to avoid making overly confident predictions about the future of American politics.
