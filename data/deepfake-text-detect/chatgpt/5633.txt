First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. She sits down and starts talking loudly about how many people there are on the bus. It's not just that she's annoying, it's that she's loud. Everybody gets irritated and after a while you can see the poor woman making a fool of herself. She is asking for trouble. Now imagine that instead of doing this, the woman sits down, folds her hands and starts to meditate. In fact, she's meditating on the number of people on the bus. She's not bothering anyone. After a while people around her start to feel more relaxed and comfortable. I'd say most people would prefer this woman to the other one. I wonder if we don't have a similar attitude to the two different ways of meditating. When you're doing a regular meditation you are usually trying to keep your mind quiet. You have something like the third noble truth in mind and you try to keep your mind focused on that. When you are doing a mindfulness meditation you are doing the opposite. You are trying to keep your mind quiet, but you are not trying to keep your mind on anything. You are just trying to be aware of what is going on in your mind and your body. In a way, you could say that the first type of meditation is trying to suppress the mind and the second type of meditation is trying to develop it. Sometimes people do the opposite of what they intend to do. They're doing mindfulness meditation but they try to keep their mind on the third noble truth. They are trying to suppress their mind and they are actually causing more agitation. This reminds me of a story that I heard about a young man who went to a monastery. He wanted to do an intensive meditation retreat, so he went to the abbot and asked for permission. The abbot said, "Fine, but you are not to speak to anybody." So the young man went off to meditate and then at the end of a week he returned to the abbot. He said, "I've had a great retreat. I've really had a breakthrough!" The abbot said, "Well done. How much time did you spend meditating?" The young man said, "Oh, about 12 hours a day." The abbot said, "And how many hours did you spend speaking to people?" The young man said, "None! I didn't speak to anyone!" The abbot said, "Good for you! You're a good meditator. You've broken through. But I wonder how you would have done if you'd spent 12 hours a day speaking to people?" There is a time and a place for being silent and a time and a place for speaking. The difference between the two is the attitude. If you are speaking in the right way it is actually meditation. This is an important point. This is why there is such a big difference between the way people meditate. If you really want to know if a person is a good meditator or not you need to look at their speech. They are not speaking just to annoy other people. They are not trying to bend other people to their will, they are not trying to be clever. They are not trying to seem intelligent or to make people think they're intelligent. They are just speaking naturally, trying to help themselves and other people. If a person is really speaking in this way, it is an expression of the fourth right perception. It's a way of seeing, a way of knowing and a way of communicating. It's a way of expressing your own attainments. If you don't meditate you will not have much to say. It's like people who are hungry. They get excited about food. People who meditate get excited about meditation. If you want to be a good communicator you should meditate. If you want to get in touch with the Buddha nature that's inside you, you should meditate. If you want to see things as they are, you should meditate. If you want to be happy, you should meditate. If you want to improve the world, you should meditate. If you want to be a good friend, you should meditate. The meditation is the secret.
