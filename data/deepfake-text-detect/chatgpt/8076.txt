Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from recreational). Then i got injured and had wrist surgery in 2007 at which time they told me that if it didn't heal well enough by 2008 or so then there was no hope for having any kind of career after this injury because you're going through 5-6 surgeries with each one taking awhile before healing properly It has been over 10 years since these injuries have happened now; when people ask about what's wrong wme - many times without being asked...i tell them "sports..."I don't go into details bcs most will say "oh...well - we all know how sports are" ...but really..they want an explanation....and why? Is their curiosity too invasive?? In addition: My husband lost his father early on bc he worked hard 60 hours per week trying desperately just make ends meet.....the man never took anything away frm us except advice sometimes very good like telling him 'dont drink drive!!!'. He only gave our son things such giving clothes gifts etc outta love....now looking back maybe thats partly where is daddy issues come true seeing young men die every yr due accidents drunk driving......when did parents become selfish???????
