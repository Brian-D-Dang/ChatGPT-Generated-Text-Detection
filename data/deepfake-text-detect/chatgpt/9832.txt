I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying he was wrong, but I think he was right. He said, "Our economy is based on the principles of freedom and free enterprise, not government control." I agree with Mike Huckabee's statement that our economy is based on the principles of freedom and free enterprise, not government control. Our economic system gives individuals the freedom to make their own decisions about what to buy and sell and how to use their resources. This encourages competition and innovation, which leads to growth in the economy and improved standards of living. Government intervention can disrupt this process and lead to inefficiencies and unintended consequences. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the government does not interfere too much in the workings of the economy.
