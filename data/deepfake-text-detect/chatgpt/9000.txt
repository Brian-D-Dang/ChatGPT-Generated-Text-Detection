Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, mostly because it seems like the government is catering too much to anyone without the expertise to do anything about it. No school should hire teachers unless they have basic knowledge of science and sciences (such as chemistry). Of course when you raise this issue though, there will be backlash against these schools being open-ended andor forced on people who have basic education skills.
