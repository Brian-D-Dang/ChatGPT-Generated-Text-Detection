Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the only thing available is a spot that was just taken by someone else with a handicap but they have their own spot without me coming on the scene to do anything about it. My school uses tiny little handicap spaces and the place fills up within 10 minutes of opening every day, so how can there be not enough for everyone?
