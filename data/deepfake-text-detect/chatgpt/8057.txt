I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is an God, he's probably what we would call now as "fairy-tale" with super powers and so on...but if He does exist....well..he shouldn't be much different from us since his creations are imperfect like ourselves (or at least should). So my question (s): Would you accept the existence for something that has physical form? And more importantly: What do YOU think will happen in your case? Or perhaps who did created our universe without intervention by some kind forcegods etc.? Doesn'T matter which - because all answer leads back too "so many questions." So please tell me yours!:)
