Hello, I'm Luke and for the longest time a small dream of mine has been to move to a Scandinavian country such as Norway, Sweden, or Denmark. From what I've heard from friends who have visited these countries is that they are extremely expensive. Although this may be true it was always my hope that since I love video games so much I would eventually be able to live in one of those beautiful Nordic countries! If you could give me any advice on how best to pursue this goal then I'd really appreciate it because i feel like now is the right time to try something new such as this. Thanks all and God bless!
