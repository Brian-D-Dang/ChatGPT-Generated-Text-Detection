This people are selling good feelings. Not really being able to talk to the dead or a magic pill to lose weight. They are like movies or video games. They have no console, don't even know what it is, but they're spending money on things that can help them lose weight and gain muscle mass. They're all trying hard. You should listen to what you want from your body - if you're not happy with the results of surgery, get out of the hospital and stop eating garbage, because once in awhile something bad happens to you (or maybe worse) I'm going to try that. Thank you!
