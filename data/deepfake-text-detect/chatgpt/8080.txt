I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for stealing 200, they could commit suicide with no parole." On May 26th 2017 I was released from FDC Marianna and transferred back home on July 11st. A private company contracted by GEO gets paid millions per year while people are sentenced wrongly or receive poor care at this facility that can't afford soap powder, Tylenol toilet paper just like we did before privatization) Now it seems as though our state representative Collins wants me silenced so he doesn't lose his seat out here its sickening!
