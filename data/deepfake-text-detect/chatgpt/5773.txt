I feel like they're acting and it often feels very campy. I don't like how they say "well my brain is more feminine," like excuse me that's something that women have to deal with every day. I feel like they're so over the top and insecure about it. I like the show but I think I would like it more if it were more about what it's like to be a trans woman and less about how the other women feel about it.
