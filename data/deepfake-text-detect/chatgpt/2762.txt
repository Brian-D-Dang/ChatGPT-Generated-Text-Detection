Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if people were truly unable to find work because of discrimination for being transgender, it would be a very small number relative to those who are not discriminated against (in other words, there is no "epidemic. This whole thing was just poorly thought out on my part.

Most governments recognize them as either something else entirely such as "gender dysphoria" or simply lump them into transvestite groups - but others then argue back saying while gender identity disorder is distinct from cross dressing, both are still recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual meaning they can still receive medical treatment. Almost half of North American adults believe that Transgenders shouldn't be allowed federal benefits like social security based off their own unconscious bias towards an entire group of people...even though more than 90 would have supported them had they known what it meant.[1]More information may also come from employment statistics where studies show almost 30 percent aren't considered "suitable" employees due largely to their physiological characteristics rather than any sort of prejudice.[2]As for individuals themselves, studies suggest anywhere between 1-3 of the population identifies under the umbrella term - 1-2 identify as "transsexual," 1-2 identify as "gay," and 0.5 identify as "bi." In fact, according to Dr. Logothetis, "the percentage [of the population identifying as transgender] I personally feel comfortable calling significant enough. It appears to me that this number is likely somewhere around 2.3] (EDIT: Although some claim 3-4) [4] (For more stats see Help Center Statistics)
