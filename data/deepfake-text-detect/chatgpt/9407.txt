Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. Let's cut the cynicism for Bernie Sanders, but for the rest of our lives we'll be surrounded by a Republican administration and the consequences will be just as bad. I'm sure that the centrists will never come to power and the left will remain in power for at least another 12 years. They're not going to want to change the governing structure of the country, they're not going to want to put socialist measures in place and they're not going to do anything radical like putting 100 percent renewable energy in place.
