What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy that ideology supports and who benefits from the end result of a movement. The important part to take away here is: The "alt right" isn't an ideology ...not its political ramifications... It's quite telling when you have no rebuttal other than semantic hair splitting over semantics while still support what these people stand for.
