Hi, I'm new. So the greeks are complaining about the EU's imposed austerity measures, the terms of their countries increasing debt problems, even going as far as to boycott german products and German goods in general? Suddenly they're "offended" by Germany not giving anything back for all it has given them over hundreds if years (not just economic help). I don't get why this is suddenly such an issue now when there was never any real complaint until recently... Maybe because many people were getting government handouts before being forced into early retirement or losing jobs due European Union regulations that made every company move production overseas where labor costs cheaper than Europe can provide though taxes on exports etc.? Sure sounds like something which would offend me too but ok maybe my understanding doesn't match up with reality here...maybe you guys know what really happened since your superior intellect will probably tell us how we should feel instead so no need trying anymore..even apologies mean nothing! Doesn;' have be racist either - some individuals might still disagree based solely upon race while ignoring other factors involved.....but "racist" isn'nt one word enough anyway....so try: Anti-GayHomophobic Racism! You say someone says stupid things more often then others therefore automatically implying he must also think less independently?! What world do these liberals live under;)????????
