I'm planning to vote for Bernie in the primaries but, if Hillary gets the nomination, I'll still vote for her in the general - I will do anything in my power not to give Trump a chance. He's walking into an electoral landslide and he has no clue what any of this country is actually like or how government works (just look at his cabinet choices). So you'd rather have trump as president?
