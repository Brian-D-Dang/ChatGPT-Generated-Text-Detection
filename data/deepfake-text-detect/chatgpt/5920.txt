So, one thing that I have to preface this with is that I see both (all) sexes as equal, outside of a few natural sexual dimorphisms (Genitalia, ability to have a baby, and a few other things). I also tend to see gender as not being a part of who you are, but rather who you present yourself to be. For the record, I am not a Tumblr user. I haven't been in probably 5 years. Anyway, I have been told my gender (by people who I know IRL) is not what I think it is. To me, it's male. I'm tall, have a deep voice, broad shoulders, and I'm skinny (6'0," 155 lbs). I wear a lot of guy clothing, like flannel, jeans, button-up shirts, etc. I like being in the company of men, especially older men. I don't like being in the company of women. I have no interest in dating anyone other than men. However, I have been told I am a "tomboy" and that I am "actually a girl." I'm told I'm "masculine" and that I "don't look like a girl." I've been told "I must not have a vagina." One of my friends was banned from a group chat because I said I "didn't think that way" when he was "coming on to me." My best friend is a girl who I have known since 4th grade. I've told her many things about my gender and sexuality. I just feel like I'm not being taken seriously. I don't want to be a girl. I don't know what I want to be. I'm not sure if I am trans or not, and that's one reason why I came here. I just want to be me. P.S. I'm a Christian, and I'm not gay or bi. I'm not confused about that. Welcome to the forum. Just be yourself. We're all people here and we'll accept you as you are. And I was coming on to you? That's cute. Welcome to the forums! It's always a good idea to be yourself here. Everyone is respectful to each other and we won't treat you any differently. Transitioning doesn't mean being a girl. It's a stage between being a boy and being a girl. You can be a tomboy, or whatever you like. I've always been a girl. My body has always been a girl's body. My brain is female. I don't have a problem with the genitals thing, but if I could have a different one, I would. I guess I'm just confused. I wish I could go to a real gender therapist. Most people who have transitioned will tell you that they have always been the gender they have transitioned to. It's just that your brain and body were in a mismatch before. You were never wrong about who you are and what you are, but I can imagine it might be hard to keep your foot on the ground. I'm glad you've found us. I'm sure you'll get a lot of support here.
