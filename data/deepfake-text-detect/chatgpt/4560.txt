I'd like to preface this by saying that parts of my post may sound like they're bragging, but they're not trying to come across that way. Also, I'm using a Mac with OS X 10.10 Yosemite and Google Chrome. My friend sent me an article about how he's gotten up all the way to level 15 on League of Legends in just 1 hour... after playing for 4 years! He then proceeded to tell everyone at school (and some people from reddit) about it which got us thinking - what if we could do this? What would be our best strategy for succeeding if given enough time? So today I present you: How We Got To Level 15 On LoL In Just An Hour So Far. So again, please read through because there will probably be things wronginconsistent or I'll elaborate more later. Some of these tips are really basic and most should apply to any game and many other series too. But here is a list of useful advice we found along the way so far when ranking everything down to 'basic' to 'advanced'. Enjoy! These Tips Are NOT For Everyone: You need to decide whether or not you want to use them before reading further. If you don't have time then go on Reddit instead where countless others who love video games share their strategies. Don't worry though, this one might help you out. There won't be much arguing about spoilers either. The only spoiler-y stuff is towards the end and my general TL;DR summary below: "leveling" is almost always easier than leveling faster. This means that your first priority has to be figuring out what skills work best for you, rather than optimizing for speed. It also makes sense since everyones playstyle varies significantly. Not all champions can farm efficiently either, meaning certain characteristics make you better suited for specific paths (more on that later). You can basically pick any champion you want and I guarantee something works well for you. Finally, remember that it doesn't matter how fast you get there. Winning is winning, even if its slow. 5 minutes versus 30 hours isn't going to change anything. Personal Experience: After asking around in rleagueoflegends and finding nothing helpful, I decided to start recording myself farming. As it turns out, writing videos was pretty fun so I kept doing it until I ended up at level 15. I used a guide called the Learn2Play Path which seems to be a fairly popular and simple strategy among Korean players compared to Zoez's Guide. His theory behind it seemed to be "Farming early higher gold per minute." While I haven't tried his methods yet (we'll see), mine seem to roughly follow those same guidelines. TL;DR Summary Of Points That Helped Us Get From 0 To 15: 1.) Start With Farming Champs It didn't make much difference as to what champ I started with since all characters eventually worked. Even during laning phase I had similar results regardless of choice. My main focus however was killing minions. Most champs already deal quite a bit damage to jungle camps regardless of skill levels so in order to reach high levels you always need to kill minions anyway. Once you've cleared the jungle at least once you know exactly what champions work best for clearing it. By choosing a farming champion you can easily clear camps quicker without having to resort to ganking. The reason why I chose farming Champions over... To Catch A Thief If you look closely throughout the video, even up until the very last second, she does actually chase him down. She simply gets stuck under the train due to some weird bug and Peanut knocks her out immediately after getting hit. Peanuts most recent tweet said he wouldn't confirm the incident happened.. However, the next day, he did say he caught the cat thief. Hmm...... Neinja xD He claims to have talked to the perpetrator himself, so maybe someone else picked it up after the fact. Or.... Maybe it was all set up prior to filming.:3 Either way, great job putting together such a good vid cover art lol.:) Apparently, this guy loves cats so much he literally built a whole ad campaign dedicated to stealing cats. And selling stolen ones online for extra cash, apparently. Shehehahahaha.....
