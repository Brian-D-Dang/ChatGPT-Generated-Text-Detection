So, it's obvious to anyone who took a math class that the average number of sex partners between straight men and straight women must be the same. However, the median is different for both sexes; where as in males there are many more men than women who have had only one partner whereas with females on the other hand (and this will probably come off sexist) most girls I know seem to believe they can go out every night and get laid without too much difficulty... I've been seeing that same trend, but for opposite reasons: Women always brag about how easy it was getting laid in college. But we never hear anything like that from guys around here!
