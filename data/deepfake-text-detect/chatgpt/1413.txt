Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent people with the intent that they would die from radiation poisoning, which is an act of genocide and mass murder. 2. There has never been any evidence presented by Japan or the US showing that there was no other way to stop the Japanese advance but to use nuclear weapons. 3. The Geneva Convention prohibits possessing these weapons against civilian populations even if you are fighting another country. 4. Many countries have ratified the treaty banning their own citizens from voluntarily acquiring them, so only those who came into possession illegally could possess them for military purposes. It's clear that we should not have used them under our Constitution because such weapons were banned worldwide; including all countries where there had already been treaties prohibiting it as well as Germany (who did need one at the time). 5. At least five nations have signed treaties since the war forbidding the development or stockpiling of nuclear arms today - China, France, Egypt, Russia, and Ukraine. 6. In light of what's happened recently surrounding the possible revivalreproduction of Nazi experiments like Auschwitz-Birkenau, such things must always remain illegal in relation to warfare and never allowed again. 7. The U.S. government lied about the fact that it had developed nuclear weapons when President Truman actually made it known publicly. 8. To date, most Americans still believe that the U.S. didn't develop the bomb until 1945 despite vast amount of literature demonstrating otherwise. 9. A recent poll showed that more than half of Americans don't know whether Hiroshima or Nagasaki were bombed first or second. 10. Allowing anyone else to acquire nukes will unleash a new age of nuclear devastation just as Germany and Austria after WWI unleashed a whole new level of terror in regards to keeping us safe through fear. Key Points: It's outrageous that the U.S., someone so advanced in technology wouldn't abide by basic ethics concerning nonviolence morality, especially considering how many people died due to German atrocities during WWII
