EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People who aren't familiar with this concept can readily fall into believing them as if it is something which exists for sure and repeatedly use "triggered" incorrectly when describing various events - filipseAug 17 '19 at 16:.21
