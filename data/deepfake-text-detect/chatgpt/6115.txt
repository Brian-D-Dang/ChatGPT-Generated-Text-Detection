So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because he was using drugs during a Pro tour. And if you read this article , it says that he admitted to the use of drugs during the tournament. I have no problem with this ban, in fact I support it. I think that the use of drugs in any sort of high level competition should be a serious offense and that professional players should be role models to the community and should set a good example. But I do have a problem with how this article was worded. "Jesse has received a full sanction from Wizards of the Coast that will bar him from participating in any Wizards of the Coast event for a period of two years, including the 2017 Wizards of the Coast Pro Tour, as well as any other official sanctioned events, and from participating in the 2017 Magic: The Gathering World Championship (Worlds)." The article says that he can't participate in the 2017 Pro Tour (which is fine) and any other sanctioned events (which I can understand) and also the 2017 World Championship. But the problem is, the 2017 World Championship is an event that isn't run by Wizards of the Coast. It is run by the players themselves and it is a worldwide event that happens to be in the same place as the Pro Tour. So Jesse can't play in Worlds because he is banned from Pro Tour? That's a bit extreme. I know that this is a really small issue and I don't think that Jesse should be allowed to participate in Worlds. But I do think that there is a bit of a discrepancy here and Wizards should address it before the 2017 World Championship. I'm not gonna say what you say, but it's the wrong place to post this. I'm not going to say what you say, but it's the wrong place to post this. In all seriousness, I'm not sure that anyone can change their mind about a subject as black and white as this. The community is split as far as how to handle the subject of banned players. I can't really see how this topic relates to the community, even though it does, and since it doesn't relate, I'd say this is the wrong forum for this discussion. I understand that you have a lot of passion for this subject, but I'm not sure where the place for it would be. Well, I don't think that any forum is the wrong place to post this. I just think that this is the wrong thread to post it in. Sorry I'm new here. How do I move it to the right thread? I'm not even going to try to say what you say, but it's the wrong place to post this. The community is split as far as how to handle the subject of banned players.
