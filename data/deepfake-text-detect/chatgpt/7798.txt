While it is true that these lab-created elements may not exist in nature or in large quantities, it is important to note that the periodic table is not solely limited to naturally occurring elements. In fact, the periodic table has been expanded numerous times throughout history due to the discovery of new elements, whether they are naturally occurring or created in a lab. Moreover, the creation of these elements allows for a deeper understanding of atomic structure and provides insight into the potential uses and applications of elements in various fields such as medicine, energy production, and materials science. Therefore, it is not only justifiable but also necessary for these lab-created elements to be recognized and studied as part of the periodic table.
