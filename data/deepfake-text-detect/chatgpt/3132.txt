I have had friendships with various males, and only one of them has not tried to at one point in time, make it sexual. This was not a big deal I'm glad to hear that it wasn't a big deal for you. However, if you feel uncomfortable or want to set boundaries, it's important to communicate your feelings clearly. It's important to remember that you have the right to say no to any unwanted advances, regardless of the person's gender. It's also important to surround yourself with people who respect your boundaries and treat you with respect.
