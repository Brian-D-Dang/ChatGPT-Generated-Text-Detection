I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my family members. They are a little more judgmental than I am used to and it's been a little frustrating. The reason why I say that is because my mom has always been very supportive of my music. She's always loved it and supports my expression of myself through music and even the voice acting. I wouldn't have gotten this far if she didn't support me. The problem is that there are some people in my family that are just ignorant. They can't see past the fur and they think that this is not something I should be doing. It's sad and it makes me very frustrated because my mom has supported me so much in the past and I've always been so grateful for that. It's frustrating because it's hard to be accepted and to get positive support when the ones that you love don't get it. I'm just hoping that they eventually do. I've definitely had that experience. I was one of the first people in my family to have a girlfriend and when that first happened my parents were a little reluctant to accept that I was gay. Now my family and I are pretty close and they're all extremely accepting of who I am. The problem is that they're not accepting of my girlfriend. She's from a different country and I've had to learn to be a little more careful and not be as open with them as I am with my girlfriend. It's just so frustrating to see some family members make such a big deal out of something that is so small. I've been lucky enough to have an accepting family and I'm sure that you will get there too, it just takes a little patience and some time to get there. I'm very sorry that you're going through that right now. Thanks, that's really encouraging to hear. Yeah, I'm hoping that I can get there soon. I have a feeling it might take a little bit longer. I'm hoping that my mom will eventually be more accepting of my girlfriend as well. I just hope that it doesn't take that long.
