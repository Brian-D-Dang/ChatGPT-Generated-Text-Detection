First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and often times racist in their application (e.g., stop frisk policies). That being said... if you're going on about how these people were treated unfairly with long sentences - they were. They committed serious acts against other humans for which there is no excuse or justification. But then again so did OJ Simpson's wife Nicole Brown! So what? He murdered her - he spends a good portion of his life doing time; she was murdered by someone else who gets even less than 10 years and will probably be out before 2019. Note this date is based upon my own speculation as to when he'll actually get released from jail. The article says "early release" but don't know why one would speculate early instead of later since parole eligibility begins at 50.
