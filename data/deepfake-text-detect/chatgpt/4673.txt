Most colleges do not require trigonometry for admissions, and do not require students to take a trigonometry course. It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math section of their test asking if you know how to use an angle measurement tool (called a protractor) More likely than any other subject, high school algebra is something that can be taken or left out depending on what courses are needed at the time it was being studied. But regardless of whether one took it or not, having had some exposure to it helps greatly with later mathematics courses where lots of problems will involve doing things like simplifying expressions involving logarithms and exponents.
