I just read this [article] stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering how much of the government is run by jews, who don't look like these groups at all (not trying to offend anyone). As for people claiming it was a joke... Yeah right.... I'm pretty sure there are guys out on the street who would want to see someone get raped or beat up too. It's not funny when you do it but they're still gonna find some way to go down with their fake smile plastered across their face. "The most difficult thing about being defeated is never admitting it." -Vietnam Veteran It might be more accurate to say that Asians fare better in college admissions because they tend to come from well-to-do families and can afford private tutors etc., while BlacksHispanics generally come from less affluent backgrounds and therefore take advantage of things like free lunch programs... a lot of which involve meeting teachers off campus after school activities. So if your son has been going to community college then he will probably have done rather poorly on SAT tests since only rich kids usually attend those schools where everything is provided for them, while poor students attending regular public highschools must rely on themselves to succeed academically. Another factor is simply race itself; even though the percentage of black population overall is higher than any other racial group, they also happen to make up less of America as a whole than Hispanics combined. In addition, due to increased immigration over the last couple decades many Hispanic Americans now identify primarily with their country of origin instead of the U.S.; thus further diluting the numbers. There are positive signs however: The number of Asian American children enrolled in preschool education rose sharply between 2000 and 2009 (from 11 to 20), possibly indicating greater interest in learning English among younger generations than previous ones. Also, according to statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics "Among 18 year olds whose parents had attended some college compared to no college, 29 percent of Whites were unemployed, 30 percent of African Americans were employed..." Perhaps this means that Black youth especially may feel confident enough to enter college without having to worry so much about what they'll do afterwards. I think one should overlook the content of articles written by liberal wingnuts masquerading as journalists. They're always full of crap anyway. "Before he could die he fell upon his knees three times, begging God's forgiveness." Joan of Arc "God does violence to us every day because we ask him to save our lives!" Mother Teresa "We cannot blame ourselves for fate's cruelty; nor should we become accustomed to death." Walt Whitman Maybe its the fact that i am white (and an american) but i hate the idea of affirmative action. Its racist! Why should my family produce slaves? Isnt thats why slavery ended in 1865? Besides, alot of blacks dont care about their own kind either..they just seem to be looking out for 1!!! While asian countries often try to help fellow asians,theres not really a need for it here. As far as im concerned,,if youre not good enough in life it doesnt matter whether youre black white yellow red blue green whatever. One person says something different?? Oh yeah,its just another lie! Well, I'd agree that maybe Asians shouldn't apply to college under AA policies if they lack merit. But, I don't know, based on racial makeup of college populations, 65 years of racism, job placement rates, income disparity etc., sheesh, I guess my point isn't entirely clear. Yes, asians deserve equal opportunity to pursue schooling although they aren't'suffering' through racism today. And yes, despite gross disparities in wealth, unemployment levels and various social indicators relative to whites, and despite the fact that whites were enslaved for hundreds of years, Asians have suffered little discrimination. However, as for AA itself, it's quite profitable to discriminate against minorities and women via scholarship money given away annually to supposedly deserving needy student. If the current amount spent on AA scholarships and grants is cut back to 0, the treasury would gain billions of dollars from tax revenue alone. Unfortunately, the vast majority of Afrocentricity propagandists refuse to acknowledge the real reasons for minority disadvantage and encourage others to play victimhood politics. Meanwhile, Caucasians are privileged to live in both filthy white trash suburbs and inner city ghettos throughout the world (as well as wherever else whites colonized). Thus conservatively speaking, the balance sheet favors Caucasians hands down. Furthermore, from personal experience, the best HS classes in California prep schools declined dramatically once Jews joined in with nonwhite efforts to promote diversity within K-12 curricula. Today, because so few Jewish scholars appear in classrooms anywhere, very few high school courses contain anything remotely resembling actual history anymore.
