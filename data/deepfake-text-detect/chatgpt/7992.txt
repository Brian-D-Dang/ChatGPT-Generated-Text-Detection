While it may seem unfair to put down animals that attack hikers in national parks, it is important to consider the safety of all park visitors. National parks see a large volume of visitors each year and it is the responsibility of park officials to ensure their safety. If an animal has displayed aggressive behavior towards humans, there is a high risk that it will attack again, potentially causing serious injury or even death. Additionally, park officials may not have the resources to relocate the animal, and it may continue to pose a threat to visitors even if removed from the immediate area. Therefore, putting down animals that attack hikers in national parks is often necessary for the safety and well-being of all park visitors.
