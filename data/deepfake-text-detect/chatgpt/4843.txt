There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man standing with his pants down). If you are that insecure, then maybe you aren't cut out for the military or law enforcement. I agree wholeheartedly. And frankly I wouldn't want to serve under anyone who would do such a thing as a prank. Maybe they were just being silly but at least he was wearing a uniform while doing this so there's no excuse for him being dressed like this except stupidity andor ignorance? Why does someone need to take their shirt off on base if they're gonna be working around other people? Don't get me wrong...it's still stupid, but worse than that? That said....why work up an erection by running around naked when you could've been playing video games instead? Also, why run around in circles once you finally get hard enough? Are we to believe there wasn't any porn available at Ft Campbell when all these guys needed to do was go home and masturbate after some time away from females? Off topic - Corporal Jordan can suck my big fat hairy ass! He will never see combat ever again because of what he did today. Now Sgt. Michael Paul has to question whether he'll pull me into traffic before Christmas Eve morning to teach him a lesson. Suck on that mother fucker! You deserve everything coming your way. Stand tall proud CPL. The world knows how brave you really are. Corporal James "John" Jordan Jr., U.S. Army, stationed at Fort Knox, Ky., had been caught red-handed last year pulling a similar stunt, which eventually led to his court martial and discharge in August 2009. But rather than pursue charges against Private First Class Michael J. Paul - who witnessed Jordan's infraction and reported the incident - the army made sure the two men got special recognition. They each received "Good Conduct Medals." Jordan now works fulltime as a heavy equipment operator at Martin State Forest Headquarters near Albany, N.Y. A spokesman for the Kentucky National Guard confirmed via email Wednesday night that Pfc. Jordan remains employed with the unit as well. An official letter sent via overnight mail Tuesday afternoon stated: Mr. Robert Callahan states the following Official Communication regarding Staff Sergeant (SSgt) John Doe, SSGT Paul: Due to the extenuating circumstances involving reduction in force action taken during FY09 for the units duties here at Camp McConnell Kentucky, Sgt. (E7) Jordan, was discharged without prejudice and given good conduct medals for actions alleged to have occurred October 16th 2007 thru March 1st 2008. This includes allegations of indecent exposure where he was discovered bathing nude. We also note that the Army will initiate proceedings in accordance with Regulation 1560 DC dated 2006 concerning abuse of authority leading to criminal conviction including assault, sodomy etc. The same document makes reference to 18 USC 707, WHICH IS IN FACT INDECENT EXPOSURE UNDER ARTICLE 120 OF THE UCMJ. Under Article 121, GIVING OFFENSE TO RECOGNIZE AS CRIME IF COMMISSIONED BY OFFICER OR SOLDIER; CONFINEMENT MAY BE IMPRISONMENT FOR UPTO ONE YEAR AND REGIMEN ARREST WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT APPEARANCE BEFORE AN ARMED ENEMY POSTION OR DURESS BEFORE OTHERS. However, under Section 459a of Title 18 United States Code, OFFENSES AGAINST PUBLIC MORALS CAN ONLY ONLY INCARCERATE MORE THAN TWICE THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY. PROFESSIONAL CARE SHOULD PREVENT SERIOUS DISORDER FROM GROWING BUT IT WILL TAKEN LIKELY ACTION TO RESOLVE THIS AS WELL AS RETENTION UNTIL LAWFUL MARITAL RELATIONSHIP HAS COMPLETED ITS COURSE. Cpl. David Myers certainly didn't think much of our species when he saw fellow soldiers urinating outside the bathroom window of his barracks - only later did he realize that the act was the product of the most natural instinct the human body possesses. To make matters even more repellent, according to reports from another soldier in his platoon, Mr. Myers and his compatriots decided to celebrate aloud after finding themselves unencumbered sexually.[...] In fact, it appears Mr. Myers isn't alone among members of the U.S. Armed Forces in having an unusual interest in peeing outdoors.[...] Mr. Myers says he has always felt uncomfortable passing urine within the confines of barracks rooms since childhood, when one of his teachers told his parents that she couldn't trust him in class anymore because he peed on himself every day. At age 9, he began drinking alcohol regularly to cope with stress,[......] Soon thereafter, however, Mr. Myers developed a fascination with watching birds fly through windows[...], and gradually became interested in other birds.
