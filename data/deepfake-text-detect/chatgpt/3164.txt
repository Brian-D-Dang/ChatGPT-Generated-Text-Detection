Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for choosing automatic transmissions over manual transmissions, other than convenience in heavy traffic or stop-and-go driving. However, automatic transmissions can be more fuel-efficient than manual transmissions in certain circumstances, such as when driving at high speeds or in certain driving modes. Additionally, some drivers prefer the ease of use and comfort of automatic transmissions. Ultimately, the choice between manual and automatic transmission depends on personal preference and the needs of the driver.
