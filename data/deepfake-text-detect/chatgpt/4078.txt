This is a problem I always encounter when I drive on a highway. The speed limit in the most used highway where I live is 70. I usually go at least 80 if not more than that, because the state is extremely beautiful and there are so many good things to see and do. I get frustrated enough driving at that speed limit as it is (70 mph) for general safety reasons but never while going over that mark. Why? Because of this: When you exceed your speed limit, your car's engine revs faster, which means that air begins to flow into the intake manifold, causing more exhaust gas to be produced. This causes an increase in power and torque, making your car accelerate rapidly, which can result in you losing control or being caught by a tractor trailer. It seems like an obvious reason why a driver would want to maintain their speed limit until they reach it! But no one does! Now, let me ask this question... Why don't people who go too fast to travel at 70mph use cruise control instead of speeding up? Here comes my point! I believe that many drivers think they have better control with cruise control and do not realize how much damage it could cause them if they were to lose control suddenly. Cruise control uses a computer to constantly monitor what speed you're traveling at and adjusts it to keep it within specified limits. If you allow the computer to adjust itself rather than using the hand controls on the steering wheel, then you risk compromising your own reaction time and possibly losing control of the vehicle altogether! (Although, accidents due to this type of condition are rare, nonetheless). So now back to my original question about why we don't speed on highways above the speed limit. Fortunately, I started my answer with the reason why we shouldn't even do that. I've got some great tips from other sources below that will hopefully help you avoid getting caught if you do happen to speed past the posted speed limit andor exceed its maximum capability.
