This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are! Juveniles are given special attention in Academia because they make people think of them and relate very differently than adults who have parents or other family members who cannot handle it successfully (although they often do). I'm afraid that if parents were to move away from their children's homeschooling habits there would be a lot more difficult for children now as they would need to learn again before school started up again soon enough.
