So, one thing that I have to preface this with is that I see both (all) sexes as equal, outside of a few natural sexual dimorphisms (Genitalia, ability to have children). However, there are also some social issues. When you say "some" do you mean all? If so then why did it take 50 years for the NFL and MLB etc...to allow women in them respectively at the same level as men when they were already allowed into college athletics on an equivalent basis since 1971??
