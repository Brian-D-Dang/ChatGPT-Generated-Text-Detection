You may have seen news that BlackLivesMatter protesters interrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Seattle. I think this was wrong to do, because he has fought for civil rights and fighting the racism of white supremacists is something that we should all stand up for. But here's why my point about the Bernie SandersMartin O'Malley issue came true anyway: Sanders supports Mark Zuckerberg as CEO of Facebook (Zuck knows how to fight the good fight against hate). The Trump campaign is taking advantage of these divisions between progressives and conservatives, making it easier for them to demonize the other side by saying one thing while doing another.
