Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be "free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean companies and organisations should allow what they don't want on their platform." Where did that idea come from? Well, a few years ago some UK judges decided that 'common law' had been abolished in this country because Parliament hadn't expressly legislated for every instance where common sense applied. So now, no matter how obvious something might seem (like your employer not allowing racist abuse) there's actually nothing in the law about it at all! Yes...it really happened - we're living through Orwellian times folks. In short: as far as Big Tech goes- if you think they are violating freedom of expression then just get government involved. That way, instead of being sued by Facebook or Twitter when others use them to break laws like incitement to violence - -they'll simply be fined into oblivion until they do censor more effectively. And those fines aren't trivial either....as I've said before -I'm pretty sure Google alone has enough cash reserves to pay off Congress with interest - so censorship would have little effect anyway except perhaps make certain outlets even less profitable than they already are (which probably isn't going to happen).
