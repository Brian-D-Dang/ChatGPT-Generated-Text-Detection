Edit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) This isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a little crazy. Maybe I'm just a sucker for cute animals. Cecil the lion was just one of those. It was like the world was crying. I have to admit though, I was one of those people who had a complete dislike for the zoo because of what they do. I'm not a fan of cages. I'm not a fan of inbreeding. I'm not a fan of raising animals for food. I do eat meat but I have never been a big fan of it. It is a big part of our human diet and I understand that. I just don't think it's necessary. I was one of those people who didn't eat much meat when I was a kid because I didn't like the taste and I hated to see all those animals being slaughtered. I didn't become a vegetarian until I was around 30, so it was after I had kids. I don't think it's healthy for them to eat that much meat, so I made the choice to eat it myself and not have it around my kids. I know I can't control what they eat, but I can control what I put in my body. At the moment, I'm not a huge meat eater. I'm more of a vegetarian. I'm not afraid to eat meat, I just don't like the taste. I don't like to see animals mistreated. I don't like to see them killed, but I don't think it's necessary to go out and kill an animal just to eat it. I know there are plenty of other options to get enough protein. I just hate to see animals be inbred or get shoved into cages. Even caged animals. I have a huge dislike for zoos. I don't like the idea of it. I will never go to a zoo again. I know there are people who love it. I'm sure it is a wonderful experience for some people. I just don't like it. Eating meat is not the only way to get protein. And I'm not talking just about humans. I would be willing to bet that most of the people who hunt or eat meat at the grocery store had never seen an animal slaughtered. The truth is that most people in this country don't understand the difference between animals that are raised and slaughtered for food and the animals that are pets and companion animals. I have never hunted, and I have never eaten meat. I do not own a dog, and I am not a cat person. I am a horse person. And I have raised animals to be slaughtered for food. It was a part of my life and the life of my family. My father and grandfather were farmers. My husband's grandfather was a farmer. We had chickens, geese, ducks, cows, pigs, rabbits, sheep, goats, and one horse. We sold our produce at a local farmers market and at the grocery stores. I spent my childhood milking cows, feeding pigs, and branding calves. My children spent their childhoods doing the same. The animals we raised were not pets. They were animals that were bred and raised for food. They were animals that we had to kill to use their meat. I have always eaten what I raised. We ate the eggs from the chickens and the goose eggs. We ate the meat from the pigs and the cattle and the sheep. We used the feathers from the ducks and the geese. We used the wool from the sheep. The only animals that we did not eat were the ones that were in the horse family. My mother raised Arabians and American quarter horses, and my husband rode a quarter horse. We ate horses as food. I don't like the idea of eating a horse that is related to a pet that has a horse like personality. We would not have bought a horse if we did not intend to eat the horse. My mother raised her horses for breeding and as a hobby. We were not breeding our horses for food. I have to admit though, I was one of those people who had a complete dislike for the zoo because of what they do. I'm not a fan of cages. I'm not a fan of inbreeding. I'm not a fan of raising animals for food. I do eat meat
