(hello Mr Trump) But also to economic and political difficulties and unemployment, which are written out of history as a result of wars and the rise of populism."

Trump's comments were echoed by economists who say they expect the country will be well-positioned for years ahead, with the German economy having grown 8 percent in manufacturing since 1999. The Washington Post has predicted Germany's economy will expand at a rate of 2.7 percent this year to 3.8 percent next year, as the coronavirus pandemic rages in Europe.
