So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern societies are built on the foundation of laws and regulations, and it's important to ensure that those laws and regulations are respected and enforced. Allowing for too much leniency in regards to immigration could potentially create a number of issues such as overcrowding, economic strain, and security risks. Therefore, I believe that it is important to take a conservative approach to immigration policy and enforce existing laws while also developing new ones when necessary.
