First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue with actual infrastructure and not just cars passing by. I think a lot of people have the impression that a large portion of our traffic comes from walking through downtown. Driving is really bad in these parts as compared to other cities in general. San Francisco and Nashville are notorious for being the worst places to walk if you're looking to take a vacationdo some shopping. It seems like we get more parking than most cities in America though (could be wrong). There's something about having something so small and nothing much else going on in the city that makes it hard to find an alternative to driving. It's also fun to go out in the middle of the night without any distractions, so no one needs to worry about getting lost or losing their job while they're doing so! There's definitely a "slow nervous zone" in Austin right now - everything seems to be moving faster but they seem quite slow. I've never been to Austin before - what kind of day would you say is your favorite? My wife and I live there too and love it there. And when she goes out maybe we'll see her lunch and dinner both great options. We actually recently got married here (at the time) and it was very nice. But I have to admit: I'm enjoying my job less because absolutely no one wants to drive either way, since it feels like everyone knows where we are going. Thanks for taking the time to read my post and thanks again for sharing your experience of Austin. You guys make me realize that we might want to try walking around instead of driving. The city looks so cool and different from the supermarket shopping malls and big box stores outside. I only started planning on visiting Austin after I moved back home; however, I am interested in exploring more of the area. I'm a bit new to this too. I suppose Portland had the better choice- I guess not. If that matters to you then I hope I could reconsider walking to work on Friday morning!
