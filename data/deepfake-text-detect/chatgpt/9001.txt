Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make sure that there are those who go into public school at the higher level than they do. But that's not the issue herethe issue is why we're not getting more educated people. And how can you tell whether a person is going to be successful if he doesn't have enough education? Because some of these people get passed up because they've never been educated. Some of them just don't have qualifications for jobs, or schools at all, or can't afford them. It's just that when it comes down to it, maybe people shouldn't even be able to talk about college because it's so expensive. Especially since there are thousands of options available out there. There are almost no middle-class Americans with college degrees today. You'd think by now we had universities where everyone would learn English and be strong because so many of us have our own way of doing things. But we won't. That's what's really driving me right along, and it's nothing but silver lining." An alternate view on average college rates has increased dramatically over the past year: Up from 15 percent in February 2010 to 17 percent last month. In March 2011, the rising rate was 11 percent which means it actually increased by four points. Indeed, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the increase in college graduation rates among college graduates nationwide (from 6 last May to 12.9) led to an 11.4 percentage point growth rate among college graduates. How do you explain the jump in college graduation rates among college grads? Well, one thing is certain: More students means more money. One explanation: A lot of the young people we see on TV and movies don't seem to realize that their colleges and universities will provide them with plenty of financial aid. Let's take a look at a few examples. 1) Harvard University graduate Una Pertempel, 22, went into the bachelor's degree program at Yale in 1991, after graduating from college. She earned 33 million a year, studying English language arts and literature. After finishing her undergrad, she transferred to the Department of Psychology, receiving 150,000 in scholarships. She then starred in "Driller," which was directed by Pedro Almodovar A beautiful woman told a man that his secrets were hidden in 1995 starring Paul Bettany and Michael Douglas. Her performance was praised by critics. 2) Harvard students routinely joke about the university's campus as the "Jimmy Kimmel of Harvard" and "The OC" of college, but their plans to attend universities elsewhere never materialize. While Princeton scholars are more likely to find the Ivy League campus attractive compared to other top universities, only two of its competitors, Stanford and Georgetown, ever accredited. According to his paper, Donald Trump's Harvard classmates are "more likely to believe that the University of California, Berkeley and MIT are too liberal than Yale, with considerably lower academic achievement levels.citation needed] 3) Harvard students regularly joke about the lack of diversity within the university, particularly in the wake of the disastrous admissions scandal that resulted in the firing of President Bill Clinton. This led to the resignation of three well-known professors in 1996 including Aristotle Achir, a professor of history and political science, and Bertrand Russell, a professor of law and economics. Their retirement licenses became invalidated days later.[citation needed] 4) Harvard graduates often claim to enjoy a better job on their resumes due to having more experience working at the highest level. However, when asked to list their best work experiences, 41 percent said they had at least another 4 or 5 years of employment at the same employer. 5) Notably absent from any of the study's findings was any indication of median wage increases during this time period. These figures highlight the problems with finding study participants. Most studies show that most workers opt for modest salaries over large pay boosts. As a result, around one third of researchers say that their current salaries are insufficiently competitive. Many of the candidates also frequently complain that their salary does not match their previous pay, because factors such as age, working history, and education status mean that employers cannot easily predict career changes, according to the Center for American Progress. 6) Chinese students in particular continue to come under criticism of recent studies suggesting that the rise of China's student debt has affected the country's general economic situation. Such anecdotes are related to a study conducted by economists Zhu Yunui and Jiang Yang, titled "Falling Student Debt": This article appears in print on October 24, 2012, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline, "Hiring Policy Hits Higher Levels of Recession," and reads as follows: "Chinese Students Are At Risk For Great Neglect."
