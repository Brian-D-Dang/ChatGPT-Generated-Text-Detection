Sorry, this is mostly applicable to folks from the US, but feel free to weigh in no matter what. I'll bullet-point for my reasoning: More good folks are killed via gunshot every day in the US than in any other country in the world. The last person I would want to trust with a firearm is someone who is incredibly angry, depressed, or both. I'm fine with guns when they are used for hunting and other such purposes, but I'm not going to stand for more gun-related deaths, and I'm damned sure not going to stand for more gun-related suicides. This is not an anti-gun screed. I'm not against guns, I'm against weapons that have no place in civilian hands. I'm glad you mentioned this because I was going to bring it up. I hate guns. They're not my thing at all. But I do think that they have a place. I'm a hunter. I own guns. I enjoy shooting them. I'm not going to be a good shot without them. I'm not going to be able to teach my children (or anyone else) how to be good shots without them. My guns are not going to end up in the hands of someone who will use them against me or against someone I know. I keep them locked up, and I keep them away from my kids. They're not a toy, and I'm not a responsible gun owner if I keep them within my children's reach. I believe in the Second Amendment and I believe that it is an individual right. I also believe that the right to keep and bear arms must be balanced against the right to live free of gun violence. I'm not sure that everyone who owns a gun should be licensed, but I do think that there should be something to prevent guns from falling into the hands of bad people. I'm sure that's too much to ask. I'm with you, but I'm not sure you're going to get it. At least not from most of the gun owners that will read this. I'm a gun owner, too, but not a hunter. I own a couple of guns, but only have a handful of shells for them, mostly because I know I'm not going to use them. I have no problem with gun laws, but I think the people who are proposing them are trying to go about it the wrong way. I have a friend who is a liberal. He has a gun, but he's never actually shot it. He's never even seen the inside of a firing range. I don't think he knows how to load it. Yet, he wants to own it for protection. I think the law should require training and licensing for gun ownership. I'm not sure I would support a licensing system either. I don't think that's the answer. I just think it needs to be much harder to obtain a gun. I'm not against licensing, but I think that if a licensing system were put in place, people would still be able to acquire guns illegally. I don't know what the answer is. I just know I'm tired of people being killed and maimed. If there's a way to end this, I'm all for it. I think it would be very helpful if we could somehow keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill people. I would be all for licensing and training. I just don't see how it would stop the illegal sales. It's a lot easier to get guns illegally than it is to get alcohol or cigarettes. I'm a gun owner too, but I have no desire to own one for personal protection. I really don't think a gun is the best answer. I don't think you can stop guns from ending up in the hands of people who shouldn't have them. It happens all the time, and people get away with it. I don't think that guns are the answer, but I think the answer is somewhere in the middle. There are already so many guns out there, and it would be hard to get them all out of circulation. I think we need to take steps to prevent people from getting guns, but we also need to take steps to keep guns out of the hands of those who are going to do the killing. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this. I don't have the answer, but I do think we need to do something. I think it's going to take a lot of work.
