(A) Work part-time in high school; Then go to college (B) Work full-time before you go to college (C) Work while you study in college. I was a spoiled lazy child. I was born in the USA, where many people can have everything they need easily. We even have McDonald's, KFC and other fast food restaurants. We don't need to learn how to cook or how to make our clothes. We can do those things in our free time. We have no idea about the life in other countries. For example, I watched a movie in which a Vietnamese woman lived in the United States. She couldn't buy clothes in the United States because she could not speak English. She had to make clothes by herself. She could not buy food because she could not speak English and go to the supermarket. The things we have are all provided by our parents. Most of us don't need to have a part-time job. We don't know how hard it is to work for a living. Many of us don't know how hard it is to work for a living.
