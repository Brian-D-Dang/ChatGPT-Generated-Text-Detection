Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as an oddball, then you might be able to see the kind of content coming out of it but people will ask for it anyway (unless they're on a little more technical sub-reddit). I think he's trying to make this argument that clickbait is too much like a foreign language. It's not really a foreign language.
