Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the attack is fatal and these stories leave us wondering how long it would take for you to become part of that statistic... To find this answer, I decided to do some basic statistical analysis on two large data sets: The National Park Service's "Bear Attack Files" from the period; and the USGS's records for national parks across America during the same time frame. From those numbers, I was able to determine what percentage of hikers even got close enough in proximity with bears to be considered at risk for being mauled - which leads me towards my first conclusion. Hikers don't get close enough to bears to have much concern! In fact, only 2 (or approximately 20 people per year) were killed by bears between 1981 - 1986 when the NPS began tracking such statistics. Not exactly reassuring reading but let's dig deeper into why it might actually be more likely for you to die on your morning commute than getting eaten alive by a black bear. First off, we need to ask ourselves where many visitors hike these days compared to decades ago.... It seems like most popular trails within National Parks now start along paved roads rather than having backcountry access - especially in Yosemite National park. This means there isn't as much potential wilderness experience going on as once upon a time. You can see here that human traffic has increased substantially over recent years according to park visitation rates: It takes a lot less distance for our species to travel around today then it did 40 years ago. We live in smaller areas than we used too. As such, fewer bears come into contact with humans if we stay put inside cities townships. For example, consider the famous grizzly who ate a woman named Phyllis Marie Manley near Glacier National Park last summer. She had been hiking alone just down stream from her camp site on Twin Falls Creek Trail and apparently walked right up to him without realizing he was there. He shook his head vigorously multiple times before finally attacking in order to defend himself against any perceived threats due to her erratic behavior. Nowadays, she wouldn't have anywhere near as big of a problem because in town, we won't walk straight through their territory checking every tree trunk in the way. On top of all that, local news reported that Lake McDonald Lodge issued stricter guidelines after the incident warning guests not to approach bears unless absolutely necessary. Bear attacks aren't nearly as common anymore as one may think despite frequent reports of them occurring. If anything, the number of attacks has gone down since 2006 based on both official government sources as well as personal observations within the naturalist community. Given that population growth has done nothing but increase exponentially since 1978, we should expect a reduction in any type of wildlife conflict whether its with bears, cougars etc.. Second, if you really want to know how far away you should keep yourself from bears, watch nature programs instead of modern television shows like Survivorman. While Survivorman certainly does represent reality in certain aspects, it also tends to highlight the worst case scenarios possible. Even though bears will occasionally bluff charge towards camera crews in hopes something gets scared and runs away quickly, most instances involve making direct eye contact with bears and remaining motionless while taking occasional pictures afterwards. If you look closely enough behind scenes footage on TV shows, chances are you will notice virtually no bystanders ever witnessing the actual confrontation other than owners and filmmakers themselves. They interview experts later on and sometimes show graphic images of severe injuries, but rarely a bystander makes physical contact with a bear unlike real life encounters where often times spectators act directly toward animals forcing them into situations where they feel the urge to fight back. Finally, most folks involved in bear studies agree that bears are becoming increasingly comfortable living alongside humans. Habitat destruction and loss of food supply drives bears into denser populated places in search of nourishment. Bear populations tend to double each decade and this phenomenon becomes apparent early on within the first few weeks of spring every year. Males begin competing for mates around April 15th and mark their territories aggressively to make sure females know where they stand within the hierarchy. By mid-May or shortly thereafter depending on latitude, mothers emerge from hibernation hungry for breakfast and encounter males vying for dominance. Bears rarely go beyond single digit body weights so it naturally escalates until one male gets injured resulting in another coming forward looking for love. Normally, these interactions play itself out quite peacefully and bears generally avoid full fledged estrus cycles that result in violent clashes between competitors. However, if for whatever reason bears run out of easy meals, things change dramatically very fast. Once again, bear managers have learned to monitor wildlife activity using remote sensing technology and found bears spending more time hanging out along roadways searching garbage cans for smelly leftovers. Two incidents recently occurred on highways in Montana involving bears eating ...,....... The,. can study Director, with happen seeking. present to for
