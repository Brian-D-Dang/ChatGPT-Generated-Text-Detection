If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available for human workers. This means that a smaller population will be better able to sustain itself without excessive competition for jobs and resources. Additionally, with fewer people consuming resources, there may be less strain on the environment and ecosystems, which could improve overall quality of life for those who remain. However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and cultural implications of intentionally reducing population numbers. Ultimately, finding a balance between population growth and sustainable resource use is key to ensuring a brighter future for all.
