First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean we should see it on every channel just because its erotica or art (which is what most people would argue "justified" the scenes in question). I agree there are pornographic images out their but for example prostitutes walking down your street isn't going to turn me into an addict any more than seeing six year old girls dancing nasty at some club will make you rape them when older - both of these things can be seen as sexualised imagery by those who want too - this however does have no relevance beyond entertainment which means barring such material from TV where children may watch makes sense...
