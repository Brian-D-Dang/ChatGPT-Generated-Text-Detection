I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. I want nothing more than the ability as an American citizen that my rights will be protected by this government (and not just mine but those of millions like myself). But scarily enough it seems everything goes against what is best interest from all angles when chosing one party over another: marriage equality or civil unions? Should we have children needlessly being born into poverty because their parents can afford them if they choose life insurance instead which would benefit society better at large then taking out thousands upon hundreds every year through welfare while paying taxes higher overall causing inflation throughout our economy so much worse off everyone else including future generations with less money available today; should women even allowed abortion although most people agree having sex shouldn't result anything other childbirth anyway...etc etc ad nauseum..
