The likes of ratheism argue that most of the world's problems come from religion, and that a post-religion world would be miles better. As humans, we inherently drive ourselves into a corner by our faith in God rather than to Jesus Christ, but the problem is not with religion alone, but with other religions as well. According to Joana Szekelyanovitch's book "Behind the Scenes: Religion, Philosophy, and Society," Christianity and Islam are the two most prominent religions worldwide today. The similarities between Christianity and Islam involve differences within one religion. For example, in Christian traditions, Christians use the word 'Christian' instead of 'Islam', to describe their religious beliefs outside Islam. Muslim scholars consider this reflection against Christianity and Islam as heresy. Muslims must adopt modern practices to support Islamic beliefs. These auteurs have also become more critical about teaching history to children. In addition, they believe that many in Islam respect the teachings of Mohammed, who was the head of Egypt's second dynasty, the Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) at some point during his reign. Although these traditional values seem to have been influenced by human-Muslim relations, they face serious issues due to the fact that religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism do not exist in Muslim countries and that Islam has grown over time. Far too often, religions which were based on belief in Allah or other gods have turned out to be dangerous for society. In order to enforce its own beliefs in order to protect its adherents, Islam is often used as a weapon against people for whom it does not belong. In the West, Christianity is preferred over Islam in terms of morality. Indeed, nearly all Westerners say that the only way they will ever find an evangelical church is through religion, while in Asia they practice traditional Christianity. Islam is the West's largest religion, with almost three times as many followers as Christianity, rising to more than three billion adherents each year. Since atheism is considered the accepted religion of the West, it is frequently accompanied with bizarre statements that restrict its followership; however, some of them even suggest that religion should be discouraged if Christians are once again allowed to worship. In the United States, Muslims increasingly express hostility toward women and take issue with President Donald Trump calling women "sluts." But there are still millions of Muslims across the globe who just want to replace Christianity with Islam. This is because in the past millions had long believed that Islam was real. Today, groupings like Democratic Party members threaten that Muslims will no longer accept Christianity. Indeed, the Quran says "all men shall inherit earth" and that "there shall be no man except the LORD" (Quran 3:8). While both Islamics and Americans know that the West cannot tolerate any kind of violence or hatred against anyone else, it seems that there is no place in Islam for such brutality and hate - despite claims made by the West that it upholds the tradition of Islam - and it appears significant that Americans don't feel the need to speak up for themselves against foreign interference. Most Americans understand and hope that Western leaders will change their ways. However, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Syria illustrates how deeply divided America hopes to hold together with its allies. After months of fighting over whether Iran would breach the ceasefire signed last September between Israel and Hezbollah, and amid fears that Hamas could attack Israeli settlements, the Obama administration undertook steps to prevent further escalation. The program included sending supplies from US military bases west of Jerusalem and implementing sanctions. When asked what he thought of the recent decision, Mr. Netanyahu said "It was unacceptable. It was very disturbing. The behavior of the Israelis is very clear and unequivocal." He added, "We realize that we want a solution that respects the rights of every Palestinian person." But what exactly did he mean? According to senior US officials, it wasn't enough to show that Palestinians were willing to compromise to achieve peace: They needed to establish "safe haven" and provide temporary refuge in Gaza and Yemen before a new conflict can begin. On the contrary, what was required is "no prolonged war in Gaza and Yemen." Under these conditions, it appeared that Israel might eventually reach agreement with the US. But only after four years of negotiations, with little international reaction, was Israel able to agree to leave Jerusalem. What has happened since then remains unclear. When we first heard of the UN Security Council meeting in Vienna, we immediately assumed that the participants would oppose any attempt to resolve the crisis peacefully through talks. Yet, the next day the council decided to postpone the meeting until later next week when, in light of the humanitarian situation and the growing threat posed by Iranian nuclear weapons, the UN Security Council agreed to stop the conference. Considerably less enthusiastic is Mr. Netanyahu's claim that there has been no progress on the resolution. At least six states have already voiced objections to the European Union's efforts to block the vote resulting in a veto power over the motion. And President Trump has gone so far as to declare that he is "prepared" to withdraw all US troops from Iraq al bin soft group groups...They and - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
