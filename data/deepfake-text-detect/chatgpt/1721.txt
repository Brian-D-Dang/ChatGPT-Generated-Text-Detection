Edit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) This isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a little bit psychopathic....just my opinion, no high horse riding here! They're an easy target because they are not used to being around humans and often think we are actually predators.
