I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton says she wants to "unleash the power of Black Lives Matter" and give the group the resources it needs to fight racial profiling by law enforcement. "It's important that we have the best possible policies in place to deal with issues like this," she told CNN's AC360 on Monday night. "We cannot run a country where one group of people is treated as second-class citizens because of the color of their skin." Clinton says she wants to make the issue a top priority by supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. She's joined by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who has endorsed Clinton for president.
