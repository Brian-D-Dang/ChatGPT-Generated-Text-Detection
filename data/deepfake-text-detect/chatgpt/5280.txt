Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for feminists here in the world of feminism because it got me so angry with regards to my own opinions on everything but as we were talking about these things proves that most just don't want to hear anything other than what they think either way you should be hearing or feeling guilty about something negative (that includes women). And then there are all kinds of straight up sexism though...
