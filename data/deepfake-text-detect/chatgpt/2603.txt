tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to my team, the New York Yankees or Giants (not at the same time), I'm usually tuned in. It seems like everyone is talking about how much fun playoff baseball is and can understand why after watching an entire long hard fought season a lot of people want for more than 1 series worth of excitement before they're done with their favorite sport. I get what your saying but just because someone enjoys something different from you doesn't make them any less passionate.
