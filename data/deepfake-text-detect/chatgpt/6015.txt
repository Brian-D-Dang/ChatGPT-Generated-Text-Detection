I should caveat that I'm talking about these terms as applied to humans not plants, nonhuman animals, or electronic devices. And by "socially-sanctioned," I mean a definition broadly acceptable to most people. I don't mean to suggest that I think that every definition of these terms is good. I'm also not trying to be polemical here. I'm trying to do a bit of deconstruction and introspection. I'm not a moral relativist, but I do think there are a lot of unexamined assumptions when it comes to what makes a thing "human." I'm going to start by taking the easiest one. I think it's fairly clear what humans are, and that humans are what makes a thing human. How do we define human, however? We tend to define humans by our biology and behavior. We define humans as mammals, we define humans as homo sapiens. We're also told that we're defined by our rationality, as opposed to our instincts. There are a lot of reasons why we're told that. One of them is that we want to be able to have rational discussions about what humans are, what rights they have, and what ethical standards we should apply to them. We want to be able to have rational discussions about whether a human being is a person, and what that means. The problem is, the definitions we have for human don't seem to fit. You see, we also define humans by our biology and behavior. We define humans as homo sapiens. But this means we're defining humans by what makes us human, which seems a little circular. We also define humans by their rationality. But we don't define humans as animals with rationality, we define humans as humans with rationality. Again, this seems a little circular. So the way we're defining humans doesn't fit with the way we're defining being human. Which raises the question of whether we have the right definitions in the first place. When it comes to humans, we seem to want to have it both ways. We want to say that humans are defined by their biology and behavior, but also by their rationality. It's not that we don't talk about this, it's that we don't seem to be aware of it. We talk about humans as if they're an entity, but we don't really think about what that means. The way we usually talk about humans is as if they were a single thing, and not as if we were talking about the definition of human. When we do talk about the definition of human, we do it with the definitions I mentioned above. But we don't seem to think about what it means to define human as a single thing. We're also told that we need to have a definition of human, because we need to have a definition of person. A person is a human being that is considered a person. Except, this still doesn't actually define a person. It just says that you have to be a human being that is considered a person. And then we get into things like what it means to be considered a person. And that opens up an entirely new can of worms. At least, it's a new can of worms for me. Because I've never really thought about it. And I'm not just talking about our current political climate. I'm talking about how we have a definition of a person. And it's one that's based on some pretty arbitrary definitions. We define humans as rational animals, we define humans as animals with rationality. We define humans as mammals, we define humans as homo sapiens. We define humans as creatures that experience pain, we define humans as animals with pain. We don't define humans as living things. We don't define humans as creatures that can breathe. We don't define humans as creatures that can see. We define humans as rational animals, we define humans as animals with rationality. When we say a human is a person, what do we mean? I think it's pretty clear that we're not really using the word "person" in the sense that it was used in the 17th century. It's pretty clear that we're not using the word "person" in the sense that it was used in the 19th century. I think what we mean is that a human is a person if we consider them to be a person. And here's the thing, we never really think about what that means. We never really think about why we consider a human being to be a
