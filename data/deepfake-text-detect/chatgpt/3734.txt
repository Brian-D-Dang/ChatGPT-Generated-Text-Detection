EDIT: a portion of replies I'm getting are focused on the defination of'libertarian' and the rainbow of american groups that claim it for their particular beliefs. If in doubt, replace'libertarian' Understood, I will avoid using the term "libertarian" and use more specific language to accurately convey the intended meaning. How can I assist you?
