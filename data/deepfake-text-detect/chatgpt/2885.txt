I've been pursuing a lot of scholarships and one of the things that irritate me is that there are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my credit score. Granted, I don't qualify for some because they have specific geographical restrictions or only provide funding for people in high school, but it's still irritating. Oh man. My spouse did college loans for years before we got married (in his case) and he had so many stories about how crappy their practices were regarding this very topic!
