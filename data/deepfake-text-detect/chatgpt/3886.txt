Not trying to start a flame war, I'm looking for a new tablet and I would consider an ipad, but I just don't see the appeal just yet. What on earth is wrong with me? The iPad has all of the advantages that the current generation of tablets have (iPod touch), it has more space than most other tablets could ever hope to offer in terms of the storage options they fill up, it's easier to use from a distance rather than pecking at your keyboard or phone, its screen is larger, and its battery life lasts longer than almost any other machine you can buy.
