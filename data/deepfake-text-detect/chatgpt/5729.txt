I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say "entertainment," but I think it's more than just that. Most works of literature have a purpose, or some kind of moral to it, or at least it's supposed to have. I think the main purpose of literature is to teach. Now, it doesn't have to teach everything, but it should teach the reader something. There are some things in books that are unrealistic, and for the purpose of entertainment. But it's still important to learn from books, even if the writing is in the fictional style. I've read books where I feel like I learn a lot, where I learn what's morally wrong, and what's morally right. It's interesting to see how things happen in books, and how people act in the situations in books, and how I'd react to those situations. I think that books aren't just for entertainment, but they're to teach the reader something, which can help himher in the future. You can learn different things from different books, and you can learn different things from the same book. I've learned a lot from books, and I think you can too. Labels: books, entertainment, fiction, life, literature, morals, teaching I agree that books have a purpose, and that purpose isn't just to entertain us. It's good to learn from books. I love reading books! I love learning from books, and even just the act of reading. Awesome! I love to read books too. I think it's great.
