While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, it is important to recognize that the actions of the McKinney TX police were clearly over the top. The officer in question used excessive force against unarmed teenagers, tasing one and throwing another to the ground. Additionally, these teenagers were not displaying any violent behavior and were simply attending a pool party. The officer's behavior is inconsistent with the principles of proper policing, which include protecting citizens, using minimal force when necessary, and upholding the constitutional rights of all individuals. The police officer's actions were unquestionably excessive, and it is important that we hold police officers accountable when they violate policy and engage in unacceptable behavior.
