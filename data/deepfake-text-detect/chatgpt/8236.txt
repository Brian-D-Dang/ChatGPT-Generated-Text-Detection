First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" has. But we should fight for an egalitarian society anyway - because if there are inequalities in this world when you die they will be equal too (unless hell exists!). That said...well done to all those writing about privilege! It does take someone who sees themselves as not privileged enough standing up against their own entrenched privileges from being able-bodied white men....not just recognizing but actively fighting them....and then convincing others-including other abled bodswhite folk...that maybe things need changing afterall .....what could possibly go wrong?giggle.
