I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before he became famous. However, his fame is largely due to his appearances on TV shows like Bill Nye the Science Guy. His popularity there was mainly due to his enthusiasm and charisma, not necessarily his scientific knowledge or achievements. Nye has done a lot of good in communicating science to younger generations, however it's important to remember that he is not a traditional scientist. He does not have a scientific degree, nor does he work for a university or research institution. He is an entertainer and educator, and as such, his public perception should be based more on his ability to make science exciting and accessible, rather than his actual scientific credentials.
