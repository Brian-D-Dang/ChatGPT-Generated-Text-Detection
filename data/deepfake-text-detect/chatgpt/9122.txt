I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several dogs and when they were young they would join me at the vet to get checked on before going out in public... It's like we've never been there, not once. Yeah, I was just thinking that if I owned it, it wouldn't do anything, but since we don't hunt we might as well put all our eggs in one basket.
