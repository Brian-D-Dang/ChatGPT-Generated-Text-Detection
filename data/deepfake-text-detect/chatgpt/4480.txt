Let me start off by stating what I believe the reddit basic income theory is. From what I have read from rbasicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society there will be no scarcity of resources or jobs and therefore everyone can live comfortably on this sum (or fraction thereof). This would mean that people could afford to pursue their interests without having to worry about earning enough money. In fact one might even say all problems with poverty etc are solved once we get rid of the need for work altogether through automation and other methods. (I am not sure if this really solves anything though) But it also means you don't necessarily want to pay out your GDP per capita but rather how much you think should each individual person receive? Now on to my first objection which essentially boils down to "how do you enforce that?" The whole point behind an UBI scheme seems to be that those who cause externalities like pollution or produce goodsservices beyond their capacity actually end up being taxed more than others. This is fine as long as someone else takes care of them. Either they move away from the area where these things happen (and then you risk losing important benefits), or you find another way around it and tax accordingly. Since most of us aren't going to voluntarily move far away, something needs to be done about this situation. The obvious solution to simply raise taxes too high, doesn't seem viable since it sounds bad politically at least. It's almost certainly better for business when certain areas become less attractive because the overall cost of living goes up due to taxation instead of just moving elsewhere. And furthermore raising taxes will probably make us poorer over time - a rising tide lifts all boats right? Well maybe except ours. We would still lose out from the decreased competitiveness of our economy compared to places which lack those kinds of burdensome costs. There has been many studies showing exactly this kind of result. So unless we were willing to sacrifice growth, we'd either end up paying twice as much later, or we'll have some nasty consequences. Of course while such a policy may indeed look good on paper now, it wouldn't stand the test of time very well. Especially considering taxes can only go so high before you reach diminishing returns... Or perhaps we're arguing about the wrong problem..? Maybe we should instead focus more on making technological progress sustainable? Instead of taxing polluters for example, why not try to create cleaner alternatives so we won't need to penalize those who choose to use dangerous technology? That feels like much more useful thinking to me. Okay okay, let's address the question of enforcement. How does one ensure that people put aside extra resources towards higher quality healthcare etc? If this was already happening anyway perhaps we shouldn't bother? Before we went into universal health coverage Sweden used to have pretty miserable rates of heart disease and cancer. Now however due to improved access to medical services, suddenly life expectancy hasn't increased anywhere near as fast as expected over the past few decades. Even countries which had poor levels of coverage saw similarly huge improvements thanks to mostly non-profit providers offering efficient treatments in place of the current insurance system which often forces doctors to opt for cheaper solutions. Seems like reformers here haven't thought deeply enough into ways to prevent premiums from skyrocketing once competition comes along. Unless we're saying that competition isn't really needed after all?!? Oh wait never mind there they go again! Competition IS necessary for free markets to function properly! Yes yes, you're absolutely correct any market failure must be fixed via central planning!. Thanks for clearing that up for us! Why did they forget to mention that earlier didn't they?? Ah well. Back to topic: Can we trust the private sector to take responsibility for fixing its own mistakes? Until recently the US government wasn't interested in finding out whether health insurers provide adequate service. They've found information indicating otherwise, but it came during Obama times. To date, the federal government still doesn't know whether Americans' expectations regarding treatment are realistic given how low provider reimbursements tend to be under Obamacare. Wasn't it the Republicans fault?!? Nooo not really, heheh sorry. Anyway, regardless; it doesn't matter that we CAN fix stuff ourselves. Because we can't. At best we end up spending the same amount of money on basically useless bureaucrats and politicians to solve issues. But worse yet, in practice it turns out that you can't force people to behave like rational actors. You see the majority of cases where there is significant disagreement between public opinion polls and reality involve situations where people actively lie about themselves to conform. Forcing people to follow laws to stay out of jail often causes large groups to collectively ignore said law, especially members of minority communities whose residents have different cultural norms. On top of this, political power brokers can easily game existing rules to wage war against their opponents and thus increase the number of casualties among the masses. Remember, the original intent of using disposable human bodies for cheap labor was more to subsidise industry than to fight wars, and thus the industrial revolution suffered from excessively high death rate attributed to a great thermo-probability.
