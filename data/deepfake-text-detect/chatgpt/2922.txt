Firstly, I'm using a throwaway because most people get really sensitive about this and my views are pretty much the antithesis of reddit (love Rand Paul, support Mens Rights, hate abortion) but anyways... When can we stop pretending that when you don't like something its automatically racistsexist? The problem is not all criticism is constructive. A lot is very vague or simply wrong. Some people even go so far as to claim facts aren't "real." This isn't true at all.
