Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not the product, but I can't help but feel that the more you tip, the more you are just encouraging them to provide better service. It's as if the tip is making up for the fact that you're paying more than you would in your home country. I understand that many places in the world have lower minimum wages. I know that people will argue that it's nice to be able to work a job where you can make a decent amount of money. I'm not disputing that. I am just saying that I have no problem with paying what's reasonable for what I get. Anyway, here's a list of some tips from around the world. Some of these are for 'good' service, some are for 'great' service, and some are for 'very good' service. I'm not sure what I'd even do if I were to get 'good' or 'very good' service. I'd probably give a "smile" and say thank you. So, a good service in Italy is 10 of the bill. Great service is 15. In Mexico, a good service is 10 of the bill. Great service is 15.
