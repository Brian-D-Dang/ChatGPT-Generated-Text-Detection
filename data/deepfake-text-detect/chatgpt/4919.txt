I'm a young, college educated, bisexual woman who needs contraceptives for medical reasons and who doesn't believe in God. The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. I'd like to explain why. It is easy enough to understand why things don't work out the Republican way I find it hard not to agree with this statement... I could see how explaining some people might misinterpret this as an insult given the Republican party's stance against gay marriage
