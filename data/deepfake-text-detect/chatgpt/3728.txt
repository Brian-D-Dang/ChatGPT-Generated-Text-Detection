I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are influenced by Islamic customs, traditions and values. As a result, you may have grown up with certain cultural and religious norms. It's important to respect these norms when in Turkey and Dubai. In Turkey, the majority of people are Muslims, but the country is also secular, which means that there is a separation of religion and state. This means that while Islam is an important part of Turkish culture, the government does not enforce Islamic laws. However, it's still important to be respectful of the customs and traditions of the people you meet. In Dubai, Islam is the predominant religion, and the country is governed by Islamic law. This means that there are strict rules and regulations regarding dress code, public behavior, and social interactions. It's important to research and understand these rules before visiting Dubai to avoid any misunderstandings or cultural faux pas. Overall, it's important to be open-minded and willing to learn about the cultural and religious norms of the places you visit. By being respectful and observant of local customs, you can create a positive and memorable travel experience.
