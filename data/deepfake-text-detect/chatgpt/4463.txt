The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely than women to have their calls recorded as false alarms and unsubstantiated," she said. In 2011-12, 45 of all children were living with a single parent; by 2014 this had risen to 61. Men on average spend less time engaged with their kids and those figures don't tell you anything about how they behave during their visits. What we do know is that fathers' rights groups say there's an epidemic of fatherlessness among young people today, something that should be addressed rather than denied or ignored. There are many forces at work - from digital distractions to divorce rates - which can sideline dads for years after separating from mothers. This has damaging ripple effects not only for children but also relationships down the line, according to Dr Anne Winkler of University College London: "Children growing up without both parents will need support from schools - if it doesn't start early enough."
