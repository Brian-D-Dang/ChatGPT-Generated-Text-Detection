Hello. For a long time now I've felt that there are many people in hospitals and psychiatric homes who will never be able to function independently and will never work, but who are nonetheless in need of meaningful lives. I believe that care homes, which provide a safe and comfortable environment for those with mental health issues, can offer them a chance to make meaningful connections with others, take part in activities, and live a full life. By offering services such as social activities, counselling, and support for daily living tasks, these homes can give people an opportunity to enjoy life and have meaningful experiences.
