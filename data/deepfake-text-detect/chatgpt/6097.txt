As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is just a waste of money. I think that any parent that would spend this kind of money on a child that they know will not get better needs to think about their motives. Are you saying it's better to not spend the money and let the child die?
