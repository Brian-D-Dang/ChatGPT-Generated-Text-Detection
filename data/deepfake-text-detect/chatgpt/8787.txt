A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government). Losing an election does not mean losing. I suppose the reason he wants to run for office is because it would allow him to engage in the kinds of leadership structures that are necessary to ensure stability and cohesion in his party, so that if a certain candidate wins another election then they can be looked after as well. That was what he said about the political parties: "It is time to use our democratic institutions to facilitate and empower people who want us to do better." This alone will drive some of the more progressive policies I see in politics today but I expect them never end up being implemented. It is important we wait until elections to apply these principles to our electoral process.
