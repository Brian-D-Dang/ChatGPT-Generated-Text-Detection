Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by a set of strict logical criteria, all derived from rational thought alone (and thus empirically unverifiable). It's also an organising principle for modern society which puts forward both moral norms - such as "do not murder" or "don't steal," but also nonmoral ones like those required to run any business enterprise reasonably smoothly, e.g., "always keep promises." Hume argues in A Treatise Of Human Nature that this kind of thinking got well out ahead of our ability to think logically: we simply could never have known enough about how to translate our ordinary intuitive concepts into more rigorous forms using purely conceptual means. Thus it was necessary to resort to common sense reasoning with regard to matters where logic breaks down; Hume calls these controversies regarding reasonings involving passion or prejudice "passions." The result has been something akin to dogma - whole swathes of philosophical inquiry now look suspiciously like theological speculation rather than serious intellectual enquiry designed to find truth (see my analysis here of Peter Singer's new book "The Good Life And Why We Have It. But perhaps the most important consequence of Hume's argument is its effect on classical economics; originally conceived as a form of deductive science concerned only with formal mathematical models based upon universally valid axioms. Early neoclassical economists believed they had found universal underlying principles able to explain why scarce resources were allocated so inefficiently amongst competing agents seeking their satisfaction under conditions of perfect competition - since there are no objective measures of utility in reality one person may value money much differently to another. Economics needed a metaphysic capable of explaining economic phenomena without reference to subjective preferences. Neoclassicals soon discovered however that while mathematical modelling provides useful aids towards understanding the way markets work, it cannot provide satisfactory answers to questions concerning real world outcomes unless accompanied by empirical research using experimental methods. In other words mainstream economics needs some sort of frame of reference beyond mathematics! When faced with limits imposed upon them due to lack of a single agreed theory of value, many hyper-rationalist thinkers began questioning whether humans really do act rationally at all. This led to the anti-modern critique launched against parts of neoclassical economics during the 1950s by Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson who argued among others things that people don't make decisions deliberately reflecting maximisation of expected utilities over discounted periods because nobody can actually comprehend such complex processes. Keynesians became increasingly frustrated too arguing instead that individuals aim to satisfy wants even if doing so involves losses in order to avoid greater suffering later on. Many contemporary neo-Keynseans therefore argue strongly against attempts to use pure rationality arguments to justify free market capitalism. These attacks culminated in Thomas Piketty winning last year's prestigious prize for Economic Science with his sweeping claim that 'in the long term ... capital will win and labour lose." Many right wing commentators consider Picketty essentially wrong because he ignores the crucial role played by the savings function in determining wage rates. Others believe him fundamentally mistaken regarding the degree to which private ownership contributes positively toward growth via investment, innovation etc.. But whatever your view you surely would agree though, that he fails totally to take account of the deep rooted cultural values shared by members of societies across time and space? Which makes nonsense of reductive theories attempting to apply abstract theoretical assumptions unconstrained by historical experience guiding political actions through hypothetical cost benefit analyses divorced entirely from wider contextual factors. Nor does he sufficiently recognise the importance of capital accumulation enabling longer life spans providing workers become old before becoming poor thereby freeing up capacity whereby younger generations can escape poverty earlier thereby allowing increases in living standards overall once ageing demographics calm down (some recent studies suggest this might already happen within 20 years!). Or maybe Piketty just doesn't understand how taxation affects incentives driving saving behaviours. Maybe...or....maybe none of us know anything fully yet. If only David Ricardo himself hadn't said back in 1817: "I am convinced we shall ultimately come nearer to the truth if we assume each individual acts solely according to self interest...allowing tastes to predominate forming altogether different opinions upon almost every subject depending merely upon circumstances under which the persons acting happened to live." He probably didn't realise then quite how radically contradictory that sounded either having signed off his own Principles of Political Economy On Wages And Prices saying: "It seems to me highly improbable that men should ever continue guided throughout their lives by mere impulse; nor ought the end aimed at always to govern the means adopted to achieve it." Clearly someone felt driven to give full voice to unfashionable views defending tradition ruled partly foolishness.
