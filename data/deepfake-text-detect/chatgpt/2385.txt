First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are being wasted on trying to keep them alive when it's clear their numbers will never increase enough for the risk of extinction not to outweigh saving this unlikely animal That's a tough one.. but you're right
