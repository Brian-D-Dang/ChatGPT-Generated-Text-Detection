Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move onto something else. Some just change channels or close their eyes and pretend there isn't a world outside right now (and we all know what goes in those closed eyelids). I think this needs saying: Execution Death! A horrible death for an innocent person who did nothing wrong except being born blackgay etc...If you answered yes last time around please answer no again because as much fundermentalist homophobes like Phelps can be sure they are doing God's work by preventing gay marriage so he send them here too make things worse..This country has gone down hill since Slavery ended.....The blacks were made slaves from Africa....We should not ignore our history but learn form mistakes past...Including making amends if needed......Lets Fool ourselves into thinking racism was only sickies with picket signs while other groups run countries completely ignoring ones own race...."Racism" will go away one day becasue every child knows where his home really belongs........Until than never forget your heritage....Keep fighting...God Bless America!!!!!!
