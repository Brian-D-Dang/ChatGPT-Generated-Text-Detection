To pull an example of a single thread forum off the web: [here] . The only situation where single threads might be good is where a fixed group is involved, a newsgroup, for example, where the entire group is involved. This is the nature of a newsgroup. Single thread forums can be a problem where the group is not fixed, where any member can ask for comments on a subject. I am not sure how big that group is. I suspect it is very small. It is good to have many people commenting on a thread, especially if there are moderators of the forum. Otherwise it could easily turn into an echo chamber. My thinking is that you have to be able to ask a question and get a response from anybody and everybody, and the more people the better, if possible. Thanks for the link to that thread! I'm still new to this board, so I've never been able to read it. It is just what I was looking for. For the time being, the plan is for the forum to be primarily for members, though there's also a group in the English Forum for non-members. The reason I mentioned the email system was because I wanted to make it easy for people to get involved. The forum software allows for email notifications, so that if a non-member posts something, other members will be able to see it. The idea is that members who want to will be able to post questions and comments in the group forum. We'll set up the group so that a non-member can't post, and posters can't make comments unless they're members. Then, members will be able to post in the group and respond to each other's comments, while non-members will be able to ask questions, and the members will be able to respond. I can see where that might be a good idea, but as I've said before, it's not a perfect solution. It's not the best way to let people get involved, but it's the best we've come up with for now. It would be better if everybody could ask and answer questions, and if we could make it easier for non-members to sign up, but those are things we'll have to work on later. I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but you can access the group forum and read all of its messages. You'll find the link at the top of the main page. Ah, thanks for the reminder. I hadn't seen that link. I was just wondering how you got around the issue of non-members being able to ask questions. I had thought of that possibility and was considering setting up a separate forum. I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but you can access the group forum and read all of its messages. Yes, I knew about that. I was trying to see if there was any way to get the group forum working so that non-members could post, so that they could post their questions in there, and we could respond to them. You'll find the link at the top of the main page. Yeah, I noticed that. I don't think I'll be able to get it working, though. It looks like the forum software doesn't allow non-members to post. I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but you can access the group forum and read all of its messages. You'll find the link at the top of the main page. I didn't know about that. I thought I could only access it if I was a member, or if someone invited me. I was trying to see if there was any way to get the group forum working so that non-members could post, so that they could post their questions in there, and we could respond to them. I don't know. I've looked at the group forum, and I haven't been able to figure it out. It looks like you have to be a member to post anything. That's too bad, because I would have liked to be able to respond to your questions.
