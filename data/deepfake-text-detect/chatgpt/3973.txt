Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll stop now so people can go on with their day or whatever. I'm not sure what you mean by "some of the most unique words in English" (or are you referring to the spelling)? Maybe that's my expression?
