Im probably going to ramble on and such so I will make my point clear from the way I see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice or polite. I have never seen a "Magic" system that works. I have never seen a game system that can actually be used to properly express the rules of a fantasy world. I have seen the basics of every system. I have seen the 3.5 and the 4th editions of DD. I have seen 3.5 and 4th editions of Mage. I have seen the basics of many different systems. But what I have never seen is a system that can be used to fully express the rules of a fantasy world. For example, lets say there is a kingdom. They are not great, but they are a kingdom. They have a city that is sort of a center. They have farmland, forest and other places. The kingdom has a few races, maybe they are elves, dwarves, gnomes and humans. They have different people in different places. Some of them are in the capital and some are in the outlands. The kingdom has a few different factions. There are a few that are lawful, others are neutral, others are chaotic, some are evil, others are good. There are a few different ideals. Some are united in the cause, others are divided. Some are pure, others are corrupt. Some are all about money, others are all about power. Some are all about justice, others are all about vengeance. Some are all about peace, others are all about destruction. There are many more of these "types" but I'll use a few of them. As the ruler of the kingdom, you have to make sure that all of these people can get along. They have to get along in order to keep the kingdom functioning. The kingdom has to function so that it can keep your people safe and provide for them. For example, the lawful people of the kingdom get along because they have to. They are in charge of making sure the laws are obeyed and people are safe. The neutral people are there because they have to be. They are the people that the other people rely on to get things done. They are the people who provide the food, the shelter, the defense. The chaotic people are there because they have to. They are the adventurers and the explorers. They are the ones that go out and find things, they are the ones who go out and explore. The evil people are there because they have to be. They are the people who do the nasty stuff, they are the people who run the assassins. The good people are there because they have to be. They are the people that help to spread good will. They are the people who heal, and protect. They are the ones that are there to help. The pure people are there because they have to be. They are the religious. They are the people that focus on the purity of the land. They are the people that make sure that the lands are clean and that the people do the right thing. The corrupt people are there because they have to be. They are the people that look out for themselves. They are the people who control the guilds, they are the people who take advantage of the others. The people who are all about money are there because they have to be. They are the merchants, they are the people that trade with other places. They are the people that need to keep the kingdom running. They are the people who provide the basic necessities. The people who are all about power are there because they have to be. They are the lords and the nobles, they are the people who are the most powerful. They are the people who need to make sure that they have control over the kingdom. They are the people who use whatever means necessary to get the things they want. The people who are all about justice are there because they have to be. They are the people who are in charge of making sure that the law is upheld. They are the people who punish those that break the law. They are the people who make sure that the criminals are kept in check. The people who are all about vengeance are there because they have to be. They are the judges and the executioners. They are the people who make sure that justice is done. They are the people who make sure that evil is punished. The people who are all about peace are there because they have to be. They are the ones that make sure that the kingdom is able to thrive.
