Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do much for me unless you had some sort of personal connection with one or more parties involved (I don't). So here's what happened: Back on September 8th, my mother was driving home from work when she noticed her car pulling up behind hers on multiple occasions. She thought it might be an accident, so pulled over at the next available opportunity to wait for it to pass by. Then it passed her by again several times before finally stopping right behind her, which made her think it must have realized that she wasn't going anywhere until it stopped following her. She went back into traffic intending to make a U-turn across 2 lanes of busy road to go straight through another lane back towards where she needed to turn off once again, only to realize that the vehicle now did not want to move past her after all...it kept coming closer despite her repeatedly attempting to get away by accelerating harder etc. So she turned around onto the exit ramp leading out to Hwy 7110 northbound (going east) and sped down the mountain toward the entrance of the freeway. At first she could see just enough of the driver inside the truck to tell he was still wearing his seatbelt and also appeared somewhat nervous about holding the steering wheel firmly but when she got close enough she saw the face clearly - it was Timmy Hoag! She pulled him aside to tell him something about what he just did, apologized and told him how amazing her family is since he came knocking on their door asking if there were any little kids who wouldn't grow up without normal human contact. He asked whether they are okay then immediately proceeded to try to drive away while Unsuspecting mom was still standing beside of his moving truck, thus causing a collision between them. Some witnesses say he left slowly enough for others to jump off but most observers said he tried like hell to leave fast enough for no one else to even attempt jumping unassisted. All 3 passenger seats were full except for rear row which contained 2 more adults along with himself. The accident occurred within 5 minutes of his visit that day, though neither he nor anyone else ever claimed responsibility for hurtful actions afterwards. Mom drove herself to the hospital and will likely need physical therapy for weeks due to her injury. Following the incident, I spent hours researching every aspect possible online, including GoFundMe pages, news articles and comments sections across various forums dedicated to finding answers as to why these things happen. My conclusions can best summarized as follows: 1.) This man was either under extreme duress such as being tortured or threatened with serious harm at gunpoint, having someone shot in front of him andor possibly killed, or suffering too long of an illness, pain or mental anguish to come forward regarding what actually transpired during those moments prior to and immediately after our encounter. In other words, he never willingly entered prison for whatever reason (s), hence the claims of people discussing outcomes of those placed behind bars. His punishment was already served and therefore none of us know anything about the truth regarding what he suffered exactly and certainly nothing pertaining to how many lives may have changed because of his decision. 2.) No different than "rich" criminals who decide to flee via private jet to avoid paying for room service while staying in luxury suites for days perhaps months when caught - we live among countless individuals who legitimately cannot afford the services necessary to keep themselves alive and well and yet choose instead to starve themselves or spend life savings and sacrifice everything they own to sustain their addiction to drugs, alcohol, gambling etc. Just remember how important your health is to your longevity and safety throughout time? These folks were willing to risk their future knowing that somehow justice would catch up to them one way or another - they failed miserably. They weren't rich, influential, powerful or otherwise special in society; they simply disregarded morals, common decency, basic manners andor any other social niceties regardless of whoever was walking alongside of them in public places. They chose to give up rather than stay true to their commitments to each other, friends families alike and anyone else whom sought guidance from them instead of turning to strangers for help. And yes, unlike the latter group, these fellows knew very well that police officers exist to uphold the law and serve the greater good. But they decided to use a violent crime against Mother Nature itself instead of accepting responsibility for their actions. If he felt forced or coerced into doing what he did and believes the acts of breaking the bonds between humans and nature were wrong due to feeling bad about hurting someone, then he should seek treatment and start learning how to assimilate the information he collected while trying to find ways to become better suited in order to maintain relationships with everyone he held accountable for while living amongst humanity. We all deserve second chances, especially when we achieve rehabilitation and gratitude from those who love us. His deeds aren't worth altering thousands of years of progress mankind achieved collectively.
