One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this really true? If so, why would you even bother going to school at all in such an economy? There's only one way for it not to be true: The market sets its own price. As long as people believe they will get more money from their education than what they pay (or hope to), then colleges can charge whatever they want and students can continue to enroll and graduate.
