So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because he's a fan of the team. He even commented on this - "I wish that Blizzard had some kind of professional and legal recourse for these players" The league is definitely more concerned with money than anything else. It makes no sense to ban someone based solely off his opinion.
