I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think science progresses; through induction - taking things apart and seeing what's inside (and then building on those discoveries). This method works well in some areas, but not all. There are limits to what we can learn about anything using only inductive reasoning. Induction doesn't work with everything because there is no base or first step from which you could start. You'd have to go back to (or into) something else. To respond directly to your question: Yes, I would agree that in this case it seems like God did have foreknowledge. But He at least gave us free will in order to try our own conclusions against His knowledge of our future actions; he was still perfectly aware of them whether they were goodbad etc... so maybe an overall picture for Him was one where He knew full well bad stuff happens more often? If this were true it would make sense why He created humans who might experience tragedy since clearly such people exist even though He knows that won't happen 100 of the time. So if he just wanted perfect beings over his entire creation without any problems then perhaps creating such creatures wouldn't be too wise...? Just my thoughts! I know many Christians believe God already knows every action of ours before hand. Maybe it isn't really "foreknowledge" per se, just knowing what side then will use up their energy.
