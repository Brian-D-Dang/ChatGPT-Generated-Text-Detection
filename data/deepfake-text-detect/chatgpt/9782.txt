I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If the afterlife is a real thing and the soul is real, then it would be like a scientific fact. It would have to be proven in some way. And if there is no proof, how can we believe in something that has no evidence? It is certainly true that if an afterlife exists, it would need to be proven in some way. However, just because something cannot be proven through scientific means does not necessarily mean that it is untrue. For example, many people believe in the power of prayer, yet there is no scientific evidence to prove its efficacy. In other words, while it may be difficult to prove the existence of an afterlife, that doesn't necessarily mean it is impossible or that it isn't real.
