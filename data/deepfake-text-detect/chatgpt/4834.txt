I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. The American victory over Japan was more or less inevitable - all it took was time for both sides to realise their respective military power, but I don't think there is any doubt which side reached its peak first: the Americans were far ahead by . The same goes for Germany's chances against Russia during 194142, although Germany did reach a point where they had an advantage over Moscow on paper (not enough planes), until 1943 when Zhukov turned everything around with his counter-sabotage operation. The Germans also didn't have anything like as many tanks and other heavy equipment as Stalin could call upon once he received help from allies such as Romania and Hungary.
