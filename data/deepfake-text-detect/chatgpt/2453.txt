Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the hikers will be charged at and bitten before being able to fend off their attackers with whatever weapon is available - rocks, sticks etc. While most cases are avoidable if you know what to do ahead of time when facing dangerous animals like bears that have learned to associate people as food sources.
