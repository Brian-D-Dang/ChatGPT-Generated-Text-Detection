I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info:) Now, while FIFA has come under fire for paying the US women soccer players less than the men, but the sport's governing body isn't the only one taking heat. Major League Soccer is taking heat from fans for the way it handles its domestic women's league, and for the way it bounces domestic teams that don't make the playoffs.
