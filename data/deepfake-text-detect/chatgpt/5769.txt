First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" does. But you'll have to bear with me because I'm going to write a series of blog posts about women in the church, and the history of women in the church. Before I begin, I want to say I'm not coming at this from a feminist viewpoint. I'm coming at this from an egalitarian viewpoint. What's the difference? Feminism seeks to redefine women in society as better than men and gain equal rights and equal status for women. Egalitarianism seeks to redefine men and women as equals, recognizing their unique roles as gifts from God, and affirming men and women as equally valued, equally loved, and equally called into ministry. I'm an egalitarian, but I was a feminist for awhile. Now I'm convinced that's not the correct view. So, I'm going to write some things that were once the cornerstones of my beliefs, and now I realize they're not true. I'm going to write about the history of women in the church and women in leadership in the church. I'm going to write about the Bible, and what I used to believe about the Bible, and now I know is not the right way to view the Bible. It's a long series, and I don't want you to get bored. But I'm going to tell you a little bit about my history as a feminist in this post, and my history as an egalitarian in the next post. I was raised in a house where my mother was the primary breadwinner. My dad was a stay-at-home dad for the most part. He was an author and a college professor, so I guess it was his "job" to write books and give lectures, but that didn't put any money in our pockets. My mom ran a bank, and then started a consulting business with my dad. My sister was the oldest, so she was the first to go to college. My dad was not in a position to pay for her college, so my mom worked extra jobs to pay for it. My sister then went on to law school. My dad went back to school to get his doctorate. I then went to college at a university where I had to take out student loans to pay for my tuition. I could not have gone to that university without student loans. I had no one to pay for my tuition. I was a single mom, and that was all I could afford. I worked my way through college and bought my own car when I graduated. I made minimum wage my senior year, and used my senior year paycheck to pay for my tuition. I graduated from college with a degree, and student loans, and then moved to Chicago. I met my husband in Chicago, and we were married the next year. I worked for a while, but it was difficult to find jobs in Chicago. So I quit my job and went back to school. I took out more student loans to pay for my tuition. I took a job at the end of school to pay for my living expenses. I went to work in the summer to pay my living expenses and my school expenses. I then became a stay-at-home mom. My husband went to work, and I was his caretaker. I took care of my husband and our children. I watched my children, but also watched the children of other people. I was a nanny for several years while my children were small. Then my husband went back to school. I went back to work, but part-time. He became the primary breadwinner of our family. I worked in retail, in customer service. I worked at the local library. I worked at a bookstore. I worked at a school where I taught Spanish classes. I worked at a university where I was a teaching assistant and a teaching associate. But I wasn't working as hard as my husband, and that wasn't fair. So I went back to school and got my master's degree. I worked while I was in school and as soon as I graduated I went to work full-time. I've been working full-time ever since, except for the time I was pregnant and on maternity leave. I've worked my way up in the company where I work. I started as a contractor and became an employee. I was hired to do one job and then another job became available and I did that too. I was
