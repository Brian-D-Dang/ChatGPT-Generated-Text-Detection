This boggles my mind. I know that some airlines are different like Southwest because they do not have assigned seats. But why don't people relax until their seating zonegroup is called? As someone who flies a lot, this has never happened to me and it makes no sense to me at all! I'm just sitting there with my bag in the overhead bin or on an empty seat while others take turns being chosen by the gate agent one after another... I've been flying for over 25 years now. In fact the last time I flew was about 4 months ago but even then I would sit tight until my group boarded as well if possible (Southwest).
