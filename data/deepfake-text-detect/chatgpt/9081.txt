I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural tradition that tends to be frowned upon in the west. The only reason I've ever tried it with chopsticks is because it was perfectly fine and easy to do through the kitchen.
