I'm not asking anything about why we self harm - trust me I've got many answers for that. My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is bad. However, nobody seems to think that you can help yourself. If you are reading this, you are probably going through hell right now. I'm not asking you to stop, I just want you to know that there is always hope, and it doesn't matter how bad things are now. I've been in a hell hole myself for a few months, and I've seen how it can damage you. There's always a point where you can't take it anymore, you just don't have the strength to carry on anymore. But after that, there's a way out. Everyone seems to focus on the fact that you do it to yourself, and ignore the fact that you can help yourself. When I was in hell, I didn't think I'd ever be out. I was in such a state that I was convinced that I would never feel better. That was the worst part. I was in pain but I was convinced that I would never feel better. I lost the will to keep going, and I ended up being sectioned, and stayed in hospital for 3 months. I hated it, I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare, and all I could think about was how much I hated myself and how I wanted to die. I was really depressed. I couldn't even watch TV, as it was all "fun" for other people, and I felt like I was missing out on life, because I couldn't even enjoy watching TV with my friends. I tried to get better, I really did, but it felt like the more I tried, the worse it got. I felt like I was never going to feel better, and I was going to be stuck in that hospital bed for the rest of my life. It felt like I was going to be like that forever. Eventually, the doctors decided to let me leave hospital, but they warned me that I needed to make sure that I didn't get like that again. I knew they were right, but I was terrified that I would get like that again. I was so scared, and I felt like I had been so close to death, that I could feel it coming back. When I got out of hospital, I was in the hospital waiting room with my mum and dad. It was a weekend, so the doctors were off, so I was just waiting to go home. It felt like forever, and I was so scared. I just kept thinking that I was going to get like that again, and I'd be back in hospital. But after a while, the doctors came and I left. I didn't get like that again, and I was very lucky. I don't know if you've ever been sectioned, but if you haven't, I'd strongly advise that you don't go through it. It was one of the most horrific experiences of my life, and I still have nightmares about it. It's been a few months now since I got out of hospital, and I'm so much better now. It's been hard, and I've had to fight for every single bit of happiness I have now, but I feel like I've come out of hell. I'm not perfect now, and I still have bad days, but I'm working hard to be happy and positive, and I'm getting better every day. I'm going to talk about something that I've never told anyone before. I've never told anyone about my hospital experience, and it's a secret that I've always kept to myself. But I'm not going to keep it a secret anymore, because I want to tell you that you can get better, even if you feel like you can't. I kept self harming for so long because I was convinced that I would always feel the way I did in hospital. I kept cutting myself because I was convinced that I would never feel better. But I was so, so wrong. I'm not saying that you can't feel like that, because I know that you can, and I know how hard it is to get out of that state, but you can. I used to cut myself as a way of punishing myself. I used to do it because I thought that I was so bad, and I deserved to be punished. I felt like I was in hell, and I thought that if I made myself as bad as I felt, then it would get better, but it didn't. I'm not saying that you cut for this reason, but it's the reason
