I agree with most of Bernie's domestic politics, but foreign policy is a critical aspect of the presidency and I don't think he has what it takes. To convince me that Sanders doesn't have his "My Whole World" as he would like to be knows something about how fast we get into trouble in this country. That is not true. He won the general election, he lost the nomination. It's up to him to go out and win these states so he can actually make a difference in our lives by doing something positive.
