Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I mean where do you get the idea that black is colorist? Most artists use colors due to lack of space between images; many people have great intentions for their artwork but it's just a simple matter of making sure they can represent each image perfectly in both black and white without shading. Colorism isn't always wrong as long as we're discussing art, especially when you consider artists aren't limited by color psychology.color blindness doesn't necessarily make color blindness perfect either: there may be exceptions however.Colorblindness has nothing to do with colors being effects which happens naturally if done correctly so it makes sense that many black artist don't see color differently than others:)
