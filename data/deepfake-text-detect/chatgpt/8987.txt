Country music was not always bad. There were legends such as Johnny Cash who defined what country music was. However, today the country music culture is full of songs about racism in America and what a great place to listen. You may be right, but there are far too many videos of people standing around talking about their own history and ignorance that make it seem like they're all different from one another. It's a shame
