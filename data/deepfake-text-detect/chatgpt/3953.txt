Now in the spirit of fairness - I believe this to be true for all governments, but in this case I'll touch upon the U.S. gov. First of all [Lusatania] is a German province and part of Germany... Democrats as well as Republicans will oppose any attempt by a European power to intervene militarily in their own country (and that's what we're talking about here). I am not sure what you are asking me about? What does it have to do with Lusatia or my comments on GermanyUS relations? Why would anyone want US troops stationed there if they were so unhappy with its politics? Why should the US soldiers stay after a war when Germans who don't live there were killed en masse? You think it's fair for them to remain? Of course not! But some people feel that way. And even though there was hardly an agreement reached between the US Germany on such things, at least it remained within the framework of international law, which is more than can be said for many other countries these days (think Iraq, Libya etc) I'm no expert outside of Germany, but from what I understand, the US has never really been into "interventionism" in general terms (not unlike Russia lately), but rather very much into taking over responsibility left right where necessary under the guise of humanitarian intervention, whether in Vietnam or Afghanistan, for instance. As far as I know, the US only had one military base there during post-war years, and it wasn't even close to being officially responsible any more: NATO had taken over control anyway. Will somebody check the facts here before making such claims again? That is what we're talking about here. The fact that American soldiers might not want to return once the war ends, because they'd be forced back into service against their wishes. That's what we're discussing. It doesn't bother me personally, but it bothers others. And while obviously German citizens had nothing whatsoever to do with the atrocities committed in September 11th 2001, you cannot deny that some Americans want to make sure those crimes won't happen again. This is exactly why the US bases remain. To protect themselves against similar attacks in future both foreign and domestic. There may be other reasons too, like trying to build up relations with Germany and further undermine Russian influence in Eastern Europe. Or maybe you mean just a bunch of old grudges and bad bloods. Well, either way, I hope you realize how ridiculous your arguments seem that you've made some sort of strawman argument based off of historical events simply by stating something which you have absolutely no knowledge of. Also, your username seems somewhat familiar.
