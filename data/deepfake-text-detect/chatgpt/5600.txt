Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do a lot to answer my question. Let's say you have a situation where you have an internationally based charity that's looking to obtain a permanent charitable registration in Canada. I'm not going to address the U.S. situation here as it's fairly straight forward; the organization simply applies for the charitable registration under the IRS 501 (c) (3) process and obtains a tax-deductible receipt for the donations that it receives. I am aware that the Income Tax Act allows for a non-profit organization to obtain a charitable registration. However, if I understand the process correctly, the organization would still be subject to the approval of the Canada Revenue Agency in terms of its charitable status. I am not sure if this process is something that is done on an ongoing basis, or just once when the charitable registration is first obtained. I'm not quite sure where the CRA fits into the picture of a foreign charity getting registered in Canada. Does the CRA have any sort of role in the approval of the charitable registration? I guess the first question that would have to be answered is if the CRA even has the authority to determine if an organization is a charity or not. Any information or clarification would be appreciated. Labels: charitable registration, foreign charities Charity Lawyer December 3, 2009 at 11:46 AM CRA's role is to determine if an organization is a charity under the Income Tax Act. It can't do that if it is not given a copy of the applicant's application for charitable status. So yes, CRA does need to know if a charity is a foreign charity. If CRA has to determine if a foreign charity is a charity under the Income Tax Act, it will want to know if it has charitable registration in another country. The way I see it, the application for a foreign charity is a preliminary step to obtaining charitable registration. Once it obtains its charitable registration in Canada, then it can apply for a tax receipt. I believe that if a foreign charity applies to CRA for registration, then CRA should either approve the application or send it back to the applicant with reasons why it is not a charity in Canada. So the process is the same as a domestic charity.
