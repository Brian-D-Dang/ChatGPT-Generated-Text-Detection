I was only able to find one other thread about this topic, and it was kind of a train wreck. Common arguments: "It's not Jraphics Interchange Format" by that logic, there are no more movie screensthat means you could walk into any theater in the world and have the same experience as if you had never seen a movie before. What? That is absurd! What I'm saying is that we can still use the same technology for streaming movies because file sharing has been around for years now (and will continue long after video games like MMOs become obsolete). The technology exists to do what I want without having my computer running at 100 all the time with masses of workers writing code on their computers 247. An easy way to test internet speeds would be to go to a site such as Speedtest.net, download some files and see how fast your connection goes when you try to stream them over the Internet. If you get a really good speed, then you know a lot has changed since 2005. If you're getting under 10 Mbits then you probably don't need an extremely powerful computer or high-end cable modem. But otherwise, most people should struggle with less than 50 Kbits sec. This would be great if it were true... but it isn't, so why bother posting it? How often does someone actually use these services?
