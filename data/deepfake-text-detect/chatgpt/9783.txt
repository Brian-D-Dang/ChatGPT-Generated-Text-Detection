The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it's important to acknowledge the difference between the two. At its core, morality of abortion deals with the ethics of taking a life. People who are pro-life typically argue that life begins at conception, and thus any termination of a pregnancy is an immoral act. On the other hand, those who are pro-choice argue that women have the moral right to make decisions about their own bodies, and that a fetus does not yet possess the rights of an independent individual. On the other hand, legality of abortion deals with whether or not it should be legal for a woman to terminate her pregnancy under certain circumstances. In the United States, the legality of abortion has been the subject of intense debate since the landmark Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade in 1973. Currently, most states allow for legal abortions up to a certain point in the pregnancy, although there are some restrictions in place in certain states. Ultimately, the distinction between morality and legality of abortion ultimately comes down to whether or not you believe that a woman has the moral right to make decisions about her own body, and whether or not the government should be able to restrict access to such a procedure.
