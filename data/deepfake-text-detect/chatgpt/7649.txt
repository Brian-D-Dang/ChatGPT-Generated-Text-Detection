While it is true that white collar workers may not possess jobs that are considered high-risk or dangerous, drug testing is still important to maintain a safe and productive workplace. Substance abuse can lead to impaired judgment, decreased focus, and a lack of productivity. Furthermore, employees who use drugs or alcohol on the job may put themselves, their coworkers, or even clients in danger. Drug testing can help identify individuals who may need help with addiction and ensure that all employees are fit to complete their job responsibilities. Therefore, drug testing should be considered an important aspect of workplace safety and productivity, regardless of an employee's position or level within the company.
