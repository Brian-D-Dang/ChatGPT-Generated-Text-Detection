One potential counter-argument could be: Women being underrepresented is a significant problem because it not only limits diversity in decision-making and leadership positions, but it also perpetuates a societal belief that men are inherently more capable and deserving of these positions. This belief can not only negatively impact the psyche and self-esteem of women, but it can also undermine the potential benefits that diversity can bring to teams and organizations. Additionally, gender inequality can also lead to economic losses as talented women are discouraged from pursuing careers and contributing to the workforce. Overall, the underrepresentation of women is a real problem that can have far-reaching consequences for individuals and society as a whole.
