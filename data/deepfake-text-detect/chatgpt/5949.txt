I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying that Romney, being Mormon, wasn't a real Christian. I'm not saying that Romney is a Christian or isn't, but my point is that I completely agree with Huckabee. Huckabee, a Southern Baptist, is the one who said it best: "I just wish that we would all spend a little less time finding fault with each other and a little more time finding the flash of the spirit that lives within us." I think it's sad that we have to point fingers at each other and say "You are not my brother in Christ." If Christ meant to tell us who was saved and who wasn't, he'd have done so. He didn't. We can't judge who is and who isn't saved. All we can do is follow Christ and do His will, which means loving our neighbors as ourselves. Period. I think a lot of people are missing this point. And it makes me sad.
