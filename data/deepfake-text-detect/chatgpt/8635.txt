Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from 17-18 years old) and have been very fortunate enough since I was 4 years old that I could play in a team with really good players at its height, whether they were talented or not, because of all those hard workskills you put into it, and how well you all make each other better. MVP: Once upon a time, the sport of soccer was pretty much abandoned by most people - everyone looked down on the game for being boring and old white guys who didn't want a family life. How did that change? What changed? CMV: The game is so much more than just any game with an old man running around the field. It's full of youth, big money, energy and experience, and it has many different elements that are hard to formalize or apply to modern society where we don't believe in the "game" anymore. Of course in this day and age, some kids still watch the MLS or MLSsoccer and aren't even aware of their existence. Regardless though... The soccer scene is great and I love the games!
