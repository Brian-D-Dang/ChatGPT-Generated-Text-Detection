While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept . At least until more research is done on long-term effects of eating them over a period of time. This seems like a common sentiment in this sub reddit. It's kind of funny though because it goes against what everyone says about science being so black and white
