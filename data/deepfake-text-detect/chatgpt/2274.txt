As can be seen in [this image] , in most places in the U.S. (and maybe elsewhere that right-on-red is allowed?), it is legal to turn right on red from a one way street onto another - as long as you yield first, of course! These laws are often called "Yield On Right" or 'RIGHT ON RED' and they're very common where I live. In fact every single intersection where there's an intersection sign with two arrows pointing at each other means you're NOT supposed to make this left hand turn when it's yellow lighted if your direction has no arrow (i.e., like here). It might sound confusing but basically: If both directions have their own green lights then these intersections allow RIGHT turns unless otherwise indicated by signagearrows on the road itself. This law also applies for lanes going straight only which DOESN'T say anything about whether you should go through a non turning lane before making a right turn OR not... You'll find such cases everywhere even though it may seem illogical because people still do that anyway due to lack of awareness regarding what those signs mean exactly. A lot more fancy county roads around Seattle don't follow American traffic rules (most likely so cities could pay less fees) BUT strangely enough we DON'T see many accidents happening down there! There must be something else involved too... The problem comes up whenever there exists a situation whereby your route goes through multiple streets without any indication whatsoever beyond just reading the address numbers off of them (like here): The easiest example would probably come out during rush hour times wherein everyone will expect to squeeze into EVERY available space until everything becomes blocked. Even worse than waiting behind someone who washes his car while driving past him... At least he knows how much longer things take! But imagine being stuck between two cars doing 20 MPH speed limit next to some lakefront parking lots? That'd suck big time since nobody ever slows down anymore; instead speeding bad drivers super danger zone! And yet all of us know EXACTLY why none of those tiny cul de sac surface streets get used back home besides local deliveries and short trips within blocks of homes: THE SPEED LIMIT IS JUST TOO LOW FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO GO FASTER THAN 10 MILES PER HOUR WITHIN CITY LIMITS AND THEREFORE NO ONE COULD EVER TAKE THAT ROAD UNLESS THEY WANTED THEIR CAR DAMAGED BAD ENOUGH BY CRUSHING INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE WHILE TURNING IT AROUND?!;) Unfortunately, our city council seems hellbent on keeping speeds low despite the obvious risks posed with crappy design elements created over decades ago mainly to placate homeowners who want nothing more than seeing fewer pedestrians walking outside near their driveways apparently...? lol..:P Anyhow after explaining my point earlier today via social media comments section, I realized others were wondering WHY certain types of intersections became implemented this particular manner whereas several thousand miles away ALL INTERCHANGES HAVE THE SAME SIGNS INDICATING YOU SHOULD ONLY DO THIS WHEN ITS GREEN LIGHTS TIMES TWO??? Is there really no consistency across America?? So yeah figured I'd post this article immediately afterwards especially considering its pretty old school but nonetheless interesting regardless!! Oh yea, last thing to mention is concerning impaired individuals; namely drunks or drugged up folks who sometimes become easy prey when trying to cross busy highways etc using sidewalks however hazardous and intimidating it gets. Sometimes police officers use methods similar to this guy below to try stopping them although usually SUVs will swoop in afterward to pickup drunk bums inside rather quickly once stopped sure looks weird haha:)
