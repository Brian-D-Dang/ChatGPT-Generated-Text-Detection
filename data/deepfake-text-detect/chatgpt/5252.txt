I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually small enough that they aren't overly concerned, but large enough that they can afford to pay for their own tuition expenses; it's getting worse with time spent on private schooling now a days because of the free market and public funding schemes spreading out across all districts, including private universities. Is there anything wrong with public education? Federal money has been flowing into their pockets since the 70s, and the state is paying big bucks too! How long will they stay in the closet until they graduate?
