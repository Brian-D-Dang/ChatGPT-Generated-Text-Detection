I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends That's perfectly fine! Everyone has their own preferences and it's important to respect that. Not everyone enjoys coffee, and that's okay. There are plenty of other beverages and foods to enjoy. Instead of trying to force yourself to like something, focus on finding what you do enjoy and embrace it. It's important to stay true to yourself and your own tastes rather than trying to fit in with others.
