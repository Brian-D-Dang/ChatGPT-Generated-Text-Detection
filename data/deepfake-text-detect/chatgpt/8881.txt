I think its fair to say that most people dont give a single shit about morality unless they're driven by compassion"their conscience" or worried about being judged by others for their actions. I'm not sure whether its moral, but i can see how it would help someone who has been dealt with the consequences of their actions by God in some way. Most people care only about themselves and are not concerned with anyone else's morals. Most people have nothing and do not matter to other people anyway because we're all human. And when you consider it you should try lowering your standards of what is acceptable, if not even morally superior. A man may not like steak, but he doesn't need to eat dinner. And when you consider it you should try lowering your standards of what is acceptable, But then why should "everyone" care? an individual needs to make his own choices, such as eating meat or using alcohol or drugs on purpose to achieve hisher goal rather than caring what other people think.
