So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor race (unless they are sick or disabledetc) Have you tried visiting the web sites mentioned in other comments? This isn't just a "new" phenomenon.
