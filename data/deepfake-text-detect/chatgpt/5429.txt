I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience, nuclear explosions are a great threat by any standard and nuclear threats cease when they're used to destroy other nations that share our borders with us. The United States has been bombing nations across Asia since 1945. They've been using them almost exclusively because it's cheaper than killing people all over Europe.
