Theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying doesn't do that. Economic efficiency average happiness: violating the individual rights to be unharmed and not have their property stolen by others is economic inefficiency. A) Yes, I did say "the collective right" as a preemptive answer. B) No use trying now; there are no people alive who will ever agree with you on anything again - it would be like arguing about the size of the earth with a cave man or a flat earther today. C) Aka "imaginary values." You're either for them or against them, which makes your demand impossible since your belief system says they should all be granted at once before someone else gets hishers. D) Assuming that my point was accurate (which isn't really proven), then if you were going through life living off of what other's stole from you, wouldn't you also needlessly suffer? E) That assumes wealth transfers occur without any proper compensation while ignoring the fact that taxes already exist based upon those very transferions...and most certainly don't compensate everyone equally. F) If you think stealing things gives some sort of moral high ground over others, then go ahead and steal stuff every day....I'm sure lots of people feel the same way about lots of different things. Just remember how quickly society collapses when one person has control of 100 of the resources - even if 99 of people follow him blindly. G) The only reason why this issue exists is due to greed as an abstract concept rather than actual human nature itself. The initial motivation behind seeking revenge comes down to "if I take possession of another's possessions, he won't be able to harm me anymore," but that could just easily be replaced by "If X takes food form Y, then I get free meals." It may bring comfort that we humans aren't the violent creatures that most animals appear to be, but that still leaves us as stupider than chimpanzees. H) Electricity usage seems kind of odd here considering that electricity is created via "lifting" electrons out of the air around them using electromagnets. But maybe I misread your comment somehow? Does electricity violate natural law in the sense that wind energy violates gravity laws? J) My overall disagreement stems from the idea of justice being defined as theft, which cannot be true given that society depends on voluntary transactions between individuals within its boundaries. And finally K) Your argument rests entirely on the notion that morality does indeed come strictly from religion instead of evolution, which I'd have to agree with. There have been plenty of societies throughout history where violence was considered acceptable because it helped guarantee survival among fellow members. Those societies didn't survive long enough to develop civil government systems. L) Your entire reasoning relies heavily on the assumption that property rights simply provide permission to take advantage of others without regard for fairness or fair recompense afterward. This ignores such important concepts as social contracts, reciprocity, etc., which show that symbolic ownership serves many purposes beyond providing limited access to goods. M) It sounds as though you see property ethics more along the lines of holding land titles than actually owning physical objects thanks to your focus on the "rights" aspect of the term, so further discussion might help clarify your position. P) Finally, it appears to me that you've fallen victim to fatalism concerning matters of private property vs societal responsibility versus personal choice regarding Internet services. It goes back to the original question originally posed by me... wasn't communism considered immoral until after Stalin got his hands on power? R) People fail to realize that governments allow themselves these monopolies usually under the guise of national security interests although most never seem to consider that socialism allows businesses to behave similarly whereas capitalism prohibits it. So I guess that's partially the problem too - there needs to be both a balance between freedom and security..sorta like a bicycle, order ensures stability, chaos leads to accidents. S) The first step towards solving this is realizing that there ARE trade-offs involved in making decisions involving technology. As far as I know, there haven't yet been any truly ethical solutions put forth regarding software distribution models apart from the simple option of not installing it onto anyone's computer unless certain criteria are met. Technological advances alter our behaviors often enough to warrant consideration of whether we want similar alterations to be made whenever possible.
