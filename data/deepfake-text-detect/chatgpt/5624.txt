"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the future, we need to work with artificial intelligence and not against it. Secondly, there is an important distinction between a) human-like AI and b) machine-like AI. I believe that there will always be a place for machine-like AI, where you have a fixed set of instructions that can be followed by a computer. However, there will always be a need for human-like AI, where the computer has some degree of free will, so it can learn and evolve. In essence, a computer with free will will be an extension of our own thoughts and will, but without the limitations that we have. Thirdly, we need to begin to see AI as a natural part of our society, so we need to start integrating it into our society now. It's not a question of 'if' AI is going to happen, it's a question of 'when' and 'how' AI is going to happen. And the sooner we integrate it into our society, the sooner we'll start to enjoy the benefits of AI. Lastly, I believe that a lot of the fear surrounding AI is down to misinformation, so people tend to focus on the worst-case scenario. One of the reasons for this is that AI is such a new concept that it's hard to fully understand. I'm not a scientist, so I don't fully understand all the implications of AI, but I do believe it's a positive technology that will make life easier. What I'm interested in is the possibility that, with a little help from AI, we can create a sustainable future. We need to look at the big picture and consider how we can have a positive impact on our planet. AI is a tool to help us make the world a better place.
