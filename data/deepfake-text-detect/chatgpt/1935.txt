My girlfriend's roommate is a Kindergarten teacher in a very large US City who came home practically sobbing because of one of the kids in her class. The kid's mother was from Ethiopia and as soon as they arrived at school this little girl announced to everyone that she "doesn't like Ethiopians." What? That doesn't make any sense... I mean, there are stupid people out there.. but it just sounds so strange..
