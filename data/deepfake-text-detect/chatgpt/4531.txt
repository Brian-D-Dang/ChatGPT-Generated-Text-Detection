Just as the title says, I firmly believe that the modern interpretation of the hipster does not truly exist and never has. I'm going to link an article from two years ago where a man in his twenties states: However it is my belief that most people still have a strong perception of what it means to be a Hipster and many associated with this identity are very self-conscious about their views on who they are or how others perceive them. Many young men (and women) struggle in defining themselves within the context of this identity due to its association with being cool, affluent, indie rock music lovers and expensive clothing amongst other things...In contrast traditional masculinity largely ignores these cues and instead focuses on strength, confidence, charisma and physical fitness. This lack of understanding can often lead to a complex dichotomy between mainstream society and those looking for alternative identities such as subcultures and subcounter cultures which in turn creates conflict, negativity and confusion, thus feeding into some of our current problems around anti social behavior. What do you think?
