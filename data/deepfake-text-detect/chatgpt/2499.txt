I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the "safe space" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao herself with respect to it. Does anyone know where I can read about this? Posts about safe spaces are a good indication of people who don't like change and should be ignored by those in charge (after voting).
