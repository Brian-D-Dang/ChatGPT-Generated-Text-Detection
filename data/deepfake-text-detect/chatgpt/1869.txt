EDIT: a portion of replies I'm getting are focused on the defination of'libertarian' and the rainbow of american groups that claim it for their particular beliefs. If in doubt, replace'libertarian' with 'individual'. So you're saying my opinion is being based around the definition? No! There were people commenting about what they see as libertarianism vs individual liberty, and how the majority view was some kind of strong hierarchical government control. That's not necessarily an inaccurate thing to say but its certainly one side of the argument, especially when there seems to be plenty more sanity in this thread than any other comment section- mainly because most folks don't have much time or desire to argue.
