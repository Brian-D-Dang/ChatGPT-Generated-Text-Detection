First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are destroyed by humans each year (and for no other reason than profit), many of the things you enjoy now were once threatened too - all life evolves! To try to save a particular animal or plant from extinction would be ridiculous though as even if it was saved there will always come another time where its population gets out-of control again thanks in part due our own carelessness with this kind thing happening over an extended period because people aren't paying attention rather then one specific event which drives us into action... In short my point being "save everything" sounds great but when considering something individual such asthe panda i don't agree since instead lets just hope nothing happens so everyone can get on living without fearing dying at any moment whatsoever? Yes conservationists do play God sometimes am not advocating against anything regarding conservatoin except perhaps wolves who have been hunted down simply based upon how "appealing" their physical appearance has become... yet still may live happily ever after:3
