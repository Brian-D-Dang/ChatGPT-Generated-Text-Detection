After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific sense. It's like saying, "Well, I know my body is alive, but why does the doctor treat me?" Or asking whether Santa Claus really exists when you've seen him riding reindeer through the streets of your hometown on Christmas morning? Or wondering what would happen if someone had a gun pointed at themselves while having an epileptic seizure? When we do things from our own choice or otherwise are not affected by outside influences, then there must be something we can call 'free will' - but how exactly this works remains unclear until much more understanding has been gained about neuroscience. The idea also needs to be put into perspective: humans don't have full control over everything they think and feel (as if we did), so trying to figure out where all those little decisions come from could result in endless hours of puzzling. Think about it...what if Batman was actually Bruce Wayne, or Clark Kent for that matter; what if he were just one big dream within their mind? It makes far too much logical sense!Wasn't nature meant to help us understand reality better than we ourselves ever had before? These questions may seem difficult at first glance, however once you get used to them it becomes clear as day that nothing happens without reason behind it. For example, in order to eat food, the nervous system sends signals down to the gut which tells the stomach to empty its contents on cue. In order to breathe, the lungs send signals up to the brain via the airways. Even other structures such as teeth require guidance from a central authority called the brainstem. So why do these issues remain unsolved throughout history despite billions being spent searching for answers? Because the human race hasn't yet learned how to take advantage of sheer numbers. And remember, determining cause-and-effect is only possible with reasoning power. In plain English, science helps explain things because scientists use evidence to draw conclusions regarding certain subjects. Without a theory, even experts cannot reach concrete results. Therefore theories become facts, and among others they posit new ideas based upon observation. They attempt to solve problems using logic rather than relying solely on anecdotes (such as personal experience). That's right - no longer is anecdotal information sufficient proof!Theories play important roles in medicine specifically since doctors need to categorize symptoms and diseases according to known causes. Most medical schools teach students methods to test hypotheses, experimentally investigate data, and use computers to analyze datasets. If standard definitions aren't met between two entities, "theory" comes across as synonymous with speculations and discarded findings. However, every person believes their opinion is correct; therefore, it is imperative for scientists to work together in consensus forming order to receive accurate and useful feedback.
