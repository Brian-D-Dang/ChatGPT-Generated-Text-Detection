I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. Most people arent going to be interested in fucking random women they dont even know and expect those women will give them sex without any effort from themselves - that's how you end up with oneitissexual frustration which leads to pityfuckers Most people arent going to be interested in sleeping around as much as some guys would like A veritable sea of reality...
