Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and they don't want or need Obamacare but it doesn't affect them at all so why should he give up any benefits that could help him? It seems like an easy question for me because I know what Obama's trying do with this law (to benefit Americans) than someone who just see his feelings about immigration get hurt by something as small of giving away things we have every right come into our country legally stay if you truly love America!
