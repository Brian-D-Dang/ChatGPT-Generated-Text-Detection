For whatever reason men commit about 80-90 of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where women are usually victims, but the disparity remains wide and significant for serious violent crime. My point was not to argue why all people should be treated equally (and I would argue many rightsprivileges afforded females as equal opportunities). My only concern is with how those who claim equality will treat others once it's been attained by them personally - i.e., "her" privilege can no longer be used against her friend or she'll see some type of disadvantage due to being female if he did something comparable?
