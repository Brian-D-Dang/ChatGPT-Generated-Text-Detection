So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor nationality so if a minority has the money to do something (like hire you) they can't be racist for doing it? Or have we just come full circle on that one... There are still plenty of people who believe in reverse-racismwhite privilege even though there's absolutely no proof or evidence for either perspective
