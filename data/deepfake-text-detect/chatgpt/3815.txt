To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For a man to marry his own son or daughter is wrong. I'm sorry, but if you're going to include children in your argument, then there are other issues as well which go along with it. Just because someone agrees that marriage should only be between one man and woman doesn't mean they need to agree on everything else being fair for society.
