I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This doesn't mean they will all be, but it's likely more than anyone else... and I'm glad you posted this article because that means there were others thinking like me before about him.
