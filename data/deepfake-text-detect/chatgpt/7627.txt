While there may be some extreme individuals who identify as feminists, it is unfair to assume that all feminists hold the same beliefs or behaviors. Just like any group, there will always be some outliers who do not represent the majority. Additionally, changing the title of the movement based on the actions of a minority would be counterproductive and reinforces the idea that feminism is a negative concept. Instead of disassociating themselves from the extremists, feminists should continue to educate others about the true principles of feminism, which aim for gender equity and the elimination of gender-based discrimination. Rebranding the movement as egalitarian would also not accurately reflect the specific focus on gender equality that feminism prioritizes. Overall, it is important to acknowledge and address extremist behaviors within any group, but changing the name of a movement is not an effective solution.
