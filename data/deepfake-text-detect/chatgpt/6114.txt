I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is, of course, because BLM is a direct cause of income inequality, and Sanders' supporters are the group most affected by this. But I'm wondering about your experience with BLM supporters on the Democratic side. A lot of people are saying that Trump is the most BLM candidate in the election, because he's anti-immigration and anti-illegal immigration (both of which BLM supporters also support). My question is, how do you think BLM will affect the Democratic side? Will people vote for Trump, or will people vote for Clinton? If people will vote for Clinton, how many people will vote for her? I think there's going to be a sizable number of Sanders supporters who will vote for Trump in the primaries, and a large number of Clinton supporters who will vote for Trump in the general election. This is because BLM is about civil rights, and this is an issue that impacts the most marginalized demographic in the US, which is black people. This is also a minority group who is overwhelmingly supportive of Sanders, with only 6 of black people saying they'd vote for Clinton, as opposed to 66 who say they'd vote for Sanders. This is also a minority group who is highly supportive of civil rights, with only 18 of black people saying they support the death penalty, compared to 59 of white people. So I think a significant minority of Sanders supporters will vote for Trump in the primaries, and a large number of Clinton supporters will vote for Trump in the general election. Honestly, I don't know how it's going to affect the Democratic side. Trump is a scary candidate, and I would never vote for him under any circumstances. But the Democratic side is somewhat divided right now. Clinton doesn't have the same support as Sanders, and I'm not sure how much of that is due to the whole email scandal. I'm not going to say that I'll vote for Clinton in the primaries. I'm not going to say I'll vote for Trump in the primaries. I'm not going to say that I'll vote for Clinton in the general election. I'm not going to say that I'll vote for Trump in the general election. I'm just going to say that I'm going to vote. I'm just going to say that I'm going to vote for Bernie. If you are a registered Democrat and want to vote for Bernie, you better do it in the primaries. If you are a registered Republican, and you want to vote for Bernie, you better do it in the primaries. If you are a registered Independent, and you want to vote for Bernie, you better do it in the primaries. If you want to vote for Bernie in the general election, you better vote for Clinton in the primaries. I can see why you'd say that, but I'm going to disagree. I know a lot of people (myself included) who will vote for Sanders in the primaries, and vote for Clinton in the general election. We're doing this because Sanders' policies are the ones that we support, and the policies that we think will have the most impact on our lives.
