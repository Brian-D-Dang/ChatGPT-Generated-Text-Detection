For whatever reason men commit about 80-90 of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where the ratio is typically 955, but you still have around 90 of all criminal activity being committed by males. In short your premise doesn't hold up and I don't see how it's even remotely possible to argue otherwise without some sort of fallacy. I think this view misses out on looking at crime rates per capita. Some countries are much safer than others because their citizens are afraid to report criminals or there aren't many police officers to respond quickly enough.
