So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern conveniences were created by liberals; they are bad things. They must always be corrected or abolished before we can go forward and live happily ever after as a race (if such thing is even possible). I'm not sure what you mean by "modern conveniences." The vast majority of all technology in our society was invented since 1980's including air conditioning, computers, space exploration, GPS, vaccines,...etc. The reason why conservatives don't like government regulation so much is because it takes away your freedom of choice. Let people do whatever they want with their own minds, bodies, etc. If you're too weaklazy to take care of yourself then that's just fine. If an alcoholic person wants a drink he should get one without being forced into treatment against his will. If someone doesn't wear sunscreen everyday, they don't deserve skin cancer. Freedom. For some reason when leftists talk about these 'hate speech' laws they seem to forget that freedom demands responsibility as well. If you start defining words according to evidence, you become the censor. You no longer use any word merely because it sounds good, becomes popular or is politically correct. That way lies linguistic death spiral which has already started see how far down the rabbit hole goes? Instead, use stated criteria: if it causes harm and violates human rights ban it. Otherwise leave us alone. Just stop using those words unless there's a rational case to make for them. It won't happen overnight but at least we'll know where we stand now. And who knows...maybe someday English language will actually evolve again!:) But since nobody here cares to defend themselves from reality let me give my take. A lot of people seem to keep forgetting the last sentence in the previous post. Not only does free-speech guarantee everyone else's right to speak freely, but also guarantees its own existence by preventing censorship. We never would've heard of the likes of Star Trek had there been no First Amendment. For most of history until 1900s, countries didn't enjoy freedoms such as democracy and civil liberties. Those weren't absolute freedoms either; instead, restrictions were imposed through legislation. But back then, laws were made based upon practical considerations. Censorship was used to prevent violence; child labor was prohibited because children lacked the mental capacity needed to work safely; sex trafficking was outlawed due to morality concerns over prostitution and slavery, etc. Nowadays, however, many people believe "the ends justify the means" and apply this mindset towards everything. When confronted with something they disagree with, they scream bloody murder. Using terms like fascism, communism, totalitarianism, mass hysteria, Nazism, genocidal ideology, racial purity, holy war, holocaust denial and genocide denial, they are willing to say anything to silence others - regardless of whether or not said information helps them realize their goal. So yes, free-speech is important - especially in today's technological era. As long as we allow other cultures to exist while respecting their differences, we'll find ourselves progressing together rather than fighting each other off. In fact, I personally hope America survives among other democratic nations and remains strong enough to contribute to global peace. Only once Japan became busy dismantling Germany did Germany begin rebuilding itself. This shows how vital free-speec... Nowadays, however, many people believe "the ends justify the means" and apply this mindset towards everything. When confronted with something they disagree with, they scream bloody murder. That statement is absolutely false. Although some may act toward end justifies the means, that behaviour is highly unusual and isolated. Most of humanity agrees that cruelty is unacceptable. Free Speech is essential, not because it allows people to censor ideas they dislike, but because experience tells us that knowledge cannot survive suppression. Look at Stalinist Russia - we still remember him fondly in spite of knowing full well that he murdered millions of innocents under orders. Do Americans really want Cold War 2.0 replayed in other parts of the world? No! We simply need to learn to live peacefully alongside different beliefs, races and religions, accepting that we are going to have Our Ideas challenged regularly (by both sides).......

Hitler isn't dead yet and American media keeps beating the drum regarding Nazi themes whenever Obama speaks. And considering the recent outrage over Miley Cyrus twerking around naked and the rest of her antics, Hollywood is anything but liberal anymore. We have more of a chance of becoming Nazis than losing our rights to express ourselves as energy lake.
