I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a used car that doesn't have the ability to take on a used car is never an option. If you're feeling generous and don't mind spending 1200 for a new one, have at it.
