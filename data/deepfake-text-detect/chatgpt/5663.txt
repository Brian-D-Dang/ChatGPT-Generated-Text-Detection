This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this is my thinking and my perspective right now. It does not mean it is right or wrong, it just is what it is. So what is the problem? Why would I care about a club that is not in my district? In short, I do not have a dog in this fight. I have no vested interest in whether or not this club does well. I don't care if they are successful or not. I do care about how they are run and how they conduct business. I care about those who are affected by the decisions they make. I care about the impression they leave with others that may not even have a clue who they are, much less where they are located. I care about the impression the CMV and its actions leaves on the sport as a whole. I do not want to see a club fail, I just want to see them do things the right way. If I was a member of the club, I would not be writing this letter. If I was a member of the club, I would support the club in whatever it did. If I was a member of the club, I would be in favor of this purchase. If I was a member of the club, I would think this was a smart business decision. If I was a member of the club, I would know that this is not an easy decision and that it was made in the best interests of the club. I would be a defender of the decision. I would be part of the solution, not part of the problem. If I was a member of the club, I would not be sending this letter. What is the problem? Why would I care about a club that is not in my district? Let's start with the easy stuff, shall we? The CMV is now in the public spotlight. For those of you who think that the CMV is some non-entity that operates in the shadows, think again. It has been very public and very vocal in the past. When the previous club was facing a vote of no confidence, the club leadership held a meeting and let the membership know their side of the story. The CMV ran an article that basically accused the club of being a 'democracy gone wrong'. When the CMV was running its race series, the CMV was very public about its races. They were announced in the race calendar, they were advertised in the magazine, and they were run as a club championship race. The club had no choice but to include the results in the club magazine and online, and to recognize the champion in the club magazine. For those of you that have seen the club magazine, it is a 32 page magazine with lots of advertising and very few words. The results are included in the magazine. The CMV ran two articles in the magazine, one about the race series and one about the championship. The race series article was a single page and was there to show the members that the CMV was in fact running a race series. The championship article was a full page and was there to tell the members of the club that the CMV was in fact running a championship. The CMV wanted to run a championship. The club wanted to run a championship. The CMV wanted to advertise in the club magazine. The club wanted to advertise in the club magazine. The CMV wanted to include the results in the club magazine. The club wanted to include the results in the club magazine. The CMV wanted to recognize a champion. The club wanted to recognize a champion. It seems like the two parties were in agreement, but for some reason, the CMV is no longer in agreement. Since the CMV is no longer in agreement, the CMV is now a thorn in the side of the club. The club is now having to defend itself against the CMV. The club is now having to answer the questions of the CMV. It is now having to justify the club's actions to the CMV. The CMV is asking the club to do something that would have been completely unthinkable a year ago. The club is being asked to recognize a 'championship' that is not sanctioned by the club. The club is being asked to recognize a 'championship' that is not run by the club. The club is being asked to recognize a 'championship' that is not run by the club. What if there was a conflict with the championship? What if the CMV did something that the club did not like? What if the CMV made a decision that the club did not like? What if the club had
