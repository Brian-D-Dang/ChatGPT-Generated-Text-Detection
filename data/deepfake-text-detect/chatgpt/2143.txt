In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals , so they can't plead for mercy. And then there is RSPCA in Australia who has been behind a lot of animal abuse scandals over recent years but still operates with full government support, which means those animals have no chance at all. Maybe it's time governments across Western culture looked again how they treat domestic and farm animals? In my opinion that would be one step towards better treatment by our fellow humans too - something I think needs more exposure worldwide!
