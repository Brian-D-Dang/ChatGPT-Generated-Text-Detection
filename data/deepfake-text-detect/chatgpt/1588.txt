Oat blenders. Mini spooners. Coco roos. Honey Scooters. You know them. You see them in the cereal section of any grocery store. They are in giant bags in a metal contraption that looks like the top half of an old-fashioned ice cream churner, only they don't have the blades inside (we're not talking about your grandma's ice cream maker either). They're called "cookies." And while most people think of these stirrers as something to add texture and flavor for kids - or adults who want one more fun thing on their list before bedtime - we all need at least three of those sickly looking things sitting around our kitchen cabinets because it may be the only way we can get through each day with sanity intact. The reason? The pandemic has forced us to adapt; rarely is there such a time when you'll feel refreshed from making oatmeal every morning but still find yourself reaching for an iced coffee. To me this says everything I could hope to express: Pandemics suck! Even if everyone was super healthy, this would always happen after eating bad food. Or drinking too many drinks. But now COVID-19 just requires a little extra effort...and patience...for some reason. Shrug. Herein lies my issue with these cookies and why we've been saved by them since March of 2020.
