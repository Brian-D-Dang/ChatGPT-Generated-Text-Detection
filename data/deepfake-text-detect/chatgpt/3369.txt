I mean all jobs, such as police officers, military personnel, CIA operatives, security clearance applications, teachers, lawyers, and doctors. Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if you have any disabilities, while others will not, but may inquire during the hiring process or during a medical examination. It's important to note that it is illegal for employers to discriminate against potential employees on the basis of a disability, as long as you can perform the necessary job duties with or without reasonable accommodations. It's always important to be honest about any disabilities you may have, but also to emphasize your abilities and qualifications for the job. Additionally, it may be helpful to research and learn about the specific job requirements and the necessary qualifications beforehand to ensure that you can meet them.
