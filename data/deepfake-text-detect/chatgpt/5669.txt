To clarify my title I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable unless the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, or the child is the product of rape or incest. Abortions should not be legal because of the many reasons why they are wrong morally and legally. An abortion is when a woman takes medicine to have the child removed from the womb. Abortion: Overview Many people think abortion is a woman's choice. I am not one of those people. I believe that abortion is morally and legally wrong. Abortion is the termination of pregnancy before the fetus is able to survive outside the womb. A fetus is a baby during pregnancy. An abortion can be done in different ways. The most common way is by taking medication that causes the baby to die. This kind of abortion is called a medical abortion. Another way is by removing the fetus from the womb. Is Abortion Morally Wrong? Abortion is morally wrong for many reasons. The first reason abortion is morally wrong is because it is taking the life of an innocent human being. A human is a person with a soul. The soul is the person's spirit. A fetus has a soul. Therefore abortion is taking the life of an innocent human being. An innocent human being is someone who has not done something wrong. That is why the innocent should not be punished. There are many other innocent human beings who have done nothing wrong and should not be punished. These people are being punished with their lives by being sent to prison or death. There are also people in prison who have been wrongfully accused of a crime. These people should be punished. They should be punished for the crime they did do, but they should not be punished for a crime they did not do. Abortion: Legalities Abortion is also morally wrong because it is illegal. The law does not allow killing an innocent human being. Killing an innocent human being is murder. A person who is innocent should not be punished for the crime of murder. If a person is punished for murder, then everyone who is innocent should be punished for murder too. This is not fair to the innocent. Abortion: Illegal Abortion is illegal in many countries. The law in the United States says that abortion is illegal unless it is necessary to save the life of the woman. Even though it is illegal, doctors can still do an abortion if it is necessary. This is a good thing. It is better to have an illegal abortion than to have a baby when you do not want one. Sometimes a woman does not want to have a baby because she is in bad health or the baby will not be healthy. If the law made abortion legal, then many women would not want to have an abortion. Abortion would be like having an unhealthy baby. Many women would choose to have a baby even though it would be unhealthy because it would be easier than having an abortion. However, an abortion is much safer than having an unhealthy baby. The law says that abortion is illegal unless it is necessary to save the life of the woman. An abortion is necessary to save the life of the woman if the baby can kill her. It does not matter if the baby can kill the woman. The baby can kill the woman even if it is not completely developed. A woman's life can be endangered by the baby in many ways. If the baby is born, it can kill the woman by harming her. An unborn fetus is like an unborn baby. It can kill the mother by harming her. It can kill the mother by harming her organs. If an unborn fetus is in the mother's womb, it can cause a woman's organs to be in pain. A woman's organs can be harmed by the fetus if it is not in her womb. It can harm her organs if it is in her fallopian tubes. The fetus can harm a woman's organs if it is not in her uterus. It can harm her organs if it is in her cervix. Abortion is not necessary to save the life of the woman if the fetus is not going to kill the woman. It is not necessary to save the life of the woman if the fetus is not going to kill the woman. If the fetus is going to kill the woman, then it would be necessary to save the life of the woman if the fetus is not going to kill the woman. If the fetus is not
