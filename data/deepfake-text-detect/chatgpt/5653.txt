Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be "free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean you can't be held responsible for what you say." And it's true, of course, that the state cannot prevent people speaking. But if the state can't prevent people speaking does that mean that people can't be held responsible for what they say? The answer is no. The freedom of speech is a freedom from state interference, and so if a state cannot prevent people from speaking then there is no way in which it could then punish them for speaking. The punishment of someone for speaking would be an interference with their freedom of speech. But the punishment of someone for speaking is not the only thing that could happen if someone spoke. For example, if someone publishes a book or a newspaper then that book or newspaper will be read by someone else, and it could be the case that someone else reads it and is offended by it. In that case there are two ways in which the person could respond, they could take legal action to prevent the book being sold or they could complain to the media. If the person takes legal action to prevent the book being sold then that would be an interference with the publisher's freedom of speech, and so the publisher should not be held responsible for anything that is said in the book. If the person complain to the media then that would be an interference with the publisher's freedom of speech, and so the publisher should not be held responsible for anything that is said in the book. But it could be the case that the publisher publishes the book knowing that people will be offended by it. In that case the publisher could be held responsible for the hurt that is caused by the book. But in that case the hurt caused by the book is not a form of punishment, and so the publisher should not be held responsible for it. The publisher could still be held responsible for the hurt caused by the book in a couple of situations. The first is if it is a legal requirement that they should be held responsible for the hurt caused by the book. The second is if the publisher deliberately published the book knowing that it would cause hurt. But in neither of these situations is the hurt caused by the book a form of punishment. The hurt caused by the book would still be an interference with the publisher's freedom of speech. And so if it is a legal requirement that the publisher is held responsible for the hurt caused by the book then it is an interference with their freedom of speech, and so it should not be permitted. And if the publisher deliberately published the book knowing that it would cause hurt then that is an interference with their freedom of speech, and so it should not be permitted. And so if the state cannot prevent people speaking it does not mean that people can't be held responsible for what they say. So the state cannot prevent people speaking, but it can punish people for speaking. And so it follows that if the state can punish people for speaking then it can also punish people for not speaking. And so the state cannot punish people for not speaking.

But the punishment of someone for speaking would be an interference with their freedom of speech. But the punishment of someone for speaking is not the only thing that could happen if someone spoke. So the state cannot punish people for speaking. To sum up, if someone is arrested for breaking the law and it turns out that the person didn't break the law, and then the person is released, and then the same person is arrested again then it is not unreasonable to assume that the person broke the law. The person broke the law. The person is the same person. The person was released. The person was arrested again. And so it is not unreasonable to assume that the person broke the law. And so it is not unreasonable to assume that the person broke the law. To sum up, if someone is arrested for breaking the law and it turns out that the person didn't break the law,
