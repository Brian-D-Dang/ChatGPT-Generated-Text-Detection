Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. By this view I could understand why they were not to be exterminated (or even forced off). But there is an old saying: "An anti-semite loses his way." I was reminded of this argument when a friend asked me for my opinion on the topic of Holocaust evidence. He said he had never gotten such a good response from anyone in Israel because they refused to accept facts. To him, we simply did not have enough evidence. At that time, we still do not have any Jewish survivors who refuse to admit their own genocide. So it should come as no surprise when people ask what happened in the past. These days, those whom they know well can easily pick apart what lies behind our current reality. Many of them want to destroy us or their children. In order to learn about the history of evil - for example, what happened during World War II, and how it affected generations of generations. They also need to understand what happened after WWII. The most important part of these questions will evolve to include both true data and historical data. For example, it is argued that Mussolini's wartime policies helped people to achieve independence rather than fascism. It would be easy for one person to say that Mussolini created fascism only to encourage another to become into fascism by force of arms. That is exactly what happened. As you can see clearly at the end of the article, the Nazis, so many of them, still stand united against the world's darkest history. This is why I support a non-profit organization called "The American Jewish Committee" to help bring awareness to the Holocaust. This group offers education, advocacy, and research. We also solicit donations to help fund programs regarding the Holocaust that are essential to dedicated efforts to fight the spread of this terrible disease. Just like the Holocaust itself, too often we forget that our responsibility is to protect ourselves, not just our family members and friends. To counter this taboo, we must listen to our fellow citizens. Let us reject ideology and fight against prejudice. And let us come together to create a better future for all of humanity.
