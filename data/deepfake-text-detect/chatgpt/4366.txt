I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that it's their right. Statistically speaking this is true; however, there are several ways to measure sexual assault. For example, the National Sexual Assault Hotline recorded between 780 000 - 990 000 calls for service last year alone (not including those who called the hotline more than once). Calls like these therefore show that many women call the hotline feeling unsafe because they fear being raped or assaulted even though they know they have done nothing wrong. Unfortunately, rape doesn't always happen at a party. It could happen anywhere, anytime and can be anybody.
