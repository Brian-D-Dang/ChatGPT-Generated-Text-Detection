I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was shocked by the Costello-McGill movie Karate Kid! Nice idea! Thanks for sharing but the movie has been around since 1997 so now wherever you are everyone is saying it's not scary at all!!!:)
