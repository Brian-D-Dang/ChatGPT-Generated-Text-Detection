So, one thing that I have to preface this with is that I see both (all) sexes as equal, outside of a few natural sexual dimorphisms (Genitalia, ability to have (all) sexes -Women have an advantage over (all) men), and the ability to be physically free, and (I feel) equal, to men (or women and the ability to basic need (logic) or lack thereof), I see both (all) sexes as equal, and separate.) Outside of the aforementioned dimorphisms (Masculity) and (Feminity) (Genitalia).
