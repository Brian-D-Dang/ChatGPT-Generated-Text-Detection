I can only see socialistic systems (The harder variety that imposes 90 tax rates and such) work out in ethnically, culturally homogenous societies like the Nordic states, or certain Orthodox Christian majority countries. It would be interesting to look at how much of a difference egalitarianism had on their culture during those times compared with other non-egalitarian societies.
