I am a young black male, who is torn between both sides of the aisle regarding race relations in America. I have experience racial profiling and understand that there is still a long way to go to eradicate racism from our country. But when it comes down to specific policy proposals aimed at addressing these issues head-on, like those proposed by Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, they seem unrealistic. How can we believe someone truly cares about solving our nation's biggest problems if heshe will not support policies that would actually solve them? Why does Sen. Kamala Harris want to be president but refuses to say she supports Medicare for All (something every other democratic candidate has said)? And why are so many candidates saying they're willing to take on Trump, yet don't have any concrete plans to do so - especially as far as criminal justice reform goes? It seems people generally agree with me: We need bolder change than what most politicians are proposing. What is wrong with this picture?!
