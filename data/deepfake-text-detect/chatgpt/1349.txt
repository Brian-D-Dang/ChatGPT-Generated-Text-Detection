I'll try not to spoil anything here for people who haven't watched Game of Thrones, but this post is specifically about events in that show. So if you don't watch it and are reading this before watching the last episode then I'd recommend staying away from anywhere where major spoilers lurk until after you've finished! The Walking Dead is a pretty good example too...
