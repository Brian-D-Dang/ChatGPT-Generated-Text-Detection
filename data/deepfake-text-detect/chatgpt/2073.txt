In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want it (or at least making them think you'll do something else if they say no) IS rape by the letter of law because once consent has been withdrawn all sexual activity stops immediately and without question until explicit permission has again been given for each new act or solicitation thereof." i am not saying i agree with him but heshe could be in an abusive relationship where her partner would threaten violence against both herself and their child unless she had unprotected sex repeatedly...?
