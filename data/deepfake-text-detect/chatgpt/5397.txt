Climate change or global warming as it previously was known as is a hot potatoe and not a very clean cut science to predict. There are thousands of climate scientists who believe that the world's oceans alone will hold enough carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, but none have predicted rising sea levels can cause ocean lakes to become inundated with water at the end of this century if we ignore basic science. That means that billions more people will experience serious consequences for our future generations than scientists acknowledge now!" said James Hansen, president of the Greenland Science Foundation. "The climate crisis has already been unfolding since the 1990s; carbon pollution causes massive storms in seaside communities like Greenland and polar regions such as Greenland." Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders urged Americans to support the Paris Climate Change Agreement on Thursday night (Tuesday). Sanders told CNN: "It looks extremely unlikely that you're going to see an agreement before 2100 unless it gets passed Congress immediately," Sanders added, calling it "dangerous" that Obama didn't show up to sign onto the pact. Sanders announced his candidacy earlier today after a series of controversies highlighted the Democratic Party's failure to embrace cutting greenhouse gas emission cuts despite warnings from environmental groups about looming crises around the globe caused by global warming.
