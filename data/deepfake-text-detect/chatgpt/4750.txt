I say "killer asteroid" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth. I have three rules: 1) A killer-sized space rock must be inside our solar system (in other words it can't come close to hitting us). 2) It has to enter within the next 80 years or so (based upon current understanding of its orbit and rate of motion). 3) The impact should occur at a time when there are no humans living on the Earth either because they're already dead or their civilization is too primitive to stop them from being wiped off the face of the earth by an incoming meteorite. Otherwise you get megalithic monuments like Stonehenge that seem to make sense when viewed as ancient warning systems designed to warn extraterrestrial sapients about upcoming impacts with supernovas. The exceptions to these rules would include some kind of rare coincidence, such as: A) An ice giant that calms down sufficiently to change its orbits before we have satellites capable of detecting it; B) Some combination of planetary alignment or conjunction between two very distant objects where the moon doesn't interfere; C) Precession caused by another body which causes Earth's poles to shift periodically - though this may be ruled out based on recent evidence that the Moon might be moving faster than expected. As far as asteroids go, many scientists believe that most near-Earth objects will fall into one of four categories: Hazardous Objects, Potentially Hazardous Objects, Contained Magnitude 6 Rocks and Uncontained Magnitude 8 rocks. Anybody know if Asteroids 101955 YOR1722016 KR102 is anything more than theoretical? My guess is that something along those lines qualifies and since I've only got 30 seconds here... I'll use unfinished sentences (and abbreviations): An example of what happens when small bodies collide with Earth is Iridium, whose collision etched chunks all over northern Canada and South America. The remnants of numerous collisions littering larger planets' surfaces seems to suggest that this process proceeds continuously throughout cosmic history. As we move further away from the source of the molten iron core (ancient accretion), these violent events become less common and eventually cease entirely. But given finite resources available until human beings reach interstellar space travel, examining multiple stages of the evolution of terrestrial exoplanets for signs of past collisions could reveal useful information necessary for predicting future ones. In fact, studying Earth's innermost atmosphere (the upper 5 kilometers) may offer clues into how dangerous the surface environment actually is and whether humanity still needs 10 billion years to evolve technological civilizations. Extra credit anyone who posts pictures of hypothetical cover art for my novel! Bonus points if people post links to cool blogs discussing related topics (which won't hurt your chances, I'm sure.)
