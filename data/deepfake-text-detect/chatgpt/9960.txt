1.firstly most people who say it is justified don't understand what "justices" and are using it to say "it was ok!"in a more powerful way so a more fitting way to say it would be "it was acceptable" 2.It is not justifiable to harm another person in any way, as it is against the law and goes against basic human rights. Everyone should be treated with respect, dignity, and kindness.
