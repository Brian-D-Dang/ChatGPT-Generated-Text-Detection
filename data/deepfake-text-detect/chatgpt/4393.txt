Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the handicapped spaces are not available, even if there is a spot on the street closer to my destination or is it just that they don't want me paying any attention to them? I'll be honest and say that this kind of discrimination bothers me as much as anything. It makes no sense to have such few'special' parking spaces especially since most cities seem intent on making sure every space can accommodate only one vehicle at time (not allowing more than 2 vehicles per spot). This seems like these handicapped persons shouldn't deserve special treatment over someone who doesn't need it because people with disabilities can still use their cars too...and my statement here assumes all disabled person will pay attention to them when trying to find an open spot! So why should we make exceptions for an already small minority? Why aren't all those extra parking spaces reserved solely for the handicap section in places where you would normally park your car but cannot so people using wheelchairs might be able to get out easily? Does anyone know what goes into deciding how many handicap spaces to provide? And why does our culture so often treat those needing significant assistance getting around differently from everyone else? Seems some parties benefit by having us do so. The question then becomes whose interests trump mine and theirs? If it isn't obvious enough yet, I think we Americans tend towards being pretty selfish anyway. Not so sure about other nations' citizens though.
