This is a problem I always encounter when I drive on a highway. The speed limit in the most used highway where I live is 70. I usually go at 80 and sometimes even faster, but then people start going crazy because they think you're driving too fast for some reason (even though it's safer). It makes no sense to me that someone can be doing 30 below the speed of traffic while there are cars passing them like nothing I usualy go at 80 You might want to slow down but then people start going crazy Because if everybody started speeding up to match your reckless behavior we'd have more accidents than before
