During the first week alone [32 million people] downloaded a copy of a Game of Thrones episode. Even if only 1 of those people keep the file they downloaded after that and use it to re-enact every scene, or make their own fan art from them: still 32m copies sold in 7 days... [Note:] I'm not going into this any more than is necessary as it's unlikely anyone will actually read this far - but my guess would be that most were posted on some torrent site and then picked up by someone on another computer who had already "downloaded" the show (or at least part). For example you might have seen an image of The Hound with his head held under water.. until he pops back out again with no apparent damage done? That was probably me! It seems there are two types of scenes on TV these days that seem pretty popular for being used for screenshots Fan Art etc. One type includes lots of close ups so maybe its good practice to crop down your shots before uploading them - although here's one where LITTLE WIND WHISTLES gets cropped out entirely. The other type of shot comes when characters start talking about something important personal and their expressions change dramatically. You can see what happens here between Arya Brienne, Sansa Littlefinger, Salladhor Saan Cersei, Daenerys Tyrion, Jon Snow Davos, Jorah Mormont Dany much more. It goes without saying how many plots could be changed just by getting rid of a single line like 'I hope' during this sort of moment..
