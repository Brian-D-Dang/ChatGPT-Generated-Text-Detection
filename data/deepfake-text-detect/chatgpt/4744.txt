While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to be President. He is just too soft for politics and the American people are tired of listening to an old fart tell them how they should live their lives and who they can vote for or not. I don't think that you'll ever get agreement on this issue in any political party...it's one where some believe its 2nd Commandment (Thou shall not kill)...and others hold onto the fact that those on death row were actually innocent somehow....in a nutshell: we're all different - but we need to try harder than we did before to figure out if someone is truly guilty first...that way no-one goes to hell yet again based on flawed evidence sentencing decisions made long ago....so many people do terrible things to each other through ignorance, selfishness or greed....but there isn't such thing as "an eye for an eye..."when you've got both eyes gouged out then either your sin will heal by itself or else it won't because God doesn't work like that here on Earth anymore.....So Bernie agrees with me in principle, though he knows he has no chance of being POTUS...He wants us all to make up our minds about abortion at least - which means he could quit saying nothing...Personally I'm pro life myself most everyone who supports my position is also against taking human lives even when the mother's health is brought into question....he argues his point well enough without backing away from a tight spot...But having said that - he'd never stand a chance anywhere in America right now unless if he was willing to change his views on several issues to appease certain groups within the Democratic Party no matter how hard he tries not to...if anything changes regarding policy positions soon then perhaps my initial post wasn't worth posting in respect to his potential candidacy.. "A politician cannot give everything; only himself." Oscar Wilde Bernie Sanders' message resonated with voters across the country during three months on the campaign trail this year. A young man running for president who challenges corporate influence over politicians may resonate especially with younger Americans. And let's face facts: although Hillary Clinton isn't exactly scolding Wall Street executives, she certainly comes across as beholden to powerful interests. She didn't win the nomination until superdelegates jumped ship and decided to rally around her, after all. So why the difference between Hillary and Bernie? It boils down to two words: revolution. As Sanders says repeatedly throughout his stump speeches - loudly enough so that television networks pick up the audio - the world needs "a massive progressive movement ... toward economic justice and social fairness." That kind of rhetoric reminds older Democrats of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs, which helped bring millions of unemployed citizens back from poverty when there still weren't safety nets in place. FDR's legacy continues today among liberals and progressives, making opposition to big business appealing cross sections of society. Younger generations seem less likely to know much about history, however, which makes the idea of voting to expand government support for average working families sound especially attractive. At least according to recent polls, Bernie Sanders beats out every Republican contender except Donald Trump. His supporters prefer Obama over Romney, for example, while younger millennials say they'd rather cast ballots for Sanders over Senator Marco Rubio. This suggests that Sanders' platform might play particularly well among younger Millennials living in cities - places where income inequality is already extreme due to exorbitant housing prices - meaning large swaths of young women aren't inclined to support Clinton in nearly equal numbers. In contrast, older white men favor Clinton over Sanders by roughly eight points. Young black men, meanwhile, prefer Sanders by close to 10 points. Sanders has been waging war against banks since his days as mayor of Burlington, Vermont home state of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream Company and inspiration for Woody Allen's Annie Hall. During his 20 years in Congress, Sanders introduced a bill requiring that credit card companies provide customers with free annual statements, warning borrowers that late fees and interest rates increase annually. When asking whether something sounds good or not, AP Stylebook advises journalists to ask themselves, "Does this statement suggest bold action, such as declaring bankruptcy or walking off a job, or mostly talk, such as debating the merits of tax cuts or raising Pell Grants?" Anyway, as recently as 2007, Sanders called for financial firms to be broken apart; now he tells CNNMoney that major problems necessitate that big businesses leave Washington entirely. Such sentiments remind readers of another old-school blue collar Democrat whose campaigns soared in popularity partly thanks to populist stances on politics: Harry Truman. Like Sanders, Truman advocated breaking up monopolies and corporations, allowing workers to unionize, and offering guaranteed jobs to displaced farmers. For these reasons, subsequent presidents like Lyndon Johnson successfully championed policies aimed at helping alleviate disparities with new ones iced over temperature levels set by adjusting to lesser known values, to showmatches the system doing that epitax view
