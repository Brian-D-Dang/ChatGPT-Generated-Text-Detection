While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established players to be quite ridiculous. It's kind of like saying you are entitled to being able to punch someone in the face by punching them back in the face. This is just a silly comment fellow redditor. OP has no actual experience at all. If anything he thinks it would do him more good to ask for advice than help him learn how to play this game properly.
