I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at an actual computer screen (or possibly even using a tablet). The reason for this is pretty simple: once you learn how to type on a keyboard, typing becomes second nature and you can't stop yourself from doing so simply by looking down at your phone or other electronic device during your daily commute or whatever. Of course, there are still plenty of ways to practice and improve the way you write with a computer-based keyboard - but is it really necessary anymore? It seems like they're everywhere these days!
