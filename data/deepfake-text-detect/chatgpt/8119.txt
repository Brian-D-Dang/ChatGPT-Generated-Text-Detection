I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg . graphic depictions or descriptions). The point is, if you have something in your gameworld which might elicit such responses from players given their ageexperience etc., then it's good practice and not at all unreasonable for thereto be no depiction whatsoever until they're old enough -or mature-enough-, because kids need protection against potentially disturbing imagery without being bombarded with them when adult themes are more appropriate but perhaps inappropriate." - JachymSE
