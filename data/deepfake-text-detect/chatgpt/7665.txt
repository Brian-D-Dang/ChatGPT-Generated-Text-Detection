One possible counter-argument is that removing money from these industries would not necessarily reduce corruption, as illegal and black market activities would likely emerge to fill the demand. It could also lead to unintended consequences, such as a decline in job opportunities or an increase in crime if people turn to these illegal activities to make a living. Furthermore, censorship of certain industries could be seen as a violation of the freedom of choice of consumers who willingly engage in these activities. Instead, a better solution may be to focus on enforcing stricter regulations and punishing corrupt individuals within these industries, rather than punishing the industry as a whole.
