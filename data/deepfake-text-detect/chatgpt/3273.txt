So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to understand why this argument is used, since animals cannot communicate their consent in the same way humans can. However, consent is not the only factor when it comes to ethics and morality. The exploitation and mistreatment of animals, such as using them solely for human pleasure, is deemed unethical because of the suffering and harm it causes to the animals. It is also illegal in many countries. Animals are not able to understand or give their permission for sexual acts, and therefore engaging in them is a form of exploitation and abuse. Additionally, engaging in sexual acts with animals can contribute to the spreading of diseases and can have negative effects on the animal's health and well-being. Overall, even if an animal appears to participate willingly in sexual activity, it is still unethical to engage in such behavior because of the potential harm it can cause to the animal and the lack of ability for the animal to fully understand and consent to the act.
