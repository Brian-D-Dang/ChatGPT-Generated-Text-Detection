This is fairly straightforward. I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property. It should not matter what the use of that property is, because it's worth exactly what someone will pay for it. Yes, but how many times has anyone actually been able to get this law passed without a massive amount of campaign contributions? All states except Missouri have been able to do so since 1900... So in 2000 27 states didn't enact such laws? What changed that year? There was no change then either right?
