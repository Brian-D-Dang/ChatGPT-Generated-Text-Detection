So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to have a rational discussion about this, but the problem lies in how we define what circumcision actually means and also why its justification doesn't apply here. The definition of "circumcision" (as used throughout Wikipedia) and other sources defines it as cutting off part of the foreskin on male babies' penises at birth and leaving their foreskins intact for sexual pleasure later on. This seems pretty reasonable, but there's one big issue with it: if the parents want their kid circumcised, they can do so before heshe enters the world. Why would you rush into performing an operation without knowing whether your child will like it? If anything, my biggest concern goes towards sex change operations - imagine these people forced to go through years of surgery under threat of jail time or some form of violence if they don't comply... It just seems like the doctor could be doing them more harm than good.Even worse when considering the forms of genital mutilation which involve removing parts of female prepubescent genitals. The reason is unconsciousness. Even though doctors try hard not to hurt kids during such procedures, chances are high that someone does, since surgical instruments have sharp edges. When it comes down to it however, you're really talking about another case of medical experimentation no different from the procedure performed on fetuses discussed above by way of example. If anyone has decided to circumcise his own baby, consider yourself lucky that he didn't end up having severe complications and the experience ruined his life. In terms of judgmentalism, every parent who decides to circumcize chooses to damage their newborn regardless of what their reasons are; therefore, even if the potential benefits outweigh those risks, it still ends up being a very bad thing overall. You should never perform an irreversible act upon someone unless given proper informed consent. People make mistakes all the time, and sometimes doing something stupid is better than deliberately harming others. For instance, if someone insists on pulling out his eyes then he'll live with blindness until death whereas if he wants to die of starvation via self starvation then he'd probably rather die immediately instead of suffering for weeks depending on the severity of malnutrition. Note that in both cases nobody is going around forcibly taking away somebody else's right to choose whatever action they may wish. So while it might seem like a slippery slope fallacy, it's really not, since not everyone who agrees to undergo a particular procedure wishes to give permission for someone else to remove that same portion of his anatomy. Circumcision ultimately boils down to a specific situation where one person makes decisions regarding another person's body based solely on his personal condition and ethics.Considering that instances of infant circumcision occur worldwide and not only in western nations (in fact, many Asian countries practice it), perhaps it is fair to say that the real problem isn't adult circumcision per se, but rather the common misconception surrounding the process among ignorant societies. There always exist religions which forbid certain practices agreed to within local communities, yet they continue to thrive because ignorance reigns supreme over wisdom. While the former is considered immoral on scientific grounds, the latter entails sanctioning questionable attitudes simply due the lack of information amongst populations. Scientifically speaking, there are several examples where religious beliefs clash with reality (like creationists claiming dinosaurs were alive 6,000 years ago despite evidence to the contrary). If you can prove me wrong, please show me otherwise. Why aren't humans ever allowed to fulfill our natural instinctual desire for animal companionship? What harm does it cause society to allow us to fully express ourselves? Sexual intercourse between animals happens daily everywhere. We cannot create laws forbidding human sexuality either, so why would we single out one type of behavior that involves two simple organisms sharing love? Shouldn't animals receive equal rights too? How did citizens come up with this idea anyway? Are they insane? Werewolves are dogs? That means human beings now share DNA with canines! Oh god, how much longer must we endure this insanity? Anyone thinking along the lines of "religion says X and X is evil... religion said Y and Y was evil" is clearly retarded. Let's assume everything in your post is true. Now see FSM logic. These things happen daily all across the world. Not once did scientists find proof against homosexuality or bestiality. Doesn't mean it won't happen tomorrow. But hey maybe next time there'll be conclusive evidence that proves this theory wrong? Also, judging people by the standards set forth by outdated perceptions is a flawed premise. No matter how often science advances and disproves prior notions, some people refuse to abandon old concepts and ideas that definitely have nothing to do with truth. Others hold onto traditions and misconceptions because it gives them a sense of belonging as well as meaning. Either way, I guess none of us stand a chance.
