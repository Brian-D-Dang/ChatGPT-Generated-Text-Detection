After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read enough nonfiction in my life (academic writing, technical writing) to know what good nonfiction looks like, but unless it's written for fun or by someone who has an interesting story to tell, most "serious" nonfiction isn't worth reading after being published in book form: too dense, dry, droning. There are occasional exceptions, such as A Walk on the Moon, Neal Stephenson's account of his experiences up there during Apollo 11; however, even these aren't really novelizations per se - they're just entertaining stories about space exploration. In any case, those few really worthwhile pieces of nonfiction will probably never see publication, so why bother? If you want lots of great literature from which to choose, go ahead and pick up whatever truly memorable memoirs have been recently published, but if you expect some higher-quality nonfiction perhaps something with critical depth andor philosophical overtones then start looking beyond commercial publishers' lists and into self-published ebooks. My favorite writer of all time has got to be Ursula K Le Guin, whose imaginative prose, wonderful characterizations, and elegant extrapolations of science and philosophy make her novels feel almost like short stories, while still managing to take place thousands of years away in other galaxies. Her recent collections, though, belong firmly among the best ever written: The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia Earthsea Cycle Volume 1: The Tombs of Atuan Other Stories The Left Hand of Darkness City of Illusions Nightflyers I consider at least half of this list to be fantastical SF adventure epicism, not only because its characters often live several millennia outside our reality until they return home, but also because the plots themselves mimic ancient mythologies of their own. This makes sense when we remember that Earthsea was realized before Tolkien came along to create Middle Earth, but also now that Heinlein and Asimov have left us worlds populated by humans much older than ourselves. Some readers might find none of this appealing, especially since many fantasy novels seem designed primarily to deliver action sequences of varying degrees of archery violence, swordsmanship mayhem, magic battles, sword fights, political intrigue, epic melees, intrigues involving giant monsters, etc., etc. Still others may think it unbecoming to call them "epic." However, given the amount of awesome storytelling happening here, neither set of people seems right to me. If you enjoy fantasies of the sort described above, try out one or two of these three new volumes containing retellings of well known myths and legends. People sometimes say that sci fi can do anything literary fiction can, but I'd rather hear tales of interstellar travel than descriptions of earlobe coloration. One last thing: don't dismiss as inferior anything produced by professionals (even if you paid for it). Plenty of writers would trade places with authors like Robert Jordan and George R.R. Martin, especially in terms of prestige, fame, and fortune. On the flip side, if you want quality work done professionally without too much fuss or expense, look no further than Amazon! They publish hundreds of titles every day, some of which are genuinely excellent. None cost less than 2.99 USD, either. Keep your eyes peeled for self-publishing opportunities on Kindle Unlimited as well - a lot of the same traditional publishing houses offer free previews in order to attract customers who aren't interested in paying full price for material available elsewhere. So wait patiently, download the sample, decide whether it's for you based upon how captivating the author sounds, and buy it at once. You'll thank yourself later.
