If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be needed and there won't be a need for so many people wanting to immigrate from other countries. It's not like immigration brings crime with it either (at least I've never seen any evidence that this is true). There aren't enough immigrants to fill all available positions anyway, even if they were all criminalsterrorists. If we had an overpopulation problem then you'd expect more violence because everyone would have weapons but that doesn't seem to be happening right now despite our high homicide rates.
