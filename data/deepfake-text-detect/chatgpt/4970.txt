With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned as a separate community from the community. There's no reason that the entire community couldn't use a place where everyone could just be there to chat and things wouldn't happen in the same way that they do here because they'd see each other every day. There are plenty of white males who maybe aren't online but definitely try hanging out in chat rooms already iirc, find those discussions more than good enough for them
