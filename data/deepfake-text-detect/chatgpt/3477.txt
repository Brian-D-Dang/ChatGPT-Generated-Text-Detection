I think its fair to say that most people dont give a single shit about morality unless they're driven by compassion"their conscience" or worried about being judged by others for their actions. However, morality can be seen as a set of principles or values that guide behavior and decision-making in a society. While some individuals may not give much thought to morality, it is important to have a shared understanding of what is right and wrong in order to maintain social order and prevent harm to others. In addition, living a moral life can lead to personal fulfillment and happiness, as well as promote empathy and compassion for others. Therefore, it is in everyone's best interest to consider the moral implications of their actions and strive to live in accordance with moral values.
