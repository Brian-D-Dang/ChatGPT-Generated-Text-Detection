In spite of the imperfections of the USA and Europe, it still remains a truth that pretty much all of the most desirable places in the world are run by women. In 24 hours I've been to four countries where women have taken over their governments (Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan) as well as Singapore, India, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Argentina, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, Israel, South Africa, Iceland, Denmark, France, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Netherlands, Hungary, Croatia, Poland, Ukraine, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Bulgaria, Belarus, Romania and China. I'm not suggesting this list is complete or comprehensive - far from it! It's just some examples of what I did on my holiday last week; nothing more than a quick trip down memory lane when deciding which country best represents female rule at present.- Mary Anne Sieghart-Touchett
