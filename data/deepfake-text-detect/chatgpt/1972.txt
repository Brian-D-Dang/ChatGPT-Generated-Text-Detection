I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that are not part of the main 2 political party's (Conservatives or Liberals). Look at election coverage from around he world. There is no shortage on attack advertising, it just doesn't make headlines here because we're used to it.
