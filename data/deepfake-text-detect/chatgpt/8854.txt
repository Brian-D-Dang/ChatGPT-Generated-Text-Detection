I like Bernie, love his politics in fact. I doubt there is a politician I agree more with. I like the fact that, unlike most politicians, his rhetoric matches his actions and he's not afraid to push political boundaries. Bernie isn't going to be your congressman or senator. Look at his record of economic success and how much good has been done for people.
