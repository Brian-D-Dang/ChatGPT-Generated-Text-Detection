Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number who are talkers on TV, especially with a new book out like "Bushwhacked" by Paul Krugman...I just think it's really odd that we're talking so much more than ever before and still not having any meaningful change at all."
