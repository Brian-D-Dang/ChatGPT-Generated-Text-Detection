Let me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers , I'm just not a huge fan of the game on its own merits. The most recent update is supposed to add in.exe files for HOCL games so I thought this would be a good time to finally give them a shot and see how they play compared to the other two classic GoldenEye games from back when I was still into FPS gaming (and because my Steam account has been inactive for years). Who am I? My name is "MrSH" on the forums here. As far as what else I do with myself...well, you'll find out soon enough!;) As usual, we're playing against each other on Xbox 360, using Wired controllers, wired up over USB. We start off by taking our weapons out of their cases and save anywhere before beginning.From there, I begin with getting to know the controls which are very similar between all three - one button shoots your weapon, another reloadsteleports, etc. The difference being how hard these buttons seem to press or where they appear depending on whether you've got headphones plugged in or not. For instance, if you want your grenade launcher to go full auto rather than semi-auto, you can hold down 'X' 'Square'. If you have earbuds in though then it will fire automatically at whatever enemy happens to get in front of you; This doesn't change much until later stages but gets annoying after awhile. Similarly, pressing X while pointing at an opponent won't let you shoot him directly unless he's right next to you. Instead, it just teleports you towards his position. So really, once things become more frantic, you need to look further around yourself instead of relying solely on looking at who's in range.It seems like you can use left analog stick to aim shots as well if desired. But I found that moving away from enemies usually resulted in worse accuracy especially since the aiming reticule never moves with you. It didn't help that enemies were consistently darting about too either.I always had trouble finding Grenades since they're hidden in crates. Even adding friends helped little. Once enemies started spawning en mass during some missions (such as when destroying the entire Venom tank) I even resorted to spamming grenades in order to clear rooms quickly. Naturally, they weren't nearly powerful enough to kill any enemies without first killing everyone near them. That was fine though since my goal wasn't winning the match; Rather, it was simply clearing everything ahead of us in one fell swoop as fast as possible.Now, say you find a crate. Killing everybody inside turns it into ammo boxes that spawn throughout the level. You also recover health and unlock new powers. These powers include letting you use gadgets such as the Rapid Fire Rocket Launcher. Unfortunately it takes quite a bit longer to recharge now which means it loses effectiveness fairly rapidly. Time management becomes important as it splits apart into separate segments: Before dodging bullets to reload; After jumping across chasms to land safely; While waiting for cooldown periods to pass; And finally, hitting nearby opponents with cover points or grabbing power ups. Also, it became obvious pretty early on that bosses are immune to normal attacks and firepower only affects non-bosses. In fact, more often than not you can grab the boss and immediately run away having done nothing of note besides surviving thanks to inertia alone.After dealing with the aforementioned issues, the mission still isn't finished yet. Your main goals are still to take out the explosives, blow open doors, disarm traps, shoot passersby, throw Molotov cocktails, wave guns around randomly to intimidate people, pick pockets, shock guards, pull levers, and climb ladders. There's plenty more from what I could tell when trying to recall specific details from earlier exploits. Anyways, it took me awhile to realize something interesting: None of those actions actually mattered at all. When checking the console upon completing certain tasks, your character has no chance of dying. No matter how many times you die or survive to respawn, you continue onward regardless. Which is kind of weird seeing as how the game clearly states otherwise.For example, blowing up bridges results in a cutscene followed by a penalty to your score. Yet the same thing occurs no matter how high or low your score currently is. It does make sense why you couldn't lose access to items nor money however. Unlike the PS3 version, all currency comes attached with ammunition credits so losing all you have might mean having to buy additional rounds which costs real estate on screen. Speaking of which, you can't hide anything behind walls anymore. Everything disappears completely including viewpoints, useful objects, and any body parts that fall through floors. Very bizarre design choice IMO considering how easy it used to be hiding behind scenery for sneaky kills.This part of the review may become relevant sooner than later given its potential to cause problems. Since I haven't gotten data-flicker. To think it will assume that half-rates; Transparency; Very different expectations.And keep a constant associated with the attitude this implies that; Confverse tendency
