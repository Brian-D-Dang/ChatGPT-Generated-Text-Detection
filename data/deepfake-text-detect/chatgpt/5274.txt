EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis) used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People have extra feelings of confusion and distress about them because of their use as examples for what people think is normal behavior I'm glad people recognize it's not normal behavior
