The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. There has been a lot of talk about how this is the wrong direction for lesbians to take and what women can do when gay guys come out as bisexuals when they're naked but lesbianism is "normal." I think that would be ridiculous considering homosexuality in itself isn't normal at all - quite literally it doesn't exist! I don't understand why people keep saying things like "normies should just accept themselves..."
