I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, you're helping the world potentially by creating a child but in the long run is that really worth the hassle? Maybe once we get overpopulation issues and there are enough resources for everyone then yes, but even then killing two birds with one stone to solve problems instead of making more seems like a better option IMO Do you know what causes people to live longer now than they ever did before? Birth control pills! Use them if you think having your own kid would be too much work or take some time off from schoolwork if you don't feel ready yet.
