In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the 'slippery slope' argument that it's legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I'm not interested in arguing the merits of either side, but I think it's important to note that there are two distinct issues here - the legalisation of gay marriage and the legalisation of polygamous marriage. Even if one were to become legal, this does not necessarily mean the other would have to follow suit. Each should be considered on its own merits, rather than being linked together in a slippery slope argument.
