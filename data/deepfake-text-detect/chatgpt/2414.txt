Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one partner is not interested andor incapable of performing as desired? It can get to a point where you're just like "Well....this isn't going too well anyway so might as well give it up." It's really about how much resentment builds over time that makes things difficult at points
