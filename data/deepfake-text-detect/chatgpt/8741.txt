If addiction is a disease, why do most addictions end spontaneously, without treatment? Why did some 75 of heroin-addicted Vietnam vets kick the drug when they returned home? It's hard to say. Maybe the same answer applies to those who work on rehabilitation mental health initiatives or help addicts find jobs and homes. The East Coast is rich with addicts, but how many of them have died from the drugs after quitting? Drug abuse is not unique. There are similar crises that can be caused by untreated alcohol abuse or drug use disorders - ESSENTIAL DEATH IN THE SKY: THIS ONE IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY BORING REVIEW. Alzheimer's Disease: Preventative care for this condition has been in recent years made even more complicated by technological advances that allow us to diagnose it easily and quickly. The neuroimaging technology used today has essentially reduced our ability to identify and treat diseases we may have had no control over before. In fact, treatment systems now involve extensive research, tools and approaches that could vastly improve outcomes for patients suffering from many different kinds of symptoms. Stressful major depression can occur because of addiction to methamphetamine, cocaine and other illicit substances. Because drug abuse contributes so much to our overall well-being and comes at such high rates in some parts of the country, there are good reasons to think there might also be a problem with addiction. But why does addiction spread so rapidly within the community? The answer lies in the state's relationship to addiction. While significant amounts of states follow an Alcoholic Beverages Act (AB) based system where addiction is limited to certain groupings of people and the use of drugs and other dangerous substances, most of the rest of the nation follows an AB. States like California, Colorado, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin offer no federal law enforcement agency to enforce their own laws regarding drug and alcohol consumption per se. It's only natural that the number of Americans living with serious substance abuse disorder would increase. However, when considering what happened today and what might happen tomorrow, there's one thing most doctors should know: Some people will never stop working on rehabilitating themselves. This doesn't mean everyone should quit, but it does mean that the recovery process needs more time to fully heal. If someone doesn't want to move forward, treatment is often helpful.
