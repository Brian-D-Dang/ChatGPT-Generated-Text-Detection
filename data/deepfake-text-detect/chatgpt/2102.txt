Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 20,000 songs in their iTunes library they paid a lot of money for (and can't play on Apple's platform). What about Tidal? That one looks good too but how does that work with all your existing tunes?? Can you just plug them into whatever service and thats it or do you need some special softwarehardware to make sure everything plays right?
