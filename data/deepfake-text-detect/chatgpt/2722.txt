This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced by the understanding that there are some people who simply do not accept evolution as scientific fact; they may concede that it is a theory, or even just kind of vaguely acknowledge its existence, but refuse to believe it on any level. These individuals exist in all markets and countries around the world (as well as those that don't have access to the internet) so when you read my post please keep these people in mind. That being said, let us dive into what we know about our origins. The beginning - The Big Bang: Before time existed, nothing existed at all. There was no space and therefore no matter, energy nor light. In fact, if one were to imagine taking a cube of normal matter and stretching it out infinitely thin, this would be the same thing as infinity...therefore no-thingness. Once upon a time though, something changed everything forever. A singularity whose mass was inconceivably large suddenly appeared then exploded outward through spacetime creating everything that exists today. When asked how such a massive change could occur without another entity causing it first, scientists theorize that perhaps it occurred due to quantum fluctuations within it. Herein lies the catch however: Quantum fluctuations can only create changes in particle states, not entire universes! Yet somehow, that explosion created every single living thing that ever lived and continues to live today. How? Either the universe has always been here because of quantum fluctuation OR some higher power caused it to explode like that. I personally choose to believe it was God. We shall see why shortly. For now, the consensus among scientists seem to be that this event happened approximately 13 billion years ago (give or take). It eventually cooled down enough for particles to form from that original blast which became different elements (primarily oxygen hydrogen), thus making water. Then after billions more years came plants (and animals too!). Now, depending on your beliefs, since life started slowly evolving over millions of years before humans developed intelligence (which took roughly 100 thousand years or so), you might think that this means our species began somewhere else besides Earth. However, based off current evidence, most experts say we evolved right here on planet earth. Some also argue that human beings are actually aliens that crashed onto this planet thousands of years ago, but very few hold this belief seriously. Evolutionary Thought Processes: As far back as the early 1900s Darwin set forth his theories regarding "survival of the fittest," whereby the best adapted organisms survived while others died off. This idea fit perfectly within the era he wrote about where survival was about food supply and such rather than diseases and other natural disasters. Since then we have come up with greatly advanced ways to study populations of species (genetically speaking) and find correlations between them based on certain observable traits. One example of a correlation is body size, specifically head size compared to brain size. What this tells us, is that larger heads require less blood flow per beat of heart equaling greater endurance and better ability to survive in harsher environments. Larger brains raise metabolic rates requiring increased calories that an organism must eat to fuel their activity levels, etc. You get my point. All of these things factor directly into how well an animal maintains homeostasis from day to day, allows it to adapt faster under changing conditions, and ultimately makes it 'fitter' than others. Think of it sorta like this - If I work hard during the weekdays I want my weekends to be full relaxation so I need a slower metabolism rate; On the contrary, someone sitting in front of the computer screen reading articles 247 wants the opposite so their calorie intake should be higher. So basically, variation breeds improvement in almost all forms of nature; whether it be person to person or species to species. Continue Reading
