WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in this community aren't even on here anymore, so it's kind of hard to follow all these things while you're reading a post about them I was just talking with my friend recently and he told me something really interesting. He said his parents would be fine if he had an online girlfriend or wife (he uses "wife" because its common use) but they wouldn't like any friendships outside their own familyfriends circle. It makes sense why someone might want to do that, especially when some times relationships turn into marriage! But what does it mean? What can happen if your mom found out that her daughter is friends with another woman who isn't related at all? This has been bothering me lately since there are several girls in our class whom we have become close with over time. One girl in particular has shown interest in one of us; she asks questions about ourselves frequently, as well as gives advice sometimes. The problem comes in when I realized that by befriending her I've given away information, though not intentionally, which could make me seem weird or inappropriate. She seems nice enough though, and I'm sure she doesn't care about that...or maybe she does?! So now I'm worried that I may hurt myself somehow. Do other guys feel concerned about this? Doesn't anyone else think that having somebody you know casually talk too openly about yourself is kinda lame? Is it normal or strange to worry about everything that happens around female acquaintances? It means that you are basically being used for sex. There's nothing wrong with this per se - everyone needs something to get off every once in awhile [but don't go thinking you'll find love in many cases]. However, you should know that there are plenty of women who will take advantage of you in order to have free access to your manhood. They may appear friendly at first, however those initial "friendship-type conversations" tend to move towards sexual favors pretty quickly...so you need to steer clear until you see signs that indicate otherwise. Unless you want to end up getting laid more than half of the time, you won't be able to count on her playing fair unless you develop an emotional attachment...and keep in mind that in order to form such attachments you must treat her like a real person. Being sexually involved with a virtual stranger is going to ultimately result in frustration and heartbreak. You're better off looking elsewhere for companionship. If you are truly interested in finding real love, then you have come to the right place. We have thousands upon thousands of profiles written by users before yours asking similar questions.

Thank you for sharing Lexie! My brother is 19 yrs old and lives with his mom dad. His dad drinks everyday and smokes pot most days. When his dad gets drunk he harrasses him constantly. Sometimes he threatens my bro, mostly with physical violence. All the kids in school call my brother names behind his back and tell him how stupid he is. According to my brother his father physically abuses him often. Should he leave home? How can he afford college????? Any ideas?? Thanks for listening... He's either living in terror or trying very hard to avoid confronting reality. Leaving home physically to escape abuse may indeed save his life but emotionally speaking he'll never fully recover from leaving - and being forced into exile is no way to grow up. Your best bet as far as I'm concerned is to confront the situation head-on. Tell your parents exactly what's happening and demand they stop allowing and enabling. Seek legal counsel immediately - if he wants to stay alive he cannot return without proper protection. Find out the laws pertaining to child custody visitation rights - if he seeks to gain full guardianship over you he may try to convince judges that you're different type social to enter created to view jockey two chances to vote pooling rates out a large percentages' points that others'?
