Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. That's why they get no love from the same people that like Timbaland and Kanye West But I have been listening for years now, I don't want your'special' insider info on who you think gets it right, because there isn't any...There is only one person through which someone decides if something is good enough to buy: YOU! If by some chance you find an artist worthy of being heard (or rather buying) then maybe we'll know but until then, keep dreaming. No need to tell me what I'm missing out on. Just tell us how many credits you acquire daily
