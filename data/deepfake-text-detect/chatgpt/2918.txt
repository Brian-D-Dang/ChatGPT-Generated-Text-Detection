Headlights are mostly useful for improving the driver's vision while driving in low-light conditions and for increasing the visibility of the driver's car in low-light or foggy conditions. While stationary, headlamps provide a limited amount of light to illuminate an area around the vehicle. Head lamps also serve as signalling devices to warn other road users about dangerous situations, such as low tire pressure, damaged brakes, or engine failure with sparks or fumes. The term "headlamp" is sometimes used interchangeably with "driving lamp," especially by vehicle manufacturers; however this usage may cause confusion among non-professional drivers who equate the two terms. Highway signs often use the word "headlamp" instead of "highway lighting." In British English, they refer specifically to what many would call'main beams' (or on older cars, sidelights), not full headlights. The American automotive industry generally uses highway lighting when referring to both turn signals and main beamsidelight combinations.
