Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one of you is not sure if he is ready to be married? I used to think I was a single man (at least until my first marriage) because of how much I loved him and how lucky we were that he understood us each other so well. Now it seems like we have been living together since our teens, whereas before we couldn't really hit it off. Until recently, I had only dated girls from high school, college, and university, so I didn't know what kind of relationship I was in at the time. It has been years since we have gone on an actual date, but today, I don't think there is anything wrong with having fun without the help of someone else. The problem is that even if you are totally happy with your life, most women who weren't as involved in their lives as you would have liked will just fail to find love again. That is something I do not agree with, although I guess that is what makes this sort of thing scary. To me though, it feels unfair to feel cheated out of getting married - or at least not able to get married, which is why I felt guilty that I wasn't able to get back into dating sooner. I also think that overall, however, the more people around you care about you and want to work things out, the better off you are going to be in the long run. It doesn't mean you should feel bad about it, but if you feel justified, then I don't know what to tell you. Am I right? No, but I can definitely say that I thought I could finally get back into dating as soon as I decided to let go of all my hopes and dreams.
