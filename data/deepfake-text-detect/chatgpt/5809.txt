This is purely from anecdotal, self researched and experiential knowledge, so feel free to correct me if there are any glaring issues in my position. I believe that some of these are also valid for the general population, so it's not just me. Low carb diets, have been around for ages. Many believe that we are naturally carnivorous. There are many people who believe that we evolved from monkeys, who are also carnivores, and we are naturally carnivores. Which is not the case at all. I have also read that we are not designed to digest grains. It takes over 7 hours for the body to digest grains. Most people's digestive system is just not designed to process grains efficiently. This is one of the reasons why many people suffer from gut issues. The one thing we have in common is that we are mammals, which means we can digest and process dairy and meat. So, if you are vegetarian, that's fine. If you are vegan, that's fine. If you are not vegan, that's fine too. If you are vegetarian and vegan, that's fine too. What I would like to know is why the obsession with being vegan when it doesn't make any sense. Veganism is just a fad diet. It's a fad diet for people who don't want to count calories. If you are vegan because you believe in ethics, that's fine. If you are vegan because you want to be skinny, that's not fine. There is no science behind being vegan. Veganism is also not a diet that makes sense for me. I was born in a vegan family. When I was little, I didn't eat any meat and I was very healthy. When I grew up, I wasn't a vegan, but ate a lot of meat. I also ate a lot of chocolate and sweets. I wasn't very healthy. When I got older, I stopped eating meat, but I still ate sweets. I ate a lot of pasta. I was still not very healthy. I also tried being vegetarian and eating fish. I wasn't very healthy. I have always believed that vegans are doing themselves a disservice by being vegan. I don't like the idea of being vegan and getting sick. I don't like the idea of being vegan and not being strong. I don't like the idea of being vegan and being weak. So, I'm not a vegan. I'm not a vegetarian either. I like to eat a lot of meat and fish. I also like to eat a lot of fish. But, I try to keep it to a minimum. I eat lots of eggs, and lots of chicken. I eat lots of cheese, and lots of yogurt. I don't eat many nuts, because I'm allergic to them. I'm not a huge fan of pork and beef. I don't eat much lamb. I have no reason to be a vegan. This is my decision. It makes sense for me. I don't care what people say. I don't care what people do. I'm just trying to be a healthy person, who eats a lot of meat. It's that simple for me. I don't eat a lot of vegetables. I prefer fruit. I like to eat fruit salads. I also like to eat fruit juice. I like to eat tomatoes, and avocados. I like to eat a lot of nuts. I like to eat lots of seeds. I don't eat a lot of vegetables. I don't eat a lot of grains. I eat lots of starches. I eat lots of rice. I eat lots of noodles. I eat lots of spaghetti. I eat lots of pasta. I eat a lot of bread. I eat a lot of potatoes. I eat a lot of pasta. I eat a lot of fish. I eat a lot of meat. I eat a lot of chicken. I eat a lot of eggs. I drink lots of water. I drink a lot of tea. I drink a lot of coffee. I drink a lot of juice. I like to eat lots of sushi. I like to eat a lot of cheese. I like to eat a lot of yogurt. I like to eat a lot of salad dressing. I like
