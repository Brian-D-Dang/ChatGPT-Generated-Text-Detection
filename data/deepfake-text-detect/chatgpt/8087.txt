After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read too many novels whose plots were so obvious it was like watching paint dry - or reading my own screenplays as they went from script stage over complete draft then back again till at least one major plot twist could be found out dunh dunhh. It's just not worth investing in all these completely pointless stories when there are plenty which actually say something interesting about life (not necessarily accurate but nonetheless true). I'm an average reader who tends towards literary science-fantasy stuff rather scientific sci fihorror material such some Stephen King type work although if fantasy fans want me on their side for warring with elves? Sure why wouldn't you assume we don't have enough wars already! [Not being sarcastic; this would most certainly happen]
