While it is true that extinction rates have increased significantly over the past century and many species are being threatened, it is important to consider that humans have the ability to take action to prevent the worst outcomes of a mass extinction event. There are a variety of conservation measures that can be implemented, such as habitat restoration and conservation efforts, the introduction of breeding programs for endangered species, and the reduction of factors that contribute to extinction such as pollution and deforestation. While it may be difficult to fully reverse the damage that humans have caused to the planet, it is possible to slow down or even halt the rate of extinction with effort and dedication. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that we cannot stop the sixth mass extinction from occurring.
