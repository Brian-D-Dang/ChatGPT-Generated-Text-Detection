Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, so I'm just going to go ahead and post my own opinion on the matter here: I think it's perfectly fine for parents or teachers (or anyone else) who feel strongly that vaccinations shouldn't be required to make their own decisions about what vaccines are recommended for children based upon that information alone. However, since we still have no way of knowing how well the vaccines actually work against the diseases listed in those lists will they really prevent all these deaths? Will there really only ever be one vaccine that works against every disease? If someone can give me some justification as to why this is exactly wrong, then I'd like to hear that story too because I want to understand more than just anti-vaxxer arguments. There are many reasons not to vaccinate. The most obvious being the fact that you do harm to your child by refusing - such as putting him at risk to get sick himself until he gets vaccinated. But there are also other things people would rather put their kids at risk for including autism spectrum disorders. It's been mostly proven over the past decade that vaccines do increase the chances of an autistic kid having ASD at least once during his early years of life, though this was probably due to environmental factors anyway. Of course there may be more cases out there, it wouldn't surprise me if there were. That doesn't mean that vaccines cause autism, but again - the evidence shows vaccines are harmful in the short term. Another reason not to vaccinate could involve allergies - if you have reactions to certain foods after getting shots, say peanut butter, then yeah, allergy rates tend to rise. As long as it's thought MMR won't introduce allergens into your system and you aren't allergic to peanuts, then I see no issue with mandatory immunisation. However, if you're allergic to something that other people think is 'natural' and therefore safe to administer to yourself, if it does come up even once in a generation, then maybe it should not be made compulsory. Then it becomes a choice rather than a directive - for example, whether or not to inject yourself with mercury fillings and know that it might result in a lifetime of brain damage, or if you prefer taking a pill instead depending on your mood in between. Maybe this will change when we learn more about the brain... It's hard to tell. But even if it didn't affect your ability to perform basic tasks efficiently enough for society to function properly, it seems to me that we shouldn't require people to take medications which are administered without their consent simply because we cannot help that population given our current understanding of medicine. I guess there is always the option of preventing autoimmune conditions from arising through selective vaccination strategies, but they need to be done with extreme care, and often lead to side effects that outweigh the benefits. It's important to remember that people have different moral inclinations regarding medical beliefs. Some don't believe in anything, whereas others believe that science is fairly objective, while others believe they are responsible for creating reality based on whatever philosophy they subscribe to. I am sure that within each group there will be multiple beliefs. My personal belief is that it'd be better to educate people about the risks of medical advice before they start thinking about whether or not to listen to doctors. And hopefully, more education leads people to decrease reliance on doctor-approved medication. So I suppose what I'm saying is that I am less concerned about mandating vaccination policies in order to reduce suicides, than I am worried that another way of looking at it will result in another tragedy where too many innocent lives are lost.
