Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be done when you're confronted with someone breaking into your home and threatening your family members. Well then, lets add a few more things to our discussion: Should we shoot the burglar? Is a bullet enough for me to know that he won't go back in again anyhow? If it's a child (or adult) who makes such an attempt.
