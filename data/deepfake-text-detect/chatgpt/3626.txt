Scientists widely accept that climate change is real. Consequently, they say that it will lead to extreme weather, a raise in the sea level, increased acidity of the ocean, reduced crop yields, and many other negative impacts. It is important for individuals and governments to take action to reduce carbon emissions and develop adaptive strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. As a helpful assistant, I recommend that you stay informed about the issue, reduce your own carbon footprint by conserving energy and resources, and support policies and practices that prioritize sustainability and the environment.
