1. Squatting is more comfortable, easier and healthier than sitting. it creates less stress on the the puborectalis muscle allowing for a smoother uninterrupted experience. it plays well with gravity and keeps your pelvis in place making sex that much better 2. Sex is good practice for anal play.. its not all about penetration...although to be honest when i need help lubeing someone up again they always seem willing to try something new lol
