First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from our experience in France. It's kinda disheartening when you think about it, but maybe there are a few different countries out there who could have been happy with our lives or at least allowed some people to come in and do their own thing without being on our side? You're right about that, we definitely did not allow multiple people into the house! We've tried to make sure that each person had the opportunity to visit the place where they were born and get their own book so that everyone has one!
