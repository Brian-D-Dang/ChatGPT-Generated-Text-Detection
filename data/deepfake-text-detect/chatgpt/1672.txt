Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I don't really want in the room anyways and few of them will actually drink enough for me to care what happens when they get too drunk. So now I have time slots from noon-2:30 pm on Sunday afternoon where i can invite friends who either would like a beer or two or three but not much else (alcoholics) or are in town visiting family because we just moved back here after living over there since 3rd grade (hi mom!) I decided to go for the latter group this weekend which feels pretty good. We're going downtown to an Italian restaurant called "Crisp" at 2pm. Anybody know if the waiterswaitresses ever show up? Or do you need to stand around awkwardly waiting until somebody decides to come talk with you before someone comes by to take your pitcher away?
