(A) Work part-time in high school; Then go to college (B) Work full-time before you go to college (C) Work while you study in college. I was a spoiled lazy 15 year old who wanted out of my parents house, but i didn't take the above options for granted and realized how much work it is to get into college. I'm now working my way through community college trying to make some money so that I can buy an apartment on my own. This was a very interesting read! Thanks for sharing.
