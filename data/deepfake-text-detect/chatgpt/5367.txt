I just read this [article] stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering the disparity in wealth between black Americans vs Asians, which is very much based on our views of how many people are poor compared with white folks because we should be better off economically overall but don't look like us. Lets see if you catch my drift. If you dont, It's not racism it's just blind hatred towards blacks native americans.
