I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically it's an unlikely event in most cases to occur within urban areas (and if you read my blog on this topic last year then we've already seen what can happen when these things do). The biggest issue is transportation: there are lots more people living near reactors than any other type facility currently being built anywhere else besides big cities like Tokyo or London where population density means they're probably going live next door anyway! As for radioactive waste... well yeah obviously its horrible stuff so hopefully some day someone will figure out how best disposerecycle fuel rods safely without them becoming 'hazardous' again after 20 years at which point putting into storage until something better comes along seems sensible enough? That said sometimes accidents just seem inevitable regardless; even walking through Chernobyl city now feels pretty damn eerie .
