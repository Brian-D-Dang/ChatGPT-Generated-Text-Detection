I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural choice. As an Asian-American, using chopsticks has always seemed like such a pain in the ass even though it's not difficult... so what happens when you have something so simple and seems hard? You end up wasting time just because you're trying to make it look harder then it needs to beit takes more effort then normal eating?
