Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my friends have started to make it personal (not including me) by not eating meat. I'm still trying to stop eating meat now since it's hard for me to get along with people who eat fish and fish food at the same time, so this is just another reminder that I am not going to change; I do what I want to do! What are some ways you can help people eat more healthy? Any tips would be greatly appreciated!!
