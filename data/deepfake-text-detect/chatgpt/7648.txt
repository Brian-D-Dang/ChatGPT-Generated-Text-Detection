While toilet paper has been a common practice for years, bidets have also gained popularity due to their effectiveness and sustainability. Bidets provide more hygiene and cleanliness as they use water to clean and rinse, while toilet paper can leave residue and bacterial buildup. Additionally, using bidets reduces the usage of paper products, making it a more environmentally-friendly option. Moreover, in many parts of the world, bidets are more commonly used and preferred over toilet paper. Thus, it is not accurate to claim that toilet paper is better than bidets.
