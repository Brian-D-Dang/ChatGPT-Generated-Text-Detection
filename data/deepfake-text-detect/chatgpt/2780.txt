Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a proxy war between the US and China: Cheap labor in North Viet Nam meant that companies could move their factories there to avoid the higher wages they'd have to pay in America; American corporations invested heavily in South Vietnam because it would let them sell goods into China without tariffs (which are taxes); Chinese businesses bought large portions of land at lower rates than what other Vietnamese were able to buy. Now, if you're an investor and your business depends on selling products like automobiles or electronics, then perhaps the idea doesn't sound so bad: cheap labor means less overhead for your company. If you've got a factory laying around with extra capacity, maybe selling more isn't such a big deal either. But when you think about how many Americans died during those three yearsor worse yet had loved ones who never came back from the war (I lost my father) you start seeing things differently. The problems being discussed right now cover far, FAR more than "teaching creationism" in science class. That's only ONE example of one topic. The problem here is that we as a society REFUSE to talk about these issues openly, give equal time to all sides involved instead of parading our views solely under the guise of "religious freedom," etc.. We won't even discuss any other topics seriously unless they are linked directly to religion (and even THEN very few will listen) despite the fact that much bigger changes can be made by making sure women have access to birth control, ensuring gay men aren't forced to undergo surgery against their wills, enforcing strong safety regulations within industries relating to manufacturing practices (i.e. chemicals metals), providing food stampswelfare benefits to low income families... THE list goes on and on. As long as we refuse to look at each issue individually and instead insist upon placing blame based solely on our respective religions, nothing WILL get done!
