Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as a freshly made restaurant pizza. However, frozen pizza offers convenience and affordability, making it a popular choice for many. To improve the quality of frozen pizza, some tips include cooking it on a pizza stone or preheating the oven to a higher temperature than recommended on the packaging. Adding your own toppings or using higher quality frozen pizza brands can also make a difference in taste.
