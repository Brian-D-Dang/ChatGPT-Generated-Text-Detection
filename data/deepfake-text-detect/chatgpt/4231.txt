I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the top ten, because I envy fiction's ability to depict events and situations as they really are. It just makes sense in my head. It took me a while to realize that the reason you love fantasy is because it allows you to create your own world with no outside interference and then live in it without ever having to worry about reality intruding into your fictional universe. But that isn't exactly how it works.
