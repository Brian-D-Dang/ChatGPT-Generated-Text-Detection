First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are lost in the wilderness due to climate change at a time when millions of people live on land (and where you can live on land for a living). But what about forests? Are there any forest based ecosystems that could help you save some or even all of those shepherdsbears? I mean if shepherds were already endangered they would be go extinct because nobody else has them. They have very little habitat and they would probably die out rather quickly. There's also less biodiversity around trees than other plant life.
