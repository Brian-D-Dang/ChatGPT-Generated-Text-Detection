Reverse racism is not a real thing because racism is based on institutional power and systemic discrimination that has been historically perpetuated by dominant racial groups. The term "reverse racism" falsely implies that racism can only occur towards the dominant group. However, any form of discrimination or prejudice based on race is racism, regardless of who holds the power in a particular situation. It's also worth noting that when members of marginalized groups show resistance towards discrimination or express their frustrations with oppression, it often gets misinterpreted as reverse racism. In essence, to claim that reverse racism exists is to ignore the historical, social, and cultural contexts in which racism operates.
