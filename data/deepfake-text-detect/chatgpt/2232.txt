Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll say thank you for the responses! Well it was an amazingly well-reasoned opinion piece that actually added something interestinghelpful into rpolitics discussion rather than just being political trash... so people are responding in kind.
