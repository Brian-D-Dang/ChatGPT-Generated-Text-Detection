This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced by the fact that while it's tempting for us as Christians to think about why God allows evil in our world (especially when we have been personally affected), those who are suffering should never feel like their pain or tragedy isn't important enough because someone else has had a worse experience or more severe injury than they have experienced. The Christian message of love must supersede all other human emotions. I hope no one reading this gets offended at what you might read below; my prayer is simply that if nothing else, your heart would soften towards "the least of these" - whether it's here on Earth or somewhere beyond its borders: When Christianity comes up against some pretty dark topics such as abortion, euthanasia etc., there often seems to arise from within the church very strong reactions which can border upon feeling angry towards doctors, scientists or even parents. If perhaps any good came out of Hitler and his regime then surely was this intense hatred? But maybe not... While looking back through history Jesus said quite clearly that he wouldn't come into Jerusalem riding on a donkey unless everyone also threw themselves down before him... Couldn't this statement mean something similar now? Do so-called rationalists really hate children dying unnecessarily just as much as Nazis hated Jews being gassed!? We need to remember that Christ died for everybody! You don't necessarily want to use babieschildren as examples, since obviously most of them die anyway either way!!! However lets look instead at another example where terrible things happen every day; car accidents. In reality though far too few people seem concerned over the number of innocent lives lost ever year due to road traffic accident compared to say gun crime which kills hundreds each week without making headlines. So how do we explain this? Maybe we shouldn't try and make sense out of everything?? Perhaps sometimes bad stuff happens which doesn't fit neatly inside logical boxes?! Sometimes life feels unfair!! What could possibly justify killing thousands of babies per annum? How does anyone sleep at night knowing they did absolutely nothing apart from work hard take care of kids yet somehow ended up getting shot dead whilst criminals get away free time after time??? Why didn't the criminal just confess himselfherself on death row rather than causing untold misery beforehand???? Isn't there anybody left outside America who cares anymore?! When WWII broke out were Nazi's considered heroes then????? Can somebody please tell me exactly whats going wrong with humanity lately........
