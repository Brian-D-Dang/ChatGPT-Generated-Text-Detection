A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off. [Watch the launch video to understand why I'm excited.] In the U.S., there is an ongoing debate about whether the new smart speakers are aimed at a certain demographic and not everyone - some people just want more options than others - which could put them in a different situation. For example, I think Alexa needs a little more attention from Amazon. In the future, I believe that all technologies will play an important part in helping us form our own identity and value system within ourselves, with more than 20 billion people. However, if we continue to ignore these trends and innovations that are gaining traction in recent years and build up their role as personal devices for generations to come, we may find ourselves facing choices that leave us way behind.
