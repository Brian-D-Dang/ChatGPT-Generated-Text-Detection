I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing , and the business makes money on top of that. That would be true if there were no competition in price. If you had two grocery stores next door both selling 5 bananas one has an opportunity (or perhaps even a mandate) to undercut the other's banana prices and get more customers by doing so; this could carry over into all sorts of competitive markets where people have incentives for trying harder or working smarter etc. What they're actually charged doesn't matter much anyway but I'm not sure why that should stop them from being able to charge what they want?
