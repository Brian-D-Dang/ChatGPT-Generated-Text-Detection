While I am not at all for the scare mongering and paranoia, I simply think that there isn't enough evidence to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept The evidence isn't there yet to show that GMOs are completely safe to completely accept. I have seen some disturbing studies showing that GMOs can be contaminated with harmful toxins and chemicals that can make their way to the human food supply. There are simply too many unanswered questions and still too many unknown variables to give them the complete confidence that we should have yet.
