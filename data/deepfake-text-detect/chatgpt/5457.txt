I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with lamb chops. It makes me feel good when someone is willing to feed me some lamb chop soup instead of eating pork chops or chicken soup. You could say that eating lamb chops definitely isn't kosher (the lamb we're eating here doesn't have any beef in the broth). Actually it does not need to taste bad there are no meats permissible for lamb consumption as they don't roast their own bones. Would you recommend lamb chops? It seems more appropriate than lamb chop but not sure if it would still work well unless one just wants lamb mutton chops is all:)
