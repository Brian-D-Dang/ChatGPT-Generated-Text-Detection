There must have been thousands of times when I was talking about a hypothetical person when it came to picking pronouns and I chose the pronoun she or he, maybe because I was trying to make a point about how society is female centric. So when I started writing my book, I thought I would choose a she. I had also chosen to give her a somewhat androgynous name, Krista. But after writing a few pages I realized that Krista wasn't acting feminine enough for the story I was trying to tell. She was too much of a tomboy to fit my description of a young woman. So, I changed the name. But I felt bad for my Krista character, so I decided to make her name a male name. I chose Matthias because it was something my parents had considered for me as a child. When Matthias was born, my parents realized that they had already chosen that name for me as a child, but they didn't tell me. As a child, I was always asking them if they were going to name me Matthias. So, I think I owe Matthias a big thank you. Another thing that really stuck with me about Matthias was the fact that in the Bible, Matthias is the man who was chosen to replace Judas in the apostle line up. Judas was the one who betrayed Jesus and so Matthias was chosen as his replacement. I thought it was interesting that Matthias was chosen to replace someone who betrayed Jesus. I wondered what it would be like to betray someone you love and then have to do something to fix the mistake that you made. So, Matthias has a huge burden to carry and he ends up doing something that I don't want to give away. But, I promise, it is worth the read! Matthias is a man who has a lot of secrets and a lot of pain in his past. He is also a man who has a really big heart. Matthias has been through a lot and he just wants to make the world a better place, even if it is just a little better.
