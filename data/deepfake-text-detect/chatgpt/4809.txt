Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move onto another topic. On top of this there are those who actually wish for a public execution and enjoy watching others suffer or kill animals as entertainment but also point out what an awful thing it was when they watched something similar in their own country. So can we all stop talking about animal cruelty so much? It seems like some people love hearing themselves say things over and over again even if nobody else cares about them saying anything at all anymore. In my opinion - whether you watch magic acts on TV or not - no murder should be deserving of the death penalty nor its punishment. If this were true then why do people get invited back to host cooking shows after murdering someone; does being good with food means one can never offend anyone's palate ever, ever again? Why only certain crimes deserve punishments while other ones don't even warrant a mention (like child molestation)? And why would anyone give a second thought to murderers seeing as they'll probably just spend most of their time behind bars anyway. But really let me ask: Do any of us know enough to say definitively where something falls within the spectrum from pure evil to perfectly justified? What if our views fall somewhere in between completely indefensible and fairly defensible given that each person has different ideas of right and wrong? Can we honestly make such judgements without knowing more facts than ourselves for every situation? If not then why do we suddenly feel compelled to judge (and criticize) something which appears quite clearly to be important to somebody? Am I the only one thinking about this? One day maybe I will try getting into politics since I've seen the world go insane because of politicians' opinions all I want to see is solutions, not arguments, and everybody gets upset about absolutely nothing unless you put your mind to making yourself look ridiculous by continuing to speak up against irrelevancy! As always thanks for reading and taking part in discussions:)
