I've been pursuing a lot of scholarships and one of the things that irritate me is that there are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my gender or race. "It's very frustrating because I think all students should have equal opportunities, whether you're black, white, male, female." The scholarship offers from the University of Texas at Austin as well as other universities say they will be offering 75 million dollars in scholarships for Texas high school graduates who attend college this fall and meet admission requirements.
