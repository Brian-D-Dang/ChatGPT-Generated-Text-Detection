Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of research and study, I've come to the conclusion that vaccinations are extremely important for both individual health and to create herd immunity. I understand it can be difficult to go against what your parents believe, but it's crucial to prioritize your own health and wellbeing. I would recommend discussing your concerns with your parents in a calm and respectful manner. Share the information you have learned and make sure to clarify any misconceptions they may have about vaccines. Remind them that vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective, and that their choice not to vaccinate can have serious consequences for not only themselves, but for others around them. If your parents are still resistant to the idea of vaccination, I would recommend getting vaccinated as soon as possible. Many pharmacies and clinics offer vaccinations for adults, and it's important to protect yourself from potentially dangerous and preventable diseases. Additionally, if you plan on having children in the future, it's important to make sure you are up to date on all recommended vaccinations to protect both yourself and your future children.
