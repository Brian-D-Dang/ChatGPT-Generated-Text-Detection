Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the animals' skin and bones become covered with water and muddy mud. If you have an animal that needs rescuing, contact rescuer's office for information on how to help them get there safely.
