Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just post the most important stuff below. Thanks for doing an AMA! 1) What is your opinion towards the recent upsurge of "cartoonish" houses in the United States? Is it worth being afraid when you're about to buy something new (or even a house)? Or maybe if you can afford a small house like that, why not live there? 2) Do you think that governments should build country-side infrastructure as well or should we focus on protecting our environment more? 1) You know those old cartoons where the big cartoon characters are standing on top of their own castles while little kids play in the streets behind them? That's what I would call America now....or at least my country, Canada. Cartoons and Farce aside, I don't understand how people have their heads so far up their asses they couldn't see through the bullshit. It was never going to be perfect - our cities need construction every day until we run out of space. We just need to get over ourselves and learn to accept reality instead of trying to build a future civilization from scratch.
