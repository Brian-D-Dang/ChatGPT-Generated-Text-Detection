I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by speaking out and potentially causing conflict. I think it's best to respect other's beliefs and opinions, even if I don't necessarily agree with them. It's important to create an environment of understanding and respect. That doesn't mean that I have to condone everything that someone may say or do, but it does mean that I should be open to hearing their perspective and being willing to listen to what they have to say.
