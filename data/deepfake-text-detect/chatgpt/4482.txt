I'm a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find sillytrivial. I'm currently dating a girl who is a hardcore feminist (which for me personally isn't actually that bad). But she's like "Oh you need to do X" or "you shouldn't worry about Y because it doesn't affect women." I realize there are many different types of feminism. But in my opinion as a male, what could be better than being able to have sex without worrying how your partner will react? Sure if someone comes up to you and says something unpleasant or even puts their hand on your genitals (!) then yeah maybe its time to grow some balls and give them an answer back! Furthermore where did anyone here get the impression that prostitution was OK etc.? Whatever happened to love thy neighbor. If people want to sell themselves they should be allowed to at least not put out the message that people don't deserve basic human rights when selling themselves. In fact maybe we just start encouraging this by saying everyone deserves respect regardless of genderracesexual orientation... etc.. Am i missing anything obvious here? It seems reasonable to say that small businesses should be closed down - although that may mean more unemployment. But why are feminists such hypocrites on these things though? We clearly aren't doing enough to combat rape so lets take away all power from men too?! On another note can anyone recommend a cool girlfriend profile pic that shows nothing? Something elegant yet subtle. The only one I've seen has been taken off Google images and I wish to avoid using stock photography that might come busting through looking something else online. Any help appreciated. ChiefWaz: Yes I am aware of what they're trying to achieve. Having said that I think the methodology is naive as well. I also believe it sends the wrong signal when certain groups try to gain political capital by applying pressure onto others to join a cause. For example would you support a campaign against Burma from Aung San Suu Kyi's party when her own country perpetrates much greater atrocities against minorities? Why is this acceptable? It simply means excluding non-western cultures that happen to mirror our current society. And thats a problem. We live in a world of free speech nowadays wether it is right or wrong. Do you really expect us to curtail freedom of expression whenever there is any hint of violence and hate towards a particular group of people? Nobody wants racism but surely banning a book which promotes racist ideas undercaters to those who hold views based upon race and culture rather than personal belief? Isn't that supposed to go against democratic principles anyway? With regards to articles on social media sites probably 100 accurate. Blood tests show pregnancy rates plummet after divorce. Anyone keen on reporting positive results regarding relationships or marriage must know that data exists otherwise it won't be reported. It's a pretty simple concept to grasp. Even if your mom happens to be into BDSM with kinky toys and "fetish objects," does it make sense for you to judge her behavior instead of leaving room for acceptance and tolerance? After all wouldn't that teach you lessons about equality and accepting differences within yourself as well as between individuals? Wouldn't that lesson be applicable in real life situations later on? It's funny you mention abortion, considering modern day birth control and in vitro fertilization give womens fertility choice as well. So if half of marriages end in divorce, you could argue that the reason behind that statistic is due largely to lack of communication and trust issues - both problems rooted in patriarchy. This leads me to ask whether the rise of single parent households is linked to feminism or female emancipation in general. No matter what side of the fence you choose to sit, it can never justify denying choices to women for health reasons, financial issues, preference and religion. And yes ljdeboer - Japan is very westernized now and is generally regarded as quite liberal and open-minded overall. Of course since the 'bubble phenomenon' didn't last long nobody pays attention anymore to this reputedly backward Asian nation. Maybe I'll eventually see eye to eye with feminists and change my mind..but until then I repeat Don't HATE THE PLAYER; Hate The System....if you wanna see hatred manifest itself look no further than PETA who hate animals as much as feminists hate men...so maybe this website or blog isn't exactly the place to air those controversial discussions unfortunately: (Good luck with everything mate! Great post! Thank You!! Thanks for commenting, guys:) For years now I thought of myself as somebody whose values were aligned perfectly with most of the articles written here. That changed during college when I started going through some heavy introspection concerning topics such as consent and body autonomy. While I still stand by almost every point made above (and agreed with some), it got me thinking about why I didn't feel truly good about these opinions before. As pointed out by commenter Bubblesense, part of it had to do with unauthentic behaviour. Part way serious rejection, especially if work boots getting along with ferrrister decided for illumination You're setting What:20 team
