I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community, but as a person who has experienced discrimination at work today because of my gender identity, it is important for me to educate myself on what they mean when they say they are gaybi people What do you think makes you feel discriminated against? Also, how do we know you aren't homophobic? Does your parents still hate gays in any way?
