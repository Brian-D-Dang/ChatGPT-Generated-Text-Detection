I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any place in the universe where you can live forever, I'd probably pick that planet." "What about Heaven and Hell?" asked Alec. "Aren't those places real? Are we going to spend eternity somewhere else besides Earth or are we just stuck here for all time?" She shrugged her shoulders as if she didn't know the answer either way. She looked at me again with a slight smile on my face before answering his question. "Actually, I don't think so - hells aren't mentioned anywhere in the Bible. But why would Jesus say something like 'paradise' if he meant heaven when most of us think he means what we call Heaven today?" Alec was still confused by this information but did not show much emotion other than starting to blink rapidly. Maybe he wasn't used to having conversations with teenagers who knew more things about him than he did himself. Most likely, though, he was considering how best to respond to her bombshell revelation. It seemed pointless. The conversation had already taken an unexpected turn. He could only wonder where it might lead next. CHAPTER 3 EARLY MORNING SUNRISE AT THE MOUNTAIN TOP HOTEL IN NEW YORK CITY WOULD BE A DIFFERENT KIND OF EXPERIENCE THAN ANYTHING ELSE ALREADY SEEN BY ALEX AND HIS COUSINS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO DISCOVER THE ORIGIN OF HUMANKIND. THEY HAD SPENDED LAST NIGHT IN FORTUNE VALLEY DESPITE HOW LOUD THE MUSIC WAS PLAYING THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THAT FARMHOUSEBAR NIGHTCLUB APPEARANCE WITH STEVIE NICKS, BUT IT DID NOT PREVENT THEM FROM SLEEPING RESTFULLY UNTIL THE TEMPTATIONS OF COFFEE AND POPCORN BEGGED AGAINST ALL RESPECTS OF GOOD TEA AND ROASTED POTATOES. SHAWN ENTERED FIRST INTO THE MAID'S ROOM AFTER SECRETLY MOVING ABOUT SOMEONE'S TRASH CAN OUTSIDE HER FRONT DOOR BEFORE HE ARRIVED AT THE OPEN CLOSET WHERE SHE LAZILY STOOD WAIST-THIGHSHOLDING UP A PILE OF WHITE ROBE. WHEN ANOTHER MAN JOINED HIM INSIDE THE GUEST HOUSE, THERE FOLLOWED ONLY ONE REASON WHY: TO LEAVE WITH WORLD CLASS BREAKFASTS EACH MORNING. IF YOU HAVE NEVER TESTIFIED TO GOD OR CREATED YOUR OWN DEFINITION OF WHAT EVOLUTION IS SAYING, THIS DAY WILL PASS WITHOUT OBJECTION AS LONG AS YOU ARE PARTYING LIKE EVERY OTHER WEEKDAY MORNING ON OCEANSIDE DRIVE NORFRITTSBURGH...AND SWIMMING RIGHT HERE! The five cousins were now standing outside their room looking up toward the lights illuminating the top floor. Despite the early hour, Alex couldn't help feeling a sense of anticlimax upon seeing them filled with light and energy from opening his eyes after getting ready for bed the night before without noticing anything through closed eyelids. They were hanging around near the door waiting for breakfast since everyone wanted to get started ASAP. Nobody slept too late in New York City before working out during the day. Although some guests actually took advantage of the hotel gym facilities, its massive size made it impossible for anyone to stay inside long enough to plan workouts in advance. Shawn turned to see Alex coming down the stairs. Shawn smiled wide at Alec because unlike his cousin, he was incredibly hungry from being awake and alert while thinking constantly throughout last night. To keep himself entertained and away from thoughts concerning food, he pulled open a drawer inside the small closet that held lots of cleaning supplies and paper towels only to find scissors. His mouth opened wider as soon as his fingers brushed against the sharp edges of the metal blades. Immediately concerned over cutting himself on a piece of cloth he quickly grabbed a towel instead. Before he brought the scissors back into sight, his hand lingered above the drawer long enough for one thing to catch his attention. There, staring right at him, was an envelope addressed to Shaan Patel. After picking up the letter and reading it, he saw another envelope addressed to Alec underneath it. Both envelopes appeared suspicious and almost guilty. Concerned, he handed both letters to his grandpa in order to decide which one needed his immediate attention first. When Granddad read the first one aloud, the expression on his face changed dramatically. As expected, his reaction was different than what happened when he read the second letter. Granddad also had no idea whether or not such letters could possibly have been written intentionally for them. However, the fact that he wouldn defused bombs, poor young people taking care of.
