In the usa gay marraige is always being debated in the media and in politics. Like most controversy in the usa it is assumed that there are only two sides , those who want to be with their partner regardless of gender or orientation, and those who disagree. In reality, however, there is a third group - those people who prefer not to think about it at all but just because they have had bad experiences or because they don't feel like being out yet. Of course this means that while we as a society do not discriminate against anyone based on sexual preference (in fact I suspect that many conservative politicians would love to see the number of sexual partners drop), what happens when you get married? What will happen to your civil partnership? Will they take away any benefits if you choose to marry someone else? Are you treated different from everyone else because of your sexuality? All these questions have been going through my mind since I found out about this issue. And now that I'm engaged, the subject is more personal than ever before for me! So much so that I almost can't believe that I am actually writing this. The prospect of discussing my sexual relationship history as part of my wedding preparations makes me cringe and feel uncomfortable; something that I've never felt associated with marriage. But, a quick google search has told me that an estimated 2 of heterosexual couples still refuse to discuss their sexual pasts during planning or during the process itself. This strikes me as odd given how common homosexuality is in our country. Why would people avoid talking about this topic? I understand that some people may fear the negative effects that come along with coming out to family, friends and even colleagues (this was my experience). However, what about other people? Does refusing to talk about sex make them less likely to become gaylesbian themselves? Isn't it important that people know exactly where they stand? Is it better for them mentally, physically, emotionally etc? It seems to me that refusal should be dealt with by professionals rather than generalised fears among families. Another interesting point raised up recently is the idea of 'traditional' marriages and how they differ vastly from same-sex relationships. Many people assume that traditional marriages involve a man proposing to his girlfriend and then having sex with her. If he wants children, doesn't she need to agree first? Isn't this a bit sexist? Certainly though, both men and women go through this process - aren't we all doing that right now? Traditionalists argue that such a relationship does exist, it's called "the heartbreak of waiting" (or similar) but it isn't really true. According to NARAL Pro-Choice America, 90 of American women without disabilities wait until age 35 (before the age of 18) before getting pregnant. For one, legally, marriage is between a man and woman, two consenting adults. There is no requirement at all regarding fertility which in turn means that women cannot be forced into unwanted pregnancies. Secondly, pregnancy requires certain medical procedures (like C section, antibiotics due to infection or even carrying the child till birth in case of complications), giving a pregnant woman a chance to say goodbye to her unborn child. Marriage, on the other hand, shouldn't. You're married, it is supposed to last forever. When was the last time you saw a picture of a couple getting married and thinking, 'I wish mine lasted longer'? Or were you too busy worrying about what your feelings will be towards each other? But that's not the whole story. What did happen after you got married? Did anything change afterwards? Did things work out? Were your lives easier or harder somehow? That's the question that needs answering. Only when people start talking about this will it begin to gain traction here in the uk. We seem to be moving slowly forward toward acceptance within the LGBT community. To do otherwise wouldn't help us.
