Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that I have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. I started playing Lol because it was the biggest most popular game in the e-sports world at the time and I wanted to get involved in the scene. I had played LoL for around 2 months and quickly became bored with the game. It was just to casual for my liking. I looked for a game to replace it and found Dota 2. At first I thought it was very similar to LoL but when I started playing it I realized it was much better. Dota 2 is more strategic, you have to play more carefully to keep the team at its peak level. You need to keep your heroes in the right positions so that you can react to situations and make the right decisions. LoL is more of a mindless button mashing game. You just spam whatever your hero does and if you do it often enough you will probably win. The gameplay is better in Dota 2. I don't know about you but I like a bit more thinking involved with my gaming. The game itself is much more fun as well. The first game I played of LoL was in an open beta match. We were playing a game of 5 v 5. The first game was a complete massacre. We lost 20 minutes into the game and the guy we were playing against was a level 30. He was a terribly inexperienced player, but still he had 30 more level than us. The reason why we lost was not because he was better than us, but because he simply had more time to level up. Everyone in the team was frustrated and no one wanted to play. I decided that this game was too hard and I wasn't going to play it anymore. In the next game we were against a guy of equal level and he won the game. It was a 40 minute match and it took us 20 minutes to get our first point. I learned that this game was more like a lottery than anything else. You could get very lucky or very unlucky. I didn't want to play a lottery so I decided to play Dota 2 instead. The gameplay is better. It's much more strategic and engaging. In Lol I just kept pressing buttons and hoped for the best. In Dota 2 I have to think and it makes it much more fun. I have heard that in Lol you can have a higher win rate with a lot of practice but Dota 2 requires more skill. Dota 2 is more like a board game in a way. If you don't play your heroes right you can lose the game. You can't just do everything at the same time and get a lot of kills. You have to decide what to do and when to do it. One of the reasons I think Dota 2 is better is because it is much more strategic. In LoL you just have to spam buttons and hope for the best. In Dota 2 you have to keep your heroes in the right places so that you can react to situations and make the right decisions. LoL is much more casual. You don't have to think as much. You just spam your hero's abilities and if you do it often enough you will probably win. Dota 2 is much more strategic. The gameplay is much more engaging. Dota 2 has a lot more depth to it. It is much more strategic and you need to think more in Dota 2. In Lol you just spam your abilities and if you do it often enough you will probably win. The game itself is much more fun. It's much more engaging. You don't have to be a computer genius to play Dota 2. In Lol you have to be a computer genius to play it. In Dota 2 you can just play it with the default controls. The controls are very easy to use. In Lol you have to use the keyboard, which most people find very difficult to use. In Dota 2 you can also use a mouse and play it with a mouse and keyboard at the same time. In Lol you have to use the keyboard, which most people find very difficult to use. In Lol you have to use the keyboard and the game itself is not so user friendly. You can't even pause the game. Dota 2 is more like a board game in a way. If you don't play
