The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to decipher all the new words that some people have just read from the books. I'm not saying they're wrong on their part but we already know what's going on here. We've been told this a thousand times, but there has also been repeated criticism of the U.S. system, including the way it treats immigrants.
