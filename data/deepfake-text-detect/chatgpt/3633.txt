I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites That's a great interest to have! The field of data science and machine learning is rapidly growing and becoming more important in many industries. Since you already have some experience with web scraping, I would suggest you start by learning some programming languages and tools that are commonly used in data science and machine learning, such as Python, R, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. You can take online courses or tutorials to learn these tools and languages. There are many online resources like Coursera, edX, Udacity, and Khan Academy, where you can learn the basics of data science and machine learning. Also, it is essential to remain updated about the latest developments in these fields, so it would be a good idea to follow some prominent data scientists and researchers on social media, attend conferences, and read research papers and articles to stay up-to-date and learn more about the latest trends and developments in this field. Try out some hands-on projects and explore open data sets, learn how to preprocess data, visualize it, build models, and evaluate their performance. This will help you build a portfolio and develop your skills in data science and machine learning.
