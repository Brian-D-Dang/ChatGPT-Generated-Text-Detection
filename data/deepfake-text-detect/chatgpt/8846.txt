I believe that Congress should have only one chamber, rather than two, one with proportional representation (the House of Representatives), and one with fixed representation (the Senate). The process by which they can do this is to ensure the full participation of all citizens. Many people who are not well informed about these measures don't know how to vote. They lack any understanding or interest in voting. They simply cannot help but feel disenfranchised because they don't see something in their rights as democratic values. If there were no electoral system for citizens' votes, then it would be very difficult for them to vote. Especially if they felt disenfranchised by a lack of democracy.
