Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better. If that is so, what is the point in reading fiction? PS I have been a reader for many years and enjoy it very much but find myself drifting away from it lately because I've found my own imagination has grown as well (as well as other things). Frankly if you'd asked me this question 15 or 20 yrs ago I would not be using reddit to ask such questions! I think there's more than one aspect here: Fiction helps improve your writing skills, which can immediately apply to real life scenarios where you could use them - whether in work, school, etc. A lot of fictionliterature focuses on improving yourself emotionally. Some people feel like they need to do something about their emotions before moving forward with their lives; others simply want an escape route from reality.
