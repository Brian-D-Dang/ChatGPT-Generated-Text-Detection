A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off. [Watch the launch video to understand why.] BTW: Amazon currently offers an Alexa voice assistant for 25 and you could get a free Echo smart speaker with your purchase. Just use the Echo Dot in conjunction with your Echo Dot and you'll have complete control over everything that comes with your Echo Dot including your own personal assistant. It's also possible to buy Alexa speakers on Amazon Prime Video or Amazon Music Unlimited products from the Prime Video Store via Prime Now instead of going through Walkman. Amazon recommends using Alexa whenever possible because it allows you to send commands directly into Echo devices while listening up to 50 less speech processing power than ever before thanks to Alexa.
