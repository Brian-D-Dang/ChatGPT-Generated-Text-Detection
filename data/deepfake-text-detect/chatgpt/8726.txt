Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than anyone else. The party the opposition talks about should be called the Democratic Party of Sweden, which it is not That's not how it works. If you vote for a party and it fails to win then it becomes the best one anyway. When we want to keep our own identity from being changed, we have no choice but to leave it behind. We voted for the same thing when the Swedish Independence movement came into existence that was still very visible. It's been passed down generations and generations of people who are lost just because they don't like their political system anymore. That doesn't make it an effective government. Our current government has absolutely nothing to do with international relations or foreign policy.
