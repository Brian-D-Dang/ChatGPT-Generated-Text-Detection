I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was horrified. The story of Alan Turing , the British mathematician and cryptanalyst, who broke the code used by the German Nazis during WW2 and created the first computer, is known to be a fascinating one. It was a key moment in the war, but was sadly overshadowed by the secrecy surrounding Turing's work and his subsequent arrest and conviction for 'gross indecency' in 1952 (he was prosecuted for having sex with another man). Turing was offered the choice of chemical castration or imprisonment, and chose the latter, dying two years later from cyanide poisoning. His death is considered by many to be a suicide, although others believe he was murdered. So, is the film fictionalised or not? Did he really work with a hunchbacked assistant in a shed in the middle of a field? Did he really break the German code? Did he really have a romantic relationship with a young man called Christopher? (which is important to the plot) The filmmakers, and the writer of the book, Andrew Hodges, have chosen to fictionalise the story. The reason for this is that Turing's life is now public knowledge, and he was a man who was so secretive, it would have been difficult to dramatise it without having to fictionalise. I think it was a good decision, I think the film could have ended up being ridiculous if they'd tried to portray it as a straight biography. So, what was fictionalised? Mostly the romance between Turing and Christopher. The film spins a fantastic romance between the two men, and they are seen together in a number of private moments. It's a romance I wanted to believe in, it's a romance that could have happened, the film makes you believe it did. While there is some truth to the love affair, it was actually very brief and passed in a few days. However, the relationship and the film itself are very romantic, and I am sure that the film has encouraged many people to believe that this relationship was true. The film doesn't mention that Turing was prosecuted for his homosexuality, and the film doesn't mention that he was prosecuted for being a pacifist. It does however mention that he was a pacifist, and that he refused to fight in WW2. This was very important to Turing, as he was a pacifist and wanted to be a conscientious objector, however he realised he was the only person in his unit who could do what he did, so he chose to fight. The film doesn't mention that Turing was a methodist. He was, and although not important to the story, he was very religious, which was important to him. He believed that God didn't make mistakes, and so he believed that everyone was gay. He believed that homosexuality was not a choice, and that the only way to change his sexuality was to change the way he thought about it. This is a key point in the film, and it's very important to the plot. The film doesn't mention that Turing was the first person to create a computer. It's true, he did this while working on breaking the code at Bletchley Park, and he was very proud of it. He was the only person to get the job of building his own computer, as he was the only person who would take the job. He was the first person to believe that computers would be a reality in the future, which has now come to fruition. The film doesn't mention that Turing died of cyanide poisoning, or that this was possibly murder. I'm not sure that I agree with this, I think there are a few valid reasons why Turing may have taken his own life, which are all linked to the fact that he was a gay man in the 1950s. The film is a good film, a true story, but it is a fictionalised one. However, it has spurred on a huge amount of interest in the real life of Alan Turing, and that's a good thing. If nothing else, the film has raised awareness of the issue of homosexuality in WW2, and the treatment of homosexuals in society in general. I think it's an important film, a good film, and a
