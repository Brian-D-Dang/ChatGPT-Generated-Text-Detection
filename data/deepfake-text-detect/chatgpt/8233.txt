We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been "thin shamed" or "skinny shamed" by another woman. I don't see how that is possible in American society, but if it should happen to you for any reason at all (like maybe your mom told the other girl she doesn't like her body) just remember this: I am so sorry things are hard right now and my words did not help them feel good about their bodies!
