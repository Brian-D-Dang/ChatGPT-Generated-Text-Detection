I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is one thing that we can be sure about, it's that our lives and the world are going through countless transformations as time passes by. We learn new things from each other and build upon all of these knowledge building on top off what has already been learned. Things simply evolve over time and so do we. How could anything similar happen without some sort of evolution taking place? It would make absolutely no sense for things to stay stagnant unless they were unchanged since our first ancestor existed in primordial form. Now if you believe that something exists outside of us then obviously an external force does exist that pushes certain changes into motion. This should lead us to think of a creator who created everything we know today (the universe, humans) at its very beginning which happened billions years ago. So how did he create us starting with nothingness because according to science every single particle was either non-existing or just started existing at zero point? So if we assume that God doesn't exist, based on your own reasoning (you said "it makes no sense why should we even say that someone else might exist watching over us? There is still something out there - call it spirit, god, whatever. If we posit the existence of this being, let's say he has two goals: 1.) To watch over his creation 2.) To interact with us more often than before. He uses us to find another living beingsa soul mate etc. What happens next depends on a lot of factors such as ourselves, the people around himher and also what kind of person he chose to become. Does he want him to go crazy, kill himself, get addicted to drugs or alcohol etc? Then again maybe he wants him to live happily ever after like Santa Claus... Maybe it will turn out better than expected though If you don't believe in a heavenly father, doesn't mean that he didn't exist. You may not agree that somebody watches over us but you are willing to bet and do whatever it takes just to win right? Just imagine yourself having the opportunity to talk to this being anytime you'd like. Who wouldn't try their hardest to convince them? They won't actually listen but hey give them credit that someone tried regardless of the outcome. The winner gets the prize! Right? Please tell me where exactly you got those numbers. Also what planet exactly you're talking about here? Would love to see video evidence to support your claims. And while we're at it, please explain to us how you came up with the idea for the "big bang" theory.Please put "infinite universes" somewhere near the middle of this conversation. That topic belongs close to the conclusion of this whole debate. This site is run by real human beings who feel threatened by your claim that there is only endless amount of space instead of infinitely many variations of space. Which is basically asserting that all space contains multiple copies of itself. Allowing people who believe in both infinite variations and multiples to agree with eachother, allows everybody to carry on enjoying themselves while maintaining common ground. Heh, well you seem to really enjoy arguing so much that my suggestion had absolutely NO effect whatsoever on your attitude huh? You continue demonstrating that you lack the ability to understand certain logical concepts yet refuse to acknowledge that fact. Let alone apologize for making baseless statements. Duh, sorry bud! You have lost this argument. Your views will never change a mind that is free thinking enough to question religious beliefs. Okay now this sounds interesting but I have my doubts about this. According to Christian mythology, once man was made, Adam Eve ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (The Tree Of Knowledge) and thus became mortal beings. Now for whatever reason, man felt cheated. Once immortal gods were tired of waiting, they decided to take matters into their hands and went against the orders set by their creators to start the flood as punishment for eating of forbidden fruit. In Noahs day, the earth was flooded resulting in total chaos. A few days later (approx), water receded and gave rise to dry land providing fertile soil for plant growth. Man began planting crops, animals followed suit, civilization arose and mankind was able to walk upright. However due to floods occurring fairly regularly, humanity settled down on concrete islands that remained above sea level and eventually developed ways of keeping track of days and seasons. Eventually men discovered fire, domesticated the animal kingdom, built cities and conquered the rest of the world. Can the story be true? Sure it probably is but what is the scientific explanation behind it? Perhaps some part of the Bible isn't entirely literal? These posts show little understanding on your side. First, none of those links provide proof of what you state directly under the title 'proof'. Second, you've stated several times that the arguments presented by Breivik are circular. Third, my claim. Fourth, your attempt to convert others' faithless category B passing the look reserved for talking to display elegance kept away with trying to remove
