Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and tell everyone they are from China. After a while this attitude is no longer acceptable anymore so their friends have to end up breaking the news to them that Person A is Chinese but really Americanized. Person B comes over and tells you how he came to America and his story about his grandparents. He happens to still think of himself as an American even though he has lived for many years in China. Since Person B cannot speak to you directly Person C chimes in. He speaks as if he were born and raised in the USA too, but he does not know what to say because he doesn't want to come off as a fool. How would things go down if Person D had just told you? Would it have made any difference or did your friend have to make a bad choice at first?
