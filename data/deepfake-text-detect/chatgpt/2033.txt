I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal products. However when it comes to making vegan pizza - this time last year my skills were still pretty basic so just thought I would share what's worked for me in terms of recipes from various places (mainly blogs). The base ingredients are: flour, yeast, salt sugar. You mix all these together as per normal but rather than using oil or milk you use water. Here is where things get tricky because there isn't much information out there on how water should be combined with each ingredient. So here goes! Flour WaterSaltSugar YeastMix until well blended then add yoghurt - fill your tins about 3 4 full of mixture - place in oven preheated at 180 degrees centigrade (350 Fahrenheit) for approximately 10 minutes. When cooked remove from tin and spread over pizza bases which have been lined with slices of tomato and topped with whatever else takes your fancy..... If anyone has any tips please do post them!!
