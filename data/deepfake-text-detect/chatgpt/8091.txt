If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will need humans doing them and populations can replace themselves as we replenish our numbers with more healthy babies (without resorting resort having children outside marriage). I'm not saying there is nothing wrong but if I had my way most people would die out a lot faster than they currently do because their chances for survival aren't great due mainly human's lack self control which leads us down so many dead ends that it becomes stupid trying just too hard when you don (t have enough energy left over from today?.
