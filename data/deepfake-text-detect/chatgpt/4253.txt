Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 500,000 songs in their library... If you want a non-phone app with no ads and infinite listening times then go to the TuneIn radio app on your pc or mac. It has an ad free version that plays the same sort of stuff but also streams media from any device (you can use a USB flash drive).
