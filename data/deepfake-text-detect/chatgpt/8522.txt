There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is that every American adult must have an equal voice in the democratic process." The FEC has not enforced these laws against any person (since they were passed). And there are no real penalties attached- it would be difficult if you tried and impossible without proof beyond circumstantial evidence like records showing badges going into his campaign etc - so most people figure "who cares?" In general though I do think he was guilty when Hastert made me aware by asking him why my opponent had been seen at our house on election day wearing buttons... we moved shortly after since i didn't want them around until voting time anyway!
