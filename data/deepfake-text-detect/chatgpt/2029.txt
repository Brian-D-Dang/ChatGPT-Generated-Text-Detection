It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be safely kept there and protected from poachers etc. I've seen some pretty cool stuff in the few years we went to the Koko-San Diego Zoo Wildlife Park (e.g., a baby sloth hanging out with its momma thru her open cage).
