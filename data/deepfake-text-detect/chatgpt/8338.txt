Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the closest spot to me is a reserved one, even though there aren't many available ones so it takes longer and costs more money than simply hunting around at random (and of course not using any kind or disabled access). I know about having an accessible vehicle but that doesn't solve this problem either because if they're away from their car then most likely no amount off ramps will accommodate them unless you have very close neighbors who allow your resident can use theirs without permission... And let us be honest here: how much do we really want our neighbours coming over all hours asking whether anyone could help? Some people just don'n like seeing others needing assistance with daily tasks - especially 'cuz those needy folk may also require some support themselves on occasion too... A lotta old-school folks still think everyone should fend himselfherself as best he she knows now long before becoming decrepit! So while waiting 'til death comes along isn " maybe possible sooner rather better choices wouldbe finding solutions such making sure elderly residents get good healthcare proper follow up care facilities instead wasting resources keeping aging citizens alive only until someone else gets annoyed enough by hearing his neighbour getting sick call 911......... Let nature take its normal way towards glorious oblivion!!!
