People talk about'natural' or'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like "free speech" or "free association" are'inalienable','natural', or'God-given', how come so many people don't have them? If you believe in'inalienable' rights, do you believe that the government should have the right to take them away? The only people who have inalienable rights are the ones who are born into the right family and live in the right neighborhood. Isn't the whole idea of'inalienable rights' to make sure that no one can take them away from you? I don't think I have any inalienable rights, but I'm not sure. I think I have the right to choose what I do with my body, but can it be taken away from me if I harm someone else in the process? Can you prove that anyone has inalienable rights, or is it just a thing you believe? If you have'inalienable' rights, what do you do when someone tries to take them away from you? What do you do when someone takes your rights away? The only people who have inalienable rights are the ones who are born into the right family and live in the right neighborhood. If you believe in'inalienable' rights, do you believe that the government should have the right to take them away?
