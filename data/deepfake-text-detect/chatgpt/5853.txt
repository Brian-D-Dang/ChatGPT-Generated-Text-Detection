Firstly- I'm a Brit, so if I'm missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies! While having a conversation over the phone about a movie (the name of the movie escapes me now) I'm fairly certain that I heard the word 'firecracker' used in reference to a character. I've checked google and forums etc and noone else seems to have heard of this term so could anyone enlighten me? Also - is it correct to say that 'it's a nice day for a white wedding'? If someone is having a white wedding, would they say 'it's a nice day for a white wedding'? Or is this a little too colloquial for a wedding? I also have a question about 'toodle oo' - is this an old fashioned term? I've recently seen it used on a TV programme (and yes I know I shouldn't be watching TV, but it was a British import and this programme had quite a lot of British in it!). How to pronounce 'toodle'? I'm not sure about 'toodle oo', but I'm pretty sure that 'firecracker' has to do with something about the color red. I've never heard 'toodle' in a sentence, but I think it's a word and it means goodbye. I've never heard "firecracker" in a sentence either, but I think it's a word and it means a person who is very exciting, either in a good way or a bad way. I've never heard "toodle" in a sentence either, but I think it's a word and it means goodbye. Edit: It's a noun, and it means "a firecracker." And, "it's a nice day for a white wedding" is a nice saying, but it's not correct. It should be "it's a nice day for a white wedding," with no apostrophe. I think that 'a white wedding' could be referring to the wedding dress, i.e. a white dress (but that's not correct). I've never heard the phrase "a white wedding" before, so I don't know. I've never heard "toodle" in a sentence either, but I think it's a word and it means goodbye It means goodbye in British English. In American English, we say "ta-ta" (rhymes with "cat. Thank you so much for your help. I've googled 'white wedding' and I've read that it's a sort of stylised wedding, with a white dress etc, but I'm not sure if it's still a thing or not. I've read that 'toodle' is a word but I've never heard it used in a sentence. I think it's a nice day for a white wedding is something that's said to be nice and cute. It's not grammatically correct (so it's not used in a sentence), but I think it's a nice thing to say to someone. You guys are doing great. I have to say I've never heard "toodle" in a sentence either. But it's British English, not American English, so... I've also never heard the phrase "a white wedding." The word "toodle" means "goodbye." The word "toodle oo" is a phrase meaning "goodbye." I've never heard it before, but I'm from America. It's British English.
