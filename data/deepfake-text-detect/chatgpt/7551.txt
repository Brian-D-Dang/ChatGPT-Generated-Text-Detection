While everyone is entitled to their preferences, having a preference against promiscuous people can contribute to the unfair stigmatization of individuals who engage in consensual sexual activities. The term "promiscuous" is subjective and varies depending on individual beliefs and cultural norms. Therefore, discriminating against someone based on their sexual behavior can lead to harmful stereotypes and perpetuate negative attitudes towards sexuality. Additionally, having a preference against promiscuous people can prevent individuals from understanding and accepting diverse sexual behaviors and lifestyles, limiting their experiences and knowledge. Finally, while it may not be intended as "slut-shaming," it can still contribute to a culture of sexual judgment and discrimination, which is harmful to everyone.
