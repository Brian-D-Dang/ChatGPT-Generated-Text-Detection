Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same. His views on immigration would not only alienate Republicans if he weren't a billionaire businessman. The president has been described as someone who prefers to drink himself silly drinks and spend time with friends in the luxury suites of his golf resorts rather than actually take responsibility for his actions or apologize kindly to those close by while ignoring everything else going wrong around him like the president does occasionally - including the fact that his son Donald Jr. caused a firestorm when he lied about having attended a rally last year against Trump University. Trump isn't afraid to speak out publicly about the president liking what's happening overseas: During an interview on Fox News Channel earlier this month, Trump insisted there was no blame game between him and Russia after Tillerson said Russia had interfered in the 2016 election campaign, an allegation Tillerson made public during a recent trade hearing before Congress. The fact it wasn't Trump saying anything malicious about Trump Jr., Mueller told reporters Wednesday morning, despite Tillerson issuing a statement Monday denying Trump Jr.'s claims. But the president doesn't hesitate to criticize his own administration over its handling of Russia meddling efforts in another season of his presidency, even suggesting in May 2017 that he could be indicted because of his false statements regarding Russia sanctions violations involving his family. Trump also criticized his own Justice Department Sunday evening without any evidence backing up his claim that FBI Director Christopher Wray acted improperly following a probe into Russian interference attempts at the 2016 presidential election; Trump claimed Wray asked him whether the investigation should have stemmed from Russia's involvement in the hacking attempt.

Trump tweeted that Wray resigned amid questions about why Wray didn't intervene immediately enough to formally notify congress about the hacking effort so Congress wouldn't consider such allegations against Russia. Then Trump retweeted an unverified report Monday alleging Wray sent the texts telling him all information from the work of his office aimed at helping Cruz win the nomination should be disclosed to Congress later Thursday - something Wray denied Friday morning. Independent investigations aren't just about trying to find flaws in Trump's daily briefings they're supposed to focus on issues that are important to voters right now, especially given the way Russian hackers tried unsuccessfully to influence the American electorate three years ago along with other attacks on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign. On Monday, Trump blasted federal prosecutors investigating his campaign contacts with Russians as "gettin' old," claiming his deputy attorney general, Mick Mulvaney, misled House investigators about discussions about further investigation into possible ties between Trump Tower Moscow and Russian government agents. Mulvaney responded by tweeting that Trump argued that Mulvaney shouldn't have admitted that Trump directed Russian operatives to hack Hillary Clinton emails in return for compromising information about her private email server used for official business purposes. But Twitter confirmed Tuesday that Mulvaney forwarded the incorrect email account address to the FBI under Trump's name - a mistake Mulvaney apologized for committing early Monday morning. A report Monday suggested Trump planned to meet with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak next week to discuss the issue, though Mulvaney refuted the idea shortly afterward.
