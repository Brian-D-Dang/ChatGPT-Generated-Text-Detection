Posting on my secondary for obvious reasons I grew up in a extremely abusive house. I dreaded coming home and the site of my mom made my heart skip a beat. It was common for her to yell at us if we didn't do as she said, threw things if we were on our phones, and sometimes even put us in a head lock if we didn't obey her. One day it got to the point where I was so scared of coming home that I was running to my friend's house instead of mine. When I'd get to my friends house I would just sit in the corner and just cry. I was scared to tell anyone because of all the times she made us feel like we were the problem and that we should never talk about her. When I finally did I was in middle school and at my best friends house I told her what was going on. My friend told me to talk to our teacher so she could help me and if it got worse I could always talk to the guidance councilor. I started to feel like I was being taken care of and that I didn't have to be scared of my mom anymore. I started to go to counseling but things just didn't change. My mom was still yelling at us and even took her frustrations out on us at school. When I was in high school I finally decided that it was time to take care of myself and get away from her. When I first moved out I was so happy because I was free, but after a few months I started to feel lonely and miss my mom. I would go back to my mom's house every weekend and talk to her on the phone almost every night. My mom still yelled at me and made me feel like a bad daughter and sometimes I felt like she really didn't care. I'd go back to my dads house and start crying and tell him what was going on. My dad would always ask why I was crying and I would tell him I missed my mom. My dad would always tell me that I wasn't a bad kid and that I did nothing to deserve that. I started to feel better because I had my dad's support and eventually I stopped talking to my mom as much. A couple of weeks ago my mom tried to commit suicide. I was at work when I found out and I just couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe that my mom would do that because I knew how much she loved me and I didn't want to lose her. I still had hope that she would get better and we would be able to get through this but that's when I found out that my dad passed away. I was so shocked I felt like my heart was going to stop. I called my mom and she told me that she's not ready to talk to me but I need to be strong and just be there for her. Now it's been a couple of weeks and my mom is getting better but she's still not ready to talk to me. It's hard to not be able to talk to my mom and hear what she has to say but I know that I need to be strong and just be there for her. I feel like I lost both of my parents in a couple of weeks and it's hard to process. My mom is getting better and I know I have to be strong because she needs me. I just don't know how I'll be able to do that without talking to her and getting her advice. My life has been turned upside down and I'm so scared of what's going to happen to us and our family. I miss them both so much and I just hope that things will get better and that I'll be able to talk to my mom again.
