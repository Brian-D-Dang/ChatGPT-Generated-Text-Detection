I was first exposed to the universe by watching season 1 and 2 of the show. I really liked them and purchased the A Song of Ice and Fire books That's great! A Song of Ice and Fire books are an excellent choice, and they will give you a deeper insight into the world of Westeros and beyond. It's always beneficial to read books that inspired movies or TV shows, as they often contain more details and character development than their visual adaptations. I hope you enjoy reading them and delving deeper into the fascinating universe of A Song of Ice and Fire!
