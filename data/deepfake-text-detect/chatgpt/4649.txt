Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and even though it's not my favorite thing to think about, the fact remains that women are physically weaker than men so unless they fought back (which statistically would be rare) there would be no way for them to give consent. I know many people who advocate against rape on forums like reddit, but I also noticed how most guys out there feel as if it simply isn't right when thinking about their own sisters or wives being raped by someone else besides themselves.. I don't get why this should happen at all and what can we do? Also if females could make their wills known before dying and males couldn't object then things might work out because the rapist wouldn't want to even hurt anymore of his family member after finding out he was raping an actual human which is in itself doesn't sound very good for him either... But seriously every time something comes up with anything that has todo with "women shouldn't be able to say whether or not they were forced" I never really hear any talks on how rapists can actually change their ways. What happens if you leave your wife alonewithout foodwith children for days without knowing where she went and come home to find her dead under mysterious circumstances? Do you go straight to trial? Or does everything just stop while waiting for a court date? How long before they arrest you? Doesn't seem very realistic, considering from what I've seen cops these days aren't that bothered by beatings if the victim agreed beforehand sometimes encourage them. If you're going to believe murder cases now then please explain away why some random guy one day decides to stab another person multiple times BECAUSE HE DIDN'T AGREE TO A TICKET AND THEN THE COPS ARREST HIM FOR IT. And oh yes as far as I am aware there ARE SO DAMN MANY PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED AT LEAST SOME KIND OF ABUSES FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS NOT EVEN NEARLY AS BAD AS WHAT WOMEN COMPLAIN ABOUT ALL DAY LONG. So once again WTH??? Women can literally die from being raped (or murdered if their body falls through the floor of the building). Men can kill each other over petty reasons ranging from arguments to bad business deals to feelings and etc., yet society still tells us that women shouldn't complain about getting kidnapped? They don't call it kidnapping when a man commits it though. Why is that?? EDIT: Now more specifically since the whole point is what kind of power did women hold b4 marriage existed and what happens during divorce situations.. Yes it says rape and sexual assaults should remain illegal BUT WHY DON'T WE SEE MORE CASES WHERE MEN RAPE OTHER GUYS OR GIRLS?! Is it because most of our parents had such evil ideas about gender roles!? There are some cases where two boys or girls decide to play doctor between waking hours and having consensual sex. Would those all somehow be considered adultery depending upon what happened later on down the road? Although I guess technically 'true love' would win out in any case by definition.... Which brings me to my next question. Shouldn't the law favor true love instead of cheating in general where both parties are consenting adults? I mean obviously infidelity under certain conditions causes much worse damage to relationships however typical male vs female couples rarely end up divorcing and according to wikipedia only 1 of marriages ever involve physical violence. Correlation VS causation maybe? If we take into account that's 10 million married couples per year that fight before ending up divorced compared to 40million individuals in America with no marital problems whatsoever sigh let's just stick to coercion based on what we see happening today. Personally, I'd rather follow a stereotypical male character then suffer a bad relationship anyway. I firmly believe sexuality is fluid up until experience sinks it hard as stone. As far as I know, no laws exist regarding prohibiting heterosexual men from making others perform oral sex. The same goes for lesbians too. Yet I tend to see countless threads where woman talk about males forcing them to stay quiet by threatening harm or death, especially to their kids while ignoring posts talking about hetero men doing it too for whatever reason. Not saying we shouldn't allow tough penalty for things like abusive behavior towards minors but what exactly is wrong with asking questions in order to better educate ourselves? Isn't education important for everyone involved? Anyway I'll save my thoughts for tomorrow; Thank You all for reading 3 Last edited by DeinoDavus; 03 May 2017 at 11:46 PM..
