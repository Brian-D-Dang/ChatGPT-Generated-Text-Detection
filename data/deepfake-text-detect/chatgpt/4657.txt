I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot at my child? Let's find out how it is possible for an officer to be so careless that he shoots someone accidentally while trying to save his own life, by using deadly force against another human being in self defense. First of all, we need to know what is lethal force: In this context "lethal" means mortal injury from bullet wounds or stab wounds; knockdowns (from punches) can also kill if they are severe enough. If you kick your assailant hard enough to affect their balance, without breaking any bones, then there may not be any immediate danger of them attempting to hurt you again as long as the first blow didn't break anything. In other words, a person knocked over with sufficient impact on the head could die even though no broken bones were present. A slip by a victim causing himherself to stumble quickly, such as falling down stairs or stumbling into something sharp, could cause fatal harm if they hit their head violently enough to make them bleed profusely. Most blows to vital organs do considerable damage, although there are exceptions - for example, some heart attacks don't always immediately require hospitalisation because treatment can sometimes restore blood flow back through damaged arteries. However large scale cardiac arrest does usually result in sudden collapse and loss of consciousness when oxygenated blood flows only one way through severed vessels. Where did these rules come from? It depends who you ask but here is Wikipedia definition: Lethality refers to whether a weapon kills faster than its ammunition will wear out. For most weapons, since bullets and shells hold more mass per unit volume than the actual shrapnel used inside the shell, the overall rate of energy transferred into tissue by the ballistic projectile exceeds that which could ordinarily be absorbed by living organisms. As a consequence, projectiles fired by modern firearms leave behind tell-tale signs of trauma, including bruising, bone fractures, and internal organ destruction. How much kinetic energy must actually be thrown onto a target before it dies after suffering a gunshot wound depends upon several factors including caliber of firearm, velocity, and type of tissue struck. The amount necessary to produce mortality varies between individuals based on age, weight, health status, time allowed following penetrating wounding, and number of wounds involved. Now let us take into account the fact that law enforcement officers carry guns and use lethal force according to guidelines published in various manuals around the world. These form part of international conventions accepted by most nations as binding laws. They define acceptable levels of lethality to enable those trained to act appropriately within defined parameters to prevent unnecessary deaths where absolutely unavoidable. To ensure compliance with minimum standards of safety and security, each step in the process needs to be documented and evidence of compliance assessed regularly and publicly reported. Furthermore training covering both operational procedures as well as equipment and tactics should be provided in order to support accountability under controlled conditions. This allows feedback through regular audits and inspections to confirm performance throughout the operation. Management activities cover planning and instruction, development of funds and budgets, recruitment and selection processes, career progression opportunities, promotion structures, code of conduct, discipline management, grievance proceedings and appeals. All are required to provide satisfactory systems and practices for effective risk assessment, incident reporting and investigation (Anon, 2017). Training programs generally aim to achieve proficiency in skills and knowledge required to perform tasks safely and effectively within situational constraints common to policing operations. There is usually good reason and justification for carrying out the job requirements with what appears to be insufficient precautions and lack of forethought. But that still doesn't explain every single case of shootings and killings by police forces. Let's go further and look at Permissive Action Links (PALS), developed and adopted by numerous countries worldwide and put into practice by US military forces. PAL stands for 'Permit Alternatives Before Shoot', and was created in order to reduce the chance of civilian casualties during combat situations caused by friendly fire. Once armed troops detect incoming enemy fire, they often initiate return fire within milliseconds. When firing rounds near each other, there is always a possibility of inadvertent crossfire. Soldiers operate in mutually supporting teams equipped with communications devices capable of identifying potential targets among team members. Each soldier has been taught how to identify himself, others, friendlies, and enemies using distinctive radio calls and associated signals. These cues include position reports, direction of movement, numbers sent up to identify friends and foes, and the nature of the threat itself, i.e., gunfire versus mortar attack - all relayed via frequency and directional devices automatically called 'talkback'. An individual member can determine he has shot injured or killed a fellow soldier simply by hearing identification broadcasts. Troops receive additional information regarding threats transmitted via handheld transceivers, fiber optic cable links, push-to-talk radios, cell phones, satellite telephones, etc. Some transmit warning messages via voice warnings indicating approaching soldiers conducting the next sign-off route. These data indicate that our soldiers understand different types of traffic serviceability risks range cleanings plus end windows
