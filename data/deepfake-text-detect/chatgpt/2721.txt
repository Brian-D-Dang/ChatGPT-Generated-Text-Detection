First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" does. Second, they are not as in your face about their belief system where feminism has to be shouted from the rooftops (at least in most places). Thirdly, there's only so much room on one person's shirt for writing stuff down! I like this response
