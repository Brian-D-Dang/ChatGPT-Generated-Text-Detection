I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, the yin and yang. But for me, there is a third dimension which is the "grey" area, where I can see both sides of the situation and try to find the balance between them. In this way, I think it's easier to make decisions and take actions that are beneficial for all involved parties.
