As a german, especially in the city I live, there's honestly too many turks and muslims here. My old school was 80 turksmuslimsguys from eastern europe, which seriously lead to a lot of fighting. Now my current school is 15 turks and muslims, which is also bad. They fight, brag about there fathers being criminals and stuff like that. The only thing they don't do is steal, but I don't think that's really a good thing. 2nd: I feel sorry for them. I mean, when there is 1 of people who are turks and muslims in germany, it's ok. But when it's 10, 20, 30, 40 or even more, it's not. Germany is a white nation, we don't have any mosques in our land, we have a huge amount of old german cathedrals, christianity is the most important religion in our land. And those people coming here and want to ruin this, it's not ok. 3rd: I'm afraid of muslims, they have a lot of bad guys here, they are the fastest growing religion in our land and it's really bad. If I see someone who's turkish or muslim, I get afraid and walk away. The only reason I'm not afraid of asians is, that we don't have any in germany and most of them are from countries where we have no war. 1. Because the turks are bad, they are like 15 of the population in Germany and they are the biggest crime group. They also are lazy and treat their women bad. 2. I think they are not fully integrated, they don't care about the German society, they don't care about their country and they don't care about their people. 3. Because Germany has already so much people and if the turks come here they take our jobs and they are already so many people and i'm afraid they will not do anything but sit on the couch and drink tea and cigarettes. The only good thing is that they are very good at sports. 1. I know a lot of people who are turks and muslims and they are very nice, nice people. 2. Because they don't know any better, they are like any other human being. 3. I am not afraid of them, because they are only normal people. 4. Because in Germany there are still a lot of jobs. 1. I know many people who are turks and muslims and they are nice people. 2. I don't know why they are not integrated, but it is not their fault. 3. I am not afraid of them because they are only normal people. 4. Because they are not so many people as in other countries. 1. Because the turks are bad and they have too many problems with the german society. 2. Because they are not integrated in the german society, they don't care about the german culture. 3. I am not afraid of them, because they are only normal people. I don't think that they are a problem. 4. Because there are still a lot of jobs. 1. The turks are bad. 2. They don't care about our culture and they don't care about their country. 3. Because they don't do anything. 4. Because they don't take our jobs. 1. They are bad people and they don't care about other people. 2. They don't care about other people and they don't care about our country. 3. Because they don't take jobs. 4. Because they don't care about our culture. 1. Because they don't care about our culture. 3. Because they don't take jobs. 4. Because they are lazy and they don't care about our culture. 1. I know a lot of people who are turks and muslims and they are very nice, nice people. 2. Because they don't know any better, they are like any other human being. 3. I am not afraid of them, because they are only normal people. 4. Because in Germany there are still a lot of jobs. I think they are normal people, like us. They don't care about our culture. 1. Because the turks are bad and they have problems with the german society. 2. They are not integrated in the german society. 3. I am not afraid of them,
