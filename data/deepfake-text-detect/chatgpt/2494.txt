I feel like they're acting and it often feels very campy. I don't like how they say "well my brain is more feminine," like excuse me that's something that women do, not men or even trans people. That was the point though! Everyone has a know-it-all voice in their head... except for Bob (who kinda did have one). It's hard to explain but there also wasn't really anything "manly" about them as far as mannerisms go, so maybe you can see where it would come across this way?
