When I see debate about'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about'evidence'. If they shift on these matters at all it's because of emotional appeals. I'm a bit skeptical that this is actually true (and while the original post might be, there are plenty of examples where 'facts don't matter but if so how can we make evidence an intellectual and political priority again? Is there any hope for making science more important than ideology in our society? Science isn't some magic tool you use to find truth. It has very specific properties: 1. The methodology should remain constant 2. The results should repeatable 3. The experimenter cannot bias the data They could have changed anything along those lines with the global warming studies or any other field. There was no peer review before hand, which means everyone had access to the raw data rather than just the authors, meaning anyone who wanted to do bad research would then simply destroy your study by manipulating the raw data themselves. All of this and many others made me question the whole thing even as someone who was pro-global warming at one point. But scientists also need to consider what their real motives were behind doing such a topic. Was global warming truly happening outside of natural variance or not and merely being attributed to manmade effects due to politics? Then why did certain researchers feel the need to show human fingerprints when studying sea ice, yet claim they didn't exist elsewhere? Why does climate change fit into an agenda of overall control of humans through taxation etc.? Those questions still haven't been answered adequately. And yes, facts DO matter and therefore the argument needs to fall somewhere between 97 consensusflat earthers. Facts used correctly though can lead to such great things as medical breakthroughs. That doesn't mean everything is "settled" or always correct. Science will never be 100 right nor wrong...it only provides answers to work toward. Arguments are needed to take back power from politicians who want total control over us through monetary gain. This may sound extreme given my earlier statement, but the way you get rewarded for medicine now days far exceeds any altruistic reasoning and instead purely driven by greed. People tend to forget scientists became rich during WWII since governments gave them huge contracts to develop war related technologies, same goes for GMO foods. You also hear stories of doctors getting kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies etc....the system is corrupt beyond belief! In fact let me give you another example. Most horrid diseases exist today thanks to dairy products. Yet most animals consume lactose (milk sugar) constantly without becoming ill despite having similar immune systems to humans. Researchers found a correlation between consumption of milk after infancy causes illnesses in adults. So once upon a time, cow poop went into the water supply and contaminated drinking wells resulting in smallpox outbreaks throughout Europe. Small pox killed millions of Europeans including children who drank tainted milk. A few years ago it was proven kids under 10 shouldn't drink milk either. Yet i bet the FDA wouldn't allow that information out considering our current president is closely tied to Monsanto food conglomerate. Recently the connection to vaccines too is coming to light with increasing cases of autism and autoimmune disorders. Many people on Reddit claim they know better than these experts citing conspiracy theories and cherry picking 'studies'. Not sure how informed they really are. Each topic brings up its own set of problems, none of which hold enough weight to sway the general population immediately. The sad part is seeing otherwise smart people deny scientific proof which disproves their beliefs. Even worse is seeing someone say something ridiculous based on outdated info. When arguing with those types ask yourself whether they honestly believe what they're saying. Do they understand the full scope of what they've said even? Are their opinions based solely on biased media sources and social groups they associate with? How much misinformation are they going off of? Ask your self how well they researched each side prior to forming an opinion. Who funds these studies anyway? Where do they come from??? Remember money talks louder than common sense sometimes. Look at how heavily funded anti-vaxxing and flat earth movements are compared to actual respected institutions like NASA and Pew Research Institute. Just look at Eddie Bravo's views vs Tony Robbins who has broken ties with him multiple times. Realistically speaking, how many people remember or pay attention to any news story unless it directly affects them regardless of subject?? Unfortunately through sheer ignorance and lack of knowledge a large portion of Americans have allowed our country to suffer greatly at the hands of greedy government figures taking advantage of our citizenry through dysfunctional legislations backed by empty promises using false authority granted by uninformed consumers. Sure sounds familiar huh?! We live in America folks!!! MAGA
