I recently discovered rAnglish. Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots. The result is a language that not only sounds strange, but looks even stranger than it sounds! Here are some examples: 1) "The teal hen" (the bird itself).2) "The green grasshopper"3) "Cafe Coffee"4) "Rainbow's End Waterway Bridge"5) "Tracy Annette Bushman-Spies"6) "Hercules the Hammer"7) "Sneeze or sneeze"8) "Flowery Path"9) "Tallulah Bankhead"10) "Limehouse Sound Railway Station"11) "Northern Rivers District Council"12) "Mardi Gras"13) "Gemeroi Koala Club"14) "Kewpie May"15) "Xenomorph"16) "Wollongbar Local School"17) A few samples from the dictionary18) "Fireworks Factory"19) "Flying Fox"20) "Fearless Vampire Killers"21) "Black Swan"22) "Sleep Deeply Tonight - Shot in Australia23) "Rocket Train"24) And here I even found myself on Google Maps25) And finally there was this gem...26) But check out these other sites for lots more cool stuff:27)
