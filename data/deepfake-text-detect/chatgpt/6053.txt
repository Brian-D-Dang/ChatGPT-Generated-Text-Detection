I really like Coke (hell look at my username), like really. I made the trek to Atlanta about a year ago for the sole reason of visiting the Coca-Cola Museum. I also love the history of it all. On top of that, I recently read a great article about the harmful effects that Coke has on the environment, including the consequences of the sugarcane industry in Brazil. I am also a big fan of the documentary Bitter Sweet. Despite this, I do not avoid Coke products for any of these reasons. I drink Coke, Coke Zero, and Sprite, probably every day. I eat the Cherry Coke flavored candy canes at Christmas. I also have a soft spot for the Coke commercials. So why do I drink and consume so much Coke? It is the taste. It is a great taste. One of my favorite Coke commercials is the one where the dad is drinking Pepsi and the son is drinking Coke. I am a Pepsi drinker, but it is a close call. I love the taste of Coke, but Pepsi is a little sweeter. But this is not the point. The point is that it is not about the taste. The point is that taste, especially food taste, is a preference. What I like may not be what you like. I like the taste of Coke. I also like the taste of beer, which is not a food at all. So why do I like the taste of beer? It is the taste. It is a great taste. I don't drink beer every day, probably not even every week. I also don't like the taste of alcohol at all. But I like the taste of beer. The point is that taste, especially food taste, is a preference. I am not saying that you should drink beer. I am not saying that you should drink Coke. I am not saying that you should drink Pepsi. I am saying that it is your preference. I am saying that I prefer Coke. What I like may not be what you like. Happy holidays everyone, whether you prefer Coke, Pepsi, or neither.
