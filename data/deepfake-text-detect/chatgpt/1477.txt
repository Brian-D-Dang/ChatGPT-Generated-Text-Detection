I'd like to preface this by saying that parts of my post may sound like they're bragging, but they're not trying to come across that way. Also, I'm using a lot of casual terms and abbreviations here (that might make sense in the context or aren't used as commonly outside of programming). However you read it, please know that everything is being said with complete sincerity. What are the key things I should do if I want to create an open source project? Is there any one thing that's really important for me to consider before jumping into something new?
