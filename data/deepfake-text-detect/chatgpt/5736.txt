(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge the media as a whole. I think it's a necessary evil and it can be used for the good. But I think it's our responsibility to make sure the people who are in the media are making the world a better place. I do this through social media. I use my Facebook account to raise awareness about issues, to share information and to connect with people. So I think that's my main contribution to the world. I just do it my own way and I'm very happy about it. I think the media is great in some ways. Through the media we get so much information, news, entertainment and what not. I think the problem is the way people consume media. Most people consume it like it's for entertainment. They see it as a way to escape from their daily life. That's why they don't put much effort into thinking about the content of the media. They don't want to question the message. So most people will go on watching whatever the media is giving them and then they'll wonder why they feel the way they feel. Like "why do I feel so sad and confused all the time?"

So they'll keep on consuming the media without questioning the content. That's why they'll go on watching the same news and not realizing they are being manipulated.

I think there is a way to consume the media so that we benefit from it. I think there are things we can do to make sure the content of the media is good for us. Like we can try to find quality content. We can think about what we want to know. What kind of knowledge we want to gain. We can then try to find information about that. We can try to research and see what the media is saying about it and then we can take it as an opportunity to go deeper in that topic and see what we can find out ourselves.

I also think we should be critical about the media. We can try to understand the message the media is sending us. We can try to understand the point of view of the people who made it. We can try to understand the intended audience. We can try to think about what they want to achieve with the media. We can try to find out who is behind it and what their background is. I think it's very important to be aware of the message of the media. We should make sure we know what we are being told. We should think about the media and what they are saying to us.
