Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for "sleeping around," and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of attention. There are many who have had this opinion as their own for years, so I am certainly no newcomer to these thoughts. It's true that our culture has become one where sex-appeal seems almost more important than intelligence or competence or any number of other qualities women may possess. The reason we see this today happens because our societies shift from an era where moral values were emphasized, to an era which celebrates immoral behavior. It could be argued that this is why men find themselves with lower quality partners now compared to what was available to them several decades ago...the idea being that they sought the attractive ones rather than those who might be smarter (or simply happier). However, while your point about how society focuses too much on appearance is valid, let me suggest that you don't really think about things like marriage equality either very often at all? Why do you feel so strongly against gay couples getting married??? Who says some people can only marry someone of the opposite gender? We live in a remarkable time where men and women are marrying both straight and homosexual individuals and having children together. If we allow even gays to make such marriages legal then there should never be 'hateful' feelings towards anyone. People who hold strong opinions deserve to openly express them without fear but if everyone felt that way and didn't speak up for their beliefs then nothing would ever change! It will take discussion and tough decision making to move forward...but through the efforts of many different voices you may just end up finding yourself agreeing with the minority instead of being upset by it! Allowing equal rights to others means allowing ourselves to accept other points of views. After all isn't that what love is all about?? Anyway this debatediscussion will continue forever. Keep thinking and keep writing:) Evan: I agree with most everything you said; except I disagree completely with your conclusion about us passing laws regarding marriage equality. You seem to believe that we're past this stage already; however, I tend to view it differently, especially since my mother brought me into the world herself and risked her health during childbirth. While it is great that she made it, it doesn't mean my sister shouldn't have received care that actually worked better toward supporting birth mothers over bringing another child into the world. As far as I'm concerned, abortion is still illegal, and yet every year some 200,000 babies die due to lack of proper medical services. And while I understand that you probably aren't defending abortions which I abhor I do wish you'd consider that facts matter, and just maybe that they could help lead us somewhere closer to societal progressivism. Furthermore, I'd add that whether or not we pass arguments supporting the freedom to choose improves upon our society depends entirely upon what kind of choice we're talking about here. In this case, it clearly helps that the argument involves reproductive rights, and therefore the right to life. But we must always remember that when discussing matters involving sexual expression, human sexuality takes place within the context of procreation. Thus, the argument may not necessarily carry over onto the issue of homosexuality itself. For example, you mentioned at least three times that parents ought to teach their kids about personal responsibility. This suggests that we've separated out the issue of parenting from that of reproduction. However, where you go wrong again is assuming the connection between the two. Yes, we need to teach our younglings ways to live responsibly in order to avoid becoming old and sickly adults. Again though, this relates back to the topic at hand. Reproduction cannot occur without first expressing oneself sexually. So perhaps we need to discuss this further as well. Because the truth is that until we stop emphasizing heterosexuality above LGBT relationships, promiscuity will likely remain high among millennials regardless of age. Therein lies the problem; once we start putting emphasis on individuality and developing an economy based off of individualism, then we'll begin seeing fewer truly unhealthy relationships occurring, where both parties understand exactly what needs to happen before releasing their bodily fluids. Thank you for reading and commenting, Evan, I appreciate it immensely.
