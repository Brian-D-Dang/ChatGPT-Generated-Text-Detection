I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately lambasted her for coming out as a woman. The same thing goes on regarding homosexuality - if you're not gay or lesbian (or bi), it's cool to hate them because they can't be straight? But what about transgendered individuals who are homosexual?? Doesn't this make a hypocrite out of everyone else who is against transgenderism??? This isn't just something that happens in society today; this has been happening throughout history!!! Example: There have always been women hating men, but we still haven't quite figured out how to deal with "the gays....." yet!! Why do things change? Well.... A lot can happen over time! Something new comes along to distract us from our old ways... whether it be technology, religion, politics etc.. For example, the use of pesticides during agriculture revolutionized life dramatically in an area where nearly everyone died off due to diseases like small pox. This allowed many farmers to become rich, while others became poor.... depending upon their relative position within society at large...... In more recent times medical advances such as antibiotics have led to obesity, heart disease and strokes being greatly curtailed....... Of course now we see all sorts of other negative side effects from using these chemicals - so much so that most doctors no longer prescribe them unless absolutely necessary!:) So maybe the next big technological development will cure ALL illnesses???? Goodness knows what we'll find out!! But back to the topic at hand - Gender identity! When I first came out as transsexual years ago, I didn't really know any trans folk personally besides two or three guys around me. Of those few friends, only one actually knew anything beyond platitudes about gender roles and stereotypes - nothing specific to me specifically. It took several years before anyone outside of my family told me that I wasn't going to transition by simply changing clothes.... which made sense given my own experience. It seems as though certain groups tend to want to label themselves better than the rest - including the phrase "transgender." Some may argue the point that differentiating between male and female is somehow offensive to males since it implies that females aren't real. (which obviously doesn't hold water!) Others could try to tell us why children should be allowed to choose whatever gender they feel strongly about - even if that means hurting innocent little boys or girls who opt Posted by Today marks 22 days until my surgery date!!!! And I'm STILL nervous!! Just knowing that another part of myself is soon disappearing makes it hard NOT to get upset about it.:) Although, I guess having someone look inside your body every day might help somewhat.:) Tell me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't phalloplasty patients be happy after the operation is done?! My surgeon called earlier this week to let me know he had received permission from his hospital to perform the procedure without supervision - meaning that any doctor present could literally step away from the table whenever they wanted to go pee stretch pull up their pants etc.... The guy said that he DIDN 'T think very highly of surgeons and felt that this practice was common across the country. He also informed me that it wouldn't hurt him financially - although possibly saving me money if all went well!! In fact, he basically admitted that the ONLY reason surgeons don't allow unsupervised procedures is because they don't want their patients walking out of their surgeries hearing "OMG, they killed my penis!!" Anyway, I've since started thinking about how terribly sad that is. Isn't it supposed to be easier than ever to heal from surgery nowadays? What happened to REALLY healing after major operations????? Did modern medicine cease to exist once penises were invented...? No matter... my surgeon calls tomorrow morning to schedule my appointment!! Wooohooo!!! Now all I need is to pray that everything falls into place and I end up getting the right amount of hormones and NOT too much - making sure anyway that Dr. Mac assumes responsibility for the treatment of the patient and not mine!!!! That won't be easy either.... I must admit that I am feeling pretty good about finally finding my way out of this mess... Yes, it takes courage sometimes to stand up to a system that is clearly rigged to keep you down forever, BUT it IS possible to reclaim yourself temporarily from the system that has kept you pinned down for far too long!!!!! So stay strong, everyone!!! Not only as a transgender person trying desperately to live healthy again, but as a human being who wants the best for everyone! And especially as people who care deeply about each other!!! Love, Darelle Here are some words of wisdom that I read somewhere recently.... Interesting... truthfully interesting.... Do YOU believe that the universe exists solely through consciousness and energy fields? If yes, please explain. If no, why not? Are all colors?
