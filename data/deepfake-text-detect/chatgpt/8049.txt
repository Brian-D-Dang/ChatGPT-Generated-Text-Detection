Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 7th Century CE. The central figure who started this newfound faith was Mohammed or Mohammad, which means "praised one" and he lived during 632-669 AD; He claimed himself as not just an ordinary man but also Allah's last prophet for all Muslims upon his deathbed when people said: "Mohammed has gone crazy." Recently I have been reading some books on Islam about Jihad war killing against nonbelievers mainly JewsChristians etc., They are saying there will come times like these again where we need martyrs such terrorists men willing die so others can live with peacefullness because they believe it causes them premaing Divine reward! But how do you call what happened at Christchurch? And why would anyone kill innocent children (in New Zealand)? What kind world am i living into now?! Help please!!?? Very scared right know...??? How could any normal person even think something along those lines!!! We love our kids too much!!!!
