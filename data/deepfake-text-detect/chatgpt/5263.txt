Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said: What happens after the honeymoon period when one thinks that hooking up with a girl doesn't work? Who knows what kind of woman you are! If you do decide to move on with a guy who's not interested in you then you will get your ass kicked by women who have already decided they don't want to live together and aren't ready (or not interested). When these two guys come into your life would it be okay if you told them what happened between the two before dating??? It depends whether they're seeing another person entirely or just having bros over at the same time as you? Of course...
