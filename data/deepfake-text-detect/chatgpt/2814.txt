For the purpose of this post, I am defining "capitalism" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. "Socialism" is defined as a system in which all goods and services are provided through government bureaucracies (with or without privately owned means of production). We will now proceed to examine how each of these systems treats the individual citizen within its borders. We'll start by examining whether either model allows for maximum personal freedom - where individuals have a high degree of autonomy over their own lives and can make choices that they consider desirable, not just those imposed upon them from above.
