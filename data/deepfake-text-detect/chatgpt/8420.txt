(A) Work part-time in high school; Then go to college (B) Work full-time before you go to college (C) Work while you study in college. I was a spoiled lazy brat who didn't like working and skipped A LOT of classes my freshman year, but by the second semester sophomore lit class got me interested enough that now when it comes time for finals...I am all about studying hard! Besides we were very poor with nothing coming out our pockets so they made us work anyway because if not then how would anyone get anything done? Pants: How do i know which type is right?? PLEASE HELPPSS!!! But people on here are saying its wrong....i want opinions too!!
