As a german, especially in the city I live, there's honestly too many turks and muslims here. My old school was 80 turksmuslimsguys from eastern europe, which seriously lead to my depression. I really feel bad for you dude: (This is going to sound super weird but have you ever tried to find a greek christian? Also I'd like to know what exactly makes you depressed because mental illness isn't just "anxiety"
