While it is true that American public school teachers face numerous challenges when it comes to classroom management, blaming the issue entirely on external factors seems dismissive of their own responsibility for creating and maintaining a positive learning environment. Skilled teachers can use various tools at their disposal to manage their classrooms effectively, such as classroom management plans, positive reinforcement, and engaging lesson plans, and overcome challenges that come with bureaucracy, parenting, or administration. Focusing solely on blaming external factors overlooks the role of teachers in creating and fostering a culture of learning that empowers students to become responsible, respectful, and engaged members of their classrooms. Instead of giving up on classroom control, teachers should keep working to improve their skills and seek support from colleagues and school resources to create an optimal learning environment for their students.
