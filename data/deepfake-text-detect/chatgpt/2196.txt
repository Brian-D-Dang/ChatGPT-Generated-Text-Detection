This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding. For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force us to either pay for things we don't want like premium channels, sports packages etc., or worse cancel one of our major bills in order to afford it all! And now there's another option out there...what could be better than being able to stream live TV online? That sounds great right?! But what about the DVR feature you get on your cable box - how do you record shows from an app if they aren't available at scheduled times?? Well, this problem has also gone away thanks to HULU Live as well!! You can still access Hulu while no longer paying 40 per month just so you can "record" 1 episode every week. Now you will only need their basic subscription package (starting at only 5!) which allows users to watch up to 5 moviesepisodes each month without ads PLUS you'll have unlimited streaming options including previous seasons of certain series', current season episodes and new releases too!!! This service offers tons more content but most importantly doesn't require me to drop other services that I enjoy watching because everything is gathered into ONE place where I can find exactly what I am looking for instead of switching between different apps sites wasting valuable minutes searching through endless pages trying to figure out what show I wanted to see when there was nothing good playing anyways. Which means less stress with my schedule AND money saved by not needing to signup multiple accounts across various platforms WIN-WIN situation here people;) And since we're talking saving some cash let's talk about Amazon Prime memberships folks shall we???:) If you haven't heard yet then make sure to head over HERE ASAP before August 7th otherwise prices WILL go back UP once again after July 31st!!!!! Because yes ladies and gentlemen, believe it or not those insanely low shipping rates won't last forever although there IS already news coming around saying prime might increase in price starting next year! So why wait until its too late!? Don't panic though guys cause even non amazon shoppers should take advantage of these deals NOW anyway.....because guess who else started delivering via Drone recently....Amazon baby!!!! It seems almost unfair that millions of Americans basically spend upwards of 3Xs MORE on gas alone driving everywhere vs someone living in Seattle using WALMART DELIVERY DRONE SERVICE. Seriously look at any city map half that area looks pretty much untouched..and I'm guessing many thousands maybe even hundreds of THOUSANDSof jobs were created along the way especially considering some cities building permits are getting approved within DAYSinstead of MONTHS. With jobs comes taxes meaning TAX MONEY which helps build roads schools hospitals emergency responders and more! Which ultimately leads to LESS crime rate homelessness drug addiction crimes against children welfare abuse ect. Not too mention in 2018 you may actually start seeing commercials promoting DRONES TO REDUCE TRAFFIC due to lower CONGESTION thus helping everyone save time during peak hours making traveling smoother safer faster easier BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT which adds VALUEto homes REAL ESTATE RATESwhich improves economies at large helping EVERYBODY!:D Oh happy day indeed friends remember always keep your eyes open the world is full of possibilities;).
