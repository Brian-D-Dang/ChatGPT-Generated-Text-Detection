I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still think they should have remained silent and let him finish his point rather than interrupting his speech multiple times in order to get their message across. He said he understood my side but disagreed because "In order for anything good to come out about racism people need to be vocal." The main issue here is one of communication style. As much as we would like our fellow human beings to see things from our perspective or to agree 100 on every single detail, this will not happen often if ever. The only thing that matters is are you able to find common ground? Can together attain what your individual goals might require? If yes then (and only then) does it matter how far apart each person stands on certain issues. It also goes without saying that being wrong can cause more harm than good when communicating with others so please don't bother attempting to sway me. Thanks
