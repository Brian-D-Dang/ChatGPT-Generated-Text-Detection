tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to the big games, I'm always watching. But, when it comes to the regular season games, I always find myself thinking to myself, "why am I watching this game, I know they won't make the playoffs anyway, I'll just watch the games that actually matter." I have friends and family members who say the same thing. I know you say that there's a lot of injuries that occur during the regular season but then, if I'm not mistaken, aren't the players playing for playoff spots during the regular season? I know injuries happen, but I think it's a pretty big stretch to say that some regular season games are more exciting than other regular season games just because there's more injuries. If that was the case, then, why have an NFL season? Why not just play one game, the one that matters, and then call it quits? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. When people say "regular season games" they are usually not talking about all the regular season games. They usually mean the games where a team is fighting for a playoff spot. And if a game is meaningless they still play. I mean a lot of players have a playoff game coming up and they will get hurt. Some are trying to get into the playoffs and some are trying to get out of the playoffs. Injuries are part of the game and if they are trying to get in the playoffs or trying to get out of the playoffs there is extra motivation. The NFL season is actually very long. I don't know if I'd call it too long. I would argue that it's not long enough. The NFL is in a weird situation because they have 32 teams, but the fans in the 16 teams that don't make the playoffs are not as invested in the regular season as they are in the playoffs. But the fans in the 16 teams that make the playoffs are not as invested in the playoffs as they are in the regular season. I think this is the reason why they have so many injuries. I don't like the NFL right now. But I'm not going to sit here and say that I don't like watching football. I just don't like the NFL. But the NFL is what is on TV. I love the college game. I wish we could watch it all day, every day. And I'm not a fan of the NFL at all. But the NFL is on TV and I'll still watch. Today's NFL is completely different from the NFL in the 1960's and 1970's. It is way more violent today than it was then. And they pay their players way less. I think the NFL has ruined the game. They are killing the game. I think they need to go back to the way they were before. I just don't know if they are willing to do that. As for injuries, that's part of the game. I don't think you should change the way the game is played to avoid injuries. I don't think you should change the way the game is played to protect the players. Injuries are part of the game and you'll get them whether you play contact or not. It's the high risk, high reward thing. Players are trying to play themselves into the playoffs and players are trying to play themselves out of the playoffs. If you're a good player, you're going to get a lot of opportunities to make plays and you're going to get a lot of opportunities to make mistakes. I think the NFL is the best game in the world. I'm not a fan of the NFL. But I'll watch the NFL. I'm not sure how the NFL has ruined the game. I'm not sure what that means. I think the NFL is very exciting. I think the NFL is the best game in the world. I'm not a fan of the NFL. But I'll watch the NFL. I'm not sure what the NFL has ruined. I'm not sure what that means. I think the NFL has ruined the game. To be honest, I feel like the NFL has become far too dangerous, and far too dominated by the elite few at the top. The NFL is a business. And the NFL is about making money. And as a business, I think it's safe to say the NFL has become a lot more prof
