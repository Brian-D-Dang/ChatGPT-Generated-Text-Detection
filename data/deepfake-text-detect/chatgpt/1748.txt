I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is one, they probably don't exist and if (when) you die that's the end for us either way so why bother with it? Then again maybe its just me being scared shitless by everything.....
