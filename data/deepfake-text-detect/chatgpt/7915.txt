There are several reasons why the government tracking and personal data collection may not be a good thing that should be continued or expanded: 1. Invasion of privacy: Government tracking and personal data collection involve collecting sensitive personal information about individuals. This may include their location, financial information, and online activity. This can be seen as an invasion of privacy and may make individuals feel uncomfortable. 2. Security breaches: With the increase in data collection, there is a high likelihood of security breaches. This information can fall into the wrong hands and be used for nefarious purposes. 3. Discrimination and misuse: Tracking and personal data collection can lead to harmful discrimination based on an individual's race, gender, or socio-economic status. Additionally, there have been instances of misuse of personal data by government agencies, which may infringe upon an individual's rights. 4. Lack of transparency and accountability: Government tracking and personal data collection often occur without the knowledge or consent of individuals. This lack of transparency and accountability can lead to an erosion of trust in government and can negatively impact civil liberties. Therefore, it may be argued that while government tracking and personal data collection may provide some benefits, such as enhanced security, the potential negative consequences outweigh the benefits and therefore, should not be continued or expanded.
