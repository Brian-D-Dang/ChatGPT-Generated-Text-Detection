I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural Asian food, so my life is a little darker now that I find a new way to use them. But the thought of using chopsticks is stick-in-your-mouth a lot of times. I think that if you want a simple meal with your lunch, you should use chopsticks as well.
