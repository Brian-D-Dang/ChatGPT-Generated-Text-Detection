Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and believe me when I say that my first thoughts were "that's fucked up," but what about non-consentual sex between friends or family members? Honestly, it's often easier to think of it as sexual assault than anything else. The way we talk about the crime here in America usually does not include the fact that there was no consent involved.
