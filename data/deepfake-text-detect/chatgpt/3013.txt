First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean the rest of us should be forced to view it in our workplaces or homes! Not only this but there is no way any company could possibly handle firing someone for showing their body parts without risking being sued out of existence by them
