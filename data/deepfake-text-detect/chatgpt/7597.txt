While it may be argued that the cost of bringing Watney home would have been exorbitant and seemingly impossible, there are several counter-arguments to support the decision to bring him home. Firstly, Watney was a highly trained astronaut and a valuable asset to NASA, making it imperative to bring him home safely. Additionally, the mission's success could be seen as a matter of national pride and a significant achievement in space exploration. Furthermore, not making an effort to bring him home could have resulted in backlash and negative public perception towards NASA, potentially affecting their funding and future missions. Therefore, the resources and efforts expended to bring Watney home were not only necessary but also justified.
