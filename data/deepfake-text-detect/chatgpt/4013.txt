A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government). Losing an election does not automatically mean that the person loses their right to run in elections for any other position. And when you say a political party leader, do you count people who are running as independents from minor parties? If so I agree with you. However if you just include anyone that is already elected then it seems like a very weak argument since most of these leaders never actually leave office and may be able to continue doing what they're doing after losing.
