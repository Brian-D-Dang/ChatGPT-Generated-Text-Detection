When I see debate about'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about'evidence'. If they shift on these polarising topics without thinking hard about the evidence, what do we end up with? If you're genuinely interested in getting better at arguing and making a point then it's worth remembering that there are many ways of proving something. There is also no good reason why 100 of arguments need to be based off of facts - someone who argues for an argument could say 'if i provide this data then the other team will concede!' and still make their point even if the data doesn't back them up. We're not taking into account the alternatives though. Even if one side's evidence seems weak when compared to another, let us consider that both sides have equally poor reasons for opposing each other's beliefs: so how can we possibly ever come up with any reasonable conclusion from that kind of situation?
