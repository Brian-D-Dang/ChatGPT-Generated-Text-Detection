This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point of view always has been and will continue to be don't judge me by my actions because they may not reflect what someone who thinks like X might do in similar circumstances; I am Z. And at some degree it seems obvious we shouldn't simply assume our own motivations when evaluating others since it is possible other factors (eases of access to information) can impact their judgment on issues, whether those issues are moral or otherwise... but that doesn't mean we should stop trying to make reasonable inferences from all available evidence.
