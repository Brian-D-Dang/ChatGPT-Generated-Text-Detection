Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. It's all about the flow. I could do that. I can put words together, say them out loud, and rhyme them. What is the big deal? I think the problem with rappers is that they think they are so original and clever and special. They are not. They are the same as any other human being. I think they should stop acting like they are talented and see themselves for what they really are. I am one of the greatest rappers to ever rap. I can't believe I didn't reply to this until now. I agree. I am so sick and tired of people believing rap is the height of music. I do think that it is a music genre and should be respected but for real, it is not the best. I have heard singers that could rap and I have heard rappers that couldn't sing a lick. It's a craft just like anything else. I have an uncle who is a really good singer, I am not saying he is the best but I have heard him sing and I have heard him rap and he isn't very good at raping. I can't rap but I could rap pretty well if I practiced. There are also rappers that aren't good at rapping and they think they are the best. They are not talented. They do what anyone can do.

They are the same as any other human being. People who rap have a very unique ability to put words together in a rhyme that they can perform well. No one can do that other than those people. If you try to do it, you'll fail, because you don't have the talent. Rappers can do this, singers can't. I'd like to see you try and do this. I also think rappers are overrated. To me it's just people trying to be witty and using big words. It's like when kids in school try to act all big and clever, you know they're not, but they think they are. I don't think anyone is special. It's not about that, it's about their skill and the amount of time and effort they put in. Also, it's not like rappers are saying deep things about life and relationships. I don't think anyone can do that. I don't think anyone is special. I disagree, I think some people are special.

I don't really have a preference. I do think that being a rapper or a singer is talent but I don't think that it is very special. I agree with OP. It's just putting words together in a rhyme.

I think people who can rap are talented and they can do this well. I don't think that everyone can do this. I am not too keen on rap and I think it is a very underrated talent. I think that it is hard to do and you really need to have a passion for it. I think that a rapper is special and unique. I have a huge preference to rap than sing. I think it takes a lot of talent to be a rapper. I could never do it, it's like speaking in a way that rhymes. I don't think anyone is
