I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, no colors at all... Is that really true? If yes: Why does God allow some people to go through hell on earth (i mean they deserve much more)? And why doesn't he prevent them from doing harm onto others if its indeed his will for those souls who end up being tortured by other humans or animals etc.? I think most of us would say we have enough heartache every day without having any new problems added into our lives! don' t get how can you just accept these situations but i guess one must be strong inside oneself with faith.. But where do u draw th line when dealing wth such cases?! For example; what should an ordinary person feeldo about anothers suffering? Should she help him out somehow even though either way her own life is going down downhill too?? Or maybe trying 2 sort something yourself then asking god 'bout eternal happiness moves away your fate as well since afterall He's gonna take care abt His job before anything else happens right!!! Please enlighten my soul:) Thankful 4 ur time patience..
