People who have no interest in politics, and are not interested in learning about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it its their civic duty; this is a big lie. I'm surprised by how often I see people saying they will know everything about a candidate or issue if only they went on reddit. So you're basically telling them to tune out election news sites because all of these web articles tell it like it is? Is your argument against those web pages that say "Click Here To Get The Whole Story On X Candidate"? It's also worth noting that there are good sources for information online - non-partisan newspapers, credible opinion pieces, respected organizations (e.g., OPB), networks with political expertise journalists (e.g., Fox News Channel). We need more of that.
