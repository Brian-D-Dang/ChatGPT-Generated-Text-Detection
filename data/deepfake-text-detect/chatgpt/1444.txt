Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of trying to reason with them about it they finally admitted defeat on vaccinating all 4 during a trip to Mexico for vacation (not even on an airplane).
