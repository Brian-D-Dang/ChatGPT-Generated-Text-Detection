This is purely from anecdotal, self researched and experiential knowledge, so feel free to correct me if there are any glaring issues in my position. I believe that some of the biggest problems with this line have been addressed by Bungie through patches (which aren't really frequent anymore) which included: 1 - More damage on shotguns 2 - Increased damage for headshotsCosmic Slugs 3 - The "dead zone" around a player actually hurting when you get hit as a result of its larger radius on an attacker vs defender model 4 - A speed increase for Pyros based on their ability to strafe faster than other classes whose movement isn't hindered while it's still moving forward like the Hunter or Engineer class missions the Pyro can run out of cover before being killed. This prevents a big part of the fun factor of finding entrances into whoop ass firefights where your character just has to make his way across open ground. It also makes them more vulnerable against alien runners because they've slowed down significantly without having to change weapons after blocking off half of enemy aliens' visibility via smoke grenades. 5 - Other miscellaneous bug fixes including replacing one game mode's two-weapon limit per map with only one weapon per person once again due to major changes in how loot distribution works. 6 - Various small balance adjustments to revive points, medic stations, armor stats etc... 7 - Inability to play ranked games at certain times of day or week whenever matches start to go over 1 hour long due to lobby sizes becoming unfeasibly large, even during prime hours. 8 - Removal of all penalties associated with losing a respawn when playing co-operatively as opposed to competitively or solo. 9 - Allowing players using private servers to be instantly dropped when entering matchmaking queue list rather than waiting indefinitely until their server finds a match; this allows anyone wanting to play the same character or not use cheats to do so without worrying about getting booted after getting matched up with someone else. 10 - Even though most singleplayer mission maps restored their original fast travel locations along with quick jump points, making the fun experience of jumping between places much better since now enemies won't spawn wherever the player appears but instead will follow the path set forth by game designers. 11 - Some new skins added despite finally stopping short of adding full body suits for characters such as the Spartan Elite Armor Skin pack, or the Medal Of Honor Pack Covert Ops Skin Set consisting of different types of helmets visors. Some people may enjoy these, especially those able to create custom skins themselves, but others don't care too much either way since we're dealing with cosmetic items here. There was another skin pack released involving Strike Suit Alpha Beta sets that had similar ideas introduced years ago as well yet never made it past beta testing stages. These were supposed to contain fully functional, wearable space suit parts complete with retractable helmet and arms that could be attached to other equipment and accessories depending on what kind of look the individual wanted for each item. However, once again, developers decided to completely scrap the idea due to reasons unknown (I'm assuming time constraints). Perhaps it would've required additional work to implement in Unreal Engine 4? Maybe they simply didn't want to include something so complex within the scope of DLC? I dunno exactly why. To address a few complaints going back to 2009 regarding lack of content updates, perhaps it might've helped to update their depictions of the soldiers across various media outlets instead of leaving our imagination running wild by letting us assume things like the Spartans looking like actual astronauts wearing orbital mining tools rather than futuristic military gear designed specifically for war. As far as I know, no further visual representations of this nature appear anywhere outside of promotional images in video trailers and screenshots used for marketing purposes. An example of what I mean: 12 - Eventually fixing a bug that allowed Holographic Visor users to notice the presence of connected USB devices underneath their helmets such as keyboards, mice, cellphones etc... By now, hopefully, every Halo player knows to check behind hisher mask should anything ever happen to cause himher discomfort otherwise known as the infamous "halo blindness." If nothing seems wrong, then just keep walking! 13 - Adding voice chat options to Private Servers (not available for public) for those inclined to prefer doing more than viewing munition statistics for teammates in real time during a mismatch scenario. 14 - Making sure that everyone gets good rewards regardless of whether there's 8 skilled players on a team or 16 random dudes trying to take down a flag. Newer teams always seem to win whatever amount of kills occur anyway so developers figured out ways to compensate for both scenarios with balanced reward methods so nobody feels cheated when overall losses obviously outweigh wins on average. People typically meet in lobbies and pick whoever agrees to team first unless said party consists entirely of strangers on Xbox Live. At least one squad member usually wants to join forces with random players that he doesn direct messengers put their personal best, and hopefully mine goes back homebase vaults spread among hosts' success rate dP poor proportionality testifies results in opportunity
