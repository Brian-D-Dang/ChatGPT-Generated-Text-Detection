Estimates show that the average american uses around 4 times the resources that the planet could support, if everyone was an American. These numbers are somewhat lower in Western Europe, but they still reveal a massive waste of resources and energy. In some ways it's worse than just using more per capita, because we're also consuming way less as well. We don't even reach half the amount of food required to feed ourselves compared with what people did 60 years ago (So basically all those fancy foods were invented to make Americans fat). Compared to Europeans, the US has dramatically reduced our consumption rate while increasing sales rates by much higher amounts than every other country combined. The US is spending 4x more on "food" than China does, 8x more than India and 16x more than Africa! This means that its not only us consumers who consume so much oil, gas etc..., but also producers like McDonalds or Walmart - which use huge quantities of fossil fuels for transporting goods across the continent. The USA produces about 50 of global greenhouse emissions from transport alone: this includes fuel used when driving cars bought at 9-10 year old age (used almost exclusively overseas), aircraft and ships carrying freight over oceans, trucks shipping goods between states; meanwhile most products we buy have never been assembled here themselves. We can find similar figures elsewhere in the industrialized world too. As I said earlier: per person, Mexico Canada produce nearly twice as much as America do in terms of CO2 production, yet these two countries import many more products from abroad than we export. Argentina imports 90 of their food supply from South America, where 70 percent comes from Bolivia, despite being one of the largest exporters outside Brazil itself. Same goes for Chile - 80. Most Asian nations rely heavily upon imported inputs due to low agricultural productivity within their own borders, let alone any future climate change disasters. One example would be Thailand, whose rice exports are largely dependent upon monsoon rains reaching Thailand, thus limiting supply during dry periods. If you want to know how bad things really are in regards to environmental issues such as CO 2, then consider the fact that life expectancy in developing countries has increased greatly since 1950. It shows that living standards have improved significantly throughout history, whereas carbon dioxide levels remain relatively constant. In fact, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air now exceeds 400 parts per million (ppm) as opposed to 280 ppm before human activity started kicking up its activities. Prior to industrialisation, atmospheric concentrations were 300 ppm. Average growth in population worldwide rose by 160, while land area grew by 1045! This graph sums everything up very nicely. With little increase in demand and output of consumer goods produced globally, we've actually seen a significant decline in raw materials utilised thanks to technology innovation along with better distribution systems. That doesn't mean there aren't problems though... There's clearly something wrong somewhere. Maybe the real problem should rather lie closer to home?
