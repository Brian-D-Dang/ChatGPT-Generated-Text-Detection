I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a car with good mileage is probably the cheapest thing you can do. How could you possibly forget about buying a car that has not changed hands since you bought it? My guess would be that it was a cheap car or something along similar lines where maintenance costs are much higher than if you buy newer models and replace parts periodically because your mileage doesn't change regularly enough for them to justify replacing parts properly during maintenance cycles.
