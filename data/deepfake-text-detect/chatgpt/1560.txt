I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the rating. Again - you know how this is going to end: There are some scenes that are just plain weird and creepy. When they're not scary at all (like Haku's girlfriend Towa) then it makes no sense because there isn't anything scary about them! And when characters talk like children instead of adults... well, maybe I'll go see it someday with an adult friend who doesn't mind such things:P Even though I don't agree with your rankings on which movies should make top 10, these comments have been very interesting!
