First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are spent on the care of pandas, money that could be better spent elsewhere. We do not need to be threatened by their extinction to appreciate their beauty. The notion of overpopulation is a bit dubious. Someone with a high school education could understand that the birth rate and population rate do not necessarily correlate. There is always some small population that breeds with no intent to pass on their genes (and even if there were no such population, the human race would survive). As for the science behind the end of the world, I do not buy it. All in all, I think the concept of humanity's end is very cool and unique, but I think it is unrealistic. the issue of overpopulation is not something that should be taken lightly. the earth is in fact overpopulated, and as long as we continue to live the way we do now we will continue to destroy the earth. I agree with everything you said but the last paragraph. I do not think that overpopulation is a big problem. There are plenty of resources and no matter what, there will always be someone living on the planet. The world does not have to be destroyed to be inhabitable. All we have to do is cut down on pollution and use resources wisely. If we are not doing that now, then we can't expect it to happen in the near future. I believe that there are many things that we could do to ensure that the planet is a better place, but it isn't going to happen unless we change our ways. The thing is that people are so selfish that they could care less about how their actions will affect others. I do not think that overpopulation is a big problem.

Overpopulation is a big problem, and unless we make drastic changes, the world will not be able to support the population that it currently has. We need to find a way to reduce the birth rate andor increase the death rate in a way that will not affect the poor and the elderly. I agree with everything you said but the last paragraph.

The idea that "humans are going to die off" is a common trope in SF and fantasy. It's also kind of nonsense. Even if we invented a way to reanimate dead bodies, we'd never be able to do it to ourselves. Even if we invented a way to colonize other planets, we'd never be able to do it to ourselves. The question is, how many generations would it take for us to completely exhaust the resources of the Earth? And the answer is probably, never. I agree with you. In fact I have a theory that we are close to the end of our species. I think we are at a point in time where we are on the br
