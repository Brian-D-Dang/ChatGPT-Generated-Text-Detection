While it's understandable that not everyone enjoys leaving a gratuity, tipping is an important part of the service industry as many workers rely on tips to make a livable wage. Additionally, tipping serves as a way to incentivize good service and reward those who go above and beyond to make a customer's experience enjoyable. By not tipping, you might be sending a message that you don't value the work of service workers and could be hurting their income.
