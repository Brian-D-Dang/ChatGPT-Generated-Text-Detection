Before anything else, let me say that I am not, nor have ever been depressed, suicidal or abused in any way shape or form. My life so far has been full of ups and downs but I was always able to find a reason for it all; if you were diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) this book is an absolute must read! It's amazing how one can improve their quality of life by changing just three things: getting enough sleep, exercising regularly and using simple strategies such as exercise reminders and self-talk aids. If you're like most people though, your lifestyle may already be in place... So what are they? In the UK alone 1 out of 5 adults and the same number of teenagers experience symptoms of poor mental health each year. The causes aren't well understood, but there are several possible factors which could contribute - including genetics, lifestyle changes and environment. In fact about 30 of all mental illness cases are linked to environmental conditions (such as stress, chronic pain and addiction). That means making small tweaks to our daily routines might very well help us manage these illnesses better.
