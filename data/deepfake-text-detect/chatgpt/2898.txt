Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I 'd like not invited...is there a good way to deal with this? Should we all just bring our dates and hope for the best or should we invite another group of friends instead (I don't want you guys getting mad at me haha). We did something similar when planning our wedding. We had quite a few 4s but they were all VERY close friends who knew us very well. If your only issue is that too many are adding a guest then tell them if they have any other loved onefriend they can bring as an alternate.
