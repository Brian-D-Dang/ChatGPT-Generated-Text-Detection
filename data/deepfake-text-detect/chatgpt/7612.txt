While literature indeed has the power to explore ethical and moral dilemmas, its purpose cannot be limited to defining morality. Literature serves many other purposes, such as providing entertainment, exploring human emotions and experiences, shaping cultural identity, and even conveying historical and political commentary. Moreover, morality is not fixed, and different individuals and cultures have varying moral standards. Therefore, literature cannot be expected to provide a universal definition of morality that applies to everyone. Instead, literature offers diverse perspectives that can be interpreted and analyzed by readers, leading to meaningful discussions and personal reflections on ethical issues.
