I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. The British were asked by Stalin AND Hitler repeatedly if they would like to come home from occupied Europe, and refused each time; neither did Stalin or Hitler ever want to invade Britain. If they had invaded Britain, it is highly unlikely that RussiaUK would have won. The British Government's withdrawal from Germany was also seen as a failure because they could not stop Hitler before he went into Poland. The Russians apparently couldn't either... so why wasn't it a success? Was the British Army too small relative to the forces available for defence against the German invasion? Did the Germans fail to get through on their own, without American support? Were there leaks of information about what was going on? All these aspects are important, but I suspect you already know those answers. In this post, I'll focus on an area that I think deserves more emphasis: air power. Airpower was such a big part of the war decision-making process, but very much ignored during the course of the conflict. It certainly didn't help the Nazi assault on London or the Japanese attack on Singapore - both easy victories when the RAF was lacking! Why were they ignored? Because the Luftwaffe was far superior to anything that the RAF had to offer - on paper. But how effective was its use in the eyes of key players in the war effort? Let me explain by looking at one case study of the Cospas-Sarsat satellite communication system, which helped reveal some of the problems with Soviet aircraft. [Here] (URL0). Now, I'm sure that anyone who has read my previous posts will remember that I love Star Wars, and was pretty disappointed when Rogue One came out earlier this year. So let's take a look at the basic science behind modern missiles - basically a reaction to our ability to observeobserve satellites orbiting above us. Firstly, we need to understand that, unlike the early days of space exploration, missiles used today can be tracked using ground based stations, rather than relying solely on satellite observations. Secondly, knowing where a missile is travelling allows us to predict exactly when it will reach its target. Finally, once we actually know where it's going, we have various ways of intercepting it - whether by radar, bombers or fighters. We've also learnt quite a lot since 1967, thanks to Israel's nuclear programme, which allowed them to develop 'proximity bombs', designed specifically to deal with targets within 10km away from the launch site. As well as this, we now have better weapons systems than ever, including lasers, microwaves and drones. As result, anticipating enemy manoeuvres, firing your weapons accurately etc., is easier than it used to be. Combine all of this, plus the fact that the US and French developed their own versions of the AIM-120 missile, which functioned over a range of around 80 km, and things got really interesting. For example, the French missile calculated correctly that it was approaching Italy after flying across the Mediterranean, even though it never entered Italian airspace. This meant that, instead of being intercepted by the Bf 109s and Vought F4F Wildcat fighter jets, it hit its mark and destroyed most of the targets inside Libya. And while this story does not directly involve the topic of missiles, it illustrates the differences between USAF NATO weapons and Soviet weapons - whereas the Soviets relied heavily on interceptors battling high level rocket attacks, the Americans rely heavily on laser guided munitions, which send precision strikes into the right areas.
