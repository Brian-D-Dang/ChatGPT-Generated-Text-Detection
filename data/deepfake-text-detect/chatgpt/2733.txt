I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for selling pot I think they deserve that choice Someone tried, defended and then found guilty of murder doesn't get an early release because he wants out so badly... I'm not sure why we would apply different standards just because you didn't commit your crime with violence?
