Just to get this out of the way first, I'm not debating what the current law is, or if people should obey the law. I'm talking about what should be the law. It's a question of ethics. While I'm all for legislation to protect the safety of the public, I don't think it's the government's role to legislate morality, and I believe that a law that restricts the use of a common technology such as the internet is a direct violation of the 1st amendment. And before you come back with something like "But it's the internet, it's a different set of rules" I say this: the internet is not a new thing. It's been around for over 30 years now. It's just the newest form of communication, and the newest technology. It's not something that didn't exist before the 1980s. But in spite of all that, the US Congress has decided to do just that with the PROTECT-IP bill, and the similar bills in the Senate and the House. The problem with these bills is that they are overly vague in defining what is illegal. While the intent is good, the law is very poorly written and is an invasion of civil liberties. But here's the problem: the legislation is only half of the equation. The other half is the actions of the ISPs themselves. Right now, all of the major ISPs in the United States are on record as saying that they would only comply with a court order to take down a website, not a "request" from a private citizen. This is the crux of the problem, because if the ISPs are not willing to take down websites, and they are not willing to pass along all the requests they get, then the law is useless. That's why the legislation that is already on the books is so vague: there is no way to make it work without the ISPs. If we want to enact laws that restrict the internet, we need to make sure that they are doable, and we need to make sure that the ISPs are willing to comply. That means, if we want to force ISPs to censor the internet, we need to force the ISPs to censor the internet. But this is not in the interests of the ISPs themselves, and I don't think they will go along with it. Let's look at the example of the Megaupload site, which is the current target of the law. The site was taken down, and the owner arrested, but the site still has mirrors and replacements for it. The law is not being enforced. If ISPs take the site down, people will just go to the mirrors and replacements. But the ISPs are not going to go along with it. ISPs are not in the business of policing the internet, they're in the business of giving access to the internet. ISPs are not going to go along with anything that would cause their customers to leave them, because that's bad business. ISPs will only comply with a court order. A private citizen is not going to be able to get a court order, so if they want to enforce the law, they'll have to do it themselves, by going to court. Which means that the government will have to enforce the law, themselves. Which means that the government will have to monitor the internet, which means that the government will have to restrict the internet. If the government wants to restrict the internet, they'll have to do it themselves. They can't expect the ISPs to do it for them, because that will lose them customers. So, if we want to restrict the internet, and make it illegal to access certain websites, we have to restrict the access to the internet, ourselves. Which is something that we should not do. I believe that the internet should be free, that people should be able to access any website they want. I don't believe that the government should restrict the internet. If a site is illegal, they should be prosecuted, just as any other site. But you can't restrict the internet, you can't restrict the access to the internet. If you try to do it, you'll lose customers. And if you lose customers, your ISP goes bankrupt and disappears, and you lose access to the internet. That's why I don't believe that the government should restrict the internet. I don't believe that the government should restrict access to the internet. I don't believe that the government should prosecute the sites. I believe
