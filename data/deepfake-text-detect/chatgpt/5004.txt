In a perfect world, puzzles would come in boxes with no pictures on them, maybe a word description of what you'd be putting together. But alas, it doesn't work that way; just like the boxes look ugly and boring because they don't have any pictures or anything to show off where things could go wrong (like pages full of pictures). Even better is if you can produce some kind of picture for each piece inside a box instead of using a picture book. If you need images of puzzles built into the box via software to put together an entire puzzle, there are thousands available online. What do you think? Would you use a software tool like this to build your own puzzle pieces? Or learn how to make puzzles yourself by yourself without having drawn images as well? Let us know below!
