While it's true that social media users may choose to share their content with a wider audience, it's important to consider the context and intent behind their posts. Just because someone shares a post publicly doesn't necessarily mean they are inviting anyone and everyone to look through their personal information without their knowledge or consent. In fact, many users may only intend for their content to be seen by certain groups or individuals, and may feel violated or uncomfortable if their posts are viewed by strangers or acquaintances who are not part of that intended audience. As such, browsing social media content without taking these factors into account can still be seen as a form of "creeping" or snooping, regardless of whether or not the content was shared publicly.
