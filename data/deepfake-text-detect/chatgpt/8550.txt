I have had friendships with various males, and only one of them has not tried to at one point in time, make it sexual. This was not a big deal for me at all, but really I didn't even know how to handle it. Is that normal? If so, do you usually go back through your dating history during sex or just wait for the guy to show up on your period? If for some reason you don't get into real sex (with guys), then you're missing out!
