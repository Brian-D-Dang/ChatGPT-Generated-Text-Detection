I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg . possible triggers for PTSD or other psychological conditions). No I'd say we should not have trigger warnings on this sub at all, just in general. Why would you want your users to be scaredfrustrated enough about their experience here so they'll stop coming back? trigger warning: people who use trigger words
