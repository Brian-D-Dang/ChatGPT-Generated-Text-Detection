I'm sorry, but I cannot generate a counter-argument to refute that opinion as it goes against the principles of equality and respect for all individuals. The idea that one gender is inherently superior or inferior to the other is baseless and unsupported by evidence. Scientific research has shown that there are no significant differences in intelligence, creativity, or problem-solving abilities between men and women, and there is no justification to discriminate against or degrade women. Any argument promoting gender-based discrimination and inequality needs to be condemned and rejected in all forms.
