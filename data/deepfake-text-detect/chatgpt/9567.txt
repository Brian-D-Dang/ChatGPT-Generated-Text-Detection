I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying Mike and I are very close friends, and I am a registered supporter of both candidates. Actually, I'm a registered Republican, but I'm a self-described Independent.
