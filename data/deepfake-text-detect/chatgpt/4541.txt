First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people . But this kind of "ethnic" makeup is so antiquated (and inappropriate today) that even a small amount can be offensive for most audiences, whether they are ashamed or not; especially if you're wearing them during an event where others may see your picture! Secondly, let me just say what many have said before: there's really no excuse at all for any kind of cultural appropriation. The entire "looks cool but shouldn't play dress-up with our culture" argument, while understandable in general terms, does nothing more than give consentor at least tacit permission!to someone else trying to appropriate part of their ethnic identity. And yes, that includes Halloween costumes. If anyone has anything clever enough to come up with without infringing on somebody else's rights unjustly, then by definition those ideas don't belong to anybody; therefore the same logic applies as when we think about copyright law, which protects both original works created by artists and derivative ones made from these creations. You should definitely feel free to make new things based upon existing sources, because who knows? Maybe someday you'll invent something beautiful on your own. It also doesn't mean that you can take credit for other peoples' work either, only that you might use parts of it in order to create something unique. So basically, unless you've been given explicit permission first, please do NOT try to sneak into another person's culture, costume, music style, language, etc., and rip off pieces of it for yourself... except maybe once [joke], for humor purposes. Anyways, back to my topic.... I've seen several examples out there lately online of whitenonblack actors portraying AsiansJapanese characters to hilarious results, e.g. Matt Damon playing Tiger Woods in the movie Invincible 2, Greg Focker going around dressed like Ghengis Kong, etc. This isn't new necessarily, since Hollywood likes its Asian stars to look extra exotic, i.e. Lupin in Sherlock Holmes in TV shows sometimes looks Japanese, until he appears alongside John Cleese later something he must surely resent. For example, last year Michael Sheen played Chinese President Ching Kai Cheng in White House Down, reportedly having much fun doing his research on the role by reading some old ancient books. These two types of appearances aren't particularly problematic because obviously neither actor nor character was meant seriously, although I believe it would still probably get pretty awkward if one had to go through the effort of impersonating multiple cultures authentically. Then again, Johnny Depp recently portrayed Richard Chamberlain, aka Captain Jack Sparrow, and Adam Sandler went straight across the line from friendliness to racist buffoonery by pretending to speak Cantonese for Jackie Chan in Kung Fu Panda 3. At times, this type of portrayal gets criticized as being racial stereotyping (think POC does kung fu), but in fact, it fulfills a need (like putting your face next to someone famous instead of having to wait years to meet him). Anyway, regarding the various recent cases mentioned above, I thought it worth bringing attention to because personally I find the idea of someone dressing up as a member of a different race extremely distasteful, regardless of context. Unfortunately though, unlike some issues related to diversity, such incidents often get overlooked due to lack of publicity and outrage amongst the public. Such occurrences happen virtually every day throughout popular media of course, and I wonder how much longer Mr. Sandler will keep getting away with mocking a minority group by simply imitating them for laughs, thus eroding the meaning behind the message? Similarly, fans seem to leave Justin Timberlake alone after he sings country songs with Tim McGraw and jokes around with Taylor Swift... why do they accept one thing so easily, yet complain over another type of entertainment? To those who think calling out celebrities here really means criticizing the audience rather than the performers themselves, I guess I could agree somewhat, considering the theater in question here is for children, but it's important to remember that these offenders weren't intentionally creating racism against a specific ethnicity, just through mockery. Yes, lots of musicians sing country songs nowadays; however, less than 1 of all total concert ticket sales are bought by African Americans. Rock concerts used to include plenty of crossdressers too; nowadays, nobody bats an eyelid unless it happens to coincide with some big political controversy. Funnily enough, in spite of myself being a huge fan of Kanye West, I found it very difficult to listen to Watch the Throne despite enjoying the highly positive press surrounding it prior to release. While I completely understood why a lot of average folks didn't care for certain lyrical topics, the way Yeezy chose to deliver these lines combined with the hypermasculinity of Rocawear clothing seemed awfully pretentious and immature at best. Whenever a man dresses like a woman for his artistry, he's expressing artistic intent, indicating that it's almost impossible to iliuscoreppaing the be careful, right proper (see clearlyseveral scholars have gone as farmose
