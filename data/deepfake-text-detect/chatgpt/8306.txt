GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job or pay rent yet so shouldn't be able to afford the things that are required for this rule; 2., if anything is needed from me it should come as an added bonus! So in short we will see what happens but hey at least i tried right? It'll just take some time longer than others...
