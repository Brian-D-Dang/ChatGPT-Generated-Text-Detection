I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still disagree with their tactics, and thus, I don't support the movement. I felt that their methodology was unnecessary, and they should find another avenue to express their frustration. My friend, on the other hand, felt that it was a smart move on the part of the protesters, and that they achieved a positive outcome. I disagreed. However, the debate then turned to the general idea of "interrupting." I was adamant about my personal dislike for it, and I got a bit riled up. I wanted to be able to say to my friend, "I know that you think interrupting is okay. That's your right. But it's not okay for me to do it, because it's rude and obnoxious." I didn't say that, but I was thinking it. I used to live in NYC, and I worked in the realm of stand-up comedy. I got into the comedy scene, and met a lot of stand-up comedians. Some of them were very famous, and some of them weren't so famous. All of them were very funny. And very rude. One of the most popular comics on the scene at the time was a guy named John Fugelsang. He was a huge, very famous comic, and the comic was a great guy. He was very kind, very funny, and very intelligent. He was also extremely rude. You see, John would sit in the audience at all the comic's open mics and he would heckle all the comics. He would constantly yell things from the audience, and insult them, and heckle them. And he was hilarious. He was a complete pest. Eventually, the audience got so annoyed that they started to ignore him. They would stare at him, and not laugh at his jokes, and the comedian that he was heckling would get very upset, and then, finally, he started to realize that this is the way that John got laughs, and then he would start laughing at all John's jokes, just to shut him up. He then realized that if he stopped laughing, John wouldn't shut up. So, he started laughing again. Then, John would get mad that the comic was laughing at his jokes, and would start yelling even more things from the audience, and the comedian would start laughing again. This would happen for the entire night. John got a lot of laughs that night, and he was a really popular comic. I had the same experience when I was a comedian. I was asked to come on stage at a comedy club, and I had to follow one of the most famous comics in New York. I was very nervous, and then this guy in the crowd started yelling things from the audience at the comic. He was being rude, obnoxious, and just plain mean. But I was amazed to see that the comic didn't get upset. He was actually very happy that this guy was heckling him. He started to heckle the heckler. He started to heckle the heckler back. And then, the heckler got the idea, and started to heckle the heckler back. They started a heckling war. It was incredible. I was amazed. The entire crowd was laughing, and the comic was getting laughs. That's the way that heckling works. You have to have the courage to yell rude and obnoxious things from the audience. The heckler has to be rude and obnoxious. The comic has to be rude and obnoxious back. The audience has to laugh at the heckler. The heckler has to get even more obnoxious. The comic has to be even more rude and obnoxious. The audience has to laugh harder. And then, after awhile, the comic and the heckler start to have a back-and-forth heckling war, and it's incredible, and the entire audience is laughing. I haven't seen this heckling war since John Fugelsang left the comedy scene. I haven't seen it since I stopped doing stand-up. And I haven't seen it since I stopped heckling. But, I think that's the
