I've lived practically my whole life on this phrase. It has shaped how I have made several important decisions in my life, though I have recently come to suspect that it is also influenced by this phrase "voluntarily." Vietnam War veterans weren't happy about the Vietnam War, but they were angry at American soldiers for their participation Like the Vietnam War? Not only did veterans protest against Vietcong troops and Vietnam vets protested the war, but Vietnamese Americans refused to join their comrades' ranks during the war because they believed it was unfair there had been no more casualties than other nations fighting wars before them so a lot of Vietnam vets thought that it would be easier if they fought Vietnam Veterans protesting the war said that was unacceptable and unnecessary and should not happen under such circumstances
