To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example: The marriage of a man and a woman in a stable relationship is one of the most stable and harmonious institutions in the world. It is the union of two people who love each other and want to make a commitment to each other to provide for each other's physical and emotional well being. Without this type of commitment, they would not be able to provide for each other's needs. It is a contract that keeps them together and should not be tampered with. When people have children, it is important that the parents remain married. When two people love each other and get married, they have a far greater chance of staying married than when the couple is only married for the children. This is the most common argument used against polygamy. If we legalize incestuous marriage, we will soon be legalizing polygamy, because that would only be "one more person." Also, it would seem to me that the same argument could be used to legalize homosexual marriage. This argument is probably true, but it is not good enough for me to justify the legalization of homosexual marriage. I have also heard some arguments against gay marriage that are, in my opinion, morally disgusting, but that are not used against incestuous marriage. For example, some people argue that homosexual marriage is a threat to the institution of marriage. As if marriage is some holy sanctity that must be protected. The institution of marriage is not some holy sanctity, it is merely a piece of paper. It has no moral value. Now, this is not to say that I want to legalize incestuous marriage, or that I am against all laws against incest. I think that laws should be in place to protect children from incestuous couples, but I do not see why the state should get involved in the private life of consenting adults. To close, I'd like to leave you with a quote from an article called, "The Case for Incest," by Peter Seeger, in The Advocate, March 1, 1988. Incest, after all, is merely another way of expressing love. It is the mutual expression of two people's desire to be with one another. How is this any different than any other consensual relationship, including marriage?
