I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for raping a child, I don't think they are getting out after that long That's not really how it works. It's your own fault if you're guilty as sin and can't stop yourself from committing guilt-based crimes or rape.
