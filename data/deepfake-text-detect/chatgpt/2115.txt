I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm ignoring how much I know about their sex life). Do you think this is normal? If so, what do I say to them if we ever meet up again for something other than just having some casual fun together?" Why are you asking us when you should be telling these guys "Meh." and moving on?
