Hi, I'm new. So the greeks are complaining about the EU's imposed austerity measures, the terms of their countries increasing debt problems, even going as far as to boycott german goods. Also, the greeks are unhappy about austerity, so they riot, and the police do nothing. And here in the US, we are unhappy with taxes and social security payroll taxes, and we riot. We also have the TSA "pat-downs" and the police and military power that the government is excercising on us. So, what's the difference? I don't want to put down anyone, but how is it ok for the EU to do this to greece, but we're ok here? Agreed. I don't support this austerity. If people can't afford to pay, then don't collect the money. Plus the austerity measures will only make things worse for the greek economy. It's like cutting off your head to get rid of a headache. 2 Treesprite, Apr 16, 2011 It's not like the Greeks can't afford to pay their bills. The problem is that they have been getting richer and richer, and have been living beyond their means. Now, because of the economic crisis and being in the Euro, they have to cut back on their spending in order to pay back their debt. They're being asked to do the same thing that the rest of us are. 3 Boreas, Apr 16, 2011 I'm not saying Greece doesn't have to pay back their debts. I'm saying that the EU and the IMF shouldn't be punishing Greece to pay back their debts. I'm not saying Greece doesn't have to pay back their debts. I'm saying that the EU and the IMF shouldn't be punishing Greece to pay back their debts. Hahaha, yeah, you're right. That's kind of how I feel. I'm in the US, and we're in debt, and we're being asked to pay it back. The richer we get, the more we have to pay back. It's kind of sad. There is a difference. Greece has debts that they do not have the ability to repay. That is why they have to cut back on their spending. I think the EU is being incredibly unfair to Greece, but I'm not sure why. Greece is very rich. They're just not spending their money wisely. I think the EU is being unfair to Greece, but I'm not sure why. The EU, IMF, and other investors are not going to put money into a country that can't pay it back. This is an issue between Greece and their creditors. There is no reason for the EU to be involved. I just don't understand why they can't pay it back. Greece has a huge population, and they make a lot of money off tourism. So why can't they pay it back? I'm not saying they can't pay it back. I'm saying that they shouldn't have to cut back on spending. I'm saying that the EU is being unfair to Greece. You would have to see their national debt to really see the magnitude of the situation. They are close to 150 of GDP. Yes, they are rich. They have a huge population and a huge tourism industry. But they also have a huge government. They overspent for years and now they have to pay the piper. Their economy is so huge and out of control that it would be like me asking my children to get rid of everything they own and not spend a dime for a year. Greece is very rich. They're just not spending their money wisely. I think the EU is being unfair to Greece, but I'm not sure why. I'm not sure if they were "
