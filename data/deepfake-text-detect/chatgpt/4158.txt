So, one thing that I have to preface this with is that I see both (all) sexes as equal, outside of a few natural sexual dimorphisms (Genitalia, ability to have sex in the future etc). Is it possible for me to change my perspective on such an issue? Nope. There's no way at all you can accept the fact that there are only two genders without accepting that humans were created malefemale and that we're not meant to be attracted to each other or to have same-sex attraction because those things make our society abnormal.
