growing up in america I was condition to believe women's breast are sexual organs do to the fact that we over sexualized them too much. it wasnt till recently that people began realizing what sexuality is and should be about, not why some male genitalia have a bad reputation for being attractive or sexy Oh wow, I didn't know that! Thank you so much for sharing your experience with me! Thank you for letting me know this too:)
