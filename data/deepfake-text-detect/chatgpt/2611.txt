With our constant fast technological advancement people seem to think that we will lead our selves to destruction because we do not use technology with care, but recently all new technologies have failed in this aspect and the companies involved also lost a lot of money. I am talking about bitcoin specifically as it is very interesting topic nowdays Bitcoin - What if there was an App for that? The cryptocurrency market has been having its ups and downs since 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto released Bitcoin into the wild world. As time went on Bitcoin users found themselves using more advanced applications like wallets and exchanges requiring specific security protocols whenever they wanted to make transactions or send coins from one address to another. Unfortunately many users were hacked by hackers who created sophisticated malware attacks against their computers which could steal personal information as well as Bitcoins without them noticing until weeks later. This caused some people within the crypto community to demand higher standards be enforced through regulation so users would feel safe while transacting online. However most regulators did not know how to regulate markets without hurting innovation and creating barriers between mainstream adoption and public knowledge. Eventually governments realized they had let cryptocurrencies get out of control due to lack of education regarding their uses and benefits, therefore beginning to work towards educating the general population instead. For example back in 2013 Chairman of Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke said: "It's important because currencies are at the center of macroeconomic stability. In times where confidence erodes globally, what happens inside your country matters less... There needs to be better understanding [of] these issues [like cryptos]. Regulators should not be shy about thinking seriously about that. But you can't wait ten years after something comes along before you start regulating it. You need to keep up with the pace of change." That being said, both Bitcoin and other digital assets have only continued to grow over the last few decades as innovative solutions continue to come forward. One such solution is Ethereum (ETC), which came onto the scene roughly three years ago. Unlike Bitcoin miners must pay Ether holders for transaction fees based upon supply and demand, making it more similar to fiat currency while still maintaining true decentralization. This combination makes ERC20 tokens (which includes all ETH-based tokens) much easier to understand and implement in real life situation. The best part is this process is decentralized meaning no government or central authority controls nor regulates anyone's ability to create, distribute, sell, buy, trade, etc., any type of tokenized asset. Many analysts believe Ethereum's usage model may someday replace traditional banking altogether, though, given time, that remains unknown. Currently some people take issue with blockchain technology because each block contains around 15 - 30 bytes per transaction (15 Satoshi). They claim that this takes too long to verify compared to credit cards and banks, however, this is offset by faster processing speeds and lower cost overall despite popular belief. Additionally a recent study showed that Blockchain transfers made 37 fewer mistakes than those done via SWIFT transfer. Although some say "the more things change, the more they stay the same" this does not apply here considering the fact that every industry has changed drastically during the past 100 years but yet remains relatively stable today. One even believes Cryptocurrencies are going to be used to increase political freedom throughout the globe, allowing citizens greater power by owning property in different countries without facing restrictions; essentially becoming the first generation capable of global citizenship simply by investing capital anywhere regardless of domicile location. Another says Crypto provides unprecedented access to global finance for millennials looking to bypass high credit card debt with low interest rates offered by ICO'sCrypto projects. Regardless of opinion, the future of Bitcoin looks bright, consider yourself warned!
