I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly interactions with the public. The two stories are very different: one is a tragedy, the other is an opportunity for change. For example, in March 2014, Officer Jeremy Duncan was involved in what would become known as "the death" after stopping Charles McMillian outside his home during a routine check-in at 2 AM. According to news reports, Mr. McMillian had just left work when he spotted someone matching his description get into a car waiting near his house before driving off without informing him. When Officer Duncan approached the vehicle stopped by Mr. McMillian's surveillance camera, it backed up quickly and sped away; he pulled over its driver, Kevin Stewart. During questioning, Richard Clardy, Mr. Stewart's friend from high school, said that they'd been playing video games together earlier that night and thereafter talked about their childhoods, jobs and interests. A few hours later, Mr. Stewart called Mr. Clardy back to say he wanted to walk around town looking at cars so he could find employment. He didn't mention anything unusual or out of character - unless you count being 25 years old living alone in a small city as something unusual. After showing Mr. Clardy where his apartment complex was located, Mr. Stewart headed toward his father's car, which wasn't far behind. Suddenly, he saw Officer Duncan running across the street towards them. As he approached, Officer Duncan yelled "get out!" and made hand gestures indicating Mr. Stewart should surrender. At first, Mr. Stewart complied, then turned to face Officer Duncan and ignored commands to put down the gun. Instead, he pointed it at Officer Duncan. Tensions escalated between the pair until Officer Duncan fired 10 shots through the windshield hitting Mr. Stewart dead center and wounding him three times. The case against Officer Duncan has yet to go to trial. Though most people agree Officer Duncan acted inappropriately, there remains some question whether he used lethal force in line with department policy. But whatever the outcome may be, I don't think anyone can argue this incident wouldn't have happened if not for Officer Duncan's intervention. By contrast, on May 21st, 2017, Officer Stephen Browning walked up to a man named John Dobbins Jr., 29, on an empty city thoroughfare asking why he appeared to be sitting idle with nothing to do. Normally, such encounters happen rarely because drivers will often seek shelter once approaching any kind of traffic stop sign or officer parked patrol car. They won't risk getting caught on camera talking to law enforcement since it might lead to arrest warrants issued based upon false statements or exaggerated claims. It also makes sense given how common jaywalking charges are these days. But those rules seem to apply only to black men. There doesn't appear to be any evidence suggesting that race played a role here as neither Mr. Dobbins nor Officer Browning appear to bear any resemblance whatsoever (although it probably never hurts to look). In fact, no white person encountered today tended to sit idly throughout the encounter either. Something else perhaps? Maybe community members aren't quite as concerned about potential racial profiling anymore than they ever have previously been? Black Lives Matter isn't quite as ubiquitous now as it was five years ago like it was 20 years ago like it was 30 years ago like it... well let me tell ya something; things are better! You know - little stuff, progress, etcetera, et cetera, et cetera... So maybe black folks actually feel safe enough walking around with umbrellas nowadays too whereas just ten years ago they weren't sure whether they were going to make it home alive following one of these public stops when fellow citizens asked questions. And even though we're still waiting for verdicts on both cases involving Mr. McMillian and Officer Duncan respectively, at least on paper at present both officers' actions seemed justified considering what they each did after stopping Mr. McMillian and Mr. Stewart. Both officers restrained themselves longer than necessary, and it appears neither shot a single bullet at any point that day. Neither officer required medical attention and none - save for the stray shell casing found beneath Mr. McDonald's body - presented obvious physical injuries consistent with gunshot wounds. Let us hope justice prevails in both cases.
