There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, but this is only true for high-income earners who save these funds rather than spend them on goods like food at restaurants (which go into hiring people) instead spending it in other areas where demand may be less strong including government services such as education which would hire more teachers." The report goes further: "In short; if your priority was increasing economic activity you wouldn't increase taxes because they reduce savings by families with lower incomes while those making higher income wages have excess dollars saved up from previous years when their pay rates were much smaller so extra taxation will probably not affect family consumption patterns very significantly unless we get back down again towards just above subsistence level...one could argue then what does an increased budget deficit mean? It means inflationary pressures rise..." - Revealing The Consequences Of An Uncontrolled National Debt Reported By Economics And Politics Consultant Dr Paul Craig Roberts author 'How America Was Lost' (2013).
