Hello CMV! First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). Secondly I think it is important that people understand that the university students have returned home to their homes after their studies at the end of the semester. Thirdly, I am sorry I cannot help you as I haven't been able to attend some lectures yet due to heat stroke injuries but hope to be back soon! Thirdly my lectures are fast approaching so please pray...Thank You! In summary, I see no need for further discussion about extra-curricular activities anymore - there has never before seen a crisis situation as we were forced into it with no option other than academic psychology teaching being forced down our throats by the government. The university community needs to come together more often without feeling threatened or harassed because of the police force. It's time to wake up to what is happening here!!!! The police officers who assaulted students have become part of our society now; they seem obsessed with beating us again because they don't want to admit that we can't afford to pay attention to the problems caused by the university which is responsible for ruining our lives. Thank you for your sacrifice and support, we'll miss you guys!!! As students we should all try really hard not let the police take away from our happiness!! We did not create this condition for them to punish us!!
