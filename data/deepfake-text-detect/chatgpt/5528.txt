Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 7th century CE, and has since spread to include more than 1 billion followers. The Quran was originally written down by Muhammad in the Arabic language, and is considered to be a perfect transcript of the words of God. Although there are numerous translations of the Quran, in order to remain true to its original form, they are not considered to be an accurate representation of the text. It is important to note that the Quran is not the only religious text that is considered to be sacred, as there are three other holy books: the Torah, the Gospel and the Zabur. According to Islam, God sent 124,000 messengers or prophets to mankind, each one of which being sent to a specific group of people. The 124,000th prophet was Muhammad, who was born in 570 CE and died in 632 CE. The Quran itself was not written down in its original form until four decades after the death of Muhammad. Muslims are people who follow the teachings of Islam, which also means that they have to follow the moral code found in the Quran. Because Islam does not recognize any intermediate beings (i.e. saints, angels, etc.), Muslims also believe that there is only one God (Allah). This belief is based on a verse in the Quran, which states that there is "no god but one god." Muslims also believe that the universe was created by God, and that they are in a state of suspension between two worlds: the material world and the world of the spiritual. The Quran is the foundation of Islam. Because Islam is a religion that is based on the Word of God, the Quran is considered to be a perfect transcript of God's message. It is believed that the Quran was written down by Muhammad, who was the 124,000th messenger or prophet sent by God. The Quran itself was not written down until four decades after the death of Muhammad. Some of the verses in the Quran were dictated to Muhammad by the angel Gabriel, while others were believed to be direct revelations from God. Because the Quran was written in the Arabic language, there are numerous translations of it. In order to remain true to its original form, these translations are not considered to be an accurate representation of the Quran. Although there are numerous translations of the Quran, there are also numerous versions of the Quran, which are considered to be equally valid. The original Quran is believed to have been written down in ink, on parchment made from the shoulder blades of sheep. These original pages are now kept in a vault in Saudi Arabia. The Quran has often been compared to the Bible. This is because both of these books are believed to be the Word of God, and were both written in the same language (i.e. Arabic). In fact, many Muslims believe that the Quran is the continuation of the Torah, the Gospel and the Zabur. They believe that these other books were incomplete, and that the Quran was sent to correct the misinterpretations of these other books. Because the Quran is considered to be the Word of God, it is considered to be perfect in its original form. Muslims believe that the Quran has not been changed since it was first written down, and that the text is the same today as it was in the 7th century. Muslims believe that there is no god but one god, and that the universe was created by God. The Quran says that there is no god but one god, and that this god is responsible for all that is. Because Muslims believe that all that is has been created by God, it means that all things are a reflection of God's power and majesty. According to Islam, all things have been created by God. This includes humans, animals, plants, minerals and all other aspects of the natural world. Muslims believe that the universe is a physical manifestation of the spiritual realm. The Quran states that the physical and the spiritual are in a state of suspension, and that the universe is a means by which Muslims can connect with God. The Quran states that the purpose of creation is to gain closeness to God. This is because the universe was created by God,
