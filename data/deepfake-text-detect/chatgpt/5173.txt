I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into giving herself up for marriage and marrying someone she doesn't want to marry or having sex like she wants. LOL But seriously though.. What's wrong with wanting couples together? I mean... this just seems silly especially if an unmarried couple only get married once in their life time since marriage isn't really necessary (swinger). There are still lots of marriages where they are forced by law that would result in children being sent off alone. It's not compulsory but it definitely forces them to take care about themselves before getting married which is why marriage is bad when you consider that most women don't spend all their lives without feeling comfortable accepting a man who came out as gay so long ago he could treat them better than other men do.
