WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in the right place don't seem to have anything better than the ones who spend most their time looking at pictures online but are quite happy with what they see and talk about how great the world is Sorry I should've clarified.
