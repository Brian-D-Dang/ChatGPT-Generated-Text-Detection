I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, right? Why would you say that in your title? What is the actual meaning of "good" and "bad"? In English it's the same as saying 'all these terrible things happened.' In Japanese they call this (URL0), which means to study or consider carefully.
