Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as I have done for many years, I've been very concerned that the government will attack the ideals of democracy in Hungary and at the same time the Indian people, who are often considered enemies of their country, will be unable to use the great power that democracy has to offer.
