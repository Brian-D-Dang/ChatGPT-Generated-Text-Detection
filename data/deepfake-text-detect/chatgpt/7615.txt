An argument against this opinion could be that allowing content to be freely available on the internet creates an unfair competitive advantage for those who choose to pirate, as they are able to offer the content for free without incurring the costs of producing it. This would result in fewer sales for legitimate retailers and content producers, which could lead to reduced revenue, fewer jobs, and a decline in the quality and range of creative works available. Additionally, this approach would undermine the value of intellectual property and discourage innovation and creativity, as individuals and companies would no longer be guaranteed a return on their investment in creating content. Therefore, instead of working together to make content readily accessible, it is necessary to enforce copyright laws and hold those who pirate accountable for their actions to prevent harm to the creative industries.
