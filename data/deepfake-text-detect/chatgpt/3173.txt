Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as a mediocre pizza from a restaurant. However, there are some ways to improve the quality of frozen pizza. One way is to add additional toppings or ingredients to the pizza, such as vegetables or meats. Another way is to cook the pizza in a hot oven at a higher temperature than recommended on the package, which can help it cook more evenly and produce a crisper crust. It's also important to make sure the pizza is fully thawed before cooking to ensure even cooking. While frozen pizza may never compare to a freshly made pizza from a restaurant, these tips can help make it a more enjoyable and satisfying meal.
