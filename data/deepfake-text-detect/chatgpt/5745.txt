This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced with my definition of "diversity": I define diversity as accepting and celebrating the existence of all groups of people, not simply acknowledging them. I define diversity as a willingness to challenge our own preconceived notions and prejudices, not simply tolerating them. I define diversity as a willingness to work for a better society where all members of society are able to thrive and fulfill their potential, not simply accepting the status quo. So, with that in mind, let's talk about what happened this week. There was a panel at the Democratic National Convention hosted by America Ferrera and Meredith Vieira called "The Power of Our Voices" that included a number of prominent Latina women and Latino men and transgender people, and it was a great panel. It was a great panel because it emphasized the importance of diversity of thought and opinion. It was a great panel because it featured people who are often marginalized and disproportionately affected by the policies of the political parties and the political system as a whole, but who are often seen as "other," or worse, seen as the "enemy." It was a great panel because it celebrated the diversity of voices and ideas that are part of the Democratic Party. It was a great panel because it was a diversity panel, and yet it was not a "diversity panel." And that's why we need to talk about what happened this week. This was a panel to celebrate the diversity of the Democratic Party and the importance of diversity in politics. This was a panel to counter the narrative that the Democratic Party is only for white people. This was a panel to showcase the diversity that is present in the Democratic Party and the diversity that the Democratic Party is capable of. This was a panel to show that the Democratic Party is capable of being a party for people of color, for women, for LGBTQ people, for trans people, for disabled people, for people of faith, for people of different socio-economic backgrounds, and for people of all ethnicities and races, and that the Democratic Party is capable of being a party that is inclusive of all people. And, for one brief moment, this panel did all of that. But then it failed. This was supposed to be a panel that was going to showcase the diversity of the Democratic Party, a party that was founded in 1848. This was supposed to be a panel that was going to showcase the diversity of the Democratic Party, a party that was started by abolitionists. This was supposed to be a panel that was going to showcase the diversity of the Democratic Party, a party that was started by Martin Luther King Jr. This was supposed to be a panel that was going to showcase the diversity of the Democratic Party, a party that has always been at the forefront of the fight for civil rights, women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and workers' rights. This was supposed to be a panel that was going to showcase the diversity of the Democratic Party, a party that has always stood up for the most vulnerable in our society. This was supposed to be a panel that was going to showcase the diversity of the Democratic Party, a party that was founded by women, a party that has always prioritized the needs of women. This was supposed to be a panel that was going to showcase the diversity of the Democratic Party, a party that was founded by people of color, a party that has always prioritized the needs of people of color. And then, this panel failed. This panel failed because it did not sufficiently highlight the diversity of the Democratic Party, a party that is not diverse enough. This panel failed because it was not a diversity panel, it was simply a panel that was focused on issues of diversity. This panel failed because it did not do enough to celebrate the diversity that is already present in the Democratic Party. This panel failed because it did not do enough to demonstrate the importance of diversity within the Democratic Party. This panel failed because it was not enough. This panel failed because it did not do enough to showcase the diversity that is already present in the Democratic Party. This panel failed because it did not do enough to demonstrate the importance of diversity within the Democratic Party. This panel failed because it did not do enough to demonstrate the importance of inclusion within the Democratic Party. This panel failed because it was not enough. This panel was not enough. This panel did not do enough. I want to end with a question: If
