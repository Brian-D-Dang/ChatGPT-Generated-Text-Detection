I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT Q community, as well being friends with several gay people in my life (including myself). But what is alluring about these relationships? What makes them so special when they can't even reproduce biologically?! Is it because we are "safe" making out while our parents aren't home knowing there's no chance one could get pregnant?? Or perhaps its just an easy way around banging someone without worrying if you want kids later on down your lives... who knows! But for now i'm curious why some see such long term benefit over others trying natural methods..
