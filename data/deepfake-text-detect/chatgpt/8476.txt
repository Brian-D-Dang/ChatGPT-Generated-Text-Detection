America has accomplished nothing in its history that makes it worth of such widespread pride and love by its people (particularly this time of the year). Every event that Americans celebrate as our greatest achievements, was done not because America did them first or better than anyone else. They were accomplishments made possible through American innovation helping to create a world for everyone but us; improving lives around every corner with no regard whatsoever about who lived there before we came along - what color their skin iswas also didn't matter either since most revolutions happen when one class wants more power over another without any respect at all towards those they are oppressing." "In fact many countries have risen from poverty just like Haiti...but do you see Haitian flags everywhere? No! Because unlike some other nations which celebrated democratic elections last week too - where democracy only works if your country benefits economically off doing so - most poor places still cannot afford freedom!" "And yet everyday I hear thousands upon millions raised on behalf-of an individual named Barack Osama Obama make declarations based solely he should be president despite his record having been atrocious thus far regarding keeping promises..." This post seems somewhat tongue-in cheek factual... But then again..who can really tell anymore nowadays?" "Socrates"
