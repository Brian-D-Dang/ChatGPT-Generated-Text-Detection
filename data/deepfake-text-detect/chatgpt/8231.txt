WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in this community have been active on here long before me and they've had a tremendous impact upon my life already so it only seems fitting (if you pardon such an awful pun) that their experiences should be shared with those who are somewhat new or might not know them at all! The following is based off some very interesting questionspoints made by one fellow user named "Kyle" whom has no doubt saved countless hours worth reading material over many years since he was just around when these things were coming out...I think his name says everything about him as far what type if person we're dealing wth lol:DNow don't go getting your panties twisted but lets get straight into business..and keep ya hands where everyone can see em' ok?;)
