While the War on Drugs aims to reduce drug abuse and addiction in society, it is primarily focused on illegal drugs such as narcotics and stimulants. Tobacco products, on the other hand, are legal and regulated by government agencies, with warning labels that inform consumers of the dangers associated with their use. Moreover, while cigarette smoking is unquestionably harmful to health and can lead to addiction, banning it altogether would be impractical and infringe on people's personal freedoms. Instead, policies to discourage tobacco use, such as increased taxes, public education campaigns, and smoking bans in public places, are implemented to minimize its detrimental effects. Therefore, the acceptance of cigarettes by the government and society is not in conflict with the War on Drugs, as tobacco products are not classified as illegal drugs and are subject to specific regulations aimed at minimizing their harmful effects on users and non-users alike.
