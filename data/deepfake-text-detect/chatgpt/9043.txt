While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established (or younger) people to be quite ridiculous. I'm 21 but my parents still feel the need to force me to be more comfortable with myself than they do by making sure I have a good work ethic. This is just the way it is.
