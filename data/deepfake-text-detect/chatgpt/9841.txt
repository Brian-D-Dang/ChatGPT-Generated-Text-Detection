I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites and build models to predict certain outcomes. That got me interested in the subject, so I started researching and learning more about it. Now, I'm enrolled in an online course on data science and machine learning, and I've been working on a few projects using various algorithms. I'm also reading books and articles about the subject and learning more through online tutorials and forums. I find the concepts and implementations of machine learning algorithms fascinating and am excited to learn more and continue exploring this field.
