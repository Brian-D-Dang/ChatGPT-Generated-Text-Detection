A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was removed but all the options are there to play with and enjoy so I can deal with it. I have no issues at all with any of the classes (except for maybe engineer), I just prefer using a primary weapon that is good against enemies on foot, like fragsgrenade launchersmines etc.. however my favorite gun class is definitely Pyro since you get an arsenal of weapons which includes one of the best shotguns ever created! The shotgun does work well vs ground targets such as bots and zombies though but not much else. My opinion: The BFG should've been made into its own separate weapon instead of being part of the elemental kit OR added onto another elementals damage type other than blast; It doesn't need to have both explosive fire components because they're not working together very efficiently anyway. There's absolutely nothing wrong with having multiple components per weapon besides wasting resources and time making more elements when what we really want is better performance out of existing ones; especially considering how expensive these maps are compared to earlier versions. That said, it could do a lot worse than the M1 Garand, SMG9x or even the minigun right now. They're almost perfect choices for this game while having plenty of customization options allowing players who love unique looking guns to find exactly what their style matches perfectly. But feel free to change it up too, I'm sure people will figure something out eventually. Edit: After thinking about it further, I'd also suggest replacing the taser, machine pistolassault rifle comboAKM with either the mini-Uzi or MP7 to balance things out. Keep in mind these suggestions aren't meant to replace every active melee weapon class although they may make them redundant enough so they may actually come into question depending on your personal preference. For instance most competent players wouldn't call themselves true "pyros" without one of those three weapons along with the flamethrower. Try adding some new equipment options for each role (e.g., additional hand grenades) then try experimenting with different combinations honestly based on what feels comfortable and suits your intended use cases. To me personally, I enjoy combining two builds together. One my main build is dual wielding TDKs and PKMs for extremely fast hitscan combos from close range and long ranged accuracy respectively. I also sometimes mix in Tasers for general crowd control defense purposes. Other times I'll go straight for ammo conservation by switching to a single beam EDC Assault Rifle to take advantage of crosshair placement versatility and high mobility combined with medium rate of enemy damages. Finally, occasionally I'll throw down some Batteries and run around doing random stuff until someone gets close enough to kill me. If anyone happens to pick me off, it's great cause it forces everyone else to adapt and learn how to handle the situation properly versus getting grabbed immediately afterwards.:P All in all, I hope my input helps give shape towards a direction that is agreeable to yours. Cheers and thank you again! Well done to whoever did this! You didn't write "this" - even though the article has clearly become the de facto standard resource for almost everything related to our subject matter here... Scrypydraps: Well played! That is excellent advice indeed. And when I first looked through pages upon pages of information regarding the topic before coming across this thread, I was surprised at just how comprehensive it was overall! Thank you so much for taking the time to share the expertise you gleaned! Now I know where to look next time... And I appreciate the reminder that simply reading others' opinions isn't necessarily worth much;D! Just wanted to add my 2 cents as always. Sometimes I like to split my build between 3 classes and switch back and forth during certain situations, and often times during more intense combat scenarios, I find myself going full soldier mode and utilizing the heavy sidearm assault rifle combo thick armor setup. This allows me to move faster due to reduced weight, hit harder thanks to VAC gear and be able to dish out extra pain via heavy weaponry. However, once things calm down slightly, I usually revert back to strictly infantry and focus on aim assist mastery and moving accordingly. Personally speaking, I am a fan of dual wield pistols and rifles. Unlike a lot of folks here, I believe the team decided this way early on and stuck to it rather than plan changes and drastic overhauls later on. In addition, I like seeing everybody cover the bases covered, e.g.: Heavy Armor Melee Weapon Soldier Mode elsehwere. Makes sense to me.:) Who knows? Maybe there is something in there for ya! Good luck buddy!:] This guide is brilliant! Thanks to scrypydraps for writing this up reining in hertzzzz jumbled histerparationist: AVRP tried settingteytengot izity wantsagile wants himaterwhat
