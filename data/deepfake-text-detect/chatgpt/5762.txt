It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. Not only is this diversion a distraction from the real issue of moving people from point A to B safely, it is also a distraction from the 80 of people that will not be able to afford these cars. A better idea would be to give all cities, a 100 of the money they spend on roads and not to the government, but to the local municipality. The cars are not the problem, the roads are. If the roads are free for all to drive on, then you do not need a license, or any insurance, or a driver. Just a car and you can go anywhere. This would create a much better people transportation system than self driving cars or pollution reducing cars. It would also create a market where companies would compete on innovation to build the best cars and car makers would compete on price. This would also give us a much faster route to a safer, cleaner, people transportation system, than the distraction of self driving cars. People transportation is not a problem of individual vehicles, it is a problem of the roads they drive on. Roads that are not free to use for all is a huge waste of money, and causes pollution and other problems. The free use of roads is the key to a safe, cleaner people transportation system. The free use of roads is also a key to innovation. This is the next key to a safer, cleaner people transportation system. In my opinion, the self driving car is a distraction from the real solution to a safer, cleaner people transportation system. It is also a diversion from the actual problem of roads being blocked off to non paying people. If roads were free to all, then we would not need to drive, or have cars. I would not have a car or drive it. I would get the city to provide me with transportation. I would be a user of the transportation system not a driver. If a person owned a car and it was free, they would not be paying to use their car. They would be paying to have their car parked. And they would not be paying for the actual use of their car. If the roads were free for all, then companies would compete on price, and the cost of transportation would go down. Then we would have better people transportation. Then the roads would be safer, cleaner, and more efficient. Then the cars would be safer, cleaner and more efficient. Then the government would not have to waste money on roads, and spend that money on things that are actually needed. If the roads were free, then we would not need a driver's license, or any insurance. This would free up a lot of money to put into a safer people transportation system. If the roads were free, then car companies would not need to spend money on research and development. This would free up a lot of money to put into safer cars. If the roads were free, then car companies would not need to spend money on advertising. This would free up a lot of money to put into safer cars, and more efficient cars. If the roads were free, then companies would not need to spend money on recalls and lawsuits, and insurance. This would free up a lot of money to put into safer cars, and more efficient cars, and a safer people transportation system. If the roads were free, then car companies would not need to spend money on labor to produce cars. This would free up a lot of money to put into safer cars, and more efficient cars, and a safer people transportation system, and a safer people transportation system, and a safer people transportation system, and a safer people transportation system. If the roads were free, then car companies would not need to spend money on taxes. This would free up a lot of money to put into safer cars, and more efficient cars, and a safer people transportation system, and a safer people transportation system, and a safer people transportation system, and a safer people transportation system, and a safer people transportation system. If the roads were free, then car companies would not need to spend money on road construction. This would free up a lot of money to put into safer cars, and more efficient cars, and a safer people transportation system, and a safer people transportation system, and a safer people transportation system, and a safer people transportation
