I've been pursuing a lot of scholarships and one of the things that irritate me is that there are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my race. There's this whole mindset amongst some Black people, especially in America where we think "Oh well I'll just go out here work hard get good grades you know and then maybe something will come up." But it really never does for us because we're always put into these boxes or categorized as who they want us to be rather than what our true potential could have possibly been," she said Activism can take many forms but when faced with an issue like systemic racism how do individuals address their concerns? It may seem simple enough yet addressing issues such as systematic oppression requires more thoughtfulness. The ability to recognize your privilege plays an important role in helping others see structural inequity which leads to dismantling racist policies while simultaneously being able to view those changes through clear lenses of empathy and understanding. Third year psychology major Jonathan Chapman believes activism doesn't need to include protesting at all costs. He says, he understands why students feel passionately about the recent protests around campus however; his own experience has taught him patience towards injustice: "We should definitely speak against injustices whether small or large so long as we aren't going burning buildings down or looting anything...but if someone was killed by police brutality right now and everyone rioted tomorrow, then everything would be gone within two days anyway without rebuilding," Chapman explained.
