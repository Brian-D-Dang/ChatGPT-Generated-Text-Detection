Hi guys! To expand: Although I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman for example) a woman to their face and when talking about the family unit, there is no need. I find it disrespectful that people use transgendered as an insult but not transsexuals? Like how can you be offended by something helpful and positive like gender identity while using words such as "cunt" or other slang terms as insults towards transgender women??
