Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on and forget about it. This is not what is needed, this is why I am trying to do something about it. As a school, we are learning about the problems of the world. These problems include poverty, hunger, terrorism, global warming, diseases, and many more. This is why we are learning about it. Many people think that the world's problems are too big to do anything about, or that one person can do nothing to change the world. But they are wrong. If you think that you cannot change the world, you are wrong. You can change the world. You just have to start with one person. You can change the world for the better by telling other people what the world problems are and by raising money to help the world problems. The world problems are not just for other countries to fix. Australia has its own problems, just as much as any other country. But why should we care about other countries' problems when ours are bad enough? Because they are not just other countries' problems; they are world problems. By raising money for world problems, we could do something about the problems. "Australia is one of the world's 20 richest countries with the world's third largest income per head. In a world where more than a billion people still live in poverty, it is a nation of excesses." - ABC News. "Australia is the world's thirteenth largest economy, the tenth largest exporter and the fifth largest importer." - ABC News. This is how Australia is doing financially. But we still have world problems. We need to help the poor countries who have to live in poverty and can't afford to pay for food and healthcare. How do we help them? By raising money. "Of the world's population, around 1.1 billion people live in absolute poverty. The Australian government spends around 100 million a year on aid to help those in need." - ABC News. Money raised will be donated to charities who help the world's poor. This includes: The Red Cross, Oxfam, World Vision, UNICEF and the Salvation Army. You can donate by coming to the school between 7:30am and 3:30pm and leaving your donation in the box outside of the office. Throughout the week, a collection of posters and flyers will be sent home with students. These will be in the folders that you collect at the end of the day. The money raised will be put towards buying food, clothing and medicine for the poor in other countries. How will we raise money? We will have many different ways to raise money for these charities. We will have a bake sale, with each student bringing in a piece of home-made cake or biscuit. Students can bring in money, or donate items to the school's craft shop. We will have a market day, where students will bring in donated items to sell. We will hold a school dance, where students can have fun and also donate. Students will sell raffle tickets for prizes donated by local businesses. I would like to thank everyone who donates to this cause. By helping others, we are helping ourselves.
