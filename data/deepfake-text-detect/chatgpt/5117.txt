I don't have an incredibly detailed post on the matter. My general logic is if you HAVE to sign someone up to vote, they will most likely be too lazy uneducated to read your post or just plain stupid and would rather not contribute anything useful that you might believe because we all know it's good enough for their benefit? Then again, I'm probably wrong since I may lack knowledge of the voting system myself but it was a shitpost so there's no reason why I should do anything more than welcome someone who gives me constructive criticism without being rude!
