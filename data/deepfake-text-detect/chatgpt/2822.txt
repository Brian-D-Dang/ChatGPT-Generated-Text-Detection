Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit like "ee." A lot of words in English have the same hard sounds at the beginning cereal" and "cerebral. 2. The spelling, or "spelling," as it were. We can understand how an average person would pronounce X much easier than how they'd manage with Y. 3. X looks almost identical to I, but not quite. There's no way someone could confuse them, especially if you add some kerning. 4. And perhaps most importantly: It's just cool that we call our currency the symbol." But does this mean there won't be any new characters? Not according to my sources...
