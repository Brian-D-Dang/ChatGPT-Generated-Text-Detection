A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a gun, the person running the range saw her but missed and opened fire on her. I don't know if this happened to you or not but it did. I have been trying to find out who put that gun in the dude's hand for some time.
