I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer shoot someone in their car? And then when you think of it like that, there is no reason to take a life at all unless they are really threatening somebody with something," said Saunders. Saunders has spent decades as an advocate for families who lost loved ones due to a wrongful arrest by police. She will be representing those victims tomorrow morning during a press conference on the steps of City Hall. She also plans to file complaints against the city regarding these recent incidents.
