A few points clarifying my view: By primary language, I mean either official language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that particular region. Second, I am not suggesting that immigrants should be forced to learn the primary language of their new country but rather that it is beneficial for them to do so in order to fully integrate into the society and take full advantage of the opportunities available to them.
