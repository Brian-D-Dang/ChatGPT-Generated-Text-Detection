Violence is not the only way to change the hearts and minds of the ignorant. In fact, violence often perpetuates ignorance, creates further divisiveness and reinforces negative stereotypes. Education and positive communication, on the other hand, can help break down barriers and open up dialogue, leading to greater understanding and acceptance. It is important to approach ignorance with compassion and patience, rather than aggression and force, in order to create meaningful change.
