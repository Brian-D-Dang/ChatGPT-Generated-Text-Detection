I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have livedcurrently live there, I could not be more dead set against the city. It's incrediblyexpensive (even for Americans), dirtyuncleaned areas of town are overwhelmingand scary at night as a woman traveling alone or with just one other person;there is no public transit whatsoever which makes getting around extremelydifficult if you don't own your car on top it all being an overpriced cesspoolof crazies that should never leave their homes without supervision). The people here do seem nicer though!:) posted by jessamyn (staff)
