Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my friends have been getting into veganism, and the arguments for it are really convincing. However, I do have concerns about how you can get all of the nutrients that you need for a healthy diet, as well as concerns about the environment. Now, I have been a vegetarian for 7 years, and I am planning on becoming vegan, but I know that I will be missing certain nutrients, such as Vitamin B12 and D. In addition, I am concerned about the environment and the amount of water that is used to raise cows, chickens, and pigs. I know that there are certain supplements that can help me get the nutrients that I am missing. However, I have heard that the best way to get vitamin D is to get it from sunlight, and I'm concerned about the cancer risks associated with that. I've also been thinking about raising my own vegan chickens, as well as a few other animals. That way, I can get the nutrients that I need, while also protecting the environment. However, I'm not sure how I would keep up with the work of raising animals. I don't think that I would be able to spend all of my time on raising the animals, which would mean that they wouldn't be getting the attention that they need. I know that there are many vegan food companies, so I'm not sure how they could be affected by raising my own animals. However, I also know that there is a big difference between buying the food from a company, as opposed to raising the food yourself. What do you think? Do you know anyone who has tried to raise their own vegan animals? If so, how did it go? Any other advice? Thanks! I'm not sure where you live, but it's usually possible to buy vitamin B12 supplements in a health food store or grocery store. As for vitamin D, you can buy supplements or get your D from fish oil, which is good for your heart. You can also get your D from milk. Some vegans (such as T. Colin Campbell) recommend eating a little bit of fish, or seaweed, and perhaps some eggs. I would suggest that you read the book, The Vegetarian Myth, by Lierre Keith, which argues that vegan diets are not the answer for the environment or for health. I'm sorry, but I don't really have any advice for you on raising your own animals.
