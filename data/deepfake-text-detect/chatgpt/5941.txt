I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be right or wrong, it's just that they may not always follow it. The reason is that I always wondered about this subject. If we are told that morality is subjective, then how can it be said that it's objective? My mother always tells me that morality is subjective because, for example, she said that some people find it wrong to steal because they would be caught and would get into trouble. Whereas there are people who wouldn't mind stealing because they would not get caught and would get away with it. I guess I have a very black and white way of thinking. So is it possible for morality to be subjective? What do you guys think? Re: ObjectiveSubjective Is it possible to be subjective? When you say that morality is subjective, what you mean is that there is no absolute answer to what is right and what is wrong, that the right answer to any moral question is dependent on the individual or culture involved. Is it possible that morality is subjective? It's subjective in the sense that there is no ultimate, objective truth on what is right and what is wrong. For example, murder may be wrong in one culture, but it may be right in another. But this doesn't mean that morality is subjective in the sense that it doesn't exist. It exists for every culture, but there is no universal truth on what is right and what is wrong. Objectivity can also be subjective. The objectivity of the universe is subjective because each individual's perception of the universe is unique to that person, even though that person's perception is "objective" to him or her. If morality is subjective, why should I listen to my mother? She may be right or wrong, but how will I ever know? I agree with you about morality being subjective, but then, why is it subjective? I would like to know how you explain the existence of morality. Subjective morality comes from my personal beliefs. I can be a subjective moralist and say that it is right for me to steal a book if I need it more than the original owner. But if you decide that stealing is not right, you're justified in calling me a thief. How to explain the existence of morality? I don't know. I don't have a good answer to this. Would you mind explaining this? I'm a bit confused. I think it's important to distinguish between a subjective morality and an individualized morality. Subjective morality is the notion that morals are subject to the whims of the individual and that they are therefore 'malleable' - ie. the 'right' answer to any moral question is dependent on the individual or culture involved. Individualized morality, on the other hand, is the notion that the 'right' answer to any moral question is independent of the individual or culture involved. Objective morality asserts that there is an absolute right and an absolute wrong - that there is an objective truth on what is right and what is wrong. Subjective morality does not assert this. In this sense, subjective morality is not, by definition, objectively right or wrong. So, I think, this is how we could explain the existence of morality. If you define 'morality' as 'a code of values used to judge human behaviour', then morality is objectively right or wrong. If you define 'morality' as 'the subjective views of the individual', then morality is subjective. Thus, morality is subjective in the sense that there is no universal truth on what is right and what is wrong. I would like to ask how you define morality. Is it the code of values used to judge human behaviour, or the subjective views of the individual? If you define morality as 'the code of values used to judge human behaviour', then morality is objectively right or wrong. If you define 'morality' as 'the subjective views of the individual', then morality is subjective. I see. But, what would you say is morality? To me, it's not a code of values used to judge human behaviour, it's a code of values used to judge human behaviour to me. But I'm just a kid. I think I see what you mean. I'm not sure, though. I'll have to think about that for a while. I guess I don't understand
