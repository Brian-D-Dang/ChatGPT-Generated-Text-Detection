I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our national budget is like a household's budget). As an adult I've had experience with both sides of the aisle. Personally, liberals are more dogmatic when it comes to their beliefs than conservatives.
