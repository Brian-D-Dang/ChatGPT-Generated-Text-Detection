While it is true that people can be selfish, it is not a valid argument against socialism communism. The theories of socialism communism are based on the premise that people work together for the common good, and that everyone benefits from a society that is more equal and just. Furthermore, many successful socialist communist movements and policies have existed throughout history, demonstrating that people can come together and work towards a common goal. Additionally, the motivations for socialist and communist beliefs do not arise from individual selfishness but from a desire to share resources and opportunities equally among society. Therefore, it is misleading to claim that socialism communism cannot work because of individual selfishness, as this argument misses the larger values of these ideologies.
