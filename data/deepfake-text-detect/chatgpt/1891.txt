Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and then they die at 38 years old from drugs or alcohol (and yes I am using an extreme example). It seems like even though person A has lived their entire life as American that we should kill off all of their descendants? That makes no sense whatsoever They would not have been able to vote anyway if this were true because only citizens can legally do so
