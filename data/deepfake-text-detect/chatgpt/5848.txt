Theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying doesn't do that. Economic efficiency average happiness: violating the individual rights to be unharmed and to keep and use your own property isn't efficient because it is harmful to people and it makes them unhappy. But it seems to me that this is a distinction without a difference. People are always doing things they do not have a right to do. We live in a society in which we give people rights to do things they have no right to do. It is inevitable that some people will take advantage of this fact. If someone has the right to murder you or steal your money, then it is inevitable that people will do so. If you think it is wrong for people to murder and steal from you, then you shouldn't live in a society in which they have the right to do so. But there is a way to prevent this: don't make it illegal for people to murder and steal from you. If you do make it illegal for people to murder and steal from you, then you are violating the rights of people who wish to murder and steal from you. That's not a good way to prevent murder and theft. Saying "theft is theft because it is stealing" is a semantic game. Yes, it is stealing. But it is also wrong. Stealing is wrong because people have a right to keep and use their own property, and it is wrong to infringe that right. You can argue that theft is not wrong because the thief doesn't know that it is wrong. You can argue that theft is wrong but it is wrong in some other way. But "stealing is wrong because stealing is stealing" is not an argument. Good post, Jeff. I had a similar discussion in my thoughts on the stealing vs. theft distinction. Theft is a property crime, and there is a difference between stealing something of someone's and taking it without their permission. The stealingtheft distinction is important. But, as you point out, there is no need to claim that theft is not theft.
