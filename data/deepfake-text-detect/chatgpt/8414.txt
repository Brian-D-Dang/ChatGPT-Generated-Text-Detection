I just read this [article] stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering these same schools are typically the most expensive (tuition, room board) and offer you less academic freedom in comparison with many other public universities such a state school or community college.... If anything we should be worried about leveling out because of affirmative action... As opposed making it even more tricked up for those who don't deserve any help whatsoever! I wonder how much 'over' representation there is at every ivy league university? Probably over 90 white (ish). And what do they call them: cosmetically diversified minorities..?? Dumbest thing ever!!
