First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person who can look at my experiences with some objectivity and compare them to those of others and determine how things are done around here (or there). I also do not have children in school or anywhere else for that matter where they may be exposed to anything related to sex education until later on in their lives when it is probably too late if what happens in high schools is an example. So maybe someone already said everything that needed to be said? Not really sure but I'll try anyway. Sex Education - A Misunderstood Process This subject brings up many emotions within both parents and educators alike as well as students because everyone has his own view of what sexual education should look like. The fact of the matter though is that all of these views based upon one's experience have a large impact on our approach towards educating young people regarding sexuality while we often times forget that each individual student may need something different than another to reach maximum learning potential while still remaining comfortable enough to make use of every tool available to achieve such goals. When looking at situations through this "learning lens," we find ourselves facing many challenges including different values, parenting styles, religious beliefs, educational approaches etc., which ultimately create barriers between us and reaching student success. It seems obvious but perhaps needs emphasis just in case: None of these differences are wrong; rather they help provide diversity among the population in question increasing its overall value. However, that does not mean that every educator must incorporate every aspect of such differences into their classroom environment. Rather, what we need instead is a system that utilizes all aspects of human knowledge so that individuals can maximize their personal strengths associated with whatever area (s) we wish to teach thereby maximizing learning opportunities along the way. Addressing Sex Ed in classrooms can very much resemble the same tactics employed by teachers throughout the generations and centuries past in other disciplines where diverse groups were forced together under certain circumstances whether it was religion, politics, math skills..etc. This process would most likely consist primarily of teaching factual information learned from textbooks along side perhaps some discussionclassroom activities intended only to encourage communication between teacher and student leading to greater understanding. That's pretty simple right? Well...yes and no. Perhaps you noticed that I capitalized two words within this sentence stating, "perhaps...." If so then your attention must now turn toward the following areas I will discuss briefly before moving forward: Facts vs Values, Variables Relationships, Real Life Examples, What Works Best?, Is It Time For Change?, Summary, References
