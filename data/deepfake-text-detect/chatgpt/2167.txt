Snowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned. Snowden did not commit treason because there was no evidence suggesting "the intent or effect (of) deliberately aiding an enemy." Any argument about whether Snowden committed treason relates only to his motives for leaking highly sensitive national security documents in 2013; lying during sworn testimony before Congress regarding NSA surveillance programs; fleeing prosecution by Russia, China, Cuba and Ecuador prior to coming forward with this information; negatively impacting international relations between nations by making America look like a rogue nation overreachingly violating civil liberties at home while engaging in covert operations abroad without public oversight; failing to come back to face justice when offered amnesty from President Obama's administration after returning some stolen files; releasing data collected on Americans as well as foreign nationals who had nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism so they could see exactly what their government was doing behind closed doors?
