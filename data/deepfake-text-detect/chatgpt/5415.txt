How can you convince me that all the nations that I'm allowed to visit aren't all working together to hide a bigger and better and more free world. Maybe the world would be better off if all countries were able to cooperate, rather than separate us from our own people? The world needs stronger economies with governments who work together in concert instead of separating them apart as it is happening now - as the world has become dysfunctional.
