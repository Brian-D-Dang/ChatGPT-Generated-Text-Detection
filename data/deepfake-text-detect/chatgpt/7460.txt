While tranquilizer guns may sound like a less lethal option than firearms, they are not a practical solution for law enforcement. First, tranquilizer guns require much closer proximity to the subject, usually within 20-30 feet, which could put officers at risk of physical harm. Secondly, tranquilizer guns take several seconds to take effect, during which time the subject could continue to be a danger to themselves, others or law enforcement. And finally, tranquilizer guns require a level of expertise and accuracy that is not possible for many officers, especially under high-pressure situations. Furthermore, not all situations law enforcement face can be solved by the use of tranquilizers. For instance, what if a suspect is already armed with a firearm, knife or other deadly weapon? In cases like this, using a tranquilizer gun would be completely ineffective and dangerous for the officer. In summary, although tranquilizer guns may seem like a non-lethal option, their limitations and restrictions make them an impractical solution for law enforcement. Police officers need to have access to a variety of tools including firearms in order to ensure public safety and their own protection.
