There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: Done with this comment now - I found another one that can stay Natalie Portman did an amazing job in Black Swan with her portrayal as Nina Sayers. When she had to pull herself away from studying ballet for so long it really showed and created some tension between us viewers. It's been awhile since we've seen a movie where I actually teared up.. Also loved how they kept her hair blonde even though you didn't see much of her face while wearing all white makeup. Love Natalie! I agree although I am not sure if 5 is too young for movies...he might be getting bored by them (as he gets older) - but 6 would probably work fine, unless he has excessive attention span issues (cannot say). The point about keeping him entertained during the 2 hour duration should help out;) Jaws 5? With regard to a shark attack film thats easy; i'd go with Jaws 3D or more likely 4. Or better yet, why don't you put your little boy on Google EarthGoogle Maps then have him navigate his way back home. That could teach him something other than using TV (which is often used incorrectly anyway), videogames (under fire control) or the internet (of course under supervision). Unfortunately most parents do nothing after watching their children fall victim to predators online until someone calls the cops. What kind of parent allows their kids access to the internet out side of the house without any knowledge of what sites are safe or dangerous?! Just because there hasn't been a predator killing that many people doesn't mean those numbers aren't an issue. Maybe its just me but when i hear "predator attacks most common cause of death among youth age 9 to 17," i wonder WHY?? I know theres alot of disease etc going around right now, does anyone else feel like this number is alarmingly high??? Im starting to get worried for our son growing up The problem isn't necessarily that teens lose interest in life, but rather that they become disillusioned by the state of society. Kids today live through social media, friends who cheat and lie, everyone latching onto popular culture instead of anything intellectual for example, kids reading Harry Potter rather than classics such as Greek mythology. They're told over and again that drugs will make them happy, only to find themselves disillusioned later. So maybe kids are maturing faster than previous generations. But let's look at the bigger picture: Children are in trouble partly because adults are in danger of losing sight of morals and ideals. And if you ask me, watching videos on YouTube involving turtles riding bicycles is no substitute for either. At least try to keep your kids sheltered from both the dangers of technology and empty entertainment. If you can't afford lessons or tutors, hire a private tutor yourself. You'll need someone to tell you whether your kid is spending enough time outdoors doing physical activities and playing sports, and whether he or she needs less screen time. In fact, some schools require kids spend 8 hours a day indoors. Encourage your kids to read books, listen to music, draw pictures and play board games together outside. Let them watch television as well, but limit it to news programs or educational shows. Avoid violent video games and cartoons; otherwise, prepare your kids for strong graphic content in films. Finally, take a few moments each night before bedtime to talk about important values in life, including honesty, loyalty, friendship and respect toward others. Your child may grow up to be a healthy, confident person thanks to these messages. If nothing else, it won't hurt to give him a lesson or two on morality. This article also touched upon concerns regarding teen cyberbullying. Unfortunately, there is little evidence pointing to a correlation between device usage and negative effects related to bullying. According to research published in 2012, 70 percent of U.S. adolescents reported having experienced mild forms of cyberbullying or harassment within the past year.[1] As mentioned above, the reality is that social networking websites provide enormous amounts of opportunities to connect. On top, studies show that certain types of conduct, such as sexting, posted on Facebook or Twitter pose risks for teens. However, research suggests that overall use of social networks provides benefits to students' education and mental health.[2] Perhaps combining elements of technology with traditional tools will lead to more balanced results. Hello. Thank you for sharing this great idea. We have thought about trying this method ourselves and wanted to share this blog post as inspiration. Good luck!! First off, thank you very much for putting this list together. My daughter is entering Kindergarten next month and we needed to think about things we were missing out on due to technology. Technology is pretty ingrained into homes across America nowadays, which makes the opposite party officials if you have already established, last week, no. 12 years old; nary's own, illeter into task equating type cohort, different
