First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. She is probably a widow. Her husband had died some years before and she was left with nothing but her two children (one male and one female). That's not much if you ask me: she could have easily come upon whatever used to be called prostitution or something like that. What would happen if there were no such thing as laws? The problem arises because we are trying to make sure that everyone has equal rights. If we only do this for our own benefit then it will fail.
