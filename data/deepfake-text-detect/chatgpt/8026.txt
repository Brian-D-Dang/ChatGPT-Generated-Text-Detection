While it's important to prioritize your partner's physical and emotional satisfaction in a relationship, it's not fair to suggest that one partner is obligated to fulfill the other's sexual needs. Sexual intimacy in a relationship should be based on mutual desire and consent, and each partner has the right to express their desires and set their own boundaries. It's also important to recognize that not all individuals have the same sexual appetite and not everyone is comfortable engaging in certain sexual activities. Therefore, expecting someone to fulfill all of your sexual needs puts unnecessary pressure on them and can cause emotional distress. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable communicating their sexual desires and working to find a mutual ground that satisfies both of them.
