The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there's usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line (for example: The Catholic Church), but you don't see people referring to abortion as "the Bible" or "Christians versus theists." It makes a lot more sense for those who support abortion rights to make arguments about whether or not abortion should be legal across borders than the original settlers did. Although sometimes the idea isn't completely without merit, the issue has been around longer than most (like the debate over slavery). Now there are those who say the debate could remain open until they get pregnant women out into society voluntarily opting against their will with the help of some kind of laws rather than forcing them into abortions. This would seem like it would have no impact on anyone except the government. And if the decision endangers lives, then what good does it do? So I'm asking myself why should anyone listen to anyone arguing against abortion unless they're Christian themselves? Why don't we hear about it from other religions also? Why doesn't anyone tell us how much worse the threat of religious violence can actually be? Are there any Christians who believe being violent towards others in this way encourages them to commit crimes against humanity too? Why aren't they calling out the white supremacists when it happens at an early stage during pregnancy instead of making statements Supporting religious minorities only shows how morally bankrupt Christianity really was before it became fashionable again after the Civil War - some wouldn't even admit it anymore. It seems almost impossible to argue that abortion shouldn't exist because the bible tells us to hold ourselves responsible for our actions. But imagine forbidding women from having children according to the book of Genesis?! Where else might someone argue about protecting the unborn child based on the Bible? Why wouldn't we hear about the persecution committed by believers against Christians just because they disagree with the Bible?! At least we know the Bible says it demands strict adherence to all morals! Maybe we need to talk about abortion once more. Maybe we need to stop worrying so much about morality while using the Bible as justification for everything it contains...just as we'd be doing today with religion.
