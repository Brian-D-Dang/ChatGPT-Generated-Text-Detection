It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet. I've always found it interesting how some of the most obnoxious drivers (or more likely, their fear-based parents) run around town at high speeds on quiet residential streets while backing out of parking spots or driving down a street in traffic just because "their" car is louder than everyone else's. It seems like these folks would fit right into an episode of Jay Leno's Garage if he decided to do one on loud-muffled vehicles... I have never understood why owners choose such a dumb thing as a diesel truck engine for their daily driver when there are so many good V8 powered trucks available... but then again this isn't all that uncommon either; I'm pretty sure GM was making CDs specifically to sell them to power plant workers and old style shift forklifts back in the day. In fact I remember seeing a couple years ago during dealer inventory periods where no less than three new "trucks" were sitting side by side waiting to be delivered, each bidding against the others' price tag in order to snag a customer who had become tired of hearing "the big boys roar." But because of tradition and brand loyalty there will probably still be plenty loaded up at your local Chevy dealership next week even though nobody wants to buy 'em! On the bright side any of you who might actually need something from a fleet store should take advantage of today being Thanksgiving for anyone looking to offload theirs before the silly rush begins tomorrow! Happy Turkey Day! Angry Quill wrote:A friend has been talking trash lately too much about his Ford F150 4x4 Silverado 1500 HD crew cab pickup. He doesn't understand the reasoning behind me calling him names. We're cool but we may not get along whenever he comes over to visit. He also drives a newer model Dodge Ram 2500 Heavy Duty which makes me sleep better at night knowing I can kick its butt anytime I want. Yeah, yeah it only gets 9 mpg city17 highway but what truck does? Everybody knows every vehicle loses efficiency very quickly once passing two tons heavier than itself the first time through a hill start rolling backwards with negative momentum. The problem with his statement however is that he says "My truck is way better than yours" without having ever driven mine except for maybe fitting a front bumper and hood ornament. Just another example of how technology keeps changing our world faster than we realize. Maybe now after reading here and watching videos online for hours at a time doing simple tasks that used to require days of searching randomly someone will see images of a jet flying overhead for the first time instead of spending the entire day listening to their favorite music DVDs playing movies until closing time. I hear there are now portable video games that connect wirelessly to computers via Bluetooth. Now that includes iMacs and iPads too! What would the future bring? If I'm right here's hoping there'll be a lot fewer cars on the road and lot more giant jumbo jets zooming through the sky. Then it wouldn't matter whether you drove a sport utility vehicle or kindle mobile device since airplanes could carry enough cargo to fill half of America's national parks and make delivery times nearly instant. Sure they'd be noisy and polluting but at least "they" won't feel comfortable stealing electricity directly from public utilities anymore. Do y'all think electric motors eventually overtaking gas engines could lead to us needing hybrid planes? That could save money somewhere down the line which means paying passengers might land safe and sound at airports across North America similar to how airlines nowadays offer free food. Because who cares about saving gasoline when you could eat turkey legs and poutine plus watch movies projected onto screens between seats anyway?! Sounds great to me! A little bit further ahead is a family Dyson vacuum cleaner that sucks dirt and pet hair right into a bag attached to its underside. This would eliminate cleaning carpeting altogether resulting in a waste disposal issue absolutely solved right away. After all everything looks clean with nothing sticking to anything instead of getting covered in dust particles! Good riddance to that mess! And speaking of vacuums, what happened to the idea of selling small household appliances using rechargeable batteries made exclusively of lighter weight components versus nickel cadmium cells that weigh twice as much yet require regular replacement? It seemed like you couldn't go anywhere in the US without encountering a Radio Shack open late on Christmas Eve that glowed brightly under white lights sending shoppers beating eensy tiny trees stuffed full of wrapped presents inside of makeshift retail stores while singing happy songs aloud. Ah well, things change but hopefully for the better. So let's take a look at the present and guess what might come in the near future. Picture yourself filling up with fuel mid air as a drone scans nearby roads for signs of leaks and cracks. Your windshield wipers automatically adjust themselves based upon sensor readings transmitted from cameras built into your steering wheel. When you finally touch ground again a few miles away they estimated travel was surprised it took place impossible? Where did we end up going out of course testifies lightening his hands tripping probability rates) isn is TR
