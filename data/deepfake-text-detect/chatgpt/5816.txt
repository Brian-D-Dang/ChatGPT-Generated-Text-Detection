The host country thing has run its course. Organizing the Olympic games is financially ruinous, blatantly wasteful and the procedure favors corrupt regimes willing to put themselves on the map. This year, it's Russia, next year, who knows. It's time to rethink this. There's got to be a better way. I suggest that we have one permanent host country, one permanent site, and that every four years we rotate the summer and winter games between two sites, one in the winter and one in the summer. Let's call this concept the Bermuda Triangle Games. For example, in the year 2015, the summer games would be held in Bermuda and the winter games in Rio. By making the rotation between two sites, we would make sure that no city would be in the running to host the games every four years. Every four years, there would be a new host city, and each city would get to show off their city to the world. The international athletes would get a chance to compete at a new site every two years. Every four years, the host country would be the same. No more phony bidding process with developing countries pandering to the IOC for a chance to host. Each host country would have all the Olympic venues at their disposal for their Bermuda Triangle games. They wouldn't have to build or renovate the stadiums. They would have the advantage of being able to lay out the track to the athletes' satisfaction. For the other two years, they would be able to schedule the games to accommodate their local interests, as long as it is in the two years between the games. All games would be held in one host country, and all games would be held at two sites. Let's say the summer games are held in the host country and the winter games are held in an adjacent country. For example, the host country might be the United States and the summer games would be held in Bermuda and the winter games in Canada. It would also be interesting to hold the games in different parts of the world. For example, we could hold the winter games in the Arctic, and the summer games in the Antarctic. The host country would not have to worry about building and maintaining the infrastructure to support the games. They would just have to run a shuttle bus from one site to the other. They would also not have to worry about the security of the athletes. The host country would already have the security measures in place. The host country would also be able to utilize its army, navy and air force to provide security for the other games. For the first time in history, there would not be any political interference with the games. The IOC would not have to worry about offending the host country. And if any host country had concerns about the Olympic games being held in their country, they could simply not host the games. The IOC would have to find a new host. It would be financially beneficial for the host country to be the host country. They would get the games for free, and they would get all the revenues from the games. They would get to keep the Olympic merchandise and all the sponsorships money. For example, if the host country was the United States, it would generate almost 12 billion in revenues from the games. In short, this new concept would be financially beneficial to the host country, and would eliminate the wastefulness and corruption that are inherent in the current system. The Bermuda Triangle Games would also be the most environmentally friendly games ever held. And finally, the Bermuda Triangle Games would be the most exciting games ever held. There would be no Olympics. There would be only the Bermuda Triangle Games. The Bermuda Triangle Games would be the first time that the Olympic games were held in the same country and at the same site. It would be the first time that the host country would get to show off their venues to the world. It would be the first time that the host country would get to show off their athletes and facilities to the world. It would be the first time that the host country would get to hold two Olympic games in the same year. It would be the first time that the host country would get to show off their athletes to the world at two different sites. The Bermuda Triangle Games would be the first time that an athletic competition would be held in two different countries in the same year. The Bermuda Triangle Games would be the first time that the host country would get to enjoy the Olympic games twice. The Bermuda Triangle Games would be the first time that the host country would get to enjoy the
