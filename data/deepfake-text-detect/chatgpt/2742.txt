Ok, view changed. I guess I meant that there was an arbitrary double standard between alcohol and pot in the workplace, as opposed to saying employers don't have a basis for firing someone just because they're high at work. So... what you are essentially stating is that it's ok to be drunk on the job, but not ok if you happen to be stoned? Sorry dude, but even being "just a little bit" stoned makes me sluggish and unmotivated, so no way would i ever want my coworkers thinking im slacking off or doing something stupid while i'm high..
