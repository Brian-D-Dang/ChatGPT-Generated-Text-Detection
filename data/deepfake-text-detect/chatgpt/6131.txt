There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is to stop political corruption, and I'm sure it does. But the law is written so that it can be interpreted in a way that is unconstitutional. The law prohibits anyone from giving or offering any money, articles of value, or services to someone with the intent of inducing that person to vote for or against a particular candidate. Now, I could be wrong, but I think it is clear that it is OK for someone to give me a bag of candy to get me to vote for them. But the law goes on to say that it is illegal for someone to pay someone else to get them to vote. Now, I think it is also clear that this is unconstitutional. If I decide to give someone money in exchange for a favor, that is a contract. The contract is between me and the person I give the money to. If I decide to give someone money in exchange for voting a certain way, then I am simply giving them money. I am not giving them a service or an article of value. I am not buying a vote. And if I want to give someone money and then expect something in return, then I have the right to do that. But I don't. Because that law says that it is illegal. I may be able to get some of my money back, but I can't expect to get anything in return for giving someone money, whether I ask them to vote a certain way, or not vote a certain way, or to vote for me. This law is fundamentally unconstitutional. It infringes on my right to contract with whomever I wish. If I want to give someone money, then I have the right to do that. And if that money is a reward for voting for me, then I have the right to give it. I don't know why I'm so bothered about this. I don't think it will happen in this election. But it is a fundamental violation of my rights. So, here's my suggestion. Let's do the following: 1) A political candidate can accept any amount of money from anyone to be used for their campaign. But they can't spend it for anything. They can't hire anyone, or spend money on anything. The money must be held in trust for the campaign. 2) A person cannot give money to a political campaign. But they can give money to a third party, who can then give the money to the campaign. I think both of these are completely constitutional. There's no contract involved in the first one, and the second one is just a third party giving someone else money. That's the only way we can get rid of the law. But I don't see anyone pushing for it. So I guess I'll wait for the next election to give money to a campaign.
