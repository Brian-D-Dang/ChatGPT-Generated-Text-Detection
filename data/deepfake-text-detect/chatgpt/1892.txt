(A) Work part-time in high school; Then go to college (B) Work full-time before you go to college (C) Work while you study in college. I was a spoiled lazy student, and thought that it is not important how much money i earn but what my parents will think about me when they see the big salary at end of month. I picked C option as well - worked for two years with one year break because of university and then started working again after finishing University
