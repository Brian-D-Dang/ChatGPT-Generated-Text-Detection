I'm not asking anything about why we self harm - trust me I've got many answers for that. My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is wrong and it's bad, but they only seem able to tell you what the negative effects are of us doing so rather than trying to help or offer alternatives that's very true! i think because there isn't a positive answer people just assume its due to traumadepression (which may be part) but don't want them implying "just stop if ur happy then u wouldn't hurt yknow?" like idk im still super new here
