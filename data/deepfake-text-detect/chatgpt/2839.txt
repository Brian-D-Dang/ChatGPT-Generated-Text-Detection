So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want a good impression of the candidate, ask them in person or have your friends talk with himher. You'll pick up on body language that is hard for people who haven't met the person to appreciate, but can provide useful information. I've always taken issue with this kind of advice when it comes from people like pundits, pollsters, etc. 1 for sticking by your guns though! (you said debate polls were "really stupid" which means you may be a pundit)
