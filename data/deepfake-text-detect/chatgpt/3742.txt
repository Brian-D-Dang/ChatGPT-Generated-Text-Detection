Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on to the next news story without really thinking about how we as a society can work towards preventing these tragic events from happening again. It's important to raise awareness about these injustices, but it's equally important to take action and advocate for change. One way to take action is to support organizations that work towards abolishing the death penalty and advocating for criminal justice reform. You can also educate yourself and others on the flaws and biases within our current criminal justice system. In addition, you can contact your elected officials and urge them to support measures that promote rehabilitation and reduce the use of the death penalty. It's important to use our voices and demand change in order to create a more just and humane society.
