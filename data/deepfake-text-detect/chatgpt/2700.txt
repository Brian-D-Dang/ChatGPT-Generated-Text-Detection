Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I 'd argue on the contrary: Black is a color just as much as white is; it's just we perceive them differently (you can't see green with your eyes). The reason why they're called colors instead of shades of gray has nothing whatsoever to do with anything other than marketing and tradition. Wait... if you don't define color by refraction, then what do you mean when you talk about red? It seems like there must be another definition which excludes reflection in order for this definition to make sense.
