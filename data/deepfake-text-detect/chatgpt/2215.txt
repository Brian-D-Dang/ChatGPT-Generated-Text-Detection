Firstly- I'm a Brit, so if I'm missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies! While having a conversation over the phone about a movie (the name of the film escapes me at present) it came up that my friend had recently been to see Gladiator and she said 'Why on earth didn't they just put their swords through each other?' Obviously this led us into an hour long philosophical debate as to where in fact would be best to cut someone's head off with one's sword. We then moved onto whether or not you could decapitate somebody while wearing armour using nothing more than your hands alone - we determined no but figured there must have been occasions when people were unable to use weapons due to being heavily weighted down by equipment etc? Secondly...yesterday was the last day for Avatar opening weekend box office takings after becoming the highest grossing 3D movie ever made and has now topped Titanic's record taking 2.7 billion worldwide as well as beating James Cameron himself who directed both films. It will also become the first film since Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith to take above number 1 spot domestically AND internationally; George Lucas' final instalment managed only half way before being dethroned in 200405. Now all James Cameron needs is "the cure" from his ex wife in order to win back his full rights....it'll happen....right?! Right??
