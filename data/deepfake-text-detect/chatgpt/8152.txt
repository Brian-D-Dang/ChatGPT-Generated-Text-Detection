Please understand that I have no hatred for transgender people, and I will not force this view upon them or anyone. I have rather liberal views, really; I'm ready to accept anything as long it's done in a civilised manner (which is why the churches can still exist). However... I think there are some simple things we should all agree on: our gender identity does NOT depend at ALL what sex organs one has between their legs! It doesn't even make sense biologically speaking - how come my dog cannot change its "gender"? How about cats? They're mammals too:) You might say they may be different species of course but humans and dogs do share more genes than you'd imagine so biology says nothing here either.. In fact if someone self-identifies themselves with 'Cocker Spaniel' then isn't person doing exactly same thing when identifying himselfherself by feminine pronouns like she her? Why would anybody care which 'species' he identifies himelf into?! There was also an article recently posted online where scientists found out mice who were born female could switch genders thanks mainly because females being able switching hormones without any medical help whatsoever: Therefore ladies relax please!!! If somebody feels his true nature inside means something else other compared just body parts - well let me tell ya right now folks your mind IS BULLSHIT!!! That said much love manosphere brothers:) So basically every time i see "transgend" promoted via mainstream media whenever GIRL WANTS TO BE A BOY...it goes straight over head since genetics dictates 100 human beings regardless bodies shape size CANNOT CHANGE ITS GENETIC CODE AND SO IT DOESN"T MATTER WHAT SEX ORGANS ONE HAS ON THE INSIDE OF THEMSELVEs!!!! So saying girl wants boyish look makes absolutely NO difference ethically towards everything including humanity itself lolz
