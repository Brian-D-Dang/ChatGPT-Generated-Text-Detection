So, it's obvious to anyone who took a math class that the average number of sex partners between straight men and straight women must be the same. However, the median is not equal to the average because people who have many sexual partners are outliers; meaning they're likely to skew your data away from the true average count (the mean). This happens if you take an extreme outlier as the source for your analysis. The reason why this matters in general statistics: The more information we can get about something, whether its personal or scientific, the better off society will come through understanding it.
