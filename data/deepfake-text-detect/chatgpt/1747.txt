Hi CMV! A recent post on AskReddit about homosexuality and pedophilia being a choice or not led me to this thought that BOTH homosexuality and heterosexuality are choice made by the brains of human beings. For example, people who have been exposed to same sex sexual stimulation in early childhood would exhibit different brain activity patterns than those who werent so they'd be identified as gay instead of straight just like how some children who grow up with single parents may end up having daughters more often then sons. All you're saying is someone could choose to shoot themselves? Or that plants can decide what species they will become from seeds?
