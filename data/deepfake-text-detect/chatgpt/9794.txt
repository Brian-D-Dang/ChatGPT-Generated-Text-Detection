I'm not a cop hater. I like to think I'm a relatively reasonable person but I'm honestly not even 100 sure how I really feel with the constant barrage of media coverage of cop shootings, the lack of transparency in many cases, and the seemingly disproportionate use of force in some situations. It's tough to make a judgement call when so much of the information is incomplete or biased.
