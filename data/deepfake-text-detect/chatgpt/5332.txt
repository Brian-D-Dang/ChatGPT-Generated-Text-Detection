I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are very strict," he says. "We don't believe this will be tolerated by the population because it's embarrassing." "There was no mention once we started travelling abroad more than once a year ago so I think there may have been some misunderstanding about Islam here which makes us uncomfortable," says Mohammed Ali. "Most people say they speak Turkish but most Turkish people aren't actually any better. We'll try to visit each other as soon as possible even if they're foreigners who know nothing else besides Arabic language." He adds: "Some think that Turkmenistan doesn't teach Islamic principles or anything like that." Mohammed Ali wonders what Muslims would do when they see foreigners coming from abroad seeking asylum saying: "They wouldn't accept them unless they were Muslim. However, those people could come with the intention of doing something bad for religion such as stealing their land or establishing Muslim caliphate that won't succeed in closing up mosques or stealing property." While Muslims in Turkmenistan enjoy protection against persecution due to Islamic law decreeing that its military rulers must respect religious beliefs, Mohammed Ali does not agree with Sharia law limiting freedoms while Muslim communities around the world suffer increasing attacks including killings by Islamists with impunity. He believes there should be stricter control over foreign visitors' travel plans too adding: "The authorities should put an end to violence whenever someone crosses into Turkmenistan instead of allowing others. Turkmenistan needs international cooperation since foreigners want freedom wherever they go except the Islamic Republic of Iran where many refugees are fleeing persecution throughout the region. We cannot allow foreign invaders anywhere near our borders until they leave. We pray Allah's blessings on anyone trying to enter our country illegally." Despite Turkmenistan having less tolerance towards foreigners than neighboring countries, Mohammed Ali hopes they can work together to enforce Islamic laws applying strong government processes keeping the country safe.
