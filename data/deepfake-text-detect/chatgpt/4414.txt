I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or coworkers. They're always telling the kids not to play with their toys because "they might break them!" Or when we go out on dates, one of the first things parents tell us is "Don't do anything you wouldn't want your momdad doing it." So why would someone need to be told what kind of sex acts they should engage in? Most people consider sexual orientation as something innate, passed down from our biological makeup; however, most of us are born into families whose attitudes contradict this belief. We aren't born gay - we learn these ideas through experience. The only difference between heterosexuality and homosexuality is whether society accepts them or changes its mind about being "wrong." So if a child grows up thinking his sexuality is wrong, he will grow up feeling like there's nothing right about him at all. He'll feel ashamed, isolated, different. And even though many LGBTQ youth have supportive parents and homes, others may find themselves ostracized by those closest to them. It isn't until these young adults are older and independent enough to form new bonds maybe after college graduationthat they gain the support they really crave: the acceptance of family members bigots never understood before. Even then, they still must carry around an undercurrent of insecurity. Many people assume that once you're married, you magically change everything about yourself...and while marriage does offer certain protections there are plenty of reasons to get divorced later after years together. For example, children don't stay little forever. Once they're teenagers, suddenly it seems every parent wants them to start dating and having sex with other humans. Of course, no matter what kind of life partner you end up with, you'll likely face discrimination outside the home as well. Luckily, despite all these obstacles, LGBTQ individuals can live happy lives without engaging in risky behavior. What matters is how open everybody is willing to listen, and how comfortable everyone feels talking openly about important issues. In school, students often talk more freely than at home; privacy is rare because students sit next to each other constantly at lunchtime, study hall, recess, etc. This makes closing doors and avoiding eye contact easier than anywhere else. If nobody talks at home but your classmates at school chat away about stuff that's making you uncomfortable, chances are good you won't have to deal with a lot of confusion and discomfort growing up. Also, keep in mind that sometimes just knowing somebody has been brave enough to come clean about their identity can make a huge impact on peoples' opinions toward queer folks. Schools are places of learning and development; hopefully one day we could focus less on creating lessons and more on teaching those lessons. But unless we take measures against prejudice today, there will likely be kids who grow up disadvantaged because teachers didn't protect their identities or their mental health things which are much harder to stop when discussing a sensitive topic instead of simply talking about math problems or basic history. One thing is clear, people tend to think they know what it means to love another person. That's why so many of us fall hard for Hollywood couples even if they clearly aren't meant to last. Obviously, lusting over Ryan Gosling's smoldering looks doesn't mean you actually care about his character. However, our feelings often extend beyond physical attraction and manifest in a variety of ways. There are times I become infatuated with female characters. When I see photos of Kristen Stewart or Christina Hendricks floating around Facebook, my heart pounds thinking about having them lay naked underneath me. Seeing celebrities naked usually triggers desires to sleep with them as too; Jennifer Lawrence was featured lying on her side during the 2013 Oscars, showing off her perfect legs and perky boobs, going viral within minutes of waking up. Sometimes I watch porn (not as frequently anymore, but I used to consume hours upon hours of X-rated DVDs), especially the videos that feature women who seem to look exactly like models, actresses, TV personalities, whatever I'm enamored with. Time and time again I fantasize about sleeping with famous women I admire and fantasizing about sleeping with them isn't weird, per se. Everyone experiences fantasies: thoughts that pop in your head unexpectedly, usually involving strangers, such as wondering if she'd let you touch her breasts and thinking about making out with him...but unlike the rest of the population, mine happen a few dozen times a week. My point here isn't masturbation; rather, looking at pictures of sexy people almost invariably leads to desire...for both men AND women. This brings us back to the subject at hand: While watching celebrity sex tapes CAN lead to healthy relationships, using them to try and determine your future partner (s) fate comes across as fairly desperate and presumptuous.
