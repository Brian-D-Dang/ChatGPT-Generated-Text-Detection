To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting there myself (I have many friends who are currently going through the process), from what they've told me about it so far seems like an excellent idea to help promote critical thinking and proper research methods in students. You might be on your way already if you think people downvote everything positive said here or by OP
