When I see debate about'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about'evidence'. If they shift on these things it is because the 'other side' has won a convincing victory in political battles. To be honest with you - and this comes from someone who's been active in politics for nearly two decades now; if there was ever a time that we've had an ocean of evidence at our fingertips but have ignored all of them due do partisan politics...it would probably look something akin to what happened over the last decade and half here on HN. People are fairly opinionated when its their own opinions being debated but quite unwillingunable to defend those opinions against others (though most often not without resorting to ad hominem attacks). So as more folks enter into discussion forums such as HN refusing to consider data points which run counter to one's existing beliefs then no matter how much evidence becomes available additional viewpoints will continue exercising influence only upon new converts rather than the larger body politic itself. This may make some feel better psychologically by allowing them to believe that they're making progress while simultaneously enabling continued inaction through intellectual laziness but barring major societal calamity it doesn't exactly set us up well going forward. And considering that the world currently teeters ever closer toward undeniable catastrophe- even minor changes could prove very consequential indeed. Of course part of what needs changing is personal behavior too: just having lots of information isn't really enough since many simply prefer ideologically driven dogmatic belief systems regardless of facts offered contrary.[0] We need to get back to viewing moral questions and social problems as ones where reasonable individuals can come together around common ground towards shared goals instead of continuing down increasingly polarized paths based largely off emotional appeals intended primarily for self-congratulation insofar as anyone believes them anyway[1]. Our current approach seems predicated almost entirely on ensuring that neither party compromises away principles so deeply held that compromise actually amounts to selling out your entire base to achieve nothing and garner blame for everything - everyone claims credit yet none take any responsibility whatsoever. In fact each distorts reality shamelessly within order to maintain their favored narrative while wrongfully accusing the opposing faction of doing precisely that same thing! It should go without saying but childish name calling and sarcastic cartoons aren't constructive arguments in general nor do they lend themselves to productive discourse between rational adults despite whatever hopes proponents might hold otherwise regarding the outcome thereof: "Well sure he called me names but that proves my point"! Likewise relentless character assassination via baseless accusations does little else aside from generating ill feelings among both parties thus hurting future prospects for mutually beneficial cooperation. The mannerisms of children playing a game perhaps? Thereby avoiding real adult discussions whereby differing views were respected until proven wrong either by consistent failure to adhere to agreed upon standards of logic reason or demonstrably beyond a doubt bearing clear signs of biases influencing the author (s), methods used along with lack of adherence to commonly accepted scientific methodologies etc. Such conclusions reached after duly weighing relevant evidence presented objectively in accordance with universally established criteria serving best interests of humanity first. When discussing politically controversial topics though certain types of reasoning become constrained due to inability to provide said objective assessments rendering debates especially prone to degenerating quickly into unproductive squabbles. As long ago as 2006 noted physicist Steven Weinberg articulated why assertions made using terms such as 'God','spiritual' or similar loaded language tend to obfuscate truth rather than illuminate it:[23] [0] Anecdotally speaking I find myself encountering fellow engineers far less frequently engaged in uncivilized mud slinging compared say business owners or politicians, scientists are usually relatively good about sticking to science too whereas other groups remain surprisingly eager jump right into the fray whenever possible and try to win ideological victories there before getting stuck trying to convert non-believers later lol. But yes generally speaking internet forum participants strike me moreso as snarky adolescents whose primary goal is posturing while condescending mockery takes priority over mutual understanding and consideration. Not wholesome stuff overall given the grave nature of existential threats we face collectively IMO.
