Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between the rich or poor. However they take hold of people by their philosophy rather than reason therefore when taken to extremes can be as destructive for society if not more so then capitalism itself due partly because it will never leave power even after all resources have been exhausted but also that these systems fail miserably at providing any true level playing field with equality which was always a problem from day one - you cannot manage without inequality whether economic, social etc. I do admire many aspects about China's economy however I must say some things very much worry me such how quickly growth has made them overly reliant on foreign investment (which could include us), secondly excessive useproliferation abuseof natural resource third recently we've seen increasing signs Beijing may become increasingly authoritarian over time instead through elections.... If this continues well my worries increase...however despite everything else most Chinese still seem overall happy enough!
