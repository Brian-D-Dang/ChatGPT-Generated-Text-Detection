Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never been much for queer or political parties, but because they're large enough in both cities that we all know each other through them, it's kind of common networking ground. Question I was talking on Facebook recently about the fact that most pride parades don't have any female representation at the parade itself; instead there are more women participating in how ever many boothsevents you can get into than men (and this is true for NY Pride as well). It got me wondering if anyone here has had similar experiences? Have any female members taken part in organizing their own event specifically targeted towards gender equality-type issues? Are there events like these that seem not so much "pride" related yet still exist solely for the purpose of bringing people together from different backgrounds under one umbrella to talk and work out problems together? Hi Mockery! Maybe you could help us out by answering your question yourself? How do you think LGBT groups should react when women say:"Hey guys, look at me... show some respect!" Or what would be the best way to deal with someone telling you she wants you to treat her differently just because she's a woman? What does an important issue such as diversity mean to you? Do you see the need for change within the community or can we expect things to stay exactly as they are for years to come? And finally why did you choose to remain anonymous and not post publicly? Shyam, thank you for sharing your thoughts on this matter!! As a nonbinary person myself, I identify mostly as agender - meaning my sense of self doesn't fall anywhere in between male and female. This means that while I am attracted to males and females equally, I absolutely cannot speak for everyone else. However, based upon personal experience, I believe people perceive nonbinary genders differently than binary ones, therefore making it difficult for nonbinary folks to seek acceptance from society without feeling like outsiders. The real problem lies deeper though. Society perceives gender as something unique and permanent individual characteristic. People also tend to view those who defy stereotypes as abnormal, even dangerous. When you start questioning societal views of gender relations and sexual orientation, you'll quickly realize that social discourse around those topics isn't nearly unified. For example, consider the relationship between gay rights movements and transgender rights movements. Gay rights organizations include trans activists among its membership, which might cause some confusion and derail conversations regarding homosexual practices, whereas transgender advocates reject association with GLBTQIA communities due to concerns over the fluid nature of sexuality (which is tied up in discussions surrounding transgender identities), homophobia, and heterosexism. This further feeds right back into our discussion, since no movement will succeed unless it includes every segment of the population. If only cisgender, heterosexual, white, wealthy, educated, able bodies participate, then none of the goals set forth will be met. In order for individuals of color, disabled, rural Americans, etc., to achieve equal standing within society and beyond, we must take steps toward breaking down barriers, educating ourselves, and working towards finding solutions where needed. A great resource for learning about intersectional feminism is . However, the point remains that queer activism requires dismantling arbitrary gendered boundaries in favor of accepting people as they actually are. While almost nothing wrong with being cisgendered or heterosexual can really compare to thinking that human beings aren't inherently divided along gender lines, questions arise concerning reproductive justice, biogenetic essentialisms, eugenics, colonial history, etc. These are significant sticking points that lead to debates that devolve into unnecessary negativity. As far as I'm aware, there are major differences going on within queer activist circles whether people appreciate what is happening or not. Some individuals feel strongly about removing certain obstacles facing marginalized populations, others wish to maintain status quo. Both sides may hold legitimate arguments, but it seems many focus too heavily on attacking perceived enemies rather than looking inwardly for ways to build bridges between communities that share similar interests. Personally, I'd love to hear some perspectives as to how various LGBTQ movements ought to handle people expressing discomfort with assimilationist tendencies. Politics aside, let's drop another level of conversation into Furry fandom now! Should furry conventions try harder to become inclusive spaces or continue catering primarily to furries already invested in the subculture? Should furry cons actively draw attention away from problematic aspects of the culture? Is it possible to be simultaneously closeted and discriminate against marginalised individuals? Can we learn anything useful from furry fans' attitudes and actions? Will insecure groups always hate on the parts they fear losing access to opportunities? In general, I find humor to be extremely helpful in diffusing tense situations. We shouldn't underestimate the power of sarcasm, either.
