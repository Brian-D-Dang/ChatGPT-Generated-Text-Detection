WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in the forum don't make a point of saying, "hey, I'm having a bad day, don't take it out on me" when they post stuff. I'm not saying that they are not feeling discouraged or overwhelmed at times, but they do not act like it. And since I want to be a better contributing member of the community, I'm going to make a point of saying when I'm not feeling my best, and I'm not necessarily sure why. I want to be better than the people that I look up to, not just in talent, but in character as well. So here goes. I'm not going to sugarcoat the truth here, I'm just going to put it out there, because you can't fix a problem if you don't know what the problem is. I've got a lot of problems, but I'm not going to focus on them here, because that would make me feel even worse. I'm going to focus on the fact that I'm depressed, and that I'm not very good at hiding it. I've got a lot of things to focus on, but for now, I want to focus on the fact that I'm depressed. I'm not going to get into the specifics of my depression, because I'm not sure how much of it is related to my ADD, and how much is related to the fact that I'm a very emotional person. I can be very happy one moment, and very depressed the next. I've got a lot of negative emotions, and I have a lot of positive emotions as well, but the negative emotions are always stronger, and they never seem to go away. I can't remember the last time I felt truly happy, and I don't really remember the last time I felt truly content. I think I've never really been content, I've just been too distracted to notice. I've always been a very emotional person. When I get upset, I just get upset, I don't necessarily have any good way to channel my emotions, so I've always just been overwhelmed with emotion, and I don't know what to do with it. I've always been a very sensitive person. I cry easily, even when I'm not really upset, I just can't help it. I have a lot of empathy for people, and I've always been very good at noticing other people's emotions, but I can't even begin to tell you how difficult it is for me to recognize my own emotions. I'm too distracted to notice when I'm sad, and I'm too distracted to notice when I'm happy. I've always had problems with my social life. As a child, I would cry myself to sleep, because I just couldn't make any friends. When I was in elementary school, I was extremely shy, and extremely withdrawn. I was painfully awkward, and I never had anything to say to anyone, and I couldn't understand why no one seemed to like me. I had no friends, I was never invited to birthday parties, and I couldn't figure out why. It wasn't until I was in middle school that things started to change, and then I started making friends, but I was never good at socializing. I was never good at small talk, and I was never good at meeting people, and that has never really changed. I'm good at meeting people, but I'm not good at socializing, and I'm not good at making friends. It's a vicious cycle. When I started playing video games, I found something that I was good at, and I was very passionate about. I loved games, and I was really good at them, and I was really passionate about them. I loved game design, and I loved learning about the process of making a game, and I loved programming, and I loved everything that went into making a game. I've always been very passionate about video games, and I've always been very passionate about programming. I'm very passionate about my hobbies, and I'm very passionate about my work, and I'm very passionate about most of the things that I do, and I'm always very passionate about everything. I am always very passionate about my interests, and I am always very passionate about everything that I do. I'
