I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is one, then how can the atheist's faith be stronger? If God exists and if he punishes non-believers for eternity in Hell...then what did that say about his love towards people who believe himher?? What kind off loving father would do such things?! Doesn't make sense! So either you don't exist at all (and only Satan created these religions) OR your existence AND infinite power are lies!! But again; why curse others with eternal suffering just because they didn"nt find "the way"? How could an omnipotent god allow so much pain on earth while being able create rainbows from thin air??? Why doesn' t He stop everything bad happening now? Stop war crimes tomorrow instead???? The list goes long...from hunger problems through earthquakes etc..God allows evil everywhere without using His enormous powers against maniacs like Hitler!!! Again: WHY THE HELL DOESN"T GOD USE HIS TREMENDOUS POWER TO STOP ALL EVIL NOW!!!! This makes absolutely NO SENSE!!!!!!!! And until we really know exactly "HOW IT WORKS," WE SHOULD BE BLESSED WITH A FEW WEEKLIES OF PEACE WITHOUT FREAKING OUT ABOUT THIS COMPLEXITY THAT EXISTS IN LIFE!
