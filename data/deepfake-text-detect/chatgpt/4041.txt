I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand that this is probably because of my age although it's still hard to accept sometimes. My GPA is very low (2.8) but I think most schools look at your high school grades more than your college ones if you're looking for scholarships or grants. What subject matters are you trying to major in?
