First I think I should make all the clarifications I can. By "true Christian," I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ. I do not mean a person who labels themselves as a Christian that does not follow Christ. I know that there are many different types of Christians. If you think you have your act together and you are "good" enough to be a Christian, you are probably wrong. The most important part about being a Christian is believing in Jesus Christ and His sacrifice for us. That is the only requirement to be a true Christian. And if you are in Christ, you are a true Christian. The only difference between you and me is that I am a sinner that God has forgiven and I am trying to live the best life I can. If you are a true Christian, God loves you. He loves you so much that He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die for you. It's amazing to me that God sent His Son to die for me. I'm no saint. I'm not a perfect person. I know that I am loved by God. I know I am loved by God. And if you are a true Christian, you are also loved by God. Do you know that you are loved by God? Do you know that God loves you? I know I do. Thank you for reminding me. I am a Christian, a wife, a mother, a daughter, a sister, an aunt and a friend. I know that I am loved by God, but today I needed to be reminded.
