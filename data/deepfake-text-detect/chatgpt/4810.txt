First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean I think it's justifiable for anyone to whip out their camera phone in front of me while my back is turned. That's really the main problem here; people walking by couldn't HANDLE what was happening after this thing went viral on 7 minutes ago? The pictures are the only reason some idiots got arrested when clearly there were plenty more photos taken before these ones. So why didn't anyone try to stop them from taking the pics? Why weren't they investigated as well? And more importantly: WHY did so many people have cameras ready at breakfastlunchtime or wherever it happened? There should be serious consequences! I watched an episode where one guy took 10 nude photo shots (and then bragged about it): The cops showed up right away (after he posted his blog post?) but never followed through to charge him with anything along those lines because hey... "he's already done enough damage." This wasn't even a sex crime or something like that. It was simply taking numerous photos without getting permission of someone who had no idea you're doing it which is NOT illegal in most places outside Israel. But maybe I'm wrong? What do experts say? Anyway, I hear it could get DEEPER than like porn charges. If it does, I hope it gets thrown down the memory hole ASAP. In two weeks time I will be working abroad, except for emergency calls home - which may come every day early morning or late evening depending on how busy we are and also due to other commitments. Now I don't want any of our family members or close friends to compromise my privacy. They shouldn't know where I am during work hours unless they're called by bosses to ask questions etc. Is there anyway to make sure they don't see the last number of call logs on specific numbers? Or better yet, wipe off the screen immediately afterwards? I looked online but mostly found instructions on wiping data remotely via USB and such. Thanks guys. A few years ago we caught eachother having oral sex in the bathroom while we thought nobody else was home. We knew that we would get in trouble later but we both wanted too. After 3 months of lying to parents, spouses, kids and co workers we finally decided to tell everything. Luckily none of them cared especially since it happened 2 times. We started cheating earlier this year and though our relationship isn't perfect we moved forward with it. Since we haven't seen eachother often lately i can now confirm that she sucks dicks harder than her husband ever has. She fucks him while feeling ashamed since her vagina still remembers its first release. He's always happy knowing that he puts his dick into someone that makes him feel good emotionally (since she gives him another chance). If you happen to find yourself trapped inside a parking garage overnight, surrounded by several layers of concrete walls and glass windows, you might be tempted to sneak a peek at your lover's snatch. Of course, once you catch sight of a woman peeing in public, it'll be difficult to resist latching onto your hard cock and jerking your own load straight between her legs. You've probably heard of men who steal images of women urinating in order to share them in private forums, like manhunt.org or cuckoldress.co... Have you made a habit of watching girls pissing in bathrooms? Not anymore! After catching four young ladies using restrooms restroom stalls at different hotels around town, we compiled a list of 12 public toilets where you can enjoy seeing real female piss pouring out on unsuspecting johns. 1) Elevator hallways - Turnstile Service Center at 45 Post Street New York NY 10003 This service center features three floors, including a full service car wash facility. If you take the elevator upstairs to access the fourth floor, you'll notice that the door leading to customer waiting area opens directly into the hotel hallway! Perfect for peeping perverts like us. A couple weeks prior to going to New Orleans, we hopped in the elevator and saw a beautiful girl peeing standing next to the wall of mirrors lining the corridor. Her slender figure stood perfectly centered behind the mirror pane - perfect for loving glances, unintentional photography, and jerkoffs galore. On the night in question, we spotted the same lovely lady again. As soon as she entered the elevator lobby, she stopped short in shock upon noticing us staring back at her reflection. It must've been very embarrassing to realize she'd just shown herself to complete strangers. Needless to say, the whole experience gave us major boner! 2) 5th generation service center 4th floor entrance does not function until final test case file goes to test room 1.
