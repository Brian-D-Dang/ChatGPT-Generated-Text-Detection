As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is irresponsible and reckless, but the government doesn't need such maneuvers for our children's safety." To be honest, some of those funds are going toward educational programs in other countries aimed at improving families' lives; another of those countries is Norway. Peter Pomerantz, CEO of the Norwegian Council for Child Care Funding said, "Parents often talk about how fortunate they feel when children learn new things after spending days practicing virtual learning from home perhaps because virtual lessons make their parents happy instead of teach them something else (which might deter others). But it isn't just the students who benefit: The lesson learned helps avoid making mistakes while developing skills critical for raising healthy kids with disabilities or preventing harm caused by emotional health challenges. Parents can improve the quality of life for themselves rather than pouring money into expensive training packages designed only for adults without access to social interaction opportunities."
