The implementation of Judicial Review from the Marbury v. Madison case from the precedent of the Judiciary Act of 1789 allows for the Supreme court to be to judge over a Supreme Court ruling. It was in 1791 that the Supreme Court made the decision to declare the Federal District Court in a case involving the trial of a judge of a court in the United States, the Marbury v. Madison case. It is not unusual to hold that a court is a court in the United States. The majority opinion of the case is that the defendant had not a valid reason to be convicted of an offence, and he was in fact guilty. The Supreme Court did not make any restrictions on the jury in the Marbury v. Madison case, and the case was not settled. This is one case that could have been argued in the U.S. Supreme Court.
