I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to make an element without writing code for someone else (why not just turn off an ion generator?). So is there any data about how rare these elements are? Elements created by humans aren't always made using codes. There might be ways of making most kinds of atoms with simple programming steps though.
