The Golden Rule: Treat others the way you would like to be treated. The Silver Rule: One should not treat others in ways that one would not like to be treated oneself, or else it is a double standard. 12282016 Search For Meaning During an Advent Season of Uncertainty and Disillusionment? Then Read on... By Rick Warren (Author) I'm currently reading "Becoming Minimalist - A Practical Guide Through the Paradoxes of Materialism" by Leo Babauta and there are many gems found within its pages. In fact, I am amazed at how much practical wisdom can be gained from even this tiny book, considering some people waste hundreds of hardback books on self-help alone. It was with these thoughts in mind that I had planned to write about minimalism as part of my usual Christmas posts. However, given recent events around me, particularly here in America, I have decided instead to share what has been going through my head during the past week. You see, while we wait for next month's G20 Summit meeting between President Obama and Russian president Putin to begin, we also find ourselves waiting anxiously for news regarding Hillary Clinton's health status. We know her hospitalization last Friday came out of nowhere, but when she suddenly won't leave her bed after having fainted twice since then - leaving us wondering if she may need emergency surgery. And while we await further updates, our minds race imagining all manner of scenarios in which Donald Trump could assume office immediately upon his inauguration on January 20th. While it seems almost impossible to come up with any scenario where he wins under present circumstances, let alone what might happen so close to Inauguration Day, we must never forget history teaches us every election day counts! So rather than dwell too deeply on such things at this time, I think it will serve everyone better to focus more intently on the real purpose of life itself while keeping our eyes firmly fixed ahead toward our Heavenly Father...to whom belong ALL glory both now and forevermore!!! Amen! And yet, amid the uncertainty and disillusionment often felt in times of change and shifting winds surrounding us, I believe Christ IS still calling His Church forward into new eras of progress...yesterday-today-and tomorrow! Yes, He did die and rise again to give us eternal hope; however, based on everything I read so far, the Holy Spirit is guiding my thinking in terms of what we as Christians are called to do right now in 2016. To tell you the truth, when I first began writing this post, this idea didn't occur to me either until I thought it over longer. But as I completed each paragraph, another chapter unfolded before my inner eye, eventually leading me down a very different path from the one I initially intended to follow. If I wasn't careful, I might wind up just muddling along without doing anything worthwhile. So hopefully you'll bear with me as I try to make sense of "Things That Matter," hoping I don't get too lost along the way...forgetting who God really AMONG US is!!?!? LOL I'm sorry, I couldn't resist saying something funny knowing most folks were only tuning in trying to sort out their own feelings in light of November 8th results...what with the national media celebrating their victory against those pesky Patriots for quite awhile back! (LOL!) So anyway, who knows whether this message makes any sense at all?!??? Well honestly speaking, none of us ever does in life! At least I certainly haven't found a single situation where Jesus or anyone else explained exactly HOW things work. What matters IS WHAT WE DO WITH THE KNOWLEDGE ANYWAY, assuming we're honest enough to admit that we CANNOT fully understand EVERYTHING we encounter in life! Ah yes, we have always known this, but somehow we've forgotten...dare I say it??!? Who needs more proof really...haven't we already experienced far worse than this to show us Jesus' true heart towards mankind throughout all ages?!? As a matter of fact, we rarely take one moment of our lives for granted because we realize no problem will EVER go away unless we create space for Him to handle it Himself. From John 10:10 we learn very clearly that whatever happens "on earth" ultimately belongs entirely to HIMSELF! Therefore whenever we feel uncertainly about a thing, especially in these turbulent times of transition and upheaval, let's ask ourselves two simple questions: 1) Is it worth spending precious moments fretting over? 2) Do we possess enough faith to trust that God WILL ALWAYS provide a solution? If we answer NO to any question above, why bother wasting valuable brain cells agonizing over things that simply cannot help us! Now we JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHETHER HE DOES IN FACT PROVIDE ANSWERS FOR OUR QUESTIONS OR NOT. Praying for guidance here....throughout all eternity!!:) PS These suggestions apply equally well to daily use a block vs. taill off a tracking the apparent value of it business, once they occasionaly set portering setting alterect porter
