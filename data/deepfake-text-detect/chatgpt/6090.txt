I have played Hearthstone since its beta and have had great times with it (I still do). My massive issue with the game is that the current meta relies too much on one deck archetype. It's the aggro Aggro Druid deck. The same deck has won multiple times in the most recent Grandmasters. I believe this meta is causing the player base to dwindle. I'd like to see Blizzard put in some rewards for people who play other decks. I'm not saying make nerf this deck. I'm saying make a deck that is rewarded for playing this deck. For example, you could get Legend rank rewards for playing a Zoo deck. Zoo is a deck that is viable and plays well in the current meta. I believe that a Zoo deck would be great for people who like to play aggro decks. Also, Blizzard has a big tournament coming up called The Hearthstone Global Games. I'd like to see Blizzard put in a reward for playing different decks. I would like to see Blizzard showcase all the different deck archetypes and how to play them. That would be a great thing to do. If Blizzard did that, I believe that the game would gain more traction. I would like to see a 1 week free trial. I'd like to see a Hearthstone F2P model. I'd like to see a card system where players get a certain amount of cards when they purchase the game. I'd like to see Blizzard advertise this a lot and also have a lot of free promotional cards. I would like to see this be free to play but still have some microtransactions. I would like to see Blizzard put in a ton of F2P promotions. This would be great for getting new players into the game. I would like to see an expansion where the game goes to a different area of Azeroth. I'd like to see players play as the Horde and fight for the Iron Horde. I'd like to see players play as the Alliance and fight the Legion. I'd like to see players have the choice of playing as either the Horde or the Alliance. I'd like to see a new expansion called Legion. I'd like to see the Alliance fight the Legion while the Horde fight the Iron Horde. This would be great for gaining new players. I would like to see the playerbase grow. I'd like to see Blizzard do something to get more players into the game. I think that the current meta is toxic and Blizzard should do something to fix it. I believe that this game has a ton of potential. I would like to see the playerbase grow. I would like to see Blizzard do something to make the game more fun. I would like to see Blizzard make the game more accessible. I would like to see Blizzard make the game more fun for new players.
