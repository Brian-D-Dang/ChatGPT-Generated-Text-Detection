I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand that these are excuses, but what can I say? The main reason for my laziness is probably because of procrastination which has been happening since high school. So here's how it usually goes: I'll be sitting down to study or doing some other work when I realize how much time I have left on whatever assignment there was. So then I get online (or call up someone) and start socializing with people instead of getting off my butt and starting studyingworking. This isn't always true though, my grades aren't terrible so far either way. 3 A's this semester even if I only turned them in yesterday. Anyway, however you want to look at it; I am lazy as hell sometimes. What should I try to change about myself to make me more motivated again? It sounds like your problem is finding something to motivate yourself... Is it just being able to find an activity that will fill out free-time until you feel actual motivation kicking back in? Or does working too hard end up making you less inclined toward things, while also leading from one thing into another - almost like rebound effect where you get burned out quickly by overwork with no balance between relaxing activities and stressing things? If it were up to me, I'd recommend trying different types of relaxation methods before diving headfirst into work stuff. For example, if video games didn't seem to help (which they don't sound like), maybe taking a break would show better results. And some stress relief may be needed after long periods spent under pressure. Don't forget to give yourself breaks! Try meditation.
