The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, which is not true. It's a bit of an outlier from my observations. But I think we've got some ideas here about why this happened. I'm sure there are more than enough people who believe in something there to reason with themselves especially men. They may answer questions like "Oh, maybe a galaxy was created. That would be interesting." Or they may say, "Well, we're only human, so pretty much everything else should just be science fiction," or "As far as space goes, what about Earth?" Who knows? Maybe we have better things to watch (and our kids are going to love Star Trek, and even more films!) And nobody gives a crap if we make a movie world where all the galaxies in the Universe look for each other and ultimately figure out why all those planets were formed o... well.... in different ways. What is true for us, how does it work? Why do we exist at all? How does the Universe make sense? One can ask "What is the universe like right now?" If you're younger, young, andor college-age yes, you might get a better idea what you're talking about. You'll need a lot of validation around your head. If nothing else, the universe has changed since its inception. We have had two threads on our consciousness: one every six months; and another every four years. The first thread began with a conversation with Dr. Budd, the physicist at Harvard Divinity School, and ended with him speaking about the number of galaxies, the nature of objects that matter (vastly), and the nature of gravity (which he calls "two" with his own terms). Chris has talked about the nature of gravity by allowing everyone to talk about how galaxies are made. He told me that it doesn't matter whether we're young or old, but that if we were young, we'd still be discussing how galaxies become matter, because we could just as easily argue that galaxies are two, and then explain why gravity isn't a thing! Dr. Budd said that it wasn't really easy to come up with general theories about the direction of stellar travel. But he can't deny that it was possible for astronomers to find stars in the galaxy through telescopes. Another challenge to his theory is that as he explained to me last week, "Most stars must come into existence somewhere.We cannot tell them apart at any speed. If we knew anything about the speed of light, we wouldn't mind seeing stars in our galaxy," said Dr. Budd. "It would probably come naturally." So we can never truly know if anything ever came together, much less what it means to be alive today. Even though it seems to take billions of years, it may seem impossible for a galaxy to be made of any single material even safe for the simple act of looking at the sun. This is largely due to the fact that most scientists believe that around 65 of galaxies already exist, and that the vast majority of them are very small ones. But, with enough observational data, it could be argued that it took thousands of years for all of their clusters to form, and the whole process caused a big problem in astronomy, making it harder for anyone to pinpoint causality. From a distance, galaxies show no signs of life. As such, it's been difficult to start understanding the nature of star formation. Many planets actually rarely emerge after they have undergone many events over the past three thousand years. This explains why stars appear exclusively in bright skybands which sometimes appear brighter than dark skies. There are several theories to explain this phenomenon and the director of a new group of astrophysics lab at Blackrock University believes that they may have suddenly developed, forming fast galaxies, albeit with minimal disturbance - "but we didn't expect stars to coalesce within the same system," explained Dr. Budd. So the theories of this new group include that they must have been created in the future and therefore should have waited until these galactic matrices existed before producing them, since that is possible. This new assumption is wrong, however. An entire generation of massive galaxies was found a few hundred years ago. Yet they turned out to be "very small, very thin, very dense" structures, and they represent the first visible evidence of mass-mass collisions between stars. Looking back, it makes clear to me that the study of galaxies is limited by one fundamental rule: the observable universe doesn't exist. The Big Bang, the first known event that occurred in any given universe, ends with an explosion of energy. A large fraction of our universe only began life as a result of gas bubbles coming forth from the surface of the sun. By the time the dust, particles, and protons of the sun started to fall, gas clouds collapsed under the weight of the effects of the current gravitational field.
