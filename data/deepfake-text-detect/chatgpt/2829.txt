Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from an early age). Then went on to play college and even semi-professional soccer in the US for about 6 years. I had some injuries at one point that caused me to stop going to practice after a couple of months with too many pain meds so eventually gave it up because there were no more opportunities for me. But while doing this, I did quite well academically and just got accepted into medical school here in Thailand. Now back home visiting family so took time out to watch all 7 games during world cup 2010 and also watched pretty much every game in Brazil last year when Soccer was really hot. Just loved watching these guys trying their best to win. Some plays are amazing and others disappointing depending how you look at them. For example losing a penalty shot is painful especially if they miss. Watching someone score a goal or making a save feels like scoring myself. So why do people support their country instead? They don't necessarily have parents who played. Why do most Americans root for USA team despite our lack of players in top leagues like EPL where these team actually train together everyday and compete against each other weekly? Because we see ourselves in those athletes regardless of whether they take part in any official training camp or not. We can relate to being from different countriescultures yet still find common ground through sports. This might be something unique only to football let's say or maybe it could apply across various sports. What are your thoughts?
