Hello CMV, As I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in America's rankings. This is a very significant portion of the misinformation that has been spread throughout the media about the United States, and, as you know, it is interesting to see what people think. In this case, I don't think the US is the worst ranking.
