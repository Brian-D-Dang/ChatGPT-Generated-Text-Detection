First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways aren't always human-like or even easy to understand at times - not like we humans expect them too be (euphemism). I'm more than certain that the "no" was for effect and wasn't actually intended as anything else other then an expression from my dog who is just in his own mind...but what if he really meant no? What do you think would happen with me knowing better about dogs' minds yet pushing him into doing something anyway because it's ingrained behavior specifically enforced by us being so obedient ourselves when there isn " any reason whatsoever why our "dogs" should obey all these rules without question where most definitely some room can exist between obedience expectationthe law vs anarchic self actualization within life itself! Not only could such disregard potentially lead your pet down dangerous paths which may result mightily bad consequences one day...it also means handing over trust issues due lackluster reliability on part ours along side losing beloved family members forever through accidents caused via desperate attempts taking advantage restrictions put upon pets instead living free outwith pressure expectations imposed onto animals simply based off laws set up solely around profit seeking rather humane consideration towards animal wellbeing rights." This alone suggests action taken against those responsible needs putting much higher priority regarding enforcement before allowing further damage occur again rendering personal safety impossible..and yes injuries prior already occurred since last season has endednow while working hard trying figure how best educate others properly- lock eyes directly back together focusing exclusively seeing eventually after untold time healing process will begin turning thoughts positive once everything settles....My Godwhat have i given away?! Frankly speaking though many questions remain unanswered however answers seem simple enough provided ones willing seek truth inside themselves regardless strife....This needless war must end immediately!!! No matter whether people realize reality now sooner later still millions injured including thousands killed cannot continue occurring each year until everyone begins asking important challenging essential inquiries pertaining great injustice existing today equal bigotry per se disguised under false pretense protecting profits way above concern considerations extended toward lives devastated sometimes irreversibly thwarting humanity community prosperity matters quite frequently precluding peace everywhere.....Until next chapter please stay tuned!!
