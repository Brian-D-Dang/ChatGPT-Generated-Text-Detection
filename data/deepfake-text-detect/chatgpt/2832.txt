I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a used sports car for a new driver is just asking for trouble. The problem with putting someone who has never driven before into an expensive supercar isn't the cost of the car, its that they're probably going to do stupid shit and wreck your 200k vehicle while learning. It might be cheaper than buying two new cars if you don't want them driving on public roads anyway
