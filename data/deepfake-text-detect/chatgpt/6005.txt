This stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the Greek economic crisis, and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the Greek government. I'll copy the first few lines of the post below, and then continue on with my own thoughts on the matter. A quick summary: I am a fan of the Greek government, but have criticisms about how they have handled the crisis. The Economist, one of the most esteemed economics magazines in the world, has a nice little video on the Greek crisis. The commentary at the end is a bit funny, as they claim that the Greeks are just big profligates who need to learn to budget. This is probably not the case. The problem with Greece is that the government's finances were grossly mismanaged for decades, and only now are we starting to see the result. In my view, the problem was that Greece was in a currency union with a number of countries that had vastly different levels of economic development. While most of the EU was converging to levels of economic development similar to Greece, Germany and France were much higher. Greece has a comparatively low standard of living, and a very low level of education. Economic development is very slow and highly lumpy. The global economy has been growing at a very rapid rate since the 19th century, but this is a very recent phenomenon. For thousands of years, the global economy was very small, and there was little economic growth. That is, while the global economy has grown by a factor of 40 in the last 200 years, over the previous 1000 years, it grew by a factor of 1.5. In order to achieve such a growth rate, you need a lot of economic development. You need to bring people out of poverty, and provide people with the means to get educated. You need to create infrastructure, and to make capital more mobile. You need to create institutions that will protect people's property rights, and will make it easy for people to enter into contracts. And you need to create an environment where people will feel safe to invest and take risks. Greece did not have this, and was not able to do this on its own. When you're in a currency union with countries that have much more economic development, you become a net consumer for them, rather than a net producer. The Greeks were sucking wealth out of Germany and France, which meant that the Greek economy had to grow much faster than the EU average in order to keep up. This just wasn't going to happen. The Greeks had to borrow in order to achieve the level of economic development they needed to be able to compete with the Germans and French. And, of course, the problem here is that the Greeks were not able to save money and become competitive. The Greek government spent money like crazy, and built a whole lot of infrastructure. And when the Greek government got into trouble, they bailed out their banks. The Greek government was able to borrow money, because Greece was an extremely safe bet in terms of credit risk. Greece has never had a default on its sovereign debt. A default would mean that the government would no longer be able to borrow money. The government had to borrow money to pay its civil servants, and to pay for infrastructure. They couldn't do this if they defaulted on their debt. For the last 20 years, the Greek government has been borrowing money in order to pay its civil servants, and to build infrastructure. Greece has been overly reliant on foreign capital, and has built up a huge level of debt, not just in the public sector, but also in the private sector. I have no problem with a country borrowing money in order to build infrastructure. But you have to make sure that you are able to pay it back. If you can't, you'll just end up in a debt spiral. In the absence of any real economic development, all the Greeks have to offer to foreign investors is the expectation that they will be able to repay their debts. The problem was that Greece did not have the institutions needed to allow it to pay back its debt. The government had a huge spending problem, and the private sector was overly indebted. There was no economic development. The EU's main problem is that it has no ability to regulate the national economies of its member states. The EU doesn't have the ability to fine Greece for its excessive spending, or to force the Greek government to pay its civil servants less, or to force the Greek private sector to take responsibility for its debts. There's no mechanism for this. This
