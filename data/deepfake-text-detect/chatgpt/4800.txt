There must have been thousands of times when I was talking about a hypothetical person when it came to picking pronouns and I chose the pronoun she or he, maybe even something that wasn't in any way gender specific. Nowadays this turns out to be an incredibly tangled psychological obstacle as well as my personal trigger for microaggression since now people read me more like "the woman who gets angry because you used 'they' instead of'sheher'." I know there are some studies on how much empathy someone has if they become aware their body language is making them seem too male or female (not sure where I got this from). But do these experiments take into account those that simply don't care what others think? How can one tell whether a certain behavior stems from ignorance (which would mean they didn't realize) or misogyny (meaning deliberate)? This question isn't about stopping myself from correcting strangers though - I do that anyway but not nearly enough. How does one cope with having inadvertently triggered an off-putting situation while trying to correct another stranger's misgendering without offending said individual? Once again: I'm not asking about avoiding all such situations altogether, just how one deals with knowing full well why somebody might react negatively towards this sort of thing. To give an example of possible scenarios: What happens if two men get into a discussion at work about which football team to support in 2019 and one insists on referring to Liverpool as manly whereas his friend points out that "we're supporting women" and ends up feeling slighted by the other guy? The same goes for saying yes makes a girl anxious; or the fact that catcalling usually comes from guys who want sex and aren't interested in calling every woman beautiful. What am I supposed to say here? Is there anything else than apologising after the event and telling the story leads to massive hurt feelings? What can I actually expect anybody to do besides try their best... (PS: The kind of answer I'd really appreciate is an excerpt from an academic book which explains the scientific basis behind each response.) EDIT 1: In case anyone asks where I'm coming from - although I consider everyone human first and foremost being part of the species Homo sapiens unfortunately means little nowadays given that we're dealing with cognitive biases. This post is meant to guide those reading this explanation to an understanding of racism, sexism, classism etc. It doesn't claim to solve everything concerning these issues but will hopefully make things clearer. Edit 2: As requested below: A: It depends on your goal. If you're looking to change societal norms, then no matter what you say, you'll probably fail. A lot of problems arise due to the preordained belief system regarding gender roles and expectation of behaviour. You won't affect these unless you educate people in society. If your objective is to end prejudice, you need to find ways to communicate effectively with others using nonverbal cues to avoid triggers and offence. When interacting socially, you should always use prescribed social conventions (courtesy shown in various forms), especially when speaking, so you may unintentionally offend someone. From my experience, ignorant comments from likeminded males tend to be less offensive compared to sexist remarks made by females. Males also generally have stronger facial expressions indicating emotion, i.e., their lips curl upward and eyes narrow during arguments. Females tend to frown more often when stressed or frustrated. However, both genders engage in body language signalling emotional states inappropriately which contributes to negative interchanges. Regardless of your intent, you should never directly accuse anyone of discrimination based on internal mental attributes such as gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, disability status, handicap, height (if applicable), weight, age, appearance, marital status, career success, education level, intelligence, physical fitness, health condition or any aspect based solely upon opinion. For most people, those characteristics remain hidden within their subconscious minds despite outward display. So as long as people perceive you accurately, resenting you for nothing more than what appears to be superficial reasons is unfair judgement. Your personality traits cannot help you until you discover them through observation. Instead, focus on improving yourself so you can become better known and respected. Choose words carefully before uttering sentences intended to convince others otherwise. Control your tone of voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Avoid ever sounding pompous, arrogant or condescending. Believe that your skills, knowledge and accomplishments deserve recognition. Work hard to earn respect and attention. Show appreciation for effort rather than payback. Most importantly, stand firm against insults directed toward you. Ignoring rude comments only encourages bullies to continue insulting you and others who feel similarly invisible. Never apologize for stating facts nor defend your position. Remain calm under fire. Stick to the point. Don't let irrelevant questions distract you. Have courage. Stay professional. Focus on solutions instead of blame. Develop good relationships with colleagues and superiors by showing polite interest in theirs lives outside work. Get along with others by acting friendly.
