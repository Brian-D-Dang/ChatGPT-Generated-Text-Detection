This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in Marvel Comics] and [Black Widow], but even though there's nothing particularly surprising about it. The character isn't bad enough to warrant a story arc like this one, although some folks are arguing that he should be ignored because he was teased as being an innocent bystander during the movies rather than an antagonist. There can only be so much stuff you could write about in comics before you get bored of it... especially if you're writing about a superhero who doesn't make it past the first page by the end (like Black Widow). However, there were plenty of hints earlier on that Black Widow wasn't the hero we thought she would become literally and figuratively after all! But if Black Widow didn't just mean we weren't getting Black Widow at the end of the movie, then the jokes surrounding her storyline definitely weren't entertaining enough too.... After all, she very nearly blew up the Avengers when she broke into the Avengers HQ and bit Captain America off. If Black Widow had been a villainous vigilante who killed Daredevil in Avengers 2 instead of simply defending her friends from Loki, then maybe Black Widow wouldn't have ended up as an aggressive villain that killed Captain America. Instead, it might have led to a more interesting discussion about how the Avengers worked together between Avengers: Endgame and Endgame. (Although some people claim that Black Widow was a more compelling villain than Loki.) And when Black Widow finally confronted Loki while he was putting together the Avengers armor, it gave Starlord another reason to hate Loki despite him being responsible for his death. The script itself keeps mentioning Black Widow's "political goals" throughout the film; there aren't many examples of it anywhere else except her motivations behind preventing the Avengers from taking down Ultron. What makes Black Widow great here? Well, there are a lot of possibilitiesshe wants to save everyone from Ultron's attack, just like Thor did back in Avengers 2 (and again in Avengers 3) - she may not want Thanos' wrath, but she also believes in treating Thanos properly. She wields the Avenger's hammer like Thor does - she fights Ultron, Loki, and others like Ultron and Loki (who has done her best to destroy Asgard), yet she feels that she needs to help Ultron fight Ultron now that Ultron is dead, rather than later when she joins them. Cheers! As the title suggests, Black Widow sees Missiles blowing up Ultron after Ultron is captured. She depicts Loki as someone who has given up fighting Ultron even though he's the villain that killed Ultron himself previously, and the Avenger can do basically anything Loki wanted without being able to strike back against Ultron once in awhile (though he tries his hardest to kill her once Scarlet Witch dies) but the movie shows how she realizes Ultron will never stop trying to defeat her entirely or that Ultron already knows what he'll try next timeMarvel Cinematic Universe Cinematic Universe Movie Prequel Series continues to surprise us each week.
