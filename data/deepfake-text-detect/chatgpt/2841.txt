There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: he did stop when his mom came to pick him up I see what you mean but I feel like this is something that would amuse me greatly as an adult
