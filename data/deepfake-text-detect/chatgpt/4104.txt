There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: Both parents have been very supportive and understanding of this young man's condition but he still seems to think that it is his own fault. My girlfriend is deaf in one ear. Like, literally deaf in both ears. She doesn't understand why people say she needs headphones or go somewhere where there isn't wind noise to hear things. I'm not trying to be mean about anything but honestly, if someone is so socially awkward they can barely communicate with their friends over the phone then you wouldn't take them on a date even if they were willing.
