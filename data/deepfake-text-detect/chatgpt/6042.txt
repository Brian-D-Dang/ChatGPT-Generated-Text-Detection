How can you convince me that all the nations that I'm allowed to visit aren't all working together to hide a bigger and better and more free world. Maybe the skyscrapers are just really long bridges and the helicopters are the same thing as the planes. But what about the people? How can you convince me that the people all over the world, in every country, even the ones with the war and poverty are not actually the best people on the planet? How can you convince me that everyone that I meet isn't the best version of themselves? I can't do it. I don't know how to explain why I don't believe that. I don't know how to explain why I can't see it. I love how much you put your heart into your blog. I would be too scared to put the thoughts of my mind on the internet for people to see, but I'm glad you do! Your blog makes me smile. I'm so glad you're my friend. Natalie, thank you so much! I love you so much too!
