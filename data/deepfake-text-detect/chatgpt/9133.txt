There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is to not allow people to hide votes and give them away. "Who knows if they will be allowed to do that again? Who will have the time, money, energy, motivation, or willpower to do it." It also means the law must pass through each state legislature before it can become law. Local leaders say that in order for the bill to pass, efforts need to be done to create laws that would allow voters to ignore voting rules in cases where ballots are cast by mail. Starting Sept 1, the U.S. Postal Service will hold public hearings at 3 p.m. Aug. 16 on whether to require all postal ballots be counted later during the government shutdown.
