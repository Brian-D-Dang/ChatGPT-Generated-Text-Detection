Edit: I've been fairly convinced it's not sexist. Still maintain invasive as all heck. Carry on, thanks for getting passionate about it! Edit 2: 7 hours and only a few dozen comments? I really wish there was more interest in the issue here so this thread could have actual discussions instead of just downvotes and upvotes. I'm wondering how much of that is actually interested in your point of view vs just being booed at people who disagree with you.
