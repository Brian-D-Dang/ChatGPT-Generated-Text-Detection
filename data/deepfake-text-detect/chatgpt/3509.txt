I don't even know where to start. I am generally a happy and healthy person. I was raised Catholic. I am not a strict Catholic. I enjoy the community of the church and the teachings of Jesus. However, recently I have been feeling a bit lost and disconnected from my faith. I have been questioning some of the teachings and traditions of the church, and I am not sure if I believe in them anymore. Can you offer any guidance on how to navigate this uncertainty and find my way back to my faith?
