While it may be true that some individuals may use the label of "free speech" to defend discriminatory or hateful speech, it does not mean that any speech being defended as free speech is inherently wrong. The ability to express unpopular or controversial ideas is a crucial aspect of a functioning democracy and can lead to progress and social change. Furthermore, the definition of "wrong" or "right" speech is often subjective and can vary between individuals and communities. Therefore, the mere act of defending speech as free speech does not automatically make it wrong, but rather it is important to carefully evaluate the content and intent of the speech in question.
