It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing I would like to emphasize here is this: It is not just enough for China's economy to grow in Asia (primarily in ASEAN) but it must also grow globally - especially if we want to achieve positive development internationally over time. China has become an important player on regional issues such as energy security, terrorism prevention or maritime safety because its Belt and Road Initiative involves some 200 countries which cover more than 76 percent of world population. This will help establish connectivity through infrastructure links between these regions that have already been established by China while being able to bypass those still underdeveloped. For instance, Pakistan-China Economic Corridor passes through Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asian Republics; Bangladesh-China-India Pipeline goes across Myanmar; the Trans-Africa Highway connects almost every African country with South Africa through Tanzania. The One Belt One Road initiative aims at connecting most significant land routes to the sea through a complex network of highways, railways and ports. These projects are expected to cost 40 trillion, using mostly Chinese funds. There is no doubt that there remains much work ahead before achieving this goal so far. But the good news is that now many large companies from around the globe - including British companies - are stepping up their activities in China. More trade means increased interaction among different cultures. That should be one focus area for the UK government to stimulate further economic growth both within Europe and beyond. So my suggestion is that Britain could play a greater role in promoting cultural diversity throughout the developing world. Prime Minister Theresa May recently announced plans to invest 2 billion pounds into cultural exports by 2022, and the Department for International Trade is considering how best to expand our export market reach. We can learn lessons from other developed economies such as Japan who promote international culture by inviting visitors from abroad to experience local life. In addition to tourism promotion, Japan offers scholarships for foreign students wishing to pursue higher education in Japanese universities, and extends bursaries to undergraduate applicants from poor families living outside of Japan. As well as looking at ways to increase bilateral spending on education and training programmes worldwide, the next Labour government will ensure that British student fees do not disadvantage low income students applying to study overseas while increasing opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend university in the UK. Education continues to provide that route out of poverty for millions of children and adults who were once trapped inside that vicious circle. In conclusion, let me stress again what one of our main goals as socialists is. To generate prosperity for everyone everywhere regardless of whether you live in London, Manchester or Beijing. To create jobs rather than cut them, homes instead of homeless people, carers instead of starving old peoples. And peace rather than conflict. Getting rid of capitalism won't automatically solve any problem. People need hope. They need democracy. Capitalism, however flawed, does offer that possibility. It may take time and effort, but socialism seems highly unlikely to deliver material benefits without taking away human rights along the way.
