I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately turn around and condemn Rachel Dolezal. This hypocrisy is based on the fact that while people were willing to accept Jenner's transition, they were unwilling to accept Dolezal's choice to identify as a different race. This double standard implies that gender identity is more acceptable than race identity, which reinforces an unjust power dynamic.
