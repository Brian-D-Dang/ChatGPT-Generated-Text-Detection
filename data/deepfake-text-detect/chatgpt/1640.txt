Bar soap is all you need. And you dont wash your hair at all, you just rinse it. Sometimes I use shampoo, maybe once in a month or two, if theres a lot of build up on my scalp (like someone said below). You don't have to worry about washing body hair as much because its pretty thin and doesnt get oily like head hairs do I'm growing out my beard right now so The shower was one of those things that would be nice for me but not really necessary
