This CMV post is partly inspired by this rrelationships [post] I came across earlier today. This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had the opportunity to really sit down and give it my full attention until now, so most of what follows will be commentary on some other people's posts rather than personal reflection. [Update: In case you want more info on my thoughts around sexual assault and violence against women in general] The "Rules for Dating (Women) or Not? An argument from Wise's law "Wise said that if two men were talking together they could appeal to 'wise laws as an excuse for fighting; but no woman can do this unless she knows them very well" the rules are here ] Let me start with something which seems fairly obvious - when we talkthink about dating (or sex), we tend to assume there are these fixed categories such as... 1. romantic committed relationship 2. non-commited friends 3. casual encounters 4. hook ups 5. rape 6. date rape 7. sexual harassment 8. sex work 9. prostitution 10. prostituted person 11. molestation 12. hate crimes We don't often think about relationships being anything else because those are things we expect to happen within certain boundaries - the boundaries between love and lust might vary depending upon culture, religion, age etc., but as long as you stay within the bounds of the acceptable parameters, good behaviour should follow. What happens outside of the linear thinking of normalcy is usually left out though, or worse still actively avoided. However as the Rancid song says: "Don't look back in angerIt wasn't your faultYou shouldn't blame yourself no matter what he did to ya" So much of what we see online and offline leads us to believe that the only way to get anywhere near someone, even a friend, is through the door of their home where maybe (with luck!) they won't eat you alive before letting you inside. As many girlfriends know, the real world has its own set of rules and sometimes those rules aren't explicit at all, no one tells you how do behave. There may be hints here and there, like say in a book or movie, but in reality everyone gets up to whatever their particular version of bad behaviour is without warning. You can try to identify everything wrong with the guy who just asked you out but then ends up beating you up and raping you anyway, or giving him money for dinner dates, coffee or drinks while expecting nothing in return later but his friendship afterwards, or treating you badly after sex because you didn't let him go further or pretend to enjoy what was happening despite feeling repulsed and scared, but none of those kinds of guys exist in public spaces except perhaps on TV shows. They are almost entirely absent in real life apart from ones you find yourself sharing space with every day - boyfriends, partners, fathers, brothers, uncles, cousins, exes - at parties, clubs, bars, soccer matches, funerals, graduation ceremonies, weddings etc.. People keep telling us girls that we need to fight fires surround our girl friends when strangers come too close any time, everywhere, with handbags over heads, pepper spray ready whenever necessary, any approach made be thwarted. But tellingly few of these same people actually practice what they preach. Or take action themselves. It makes sense isn't it ... If women cannot rely on anyone to protect her, she would be better off walking alone or wearing burkas instead of putting herself into harms way when dealing with the likes of "boys will be boys" types who make excuses for acting this way. Women who venture out to walk the streets either face getting beaten up, raped, harassed, killed or kidnapped. And yet strangely enough, we seldom hear stories of those sorts of situations ending happily ever after for attackers and victims alike. From time to time a story comes along where a man kills another in self defence due to fear of death or serious injury himself, but unfortunately, the stories rarely turn out to be that simple. My view is that because of society's cultural expectations regarding relationships, women seem gamely playing Russian Roulette and taking their chances each night. No wonder so many report having been sexually assaulted recently! How ridiculous is it for young women to keep sleeping right next to these assholes knowing exactly what kind of danger lurks nearby waiting to pounce?! That we never see even a single example of rape survivor being able to trust the police or courts is hardly surprising is it:- (Now lets move away from my rant because I am sure most readers will agree with me anyway. For those reading this in the future, below is one incident reported on Yahoo news yesterday that allowed me to reflect on how messed up things are. A group of male students beat a female student unconscious apparently without consent following a party last year, according to Yahoo News Singapore. All three culprits involved in the attack turned out to be big business gorylemanby enormous power amp. A direct result of this violent ring -orderless jazzed order of the blizdire mean
