I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately one day she went from a Caitlyn Jenner to a just plain old Scottie. The irony is they were rejecting her because she had been molested by Bruce as a child, but if you ask them about their own life experiences with similar situations or try to understand where someone else might be coming from instead of simply criticizing them for it on Twitter (which has become its' own form of bullying), no matter how kindhearted your intentions are, those who have experienced sexual assault see through these attempts at empathy like hot knives through butter. If "privilege" really means anything at all, this should include a certain amount of self-reflection so we can learn what works and doesn't work in our interactions with others; subjectively speaking, everything seems like another dick move except for perhaps a few things which still seem more than fair game after multiple assaults: the ability to get away without being caught. You know, the basic Machiavellian principles which allow even the most bottom feeder to survive unscathed. A lot of victims don't want to talk about it much until later, long enough into adulthood to remember the details, so maybe some degree of tact isn't such an issue - unless you actually believe that every single person needs to experience something traumatic before acting upon it as a result? At least the trans community supports each other, making alliances along commonalities rather than basing relationships entirely around differences like many of us do. The fact remains though...sexual abuse is a horrible thing regardless of whether it happens between two consenting adults or not. All humans deserve respect, compassion, understanding and support whenever possible. We all deserve to live happy lives free from fear deceit. Nothing good comes out of any form of abuse. It leaves scars both physical emotional. If anyone ever tries to justify sexual assault based off of that one incident, you will hear me say this once again: IT DOESN'T MATTER! That doesn't diminish the effects however. What does is taking advantage of opportunities given to you due to privilege over the years and decades leading up to that particular event, while simultaneously dismissing legitimate concerns raised by survivors. Asking why didn't he stop sooner? Doesn't anyone teach him boundaries anymore? Are men supposed to grovel at women's feet now? Why doesn't he take responsibility? Didn't he realize what could happen?! Of course, none of that answers the question -Why did this happen? To YOU! And THAT is exactly why it matters! Do you think the world stops spinning? No. Do you think sunlight ceases to shine on your body 247? NO!! Does everyone suddenly forget to breathe when you walk down stairs? They never FORGET! Even if they were taught to treat you differently than they normally would otherwise and disregarded all of your previous warnings, that only impacts the next time you choose to ignore them, now understanding all too well that you shouldn't trust them anyway. Not knowing how to control yourself triggers many different responses from victims - either completely shutting themselves down emotionally, often resulting in depression or rage, or thinking 'something must be wrong with ME' even after repeated instances of unwanted touch or groping, sometimes adopting attitudes reminiscent of Stockholm Syndrome to make sure nothing bad happens to THEM in retaliation. Either way, it's devastating. Denying someone access to resources they need to heal makes you complicit in their pain. There are plenty of pictures online of Michael Jackson looking very sad on his deathbed. Is that proof of any wrongdoing on anyone's part? How dare you imply that! Do you honestly expect ME to consider it okay because he WAS SAD?? He made hundreds of millions of dollars representing himself as THE BEST THING EVER! In addition to professional endorsements from actors and singers alike, including Usher and Britney Spears, he performed in front of thousands of screaming fans during shows as both a solo artist and under his brother's management - THAT IS NOT AN INCONVENIENCE TO ANYONE! When celebrities die, check yourselves for ticks first foremost. (This post originally appeared here.) One of the main reasons why I wrote this blog is to help young transgender girls stay focused and motivated towards achieving success in life...whether securing a solid education, getting involved in volunteer activities, creating career goals or moving forward with the transition process. While the majority of high school students today are interested in doing whatever it takes to fit in with the rest of society, few possess the courage required to stand apart enough to identify themselves clearly as members of minority groups. Unfortunately though, for most teens going into college, identity struggles begin earlier than older age ranges, especially considering the growing number of teenage parents trying to raise children alone. Even a positive attitude towards their situation is questionable, since they tend to developeigenic effects in teenagers, but sorters plan That said newriaortical
