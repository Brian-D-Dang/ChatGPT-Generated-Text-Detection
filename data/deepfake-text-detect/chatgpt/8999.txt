I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think about life on earth; to appreciate its complexity and its complexity in relation to natural systems and conditions such as evolution, ecology, and climate change. In my opinion, there are two ways of looking at things - either direct or indirect - and using them both counts as "natural." Sometimes we say that they don't exist because we assume that these systems aren't built by humans! But many people actually believe that all organisms will evolve together and they do so without an environmental explanation: They are not designed to reproduce at all. They evolve when their environment is warm. When they reproduce even if their environment is cold, when their environment is warmer, then they have a genetic memory to help sustain themselves and nurture others more effectively. So when some members of your family die prematurely, you can be sure that their genes would carry on reinforcing us through generations until we lose our ability to learn and adapt ourselves to new environments. If any member dies before you, the next best place to find a suitable replacement is a community where only those members who live with each other survive. Unfortunately, we continue to see scientific evidence that causes this extreme loss of species and diversity from time to time, but most scientists believe that it has been very long overdue. In 2000, for instance, but once again in 2010, the IPCC released a report showing that damage to wildlife was greater than for any other group over time... On numerous occasions, scientists have described the human-induced decline of biodiversity in Africa, Asia and America, pointing out that lost habitats may also include sea lions, leopards, tigers, splinters and foxes, and that climate change might cause dramatic shifts in habitat types.[1] One recent study estimated that over 90 percent of forests were no longer endangered [...]
