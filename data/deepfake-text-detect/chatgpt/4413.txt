Being transgender and wanting surgeryhormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think we all know someone like this in our lives. If they're lucky enough for their gender dysphoria to be mild, some simple counselling might help them cope (and avoid potential depression). But if it's severe, then really the only solution seems to be hormones andor surgery. Hormonally treated trans people are affected by medical decisions about what treatments to offer, but they also have serious mental health needs which sometimes go unaddressed. The fact of having your genders surgically changed can create extreme stress (I had "the talk" during my first transition when I was 16), not least because there may not yet be any appropriate surgeons available who won't cause problems. There are plenty of other therapies these days that could potentially alleviate those issues; perhaps even support group work could make a difference?
