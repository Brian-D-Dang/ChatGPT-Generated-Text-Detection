First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways of seeing and interacting with the world is different than ours. They also react to stimuli in very simple patterns. Their brains can be trained to work much like our own, because we have the ability as humans to focus on what's important (dinner) and ignore everything else, which dogs are incapable of doing by nature. As an example, let's say you've only ever come home after working all day long and wanted nothing more than to sit down on your couch at 6PM for some T.V., then get up for bed around 10pm when its time for dinner. Well if we took a dog that was raised differently from us or had no previous knowledge about how to behave and did exactly what we said we would do while trying to keep them focused on what we were wanting them to seedo, it wouldn't end well. The reason why? Because even though most people think they understand their animals better than anyone else does, there are still many situations where actions speak louder than words, so to speak. For instance, many dogs aren't taught proper body language for greeting new people, so everytime someone walks through the door they'll jump into full attack mode. Now these behaviors may seem totally innocent to those who own the dogs themselves, but to outsiders looking in, especially children who want pets badly, other adults who don't take certain precautions could lose control of the situation and cause harm to both owner and child. This sort of thing happens quite frequently when one takes their pet out for a walk in public. It's painfully obvious to everyone watching that your dog doesn't mean any harm towards others, but will almost always act defensively when confronted by something unfamiliar. Obviously training plays such an integral part within the relationship between man and animal, just as much as communication does. If you raise your puppy properly, he'll grow up being socialized correctly to his surroundings, unfortunately many owners simply do not give enough importance to teaching basic manners to their pets early on in life. So the question becomes, "Is the tradeoff worth it?" There is good and bad news regarding this, depending on the type of person you are. To begin with, raising a dog isn't easy. You need patience, understanding, discipline, that unique human touch that allows him to feel comfortable coming to you whenever needed instead of becoming fearful due to past negative experiences... All kinds of things really. That being said, owning and taking care of one brings great joy. Seeing the way your dog interacts with his environment makes you smile knowing that you helped make a difference. He comes running when hes hungry to eat and excited to play fetch with you, without having to ask or wait until its okayed. When he sleeps next to you, he looks completely content. We might argue over whether or not dogs should be allowed inside the house since they shed copious amounts of fur each season, however thats another discussion entirely. In conclusion: Owning a dog means giving up lots of personal space, responsibility and freedom among other things - but it brings back even greater rewards throughout the years of companionship.
