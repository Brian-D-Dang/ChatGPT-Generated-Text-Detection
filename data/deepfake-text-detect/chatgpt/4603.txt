Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if you are on a fast enough machine the time spent by V8 doing garbage collection is negligible compared to processing time. This seems like good news indeed! - Matthew LeMayJun 18 '12 at 10:08 1 Answer 1 This might be an edge case, but let's ask it anyway:) In your case, when the swapbuffer function returns, how many bytes has it put into the output buffer? Likely zero or some small amount (maybe 4 or 8). But then what happens next? It calls write , which will call back into C until either EOF or writes all of its data into the OS pipesfile descriptor. So we've got one extra layer of allocation before getting here. When do those allocations happen? Inside the VM initialization procedure where v8::VTableT::Initialize sets up for GC-safe mmap s by calling::operator new (sizeof (vtable...which allocates heap memory. And this allocation takes plenty of CPU cycles too. So unless maybe there are no other things running during these initializations - hmm... guess not - you're probably experiencing a large percentage of slowdowns. If you aren't seeing any slowdown, well, you can try profiling with V8MEMORYPROFILE1. You'll find a lot more information about this feature on
