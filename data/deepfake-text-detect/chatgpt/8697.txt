I'm a lifelong veggie, and I've been vegan for a while in the past although I'm not anymore. I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being vegetarian - it's just that they're definitely one of the most widely accepted and successful dietary choices. It's just that their are more than once and twice as many exceptions to this, but there aren't very many exceptions to vegetarianism that support vegetarianism This is true. There are around 2 of vegans who do not choose meat or fish, but they tend to be vegans themselves (in particular those who are actively seeking out alternatives)
