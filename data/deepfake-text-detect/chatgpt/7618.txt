One counter-argument to the above opinion is that just because someone puts content on social media does not necessarily mean that they are comfortable with anyone and everyone viewing it. People often curate their social media presence to present a certain image or share information with a specific audience. Browsing someone's social media without their consent can be seen as an invasion of privacy and can make them feel uncomfortable or violated. It is important to be respectful of people's boundaries and ask for permission before viewing their social media content.
