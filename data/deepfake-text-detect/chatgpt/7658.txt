The Liebeck lawsuit against McDonald's was not frivolous. Although the claim was for a seemingly small amount of 20,000, the lawsuit represented a larger societal issue, namely the responsibility of corporations to put the safety of their customers first. Mrs. Liebeck suffered third-degree burns on her thighs that required skin grafts and two years of medical treatment after spilling McDonald's hot coffee on herself. Furthermore, over 700 people had reported burns prior to her accident, yet McDonald's had not taken adequate steps to address the issue. The lawsuit was not about getting rich quick, as some people may claim. Instead, it was about holding a corporation accountable and ensuring that their customers are safe from harm.
