I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. From an economic standpoint alone they lost it as Germany was able to rebuild their economy with little trouble while the allies were still only starting to recover from the first world war. The US had won by invading Japan before them being ready for war again. By of course having a larger army than any other power.
