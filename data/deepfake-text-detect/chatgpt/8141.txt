I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a secondhand one might be the most sensible option. My wife and her family are moving back home from California at some point next year (within six months). We're talking about purchasing an old Acura NSX for them because she loves that model of vehicle being able take off down windy mountain roads without worrying is huge! It will fit our budget perfectly with enough left over cash after purchase costs we can put towards upgrading their current vehicles or even get further new ones later on if they wantneed more than just transportation; all while keeping up payments through us as long-term owners...but only temporarily until transfer ownership occurs when needed again sometime around 2021ish? Or am i missing why wouldnt you buy brand spanking NEW instead?? -Married couple who love classic sports muscle automobiles caring passionately abt environment
