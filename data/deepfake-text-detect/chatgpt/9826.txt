Reddit is a website, a business, it is the "front page of the internet." This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these types of posts can help create a safer, more inclusive community. It's important for the moderators to be aware of what type of content users are posting and to remove any that is deemed inappropriate. This can help create a better experience for all Reddit users.
