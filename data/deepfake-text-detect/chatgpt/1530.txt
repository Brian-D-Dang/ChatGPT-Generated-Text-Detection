This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... I think it's very unlikely that these kids had any idea what GamerGate was when they did this. They just saw a bunch of men attacking women everywhere (and in particular Zoe Quinn) without thinking anything about who or why they were doing so for over three years straight.
