Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll probably just end up giving them all away later today (or tomorrow). All of the reddit gold that you're gifting will be split into three different parts one for each of your comments in this thread! You did win 1 last week so it's nice that we can give it back:)
