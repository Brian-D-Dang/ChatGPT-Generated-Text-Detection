First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a personal sense rather than actual knowledge or experience with running these games themselves (and not just because they tend toward hyperbole). I recognize there are plenty sites out their which do offer advice on how best run each game system but what makes rpgamer so special? What sets it apart as being THE place you go if your looking at questions about tabletop RPGs in general? Is its focus purely based around DD 3 editions (as far back into my memory goes) or does other systems have some relevance too?. For example Battlesystem has been mentioned several times during various podcast appearances by aforesaid host RutyRutter; yet he's never once polled his audience via redditrtehackers etc asking specifically "what tips would people give regarding using battlesystems" type question - maybe Im wrong though!. So where exactly am i going wong...surely im missing something important..maybe someone could answer those two related qns above please:
