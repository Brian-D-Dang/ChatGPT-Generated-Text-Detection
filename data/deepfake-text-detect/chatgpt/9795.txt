Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as the very worst restaurant pizza. Frozen pizzas are generally much cheaper, faster, and more convenient than restaurant pizza, but their lower quality is usually a trade-off. Frozen pizzas are pre-made, so they can't be customized to suit individual tastes like restaurant pizza can. Additionally, frozen pizzas often lack the fresh ingredients and unique flavors that make restaurant pizza enjoyable.
