I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to come into possession of one naturally. The only way you could get them is by some kind of nuclear reaction happening inside something like solid lead." "You mean smashing atoms together?" asked Marge incredulously. "How would anyone ever manage that? And why don't they smash themselves apart instead?" Glenn went into his own personal account of how he'd made atomic bombs for various countries during World War II working under Enrico Fermi at Chicago-area research institutions: Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) first, then the University of California-Berkeley Radiation Laboratory and finally Los Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexico where Glenn was eventually appointed director emeritus.[8] He explained the process involved, the technology available to create an atom bomb back when he worked there, and even told about being part of a team sent out to scavenge uranium from the islands off Japan after Hiroshima had been destroyed so American scientists now knew exactly what type would be needed - uranium 235, which produces greater amounts of heat than normal uranium. That evening everyone expressed great surprise when Glenn said he didn't know anything about plutonium; all he really remembered were those long nights crammed around large, blackboards with diagrams showing complex equations mapping the electromagnetic forces between protons and neutrons within the nucleus of an atom. At least twice each month someone would bang their head against these boards over night trying to crack problems and gain new insights the group couldn't understand. Eventually, sleep deprivation began causing gaps in their memories until they simply gave up trying to make sense any more. But before quitting altogether, two members of this team stayed behind thinking aloud if perhaps they might have discovered the secret formula that allowed humans somehow to see through walls without actually going anywhere near them! As far as Glenn recalled none of the others shared this idea because they thought it too crazy...[9] (Source - Did You Know?)
