While it's true that Hearthstone's card economy can seem unbalanced and shallow at times, especially for newer players who may not have access to all the top-tier cards, it's important to consider that the game is constantly evolving and changing. With each new expansion, new cards are introduced that can shift the meta and change the way the game is played. Additionally, Hearthstone's designers have made a concerted effort to balance the game over time, often through nerfs and buffs to existing cards. While there may always be a few overpowered cards or decks, overall the game is fairly well-balanced, and players who put in the time and effort to learn the ins and outs of the meta can still find success. Furthermore, the Gnomes vs. Goblins expansion was released nearly six years ago, and the game has seen numerous expansions and updates since then, so it may not be entirely fair to judge the entire game based solely on that one release. Overall, Hearthstone remains a highly popular and engaging game for millions of players around the world, suggesting that the card economy is not as unbalanced or shallow as some critics might make it out to be.
