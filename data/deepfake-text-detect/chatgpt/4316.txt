First of, this is only talking about people who are vegetariansvegans for ethical reasons. If you are a vegetarian for any other reason, this does not apply Being a vegetarian or vegan has nothing to do with the ethics of killing animals for food and it has nothing to do with religious reasons (unless you believe in an animal-based religion). A lot of vegeans have had bad experiences that may be due to poor diet choice or stress from work etc. Rather than going into so much detail I am just going to tell you what causes a certain type of behavior to occur more often than others. If you don't eat meat or fish then your body will start converting protein to fat, which means it needs energy. This energy can come from dairy products like cheese, butter, cream or milk. Dairy foods contain many calories, but they also contain lots of health benefits such as calcium, phosphorus, vitamins B1 through B12 and vitamin D. The human body uses 25 of its calories on fats - these are used mainly by the brain, heart, muscles, liver, skin and intestines. Most of our energy comes from carbohydrates, which means we need dietary fiber to keep our digestive system functioning properly. Fiber contains amounts of soluble and insoluble carbs, and helps regulate blood pressure, bowel movements, and bowel function. Fats are essential sources of cholesterol, with cholesterol being crucial for proper cell development. It's important to remember that most of the dietary fiber you get from grains comes from starch as well. Starchy vegetables in particular provide lots of fibre and other nutrients. Fibre also prevents constipation. Many vegies and vegans get enough fibre through whole grain cereals and beans. Many vegie options come in the form of pulses and legumes. These include lentils, chickpeas, kidney beans, black peas, garbanzo beans and soybeans. Lentils are especially high in iron and protein while chickpeas, beans and lentil mix are great for reducing inflammation throughout the body. Canned tuna is good when you're short on time because you'll never go back to eating meat! Tuna fish is high in omega 3 fatty acids and is excellent for lowering LDL cholesterol levels. Other Omega 6s found in fish oil supplements can lower triglyceride levels, slow the growth of cancer cells and even improve insulin sensitivity. Fish oil supplements can help reduce the risk of depression and anxiety. Digestion begins when food enters the small intestine. The large intestine breaks down the food slowly over a few days before moving out to the colon where it is absorbed. Digestion still takes several hours without food intake so there is plenty of time during meals to digest any leftovers. Eating right does impact how quickly a meal makes it up to the stomach - if you eat too fast some parts of the food pass completely undigested whilst others enter you intestines unrefined and unpolished. The faster digestion times cause us to feel less hungry later in the day, but too little fuel is available for our bodies to use efficiently. If we eat too late at night, for instance after midnight, we run the risk of becoming emotionally exhausted by having to find energy elsewhere instead of simply digesting everything we've eaten.
