I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If we were going to die then why the heck would there be any need for a mother to give birth. What was the whole point of it. I have no answer but my question is why not just die. Why not just not reproduce and not have a baby and die. Why make people suffer. Why is there suffering at all. If you ask me we all come from a happy place, we all come from a place where we are not aware of anything. We are just in happiness. Then the mind creates thoughts and feelings and emotions. Then you are brought to this world to experience. That's all. Why make us suffer. We are not meant to suffer. That's what is so fucked up. But at the same time if we were not meant to suffer then why are we born into this world that is so full of suffering. Why not just not be born. I have no answers. It's just a thought. Just a thought. But it does make sense to me. What do you think? I would like to hear what you think and your reasoning. It makes sense to me, too. That is why I am a pessimist. I think there is a reason to be depressed and no reason to be happy. Wow. Now I'm depressed. Dude, you are young and have your whole life ahead of you. There is a reason to be happy. You are a young man with no responsibilities and have no worries. But there is a reason to be happy. You just have to find it. It's in all of us. I have to disagree with you. I think it's in all of us but we choose not to see it. Having no worries and no responsibilities is exactly why you can't see it. It is because you are not truly living. You are not experiencing what life is all about. You have no fear. You have no worries. You have no responsibilities. But you have no life. You are not truly alive. You are just existing. Living is experiencing what life is all about. Life is about living. It's about experiencing. It's about having feelings and emotions. It's about being scared. It's about being happy. It's about making mistakes and learning from them. It's about experiencing life. You are not doing that. You are not truly living. You are existing. How can you be depressed if you are not experiencing life. It is because you have not experienced life. You are only existing. It's too bad that you are not experiencing life. But that doesn't mean that we all have to be like that. You are not living and that's why you can't see the reason to be happy. You are not truly living. Wow. You are a fucking douche bag. How do you know I am not truly living. I am living and experiencing life. I am experiencing life all the time. I have my own business that I have built from the ground up. I have my own family. I have friends and I have a wonderful life. You don't know what you are talking about. I think you are fucking delusional. How do you know I am not living. I am living and experiencing life. I am experiencing life all the time. I have my own business that I have built from the ground up. I have my own family. I have friends and I have a wonderful life. You don't know what you are talking about. I think you are fucking delusional. You are a fucking ignorant douche bag. No. I don't know that you are not living. But you are not living. You have no life. You are existing. You are not really living. You are just existing. You are not experiencing life. You are not experiencing what life is all about. You are not feeling and experiencing what it is like to be scared. You are not feeling and experiencing what it is like to be happy. You are not experiencing life. I am experiencing life. I am experiencing what it is like to be scared. I am experiencing what it is like to be happy. You are not. You are just existing. I don't think you have experienced what it is like to be happy or scared. You are just existing. You are not living. You are living but you are not living life. You are just existing. You are not truly
