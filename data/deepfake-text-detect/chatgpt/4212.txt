Edit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) This isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a little bit racist, and that's sad as fuck. But I understand that in this day and age we need to protect our country from people like him. I'm not sure how you'd fit hunters into your racist category... Like you said these killers are just trying to feed their families, why is that so hard for you to believe? Because you're twisting this issue into something it shouldn't be. A lot of these killings have been on private land...but when they happen on public property....the government should do more to stop them. They can probably find legal recourse if the owner doesn't want them there. It would make sense too since he told his family he was going out with friends...so naturally he knows where his son went off to. He most likely wasn't having an affair though..
