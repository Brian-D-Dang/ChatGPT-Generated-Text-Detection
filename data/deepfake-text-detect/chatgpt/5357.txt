I'm referring to this news story about the incident at the community pool in McKinney TX. You can reference it here, the video is down the page and is approximately 1 minute long or so). You know how some people say they don't like to pay attention during a plot twist? This is what happened every time something happens when you watch a movie on Netflix because they think it'll ruin your life daydreaming over the fact that they're watching a plot twist that might spark curiosity by describing it to their kids as wrong! Yeah I've heard that too but my parents are really used to seeing these things happen EVERY TIME something happens with their children haha
