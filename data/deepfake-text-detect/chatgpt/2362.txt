By "practical reason," I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election. I admit that this is not always easy to do, but it makes discussions like these more productive if people are operating from some kind of shared assumptions about what they think an acceptable justification for political behavior might be. I'd say there's at least one good practical reason: Voting provides me with information on how my neighbors see themselves politically (whether in regard to specific issues or candidates). This can help inform future decisions regarding policy changes; knowing which side your neighbors sit on may allow them to give better feedback when discussing ideas due to being able to speak their minds without fear of retribution. For example, someone who isn't afraid to call out racism will have fewer qualms doing so among those whose views would punish such statements as disloyalty. The same goes true vice versa - having friendsfamily members disagreeing constantly won't necessarily make communication difficult entirely because we might form some common ground around other things besides politics.
