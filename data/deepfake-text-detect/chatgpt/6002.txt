I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is something beyond this earth then we shall never know it. I am a realist when it comes to these things. However, I am a follower of a religion that says I will go to a "place" where there is "heaven" and "hell" and that I will be judged by a "god" and that if I am "good" enough then I will go to "heaven" and if I am not then I will go to "hell." Now this is all fine and dandy until you look at what is written in the holy book. The holy book is the Muslim Holy book, the Quran. The Quran has a chapter called the "Heavens" in it. As I read the chapter the verses that struck me the most were verses 72-75. What is the chapter about? It's about the day of judgement. The day when people are judged. The day when the good and the bad are separated from one another. If you read the verses carefully and compare them with what we are taught in the Christian religion then you will see that it's almost a mirror image of the Christian religion. Most of the time I am a realist. I don't believe in supernatural, I believe in science and I believe that what is written in the Quran is the truth. However when it comes to the day of judgement I think that I might be wrong. I think that there is some kind of supernatural and that on the day of judgement you will be separated into two categories. One category is those who believe and the other is those who do not believe. If this is the case then the believers will go to heaven and the non-believers will go to hell. I'm sure that we will be judged in the day of judgement. I am sure that there is a God who will judge us. We all do bad things and we all do good things. At the end of the day we will be judged on the good things that we have done and not on the bad things that we have done. If we have done good things then we will go to heaven and if we have not then we will go to hell. I'm not trying to convert anyone to any religion but I'm just trying to see a logical side to this argument. A good topic for a debate though. I think it's very interesting how the two are similar. I'm not quite sure that I agree with the last part, but I'll have to think about it a bit more. I agree with the last part as well. It's just that we should be judged on the good things that we have done in life. I think that a lot of the bad things that we do is because of our upbringing and that's why we shouldn't be judged on those. A lot of people are judged for the bad things that they have done. It's just that we should be judged on the good things that we have done in life. It's just that we should be judged on the good things that we have done in life. I think that a lot of the bad things that we do is because of our upbringing and that's why we shouldn't be judged on those. I agree with the last part as well. It's just that we should be judged on the good things that we have done in life. I think that a lot of the bad things that we do is because of our upbringing and that's why we shouldn't be judged on those. I have never really thought about this before, but I think you are right, and I think that religion is mainly a matter of interpretation. Everyone believes differently, so it would be almost impossible to find one religion that everyone would believe. I agree with the last part as well. It's just that we should be judged on the good things that we have done in life. I think that a lot of the bad things that we do is because of our upbringing and that's why we shouldn't be judged on those. I think this is an interesting topic, but I also think that it is very complicated. I do agree with the first part, but I'm not sure how I feel about the last. It seems like the main goal of judgement is to get us to behave a certain way, so if we were to be judged on the things that we did in our lives, we would have no motivation
