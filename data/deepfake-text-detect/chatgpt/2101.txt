(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge people who are part of the lifestyle. I have no problem with any other kind of sex, as long it's done within a loving relationship and consenting adults (which used to be legal anywhere). Second before we start on this topic, let us go over what consensual means... In laymans terms you can do whatever the fuck you like so long as 1 person involved consents; 2 more than one participant don't harm another human being by not giving their explicit informed permission to participate; And 3 all parties agree to follow basic health rules such as use protection etc.. So if everyone follows these simple laws then your golden! Right? Wrong!!!!! If only life was really that easy - - Oops now i'm drifting off into philosophical land again.... Anyway back onto why our laws should protect gay couples rather than just straight onesWhen it comes down to whether same sex marriage will lead to polygamy..... No it won't!!!! Let me explainThis would mean two women could get married love eachother but they couldn't live together because legally even though both were female neither had rights over the house property which belong entirely to the male partnerNow lets look at opposite gender marriages for exampleTwo men can marryOne man owns everythingAnother lives rent freeSo where does polygamy come from exactly...... Yup its right outta the bibleFirst ever recorded polygamous marriage was between Abraham and SarahAFAIKSarah gave birth when she was 90!! Not practical today unless u wanted lotsa babiesAnywayAbraham fathered a whole bunch of kids thru his many wives including IsaacJacob took over after abrahms death started marrying his siblingsHe got pissed off at Leah and cheated on her with RachelLeah told Jacob about it and he kicked her out while taking Rachel as a wifeThings didn't work well for him eitherRachel died shortly afterwardsIsaac left LabanJacob due to cheating nepotismLaban tells Isacc to take some livestock bridesman (taken away from someone else) Then give them things and goThe guy refused cause using deception isn't coolIsmail tricked laban into signing documents stating "all childeren born here will belong solely" also known as slavery....... Thats how Samaria came aboutWent on to form a new country called IsraelWhich became famous world wide during Jesus' timeAt first most Jews rejected him till God sent MosesAnd argued in favour of Jesus until finally most accepted HimBut some decided otherwiseBecause 5000 years ago law came alongThen folks believed anyone practicing Judaism needed to convert and become ChristiansOtherwise everyone gets punishedThat included those persecuted gaysIn fact most countries treat homosexuality worseThan adultery and stealing! This makes sense huh?? What happened to freedom of religion??? Theres nothing wrong with having multiple partnersAslongas it involves full consent, care and respectFor yourself and othersIf anything marriage should be based around loveNot moneyand powerAnyways sorry for going on an extended tangENTGuess thats enough ranting for nowWhy yes I am biased against polyamoryIt simply goes directlyagainst every single piece of literature written since beginning of civilizationNo doubt you'll say:"oh well ancient tribes weren't civilized!"Ummm yeah no shit sherlockIts kinda hard to write books without electricityMaybe someday humanity will evolve beyond rape murder violence theft lies manipulation deceit machiavellian tactics etcetcWe've already seen huge leaps forward in social progressionJust check twitter lolOk must stop bloggingnowBack soonTake CareYoursTristanPS I'd appreciate feedback good bad or uglyThanks
