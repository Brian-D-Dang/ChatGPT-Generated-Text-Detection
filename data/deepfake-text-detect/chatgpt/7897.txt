A counter-argument to this opinion would be that the right to bear arms is an important aspect of autonomy and personal freedom. Additionally, the availability of guns can be a strong deterrent against crime, and can also provide a means of self-defense for individuals who may otherwise be vulnerable. Moreover, the presence of guns empowers responsible law-abiding citizens to prevent or alleviate violent crimes, and hence increase the overall safety and security in society. In short, while there may be negative aspects associated with guns, it is ultimately a utilitarian win for society for individuals to have the right to bear arms.
