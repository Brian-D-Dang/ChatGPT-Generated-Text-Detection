Just as the title says, I firmly believe that the modern interpretation of the hipster does not truly exist and never has. I'm going to link an article from two years ago in Salon which proves my point about it being a farce. It's been proved over time too but you can't quote articles on Wikipedia so this is what i have. You're forgetting there's people like me out there who are old enough to remember when they were hipsters, still do hipster things, and get upvoted at least once every few weeks for posting pictures of parties we went to as kids or college aged men who just happen to be dressed similarly to us today (even though those pics mostly look identical).
