Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. The practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes is called "Cabotage" and it has been prohibited by the Federal Aviation Administration since 1978.
