I just read this [article] stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering the overrepresentation of minorities in our school system, it would seem only logical for them also be represented at higher levels amongst college studentsat least compared with their numbers among high-school graduates! What gives?
