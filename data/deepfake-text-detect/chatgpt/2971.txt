I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience, we know that those who drop nuclear bombs first generally get a tactical advantage over their opponents which will often result in total victory and the destruction of any opposition! The only nations left on earth are blind sheeple with no ability or desire to question authority figures. As long as they can eat cheeseburgers by running up debt, then they'll be happy. At least until some new threat comes along and blows them away... When you see people walking around trying hard not to look at smartphones while listening to music through Beats Headphones (but still looking distracted) it's because Obama keeps turning off cell towers across America so his "buddies" can keep getting free phone calls from China. It is time to wake up and show these bullies what happens when someone gets too big. Just ask Kim Jong Un how things work out if you attempt to intimidate your neighbors with nukes. We're just lucky he isn't crazy enough to launch one into space yet. We must always remember that a few decades ago North Korea was basically our friend now we avoid going there like the plague!!! And don't forget: Santa Claus doesn't exist either!!
