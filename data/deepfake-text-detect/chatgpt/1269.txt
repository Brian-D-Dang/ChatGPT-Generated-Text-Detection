In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me, how it made us feel as a community. I will also finish with some thoughts about what we can do now that our work on the issue is done in order for us to heal together from the trauma caused by these attacks so many years ago... To start off at the beginning: What does this say about our society? This was one week before 911 - when Saudi Arabia flew two planes into New York's World Trade Center Towers, killing almost 3200 innocent people - when flights out of New York were being diverted via Montreal over concerns about possible terrorist activity. There had been an actual attack three weeks earlier but nobody paid much attention then either (although you would have thought there wouldn't have been any security if they did know). It wasn't until 20th September 2001 that those who died from the attack received official recognition through a state funeral held during which I watched my brother-in-law lean forward to take a photo of his sister's husband standing behind President Bush. My best friend lost her mother too; she said Sarah Palin never once mentioned the victims or their families again after the day of the ceremony. Her father in turn spent days waiting outside the Church where he volunteered when the mourners left on Sunday morning looking pained and defeated while walking home alone each night without seeing anyone else leave. As a result of this, the memories live with him every waking moment. The point here isn't just about the politics surrounding 911 itself though. The question I wanted to answer was whether Canadians are really ready for another act like this. We aren't. And not only has "the time come" for such an event since we voted Harper back into office last year, we need to consider whether Canada ever stood up enough against terrorism prior to that election lest we ask ourselves why we didn't stand up properly then either.... When the Toronto Star ran articles on anti-Muslim hate crimes the same weekend Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president (which came more than six months later), our media started covering the topic as former Conservative cabinet minister Chris Alexander suggested that Muslims should report more hate crime incidents immediately following the US elections stating outright that Canadian police weren't doing enough to investigate them. But go figure, CBC News covered it hours later instead..... A few things came to mind first reading this story: 1) Why weren't national newspapers reporting about this sooner 2) How could Chris Alexander possibly believe both statements publicly given most news outlets actually shy away from race profiling reports unless absolutely necessary given recent events across North America and Europe involving police using overly broad definitions of criminal behaviour resulting in racial profiling 3) Has the stench of racism finally reached this country even further than we realized before? If so, 4) Are Canadians still receiving fair representations of Muslim communities online thanks to social media platforms or 5) Is Islamophobia taking root within mainstream religious groups making it increasingly difficult for moderate voices to resist its growth? All five questions were asked privately among friends watching on Facebook who found themselves asking similar ones afterwards.. Nowhere near as hard hitting yet equally troubling headlines appeared online relating to Quebec City mosque shooter Alexandre Bissonnette's history with immigration issues claiming immigrants pose a threat to French heritage sites. In fact, the National Post reported less than 24hrs later that people shouldn't expect anything different next time someone tries to shoot up a place of worship anywhere in Canada. Ironically, the article linked above linking to that headline actually talked more specifically about radio host Dan Savage (who called for the strip clubs serving alcohol to close down over Halloween noting that women don't deserve to pay to watch men undress!) in response to backlash he faced. You may recall that by Wednesday June 14, 2017 Dan Savage tweeted along the lines of "It seems like the Islamic religion might be especially prone to violence and extremism." He went onto add: 'Since May 15th there have been more than 1000 acts of violence worldwide inspired by ISIS with almost 500 deaths' (emphasis added for emphasis sake!). Which brings me directly to Thursday August 17th 2017. It seemed extremely odd that 8 months after Dan Savage's tweet there hadn't been a single TV interview by regular reporters who cover the topic regularly seeking answers from experts in law enforcement regarding whether Islamophobic rhetoric contributes in contributing towards violent actions perpetrated against Muslims. But no matter! That evening, mere minutes after Trudeau spoke at length to the public condemning anti-immigrant sentiment and extremism, Radio One broadcasted an entire hour long program filled mostly with interviews with guests with strong opinions including a couple denouncing Dan Savage saying they think he encourages hatred... From their perspective you see.... So much for impartiality..... Of course this led listeners calling in wanting to hear "both sides..............." Because according to nothing Prime Minister Trudeau says, neither side matters... for part, balloon Chel Foreign Los
