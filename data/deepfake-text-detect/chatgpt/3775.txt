I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life. I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; however, in my life there has always been an underlying assumption that if you were not born on this planet with these characteristics or traits then you are inherently lesser than others. It is no secret to me now that I am descended from people who were forced into slavery by another race. This fact was widely known to the Founding Fathers during their deliberations over the Constitution, but it was only made public after the Civil War when those who had once defended the institution began making excuses for its existence. The concept of racial inferiority still permeates our society today. For example, a black man can be homophobic without being racist because racism is defined as prejudice based on one's actual or perceived race. However, if he does not like the way his white friend behaves while waiting at the bus stop after school, then he could easily become prejudiced against all whites in general through fear of racism itself - though he would never call himself racist. What makes this attitude so damaging? It leads to self-loathing among minorities. They may not realize they want equal treatment, but when the idea of acceptance is thrown out the window they feel rejected and unwanted. Not everyone experiences discrimination, which explains why some Hispanics, blacks and Latinos live in poverty despite having higher levels of education than whites throughout America, but many do experience it nonetheless. When we learn about how much better off most Americans are compared to Africans, Asians, Native Americans or Central Asians, we think how fortunate we are to dwell in a country where economic inequality isn't a daily reality. We should instead live in a world in which every person feels welcome regardless of sexual orientation, skin color, gender identity or ability level. There is nothing wrong with liking football or basketball more than baseball or poker. In fact, I often prefer them both! And although I don't personally believe sports shouldn't discriminate against anyone based on their abilities or religion, there is something wrong with discriminating between different races, ethnicities, nationalities etcetera just because someone happens to play football rather than baseball. This is especially problematic when fans of different teams, sports leagues or countries see themselves as feuding with each other instead of enjoying their own sport collectively. Sports fans aren't as separated apart as we seem to make them out to be: especially since teams move around constantly. People are even drawn together across international boundaries because of common interests. What's worse is that this mentality often takes root amongst certain demographics of people who share language, cultural norms and religious values. Some Americans support the Trump campaign in spite of the fact he hates Muslims, while others question whether or not Donald is really going to allow Christians to practice their faith openly in the United States of America. Fans of European soccer clubs often come to terms the violence of their games thanks to the efforts of thousands of volunteers protecting victims whenever they hear about street attacks worldwide. International fans might also develop a kinship bond to rivalries like Argentina vs Brazil, Germany vs Spain, France vs Italy etc. We love our sports - let's put down the "us Vs Them" division and celebrate each other's victories and defeats together.
