First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways and thought processes aren't that much different from ours. They have basic needs - food, shelter - just like we do, so all the problems related to over-exertion or lack thereof, just as with us is also true for them (but you don't see me complaining about it). Most dogs get along well with people because we understand each other's language. However, certain breeds tend to be more aggressive than others, especially towards strangers who may appear threatening - either physically or verbally. That said, no dog will turn on its owner unless heshe breaks ranks long enough to welcome another individual in the family unit. All dogs need to learn respect for humans, and anything else too near them can startle them and set off an attack. As far as training goes, most owners would agree that if your dog doesn't listen when under command or ignores commands altogether, you'll need to find some way of teaching him good manners. This includes socializing him, which can take time and patience and be pretty expensive, depending how many puppies there were around when he was born. All those toys at Christmas? Those never look quite right after Easter, come rain or shine! You might try introducing toys designed specifically for pet therapy. The Instant Piggy Bank toy, for instance, is one such product worth looking into. It has been hailed by veterinarians, vets and behaviourists alike as being among the best products ever created for indoor playtime for youngsters - though naturally only if used according to instructions. These include filling it once per day with small amounts of kibble until full, providing plenty of opportunities to give his attention away from the 'piggy' part of the game, then putting it back where it belongs before replacing it with new feed. Another great toy which works similarly is the "Do Not Disturb" Peanut Butter Toy. You've probably seen these advertised everywhere - possibly even while reading about our own beloved pets. But did you really know what they were designed for? Here's a rundown on three interesting facts you didn't know about the PetSafe Roverz Remote Control Dog Walker and Leo Breeders... Read More
