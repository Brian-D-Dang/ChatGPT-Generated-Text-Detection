It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing we are not talking about nearly enough in this equation is international law. I would like to acknowledge that China's rise has been accelerated by its ability to forge strong alliances with countries around it at home (e.g., Pakistan), across Africa (e.g., Algeria) and even within Southeast Asia (i.e. Laos). But these relationships must be scrutinized for their legality under treaties such laws as the United Nations Convention on Law Enforcement Assistance (UN-CALEA). A cursory examination reveals some interesting tidbits which highlight why China may need an alliance system more than any other country over time. It will also explore how a coalition of nations without respect for sovereignty can unite itself into an alliance structure that Western governments have historically struggled against or simply ignored. This article seeks to lay out these points along with others concerning regional and multinational relations between members of The One Belt, One Road Initiative. Brief History: An Outline Of International Relations Throughout Modern Times Before focusing too much attention on Chinese involvement, let us take a look back through history and examine how things came together so powerfully. To start off, I want you to look at two very powerful examples from our modern past - namely San FranciscoOakland Bay Bridge construction and Berlin wall building. In the first case, America had every advantage - great technology, access to funding via big business, lots of manpower, etc. Yet something happened during that process where American engineering was taken hostage by politics and turned 180 degrees away from what was originally intended; government control began kicking up a notch, destroying acres upon acres of farmland, turning rivers into sewers and altering natural habitats at whim until capitalism could no longer help support the project. In addition to having ideal conditions for development, decisions were made based on ideals rather than real world circumstances. There was little doubt that both sides wanted bridges built but instead of putting a stop to this madness, there ensued a battle of wills where the weaker party eventually yielded to the stronger one.....and it wasn't long before cracks showed up in the dam being built and stress became unbearable. When the tensions broke loose, everything stopped dead including the flow of goods throughout Northern California. People literally stood atop each other while trying to get cell phone service amidst heavy traffic. Chaos reigned for days until everyone calmed down a bit and order resumed, albeit only after several deaths and injuries. The second example involves Germany once again and the Great Wall of Berlin. After World War II ended, West Germans desperately needed a symbol of unification among themselves. Despite living side by side, East German citizens feared western influences because they knew reunification was going to go south if they couldn't turn the tide toward the east. While many abhorred the idea of communism and embraced freedom, trust immediately took precedent over ideology. So they did exactly what had to happen....they started constructing walls! They didn't know who else to build them next to since Europe already boasted plenty of fortifications. Even though East Germans knew the tactic would fail, they still felt compelled to keep trying. As soon as workers connected power lines above ground, electricity exploded outward causing massive explosions across multiple buildings in Soviet controlled territories that resulted in hundreds injured and dozens killed. All attempts to halt production failed until the organizers finally understood their error in foolhardy judgment.......at least three years later! Once the dust settled, East Germany was destroyed and the free west prevailed as planned. So here we stand today looking at a game changer in regards to economics and security worldwide. And this shift is happening faster and harder than most experts predicted. Just ask yourself... "Why? What caused this change the way it is?" You might say trade deals and the resulting job losses, capital flight and the subsequent lower standard of living, debt accumulation, demographic shifts and radicalizing ideologies, etc.. These reasons are good ones, however just think about it for a minute....how does the U.S. benefit from trading with another nation? How do we prevent foreigners from moving out of the U.S.? How would we maintain military bases overseas if our economy collapsed? Since we haven't won wars lately, maybe those questions aren't so important anymore. Ultimately, we rely heavily on foreign aid to ensure basic needs continue. We provide foodstuffs and medical supplies from South Korea to Pakistan. Our own troops fight alongside allies for protection and sometimes send aid. Would anyone argue against better health care for soldiers dying in action compared to a camper fighting malnutrition or worse diseases whilst quarantined inside Afghanistan? Searching For Answers: Why Did Chine Build The New Silk Roads? Is It Because It Couldn't Beat Us Anymore? Of course, this raises more questions than answers. Who knows why they went ahead with these projects? I don't believe they power-driven equipment is empty of expensive devices containing batteries where drivers become to be read, whether drivenness, a close tongue winds have now thats ends
