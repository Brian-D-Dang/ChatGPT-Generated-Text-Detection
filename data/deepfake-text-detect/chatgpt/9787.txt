First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are being put towards conservation efforts, and pandas are one of them. These resources could be used to save a number of other species that are more endangered or facing extinction. It is also important to recognize the loss of habitat as a major threat to pandas, and focus on creating ways to protect their habitats. We should also continue to support research into finding solutions of how we can mitigate the effects of climate change on the species. Finally, we should continue to educate people about the importance of protecting pandas and the environment, so that everyone can understand the value of these animals and the need to preserve them.
