Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I'm not complaining about Facebook's new genders, I'm actually quite pleased and supportive of their inclusion. I've been questioned on my support of Facebook's new gender options several times, and I've realized that not everyone understands my excitement. This page is intended to hopefully clarify why I'm so happy about Facebook's new gender options. For a while now, I've been thinking about writing this page to explain my excitement over Facebook's new gender options, but I've been a bit hesitant for several reasons. I've always wanted this page to be strictly about the content, so I've never wanted to get too personal. While my excitement for Facebook's new gender options is something I'm incredibly excited about, I've never been one to rant or rave about things (including my support of Facebook's new gender options) - so this page has never been in my future. However, I've also always wanted this page to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their gender or sexuality. Many people view gender identity as some sort of 'fad' or a 'trend', something that's becoming incredibly popular and gaining tons of support. This is one of the things that makes Facebook's new gender options so exciting: it means that people can finally stop being afraid of being themselves. It means that people can finally be themselves without worrying about what others will think. It means that people can finally be accepted. I've always been very vocal about my support of the LGBTQ community, but I've always been extremely hesitant to talk about my own personal gender identity. Even now, I'm not sure how to refer to myself - I know that I'm not a "he," but I'm not a "she" either. I don't want to be put into a box, but I don't want to be left out of Facebook's new gender options either. I'm going to try my best to explain my personal gender identity, but I'm sure I'll be unable to put it into words. In my opinion, there are two main ways to identify your gender. The first way is by how you physically look and act: people identify as "boys" or "girls," "men" or "women," "cis" or "trans" etc. The second way is through your own personal thoughts, feelings, and emotions: people identify as "male" or "female," "masculine" or "feminine," "androgyne" or "genderfluid" etc. I identify as both of these ways. As far as my physical appearance goes, I'm incredibly feminine. I like to wear dresses and skirts, I enjoy wearing makeup and nail polish, and I love to wear feminine jewelry. This is partially why I identify as "female" and "woman" on Facebook. I'm also incredibly open about my sexuality, and I'm not ashamed of who I am. I love to wear feminine clothing, but I'm not ashamed of myself for doing so. I also love to wear masculine clothing, and I'm not ashamed of myself for doing so either. I'm incredibly open about who I am and what I like. However, I'm not comfortable with being a "woman" or a "female" - to me, those words are too exclusive. I know that sounds crazy, but I'm not ashamed to admit it. I have cisgender female friends, and I love them dearly, but I'm just not comfortable identifying as "female" or "woman." I also have transgender female friends, and I love them dearly as well. I'm not ashamed of who they are and what they go through, but I'm just not comfortable identifying as "female" or "woman." I've tried identifying as "genderfluid" on Facebook, but I never felt comfortable with that either. I think that "genderfluid" is a word that's been twisted, and I think that the meaning of "genderfluid" has been completely lost. I think that "genderfluid" is a word that has been taken over by people who wish to use the word as a "fad." I think that "genderfluid" has been taken over by people who just want to look cool
