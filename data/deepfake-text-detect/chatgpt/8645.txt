I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by giving them an explanation that their actions were wrong. As you know, some of the things I have said are completely false and selfish. But you can get away with all kinds of bullshit if you're willing to put yourself in harms way so there is no reason why they cannot be trusted. This may sound stupid, but is there any good advice available about what to do? Would it be okay for me to leave him around while we're together?
