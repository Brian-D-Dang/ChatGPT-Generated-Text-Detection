First thing, let's assume the biblical Jesus is completely true. Now, I have a fair knowledge of the biblical tale, but if I say something wrong, feel welcome to correct me and tell me where I'm wrong so that I can attempt to correct it for you! This is neat stuff - a lot more info than it seems! I've heard that Jesus was actually the creator, but I'm not sure how true. It could be misunderstood as a mythological character who only thought he'd be a prophet or something like that?
