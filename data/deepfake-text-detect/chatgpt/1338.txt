Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the new law it could be made even more serious: if you don't provide "material assistance," that means not testifying against someone else who has been charged with conspiracy or fraud - and refusing to testify would usually mean lying about past criminal activity (which you can already do now). If we accept this proposition as true, then it becomes all but impossible for journalists ever to tell stories from inside these so-called 'fishbowls of government agencies,' much less get them published by mainstream news outlets like The Washington Post or Time Magazine. It will require courage on their part to take risks they might regret later, especially when dealing with people whose careers depend upon keeping secrets ... But what are these secrets? What kind of things have people done behind closed doors which should make us stop trusting our own governments? These questions form a framework through which I examine my experiences working at the CIA during the Bush era; the story was first told in length in We Are All John Millington Synge.
