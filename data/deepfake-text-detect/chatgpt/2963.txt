I just read this [article] stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering how much conservatives hate affirmative action, you would think they'd be all for helping minorities get a better education. But then again, I'm not sure if the people who write these articles realize what kind of picture those statistics paint about our society... I guess it's too scary for them to actually look at it though..
