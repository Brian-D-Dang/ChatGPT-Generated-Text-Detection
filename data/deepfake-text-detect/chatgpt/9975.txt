Edit: Thanks for all the info. I more or less quit responding because a couple people effectively changed the way I was looking at the issue. To be honest though, it really opened up my eyes and I'm considering the possibility of transitioning to a career in programming. I think the best advice is to start by learning the basics of programming. There are plenty of online resources that you can use to get started. Once you have a basic understanding, you can start exploring different languages, frameworks, and technologies. You may also want to look into joining a local meetup group or taking a class at a local community college or university. With time and practice, you will be able to gain proficiency in programming and eventually pursue a career in it.
