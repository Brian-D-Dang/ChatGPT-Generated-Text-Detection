Before I continue, I would like to start by saying that I am not a pedophile and that I am strongly against the sexual abuse of children. My view is in no way representative of all who practice or believe sexuality. This article will be based on my personal experience with sex-positive people and their views, but it should also provide an interesting opinion on what these ideas about sexuality are actually worth since some might disagree with me. This whole concept of sex-positivism has been around for quite a while now. Some elements were inspired from radical feminism, others from queer theory and still other parts emerged as part of cultural anthropology. It was first coined by Alan Soble in his book Sex Positivity: Radical Feminism Reclaiming Sexuality. The term itself can mean many different things depending upon which group you ask. If we talk about contemporary "sex positive" communities however, one must define it as such that encompasses those who see pleasure and eroticism as something desirable and valuable when they come across new ways of experiencing them, regardless if this is through heterosexual, homosexual, incestual, polyamorous relationships (or whatever) ... If there's anything common among those involved in the various forms of sex positivity according to Wikipedia, it is that they praise consensual noncomformist behavior and reject any sort of gender essentialism. Roughly speaking, sex positivists hold that anyone who wants to have pleasurable experiences may do so without being pressured into harming anyone else sexually or otherwise. They accept both monogamy and polygamy as valid models of commitment and intimacy. There is furthermore no pressure onto women towards having abortions or even giving birth. Although there is a certain amount of grey area here. Following the example of Sofia Ahmetiu, the author states that she finds men getting pregnant after rape just as much problematic as pregnancy resulting from unwanted pregnancies. She does not consider abortion as necessary nor sufficient solution if there's exploitation involved. In her opinion, it depends entirely on each individual woman whether she regards it as acceptable to get yourself raped and then carry the child of your rapist, or find another partner willing to take care of the baby. So yes, albeit only within certain limits, we could say that most sex-positive thinkers tend to advocate reproductive autonomy and a healthy conception of romantic love. Importantly though, they don't support coercion and violence - neither physical forces used to prevent someone from reproducing nor involuntary sterilization, either forced by law or performed under threat of imprisonment. There is however another side to this argument. Most notably represented by philosopher David Benatar. He sees pedophilia as morally unacceptable, arguing that children cannot consent to intercourse due to immaturity, lack of free choice, cognitive limitations etc., hence justifying its eradication. Likewise he takes a stand against prostitution and argues that minors cannot enter it voluntarily. These two quotes are taken from chapter 3 of his 2009 publication Better Never To Have Been: The Harm Of Coming Into Existence. Moreover, he rejects masturbation altogether and promotes abstinence until marriage as moral imperative. The main problem with Benatar's arguments is that he assumes every adolescent girl is at risk for becoming a victim of sex trafficking and ending up in prison. That seems very far fetched considering how easy it is nowadays to track down and identify individuals using social media, especially underage girls living away from home due to school. At least in Western countries. We know exactly where they live, work, study and play. Also, why wouldn't any young girl want to reach adulthood? Why become mature enough to acquire responsibilities? Furthermore, why remain single once fulfilled life goals are reached unless it is because she doesn't have access to contraceptives yet? And again, why spend time alone when opportunities abound? This paragraph pretty well sums up the problems with Benatar's point of view: The thing to realize is that there are plenty of reasons teenagers and adults don't choose to engage in acts involving force, deception and harm. That's why most people avoid doing drugs; alcohol makes sense too. You need to use discretion, respect reciprocation and treat everyone respectfully, including potential victims. Otherwise you're likely to end up abusing children or committing crimes...It matters little if you think kids are cute or "innocent." Anyone who knows grownups feels contemptuous of both groups. Human beings generally dislike hurting animals and small children more than they like impressing one another socially. People won't deliberately hurt others; they have better things to do. Even torturers and mass murderers generally limit themselves to activities with high stakes, relatively few participants, and clear rules....If you think you're witnessing evil, you probably aren't. What you're seeing looks more like plain old human nature operating below its full capacity. Or worse incompetence working overtime on the job of power over others....Simply put, we can train great fighters, faster cars, smarter computers, stronger steel, tougher skin, longer lifespans, better nutrition, less disease, greater longevity, clearer methods that display a strong opposition to refer to set to refer to independent authorship oppositions, our opponents' largest followers agree to users make them
