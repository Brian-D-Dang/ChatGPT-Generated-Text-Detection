I believe that people have a moral obligation to donate money they do not need. Full stop. But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of forcing other people to give them things just because "it's what you'd do," which has been their justification for every tax and regulation ever enacted over the past century or so, plus any new law passed by Congress since then. Forcing people to pay taxes would be illegal. That does not mean nobody should want it everyone ought to feel entitled if nothing else. But taxing someone inexorably while refusing to provide himher with anything he wishes even though it may be a benefit for others would likely violate some cruel aspect of human nature. I'm pretty sure we can agree on that one.
