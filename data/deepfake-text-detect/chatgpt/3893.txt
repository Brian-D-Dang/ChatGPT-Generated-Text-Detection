I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the refrigeratorfreezer combo I had before. So... should I be happy or sad? Why not get a second freezer? Because i live in town, my parents are paying for this one but they're letting me use it while i'm still living with them.
