I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing from this, so why should he pay higher prices? Surely the price of oil is determined by whether it is in the same shapemodel as the usual coal-fired power plant and if so what kind of gas? If oil gets better then it tends to go down because it makes more money (and consumer spending declines) rather than being profitable. If you're not making money out of that then that's your problem.
