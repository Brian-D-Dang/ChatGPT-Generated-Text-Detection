If movies and video games are subject to regulation and censorship, then books should be too. In many places, especially in western cultures, the censorship of books is looked down upon as a form of oppression or oppression by other means. Books have been banned for years over things such as content that was deemed "obscene" (homophobia), racist remarks (serious race issues) and even childbirth - although this may all seem like it comes from the dark ages compared with what we see today elsewhere around the world! Books can also be censored because they offend certain people in society who don't want them seeing their images, music or pictures pop up on someone else's TV screen for instance...and yet again I would argue that censoring something just because you do not agree with its message seems arbitrary at best; perhaps more so than arbitrarily banning filmsgames based on political correctness? I think one way of addressing these problems is through education and awareness-raising: educating children about the reality behind restrictive policies regarding anything related to sexuality, gender identity etc., whilst encouraging young people to read widely across genres and work together constructively towards removing barriers preventing access to literature regardless of age. Creating opportunities to discuss diversity and tolerance within school settings could help address some of these issues but surely there has got to be an easier, less polarising solution!
