To my knowledge there are no peer reviewed sources that link GMOs to any negative health effects. There is as much reason to believe genes manipulated in a lab are capable of causing the same effect, if not worse, than what we're seeing with crops grown in natural environments. I don't see how you can say GMO's cause harm and then also claim it has nothing to do with open fields that aren't controlled by big ag companies? Maybe I'm missing something...
