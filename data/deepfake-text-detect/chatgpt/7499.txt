While it is true that Bernie Sanders advocates for increased government spending on social programs, it is important to note that his policies also aim to increase revenue through measures like increasing the taxes on the wealthiest Americans and closing tax loopholes for large corporations. Additionally, his economic policies prioritize investing in infrastructure and green technologies, which have the potential to create jobs and boost economic growth in the long run. Furthermore, Sanders-style socialism is not a one-size-fits-all approach and can vary from country to country. For example, Sanders has pointed to successful socialist policies in countries like Denmark and Sweden, which have lower levels of income inequality and higher standards of living than the United States, while still maintaining a thriving capitalist economy. Therefore, simply labeling Sanders' economic policy as a "deal-breaker" overlooks the nuances of his proposals and ignores the potential benefits of investing in social programs and sustainable economic development.
