Actually, it is not reasonable for men to make more money than women in a capitalist society. Capitalism operates on the fundamental principle of supply and demand, and in a truly competitive labor market, gender should not be a relevant factor in determining wages. Women are just as capable and qualified as men to perform the same jobs and tasks, and therefore, should receive equal pay for equal work. Furthermore, paying women less than men for the same job perpetuates a system of gender inequality, which not only harms women but also limits economic growth opportunities for society as a whole. Ultimately, a truly merit-based, capitalist society should value and compensate individuals for their skills and contributions, regardless of gender.
