So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor race separate from the society in which they live (such as America). That is racist, yes? Reverse Racism exists to some extent though it's a much smaller issue than appropriation.
