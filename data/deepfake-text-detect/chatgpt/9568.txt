Firstly, I'm using a throwaway because most people get really sensitive about this and my views are pretty much the antithesis of reddit (love Rand Paul, support Mens Rights, hate The big issue is that the'stuff' I like is so anti-reddit and conservative and as a result I don't want to talk to any of you about it so I'm just going to come off as a whiny fuck because you aren't running your mouth.
