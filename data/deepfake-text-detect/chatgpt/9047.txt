First I think I should make all the clarifications I can. By "true Christian," I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ. Oh no! Think about it for a minute. Just because you don't believe in a god doesn't mean you're not an entirely independent thinker. Maybe be more specific, but this isn't any different from what was said before. If you believe something is true then it's just believing in that God exists and so people are going to accept it anyway. If you believe something is true then it's just believing in that God exists and so people are going to accept it anyway. This sounds like bullshit or maybe it is just my own personal interpretation? I'd say it's either: 1) Examine everything that appears on the internet 2) Receive nothing at all 3) Accept anything beyond what seems possible 4) Be silent, that it's all there
