Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a little bit like its English equivalent when spoken in an over-the top manner (usually by the same people who say things about how much they hate French). 2) It sounds cooler and sexier: I've heard many times that 'k' makes words seem sexy... I don't have any problems with using either form anywhere! If you're writing code or business documents etc., use "Je suis." At homearound friends'voir faire'etc..use je t'aime":) 3.) Uses less syllables; this comes from my personal experience as well - ive been told on occasions not try do pronounce everything word because it's too long but rather shorten them so everybody can understand what im trying talknig abt without having me repeat myself every couple seconds... i find longer sentences harder ot keep track off while listening 3 4th reason down below:P
