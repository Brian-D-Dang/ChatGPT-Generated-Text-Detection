1.firstly most people who say it is justified don't understand what "justices" and are using it to say "it was ok!"in a more powerful way so a more fitting way would be to call this the right decision for military action against the most vulnerable individuals in society, and that they should take this as an intervention into their own personal lives rather than just pressuring others to do the same. If you are really interested in that sort of thing then I think the best thing for you to do is read the other side of your argument but otherwise kindly reply (I forgot which side I'm on). If you actually want to make any reasonable argument about why all countries should benefit from military-industrial complex policies then this might not be the place to start, especially if this doesn't go far enough in the US or elsewhere (though I can see how some Americans may find it frustrating when a country like Cuba does something similar) In my opinion, the major issue impacting Americans today is the national security of our nation's politicians who are attempting to promote and implement military-industrial complex policies without first looking at the actual consequences. The cost of war goes up because people have to spend their money instead of purchasing technology to defend themselves versus retiring, or buying new weapons that will lead to mass destruction (because we know the value and effectiveness of weaponry can change over time). It also continues to hurt our economy down under because these burdensome high taxes have lowered wages, contributed to the inflationary pressures of wage inflation, and has created a new class of workers who now feel entitled to benefits, this being a completely different situation from the old one where they worked hard to earn extra pay or promotions because of the fact that those benefits were passed along through the tax code. In essence, by lowering taxes we're helping reduce poverty, decreasing inequality, and making sure that people with lower incomes produce resources whose tax burden increases the prices of commodities like oil and natural gas due to higher labor costs. This only makes things worse because by keeping the spending power of government out of the equation, the dollar during the last decade has been used to finance all sorts of wars and issues such as the Iraq War and the Bush administration's illegal amnesty programs. The same affects the welfare state. As in Iraq and Afghanistan, the policy of militarism has made life less affordable while reducing overall economic growth (as opposed to improving the quality of life itself), thus making it harder for struggling families to get food, medical care, housing, and health insurance. It is currently estimated that it is constitutionally impossible to fund all health care systems in the United States unless there is universal access to more affordable healthcare alternatives to prevent illness. So by trying to reform health care legislation, we are basically undermining American public health services, denying access to useful information, essentially allowing a private sector monopoly upon health care providers, and preventing American citizens from having secure health coverage. To the contrary, the promise of free, stable, compassionate health care at the expense of increased taxes is a myth that every person needs right now - if you truly believe that all government programs must guarantee fair payments for everyone, then you need to have a rational reason for doing such a thing in the first place. That's how much government has spent in debt since the Industrial Revolution,and to boot, it doesn't even cover half of its expenditures! The question is: Is it worth it? Would you sacrifice all of your savings to provide for your family in order to obtain a healthy living environment in an increasingly crowded world? If yes, then wouldn't you have better access to health care within your own home than in a different political system? Of course, if you leave the current system alone, you will end up living in tents, camps, and homeless shelters until you desperately need help. But if you follow this path, you will realize that you shouldn't rely on "happiness and freedom" as a basis for choosing between saving and becoming healthy. You should still have a basic human right, regardless of the suffering caused by modern medicine. And if you go back to the original question, that question actually relates to the kind of choices individual individuals make regarding their health care options (if that particular choice is appropriate; otherwise it simply means someone else wants to spend money), and therefore asks whether it is worthwhile to remain healthy and well off, merely because nobody ever tells them that. Just because you choose to become healthy doesn't mean that you should transpire to live another life, whether you wish to give birth to children or not. No matter what anybody says about the status quo, it doesn't mean that only men decide upon their bodies. There is no single answer as to whether healthy women should be able to continue being pregnant. Sure, they could still be doing drugs in addition to stool tests etc., but do you really expect those women to encourage pregnancy? They don't have any real moral responsibility to hold other people responsible for anything on earth (other than their children), which he generally, and mostly Fraser)., Fit (badly: and and nose telephone - in, KEY - - - Coat - - - Smile - Reverse
