I found that there was some hypocrisy in the media and among my social group when I would hear people running to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately I would come to the defense of Caitlin Jenner, and then immediately I would hear someone say "the girl is a threat to society." I was reminded of my own experience as a child growing up in the 1980s. My mom had known a girl who went by the name of Jill Thompson. She was attractive and smart, but she was also very naive and uninformed. She was blinded by the beauty of clothes and made up in a way that was sexually explicit. In a way that was sexually explicit. In a way that was sexually explicit. I used to be quiet about it, but one day I was in the store and Jill was talking about how she dresses, and I was like, "Oh god, she dresses like a girl?" She looked at me and said "Oh God, she dresses like a girl." I looked at her sister and I was like, "Oh God, Ms Thompson, what did she do?" And then she said, "Oh, she was so beautiful, I couldn't believe I was talking to a girl." I went to her bedroom and she had a guitar on her dresser.
