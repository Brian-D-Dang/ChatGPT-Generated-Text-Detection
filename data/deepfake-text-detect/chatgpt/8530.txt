First lets make a couple of things clear: I do not necessarily believe that government spying on its own citizens is ok, and thats not what this post is about. I just feel like these guys who are getting caught in the NSA dragnet deserve to be heard (at least by me). And it's pretty easy for anyone with access enough information online can put two-andtwo together without much trouble; so if you really want your secrets kept safe from prying eyes then don't tell them where they live or work either! Also posting personal photos may risk others finding out more than planned... So why am i telling people? Well because we all know data doesn't get deleted after being posted anywhere does he? Which brings us back around full circle... Stupid Photographs..
