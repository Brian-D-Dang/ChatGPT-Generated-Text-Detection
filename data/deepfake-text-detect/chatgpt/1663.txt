Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked, and keep the cook from winning. The whole thing is awful. I also don't get why it's called "Tyson vs. Manolios" when Tyson has nothing to do with this competition..
