Edit: I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll just link them all in the description of my thread so anyone who's interested can check it out. I'd prefer you post your code somewhere like GitHub or StackOverflow - rlearnpython is not really for instructional purposes (or at least its not meant to be) Also why did you switch from Django 2.x?
