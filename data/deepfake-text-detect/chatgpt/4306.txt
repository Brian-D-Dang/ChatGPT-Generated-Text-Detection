Given that livestock consume more water, feed, create more greenhouse gasses, and suffer throughout their lives to eventually be killed, while providing no essential nutrients that cant be attained through other methods. I'd take the meat over the feed any day of the week. Meat is for omnivores too (though not all omnivores are carnivores).
