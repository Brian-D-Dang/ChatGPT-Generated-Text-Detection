CMV: ISIS isn't about the US, it isn't about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isn't about us, and to imply that there is a link between Iraq and 911 is just stupid. The biggest mistake you made in your piece was implying that we have been somehow successful at fighting against this threat we face from Daesh. We haven't. We are losing ground everywhere where our troops get involved. The situation on the streets all over Syria and parts of Afghanistan is far worse than when I left two years ago. This has nothing whatsoever to do with President Trump or his policies (which were fine), but rather it speaks volumes about what our leadership thinks should be done here. We need to bring these people home as soon as possible! Then let them continue their fight on their turf. Do not send tens of thousands more soldiers to risk their lives for no purpose! Bring those suckers back home so they can safely die for their religion. There will always be another bunch who want to kill us in order to make themselves feel like "real men" - one day sooner that they expect. Let them go where they belong - in an Iraqi prison cell for life. For saying otherwise would mean you don't truly believe in freedom enough to allow others to live how they wish. You are a hypocrite and that cannot be tolerated by any reasonable person. So put away your BS comments and say something nice instead. God bless America! But for only half a second before he slams shut your lying tongue. Larry Guckian
