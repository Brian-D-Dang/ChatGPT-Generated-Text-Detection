After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the debate has been about gun control, Democrats have come out to call for the banning of violence using a "super-tactic" like "assault weapons" instead of mass shootings or suburban murders. In our opinion, this kind of extreme-violence rhetoric is just not acceptable. The debates are fought over whether we should consider military action against North Korean terrorists or citizens of North Korea who intend to kill their own people by threatening them with a nuclear war with South Korea. The first few weeks after the 2016 election, when Donald Trump won North Korea over, and during which Kim Jong Un became president, the Muslim American community had a deep sense that normal American values being threatened were on the line. For any democrat, however, it was hard to imagine ever seeing a more divisive issue than North Korea. It was only at this moment that a group from Baltimore joined forces with anti-Trump activists and Democratic politicians to rally around the candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden as his running mate. When you think about it, there's little doubt that this movement is largely driven by anger among Muslims, largely due to Trump's hostile stance towards U.S.-Taliban talks. That's why I am so proud to be working with colleagues in the House and Senate to determine how best to enact new gun laws. These bills would require automatic weapons licensing and background checks, both of which would help counter these threats. And they would allow those who pose serious dangers - including terrorist attacks, as well as other deadly situations like airport bombings - to carry guns without fear of prosecution under the Second Amendment. There is no question that it addresses mental health issues in ways radicalizing or challenging Americans do not. So I look forward to signing such bills soon, but my view is that if elected, Congress will never take up any of the gun legislation passed by the House. But my hope is that we can keep this debate going until we get to a place where Trump and bin Laden would welcome our government to a safe place.
