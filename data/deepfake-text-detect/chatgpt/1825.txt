Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to 15hour. While many would agree that this should be done in order for people to make enough money so they can support their families, some say it's not fair because most employees only work one or two hours a day; working harder than everyone else who works no more than an eight hour shift at McDonalds for 7hr - while also getting paid benefits (including vacation time) and healthcare? This topic has been gaining traction since 2016 when Senator Bernie Sanders had introduced The Raise the Wage Act which called on Congress to raise the federal minimum hourly rate from its current level of 7.25 per hour to a new 10.10 by 2025. On October 3rd 2019, House Democrats passed legislation that raised the national minimum wage from 7.25 an hour to 15 within five years, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he will block any bill providing higher paychecks. Is it really worth it then to have your boss dictate how much you earn instead of yourself deciding what you want out of life? The government certainly doesn't set the wages of all workers anymore: Employers do. And as long as employers are willing to pay their workers above the minimum legal wage - regardless if it's 15 dollars an hour or 20 - why should we care? Who decides whether our minimum wage laws need improvement anyway? The majority of Americans think companies should have to offer fair wages! So let them decide the value of labor and quit trying to tell us there isn't such thing as an overpaid person. In reality, nobody makes 10 times as much as someone else doing basically the same job just because "someone" made significantly more before taxes were taken into account. There aren't even hundreds of thousands of super-wealthy billionaires making twice, three times, four times or more wages compared to regular employees...and yet these people still manage to live comfortably off their dividends. We're fed up with being told what we must do with our lives every single week, month and year. Letting businesses run themselves without interference seems like the best way to go about things. Imagine if we returned to the days where we actually owned property rather than renting land to others through mortgage loans. If something went wrong, private insurance companies emerged as solutions. But guess what happened? Rather than learning lessons from history, corporations turned around and took advantage of those poor decisions resulting in problems later down the line. Not only did banks become insolvent during 2008, countless other industries crashed too after receiving free reign under the previous administration. As President Obama once famously said,"We've got to create jobs." Or words to that effect. But won't business owners simply take away the rights of workers and leave taxpayers paying bills until it's already gone? Well maybe we'll see a different future thanks to social media platforms beginning to ban political advertisements starting January 1st 2020. Due to Facebook banning lies and fake news for fear of election meddling, Google ads, Twitter's verification process for politicians, etcetera, big tech giant YouTube finally banned political adverts altogether effective January 5th 2020 which means the door opens wide open for small businesses, local politicians across America and frankly anyone asking for change. With less scary TV commercials telling us what to believe and where to put our vote, imagine the possibilities America could reach. It may seem hard to get involved right now in spite of everything going on today including wars abroad, mass shootings occurring almost weekly and a lack of compassion amongst Trump supporters nationwide..but keep pushing forward despite anything standing between you and success. Keep living your dreams everyday. You don't deserve to feel hopeless.
