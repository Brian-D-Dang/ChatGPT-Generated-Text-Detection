This CMV post is partly inspired by this rrelationships [post] I came across earlier today. This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had the chance to explain myself in any depth before, so here goes! I am all for romantic relationships between people who are interested in each other but that don't necessarily involve sex or children (or marriage). We can be friends - maybe even best friends; we can share activities with our partners; love them without having some physical thing they call 'love-making'; spend time together just because it makes us happy. But sometimes...sometimes you want someone else around when looking at your partner doesn't do anything for you anymore: that person can still give conversation or help out if needed, make you laugh, talk you through hard times...and heshe will never expect anything more than friendship from you back. If those aren't reasons enough for being able to keep on being friends after losing interest in one another sexually then what are?
