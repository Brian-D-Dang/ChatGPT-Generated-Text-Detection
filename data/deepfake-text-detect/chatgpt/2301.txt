Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, do you think people are so drawn in by the presence of celebrities? There is a reason why many companies pay big bucks for endorsements and would love to have their name mentioned alongside a celebrity's. Celebrities Are Already Featured In Your News Feed: When we use Facebook as our main source of news information (as most social media users tend to), we see posts from friends similar to us sharing links with pictures they like, sometimes accompanied by comments praising them or asking questions about what was shared. So if your friend liked a picture featuring Jennifer Lawrence yesterday afternoon, say at 1 o'clock while you were sitting down on this Friday morning looking through your latest Twitter feed update notifications - wouldn't you click over there just out curiosity because she's "famous" now too?! Well guess again! We all fall into this trap where we see something funnyinteresting enough to share but not important enough to actually go visit another website when we can easily get the story right here! And let me tell ya, doesn't every one else seem slightly less crazy after seeing her post compared to how YOU normally act around random strangers?! They Can Infuse Their Personality Into The Product Or Idea More Easily Than You Yourself Could: If you ask anyone trying to buy organic food whether things taste better than regular fruits veggies did before, chances are pretty high they'll probably give some sort of sarcastic answer along those lines. Some might even agree, especially if you're buying apples instead of bananas becuase apple trees don't really produce much waste unlike banana plantations. But my point still stands; Most products today aren't exactly relatable compared to what real humans experience due to the overabundance of chemicals used during production processes such as processing foods, making clothes or whatever other thing comes across mind first immediately upon reading this article right now.. Celebrities however represent everyday life experiences people relate to off-screen which makes it easier to come up with ideas based on these topics rather quickly since everything related to it will be top of mind instantly via suggestion algorithms working behind the scenes allowing any creative person to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena...and boom goes the dynamite. That being said though, try harder next time!! It also helps if you've experienced things like traveling abroad or lived outside your home country thus increasing contact frequency with different personalities, cultures and lifestyles - giving yourself plenty of material to work with whenever inspiration strikes!
