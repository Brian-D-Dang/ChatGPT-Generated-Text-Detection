There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man wearing shorts? The law requires that the laws be enforced) but you could easily justify doing this by pointing out how consensual sex cannot happen without consenting adults knowing exactly what happens to people who do something like this. What other words can you think of?
