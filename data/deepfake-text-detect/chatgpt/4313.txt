People seem to feel right now that Sanders is just not well-known enough to even have a chance at the presidency, and that it will stay that way. Everyone has been debating this for decades with no successful solution (the fact that there are people who still think Lester Holt's question was "very unkind" about Obama says a lot). There aren't any obvious reasons for why things would change but rather some weird psychological thing going on in our brains which doesn't make sense to us anyway. The funny part of all this is that so many Hillary supporters spent years saying how much they loved Obama because he was such a big name. Now we're seeing what happens when you love someone too long...
