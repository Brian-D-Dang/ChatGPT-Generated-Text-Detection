IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say "preposterous" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more people? I think the word is meant for characters who don't seem like 'themselves' in particular cases - though not always a bad thing (as we see from Ollivander). Having said that I absolutely agree with your point!
