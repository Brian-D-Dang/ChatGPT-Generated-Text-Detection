Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich or poor. It sounds perfect however, the problem arises when you consider that human nature isn't necessarily like this - which leads to a few issues: 1) The leaders of these systems always tend towards corruption due to power over others (see the Soviets their 'hierarchy, as they try to keep themselves on top for longer than needed before stepping downbeing removed from position by someone else; also leading into... 2) There will come a point when one person won't be able handle all the responsibility alone therefore creating more inequality within society caused by incompetence rather than greed, otherwise known as officials being corrupt because it benefits them financially through bribes etc., not only does this cause problems with people losing faith in government but can lead to civil unrest if done wrong. 3) Human beings aren't equal mentally nor physically so how do we decide who should receive what? 4) If humans weren't meant to work together then why were natural resources created specifically for us to use such as food crops, trees etc.? We need each other just like plants and animals rely upon Nature! 5) What about those individuals whose passions don't fit under any particular category eg artist (s)? 6) How exactly was God going to reward good behaviour?? Surely he couldn't have said 'good job mate'?! That's hardly praise worthy material.
