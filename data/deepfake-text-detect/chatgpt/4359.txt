Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of interplay. And while no one would have specifically written about this in the context of DC comics, the reader also gets an impression that they are reading a book called "The Secret History of Comics" or something like that for much the same reasons. This sounds really cool! Would you mind sharing more?
