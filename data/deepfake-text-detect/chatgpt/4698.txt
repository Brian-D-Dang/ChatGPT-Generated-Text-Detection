Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for men that seems to be popular amongst feminists today (women who are supposed to have 'the vagina' obviously don't care about men). But on another forum I asked "Why do so many feminist hate men?" I got an answer from a guy in his late twenties one night as we were getting ready to go out drinking. He said something along these lines: 1) Because they're pigs 2) They rape too 3) There should be no relationship between women and men 4) Men act with complete disregard towards everyone but themselves 5) Everyone wants to kill them 6) Women treat them poorly 7) It makes sense when you think of it 8) It would make things more equal if there weren't any males 9) Nature made them this way because she hates us 10) All men want sex 11) We deserve it 12) Don't give up your dream girls 13) You might find someone else 14) Keep turning me down 15) Yes 16) No 17) Sometimes 18)...etc.. And he even signed off by saying sorry for being such a pig. After my initial shock at hearing his comments, i started laughing hysterically thinking how absurd everything sounded. This gave me some insight into why some people may sound stupid or offensive even though they aren't necessarily saying that.... So now, while posting here, I'm wondering what other peoples thoughts are? Are these points valid ones? Have I misunderstood him through sarcasm? Or perhaps he really does believe them fully? What percentage of men actually fall under these categories? Has anyone heard anything similar before? Any input will help! Thankyou! [Added] So far in talking to others, most seem to agree with him except for point 3-8. One person argued that he could not know whether or not those claims were true since there's always exceptions. Another added there must be exceptions because otherwise, men wouldn't exist. [Edited again] And finally I found this youtube video where he talks about the same things. The first few minutes are just very well spoken, the last 50 seconds however reveal a man so full of himself, and self loathing in regards to the fact that guys even exist. For example:"why would anybody ever say yes?." Also"it can happen sometimes." That he thinks women control their own fate better than men is pretty telling imo [Ended up going somewhere different] Thanks so much for readingresponding! Much love:) Chloe xx P.S. Slightly offtopic question...if one is a lesbian, does it matterhave any effect on her viewsbeliefs etc? If not then does it affect her chances of finding love in life? Hey girlie, welcome to RPF. As a Lesbian myself, I'd like to offer a little advice that isn't politically correct, lol. First of all, the majority of lesbians tend to gravitate toward the Feminists movement - due primarily to common interests. However, I've been around enough Lesbians over time to notice trends within their ideology and general demeanor. Some Lesbians simply don't speak openly about their sexuality until after marriage, especially if they come from conservative households (lesbianism wasn't even considered acceptable among certain families back home), or those from countries where homosexuality remains illegal. Second, THIS IS NOT A CULTURE WAR WHERE YOU HAVE TO GET IN LINE WITH WHAT THE MOST POPULAR SEXUALITY FORMS LOOK LIKE OR WANT. Thirdly, as long as you are happy sharing yourself with whomever, respect whatever form of sexuality other females choose to adopt. Fourth, being bisexual only means your sexually attracted to both sexes equally. Not every woman and every man is bi sexual. Fifth, if a female comes across as negative, disinterested, preoccupied with male attention, suspicious and jealous of female friendships, fearful of intimacy and incapable of sustaining emotional bonds with other human beings, you probably just haven't met the right individual yet. Sixth, don't let anyone tell you what you CANNOT DO. Seventh, if you identify as Femme, and realize you still desire the company of Males - give a shot at dating and see what happens. Eighth, open mindedness is key. Give whoever you date the opportunity to prove themselves worthy of your trust. Ninth, don't take your partner's preferences personally. It's hard work saving the world, doing chores, having kids, working jobs, fixing cars, paying bills, shopping for groceries..... Think about your priorities. Lastly, remember that nobody fails overnight......only gradually. Just feel free to ask questions anytime and hopefully some lovely ladies will provide answers:D Happy rping (22-01-2012 05:17 AM) PolitikWaste Wrote: Hey girlie, welcome to RPF.
