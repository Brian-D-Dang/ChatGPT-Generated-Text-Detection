I'm a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find sillytrivial. I'm currently dating a girl who is a hardcore feminist, which is actually really great because she's always challenging my views on certain issues (in both directions). silly trivial "embarrassingly ugly" to you?
