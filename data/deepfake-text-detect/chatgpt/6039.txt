Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between the poor and the rich. It's a great idea in theory and, as long as we're not talking about every single person on the planet, it could be a decent way to go about governing a nation. However, in the real world, there are many problems that could arise if we were to implement such a system, and let's face it, they've already arisen. There are many problems that have arisen from Socialism and Communism, both past and present, that proves that this is not a practical way to run a country. The most obvious example of how Socialism and Communism don't work in the real world is the Soviet Union, and how they turned into a dictatorship, eventually forcing it to collapse. By giving total control of the government to the working class, it can lead to it becoming a totalitarian state, where people are forced to do things that they wouldn't normally do. In other words, it's a bad idea to let people who know nothing about politics run the country. Another problem that comes with a Socialist government is the lack of incentive for people to work. The average Socialist will be happy to work, but for the vast majority of people, an incentive to work is required. The fact is that a lot of people in the world are not motivated by simply being given a basic level of living standard. People like to be able to earn more, and that's why capitalism works so well. Without people being given the chance to own property or businesses, they can't be motivated to improve their own lives. It's the idea of working hard to improve your lot in life that makes Capitalism so popular, and in a world where everyone is equal, there's no incentive for people to do so. Economic inequality can also be a problem, with rich and poor being very divided. This can lead to the rich being able to exploit the poor, who are the ones who will have to carry out the work, while the rich can sit back and not do anything. This was the case in Communist countries, where the wealthy elite would work the poor, while they themselves sat around on their big chairs, smoking cigars and drinking fine wine. One problem that is extremely important is that of overpopulation. This is a problem that is occurring around the world, and it's a problem that has been going on for many years. In a country like China, the government could very easily prevent this problem, by ensuring that people have very limited families, and the birth rate is controlled. However, this is something that the Socialist government is unable to do, because they rely on having a large population to help support the state. As we've seen, Socialism and Communism can create many problems, and this is why it isn't a viable option for a country to run. This is why in the 21st century, a Socialist country like China has been slowly moving away from Socialism, and towards a more Capitalist state. While Communism may be a good idea, and one that can potentially work, it is something that is unrealistic to expect to happen any time soon. As long as people are corrupt, and greedy, it's something that will never happen, as they will never allow it to happen. The fact is that Socialism and Communism are ideas that are good in theory, but they are unrealistic for a country to run. In the real world, they can't be implemented properly, and are plagued by the issues that I've talked about. There are many other problems that I haven't talked about, and these are just some of the issues that can arise from a Socialist or Communist country. In conclusion, Socialism and Communism can be a good thing in theory, but the reality of the situation is that it can't be implemented properly in the real world.
