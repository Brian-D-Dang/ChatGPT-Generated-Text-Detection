I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the "safe space" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao herself. Is it just a symptom of the usual Reddit bigotry (again) or more sinister? For those who haven't heard about this and aren't familiar with reddit: basically you can post anything there without censorship; people vote on what they like and dislike. It has very little moderation so much stuff gets posted that might be offensive in some other contexts. There are two kinds of users - power users who control their own votes by applying tags, for example "funny," and ordinary redditors. Ordinary redditors would say something that is fun as comedy while the power-users will take it at face value, thus including potentially obscene material among all sorts of things. This means that ordinary redditors can easily get banned if their comments stray outside the set range allowed by moderators, which was always a point of contention between moderators and userbase. There were also mod issues (although many mods insisted they weren't), such as problems after the departure of Alexis Ohanian when he took over as COOfounder of Reddit Inc., a company whose shareholders include Visa and Conde Nast. The board was claiming various conflicts of interest and looking into whether Victoria Taylor should still remain head moderator, given her position within the family business AVG Technologies (a sponsor). The decision to make Ellen Pao executive chair gave rise to further concern, since she'd previously made well known statements expressing feminist views. As far as I know, nothing came out of these allegations except accusations against the board made by several members who then resigned in protest. At least one former employee claimed revenge discrimination had taken place. There were also numerous complaints about intimidation directed at whistle blowers inside and outside Reddit Inc., though again no evidence appeared. Ultimately the board voted to fire Pao rather than reinstate her, but that turned into another battle where workers demanded arbitration instead and got fired anyway because Amazon doesn't allow this either. So now we've got the newCEO running things, supposedly taking advice from experienced employees before making big decisions, and meanwhile back at reddit everything seems great apart from the occasional harassment campaign against women. Still, even if most people don't care it must feel good to score points politically. But this kind of thing could come back to bite them; having only yourself to blame while everyone else smirks isn't the best way to keep your job, especially when you're dragged through the mud during an election season and end up losing office despite having won the popular vote. The blog posting mentioned above says: As I wrote here earlier today, yesterday's announcement makes clear that our community management team will continue to work closely with each subreddit, ensuring its content aligns clearly with Reddit's mission of "Anything That Should Be Discussed." We do expect moderation activity to increase as subreddits grow larger overall and as threads accumulate high numbers of comments. In order to ensure community managers can focus on helping individual communities thrive, we plan to reduce staffing levels across the entire organization in 2015 in coming months. So how did the first day go? Did they reach their goals? Was anything done besides cutting staff? Were there major changes in mind? What happened? Has anyone seen any original source documents? Maybe someone can show me a transcript of the internal meeting where Pao laid out the ideas discussed and acceptedrejected? They can send it via email or snail mail, whichever works fastest. The more info available the easier it'll be for us citizens to evaluate this situation critically, identify the biases behind it and decide accordingly. I wouldn't want to see the same mistakes repeated anymore. By trying to hide information right away the admins seem intent on preserving the status quo, assuming everyone is afraid to speak out now because they think things may change once summer hits and the presidential election takes place. If you believe recent events prove otherwise though, please let us know! Too often spreadsheets and graphs replace thoughtful discussion around important topics, leading to premature conclusions based on bias, ignorance, tribalism and fear. Being mindful of that this time around is crucial. Update 1: Some links: Pao on 'Transparency' reveals why employment law is different, and the bad side effects for Google One person died due to lack of medical treatment during the protests held last year and 3 others suffered serious injuries. Many protesters became ill due to poor ventilation and water shortages. About 70 of participants reported feeling exhausted prior to holding signs - 13 said they felt physically sick. On the 6th anniversary of World AIDS Day, we pay tribute to loss families... and hope to prevent future deaths. Protests become violent. More die. And BlackLivesMatter activists try to move forward. We went too early, too soon, and handled ourselves poorly. All hands on deck. No excuses. To learn from these errors. White text. U.
