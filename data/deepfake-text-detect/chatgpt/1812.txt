Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between the wealthy elite of one country or another. But capitalism has been shown to be successful as well; it's given us a high standard of living for generations now, not only thanks to private enterprise but also from government support. Many people still believe that socialism can never work because they don't understand what kind of ideology communism really was under Marx and Lenin: totalitarian control over all aspects of life through state-run businesses including factories, banks and even schools (yes you read this right!). Instead of having free markets like we have today, these states operated with strict rules on how production should take place so workers could use their time properly while being paid the least amount possible per hour worked. This led to forced labor such as child labor which was outlawed by the Geneva Convention during World War II. In addition, any individual who thought differently than the ruling class were strictly punished such as censured books, newspapers, radio shows etc. The reason why communist regimes failed is simply because anyone at those times had nothing to lose when obeying orders. People became little robots just waiting around doing whatever their rulers wanted them to do without question. That changed once the Soviet Union collapsed due to economic isolation following WWII; instead of countries coming together for mutual benefit and prosperity, some nations came at each other with full force after realizing they were getting left behind economically. For example, South Korea fell victim to every single thing North Korea did almost immediately once reunification occurred; many Koreans view this war crime against humanity as completely justified since North Korean soldiers killed citizens daily before fleeing south into China. These wars continue to this day albeit more covertly, especially within the United States itself where radical Islamic terrorist groups roam freely causing public fear rather than a targeted effort put forth towards eliminating terrorism. Another big problem with socialism is that it tends toward authoritarian rule which is not always seen as good if we're honest about our history. You see it with dictatorships throughout history who routinely murder political dissidents and opponents using things like firing squads and gulags. Another major issue occurs concerning corporations choosing profits above all else; most modern socialist governments recognize that business cannot survive long lasting relationships based off of pure altruistic values alone. Socialism creates short term gains for the masses through government mandated policies aimed towards raising quality of life for all but loses longer term goals to appease special interests driving demand for certain itemsservices for profit. A valid argument can certainly be made that none of these issues exist currently due to capitalist ideals which have also allowed for technological advancements and innovations unlike anything ever imagined even 20 years ago! Rather than trying to go back centuries again to justify failure though, I'd argue that the best solution is to look ahead to achieve future success rather than focusing solely on past failures.
