First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and I am also largely opposed to the private prison-industrial complex. I think that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that the actual sentences are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes) and that the sentences are inhumane (re: the drug war and victimless crimes).
