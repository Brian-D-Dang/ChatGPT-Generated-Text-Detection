To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going for gay ones. I don't think it's right or fair to force people who choose not to marry to make excuses for everyone else. I agree with your whole post, but would like to add one thing: but I do believe there is a correlation between illegal immigration and violent crime. No, there isn't.
