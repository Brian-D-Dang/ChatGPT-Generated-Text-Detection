First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from some sort of resentment towards menthe male gender in general (which isn't necessarily bad). So my question might come out as a bit sensitive or even offensive but... are there any women who feel exactly the same way about these sorts of things? I think you're going to find that the majority of people here have no such feelings at all; we just enjoy our revenge fantasies over getting reasonable things back when stupid shit happens. The whole "men hate us" thing probably stems more from rants by crazy tumblr girls than anything else.
