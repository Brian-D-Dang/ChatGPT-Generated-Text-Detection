Given that livestock consume more water, feed, create more greenhouse gasses, and suffer throughout their lives to eventually be killed, while providing no essential nutrients that cant be attained through a vegan's diet. If you think about it though the whole point of eating meat is not for sustenance but enjoyment so why would vegans care about what other people eat as long as they are happy? Every single animal on this planet eats animals in nature yet we somehow have enough self awareness (much like omnis) to know killing an innocent sentient being isn't right even if it tastes good...
