Posting on my secondary for obvious reasons I grew up in a extremely abusive house. I dreaded coming home and the site of my mom made my heart skip a beat. I would hide in my room and try to make myself invisible. I was always afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing and being punished for it. It was a constant feeling of loneliness and despair. As I got older, things didn't get much better. I felt trapped in this cycle of abuse and couldn't see a way out. But eventually, I realized that I couldn't keep living like this. I began to seek help from friends and professionals. It was a difficult journey, but with the support of those around me, I was able to leave the toxic environment and start rebuilding my life. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. Today, I am in a much better place and surrounded by people who love and support me. To anyone out there who may be going through something similar, know that you are not alone. There is help available and you deserve to live a life free from abuse. Don't be afraid to reach out for support and take the necessary steps to create a better future for yourself.
