Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women running for political office, it always seems as though there is this implicit assumption that men and woman are different in some way, which if you take a look at the actual numbers isn't really true at all (excepting transgender issues). So what's going on? Are we just perpetuating inequality with our own rhetoric now too? Or do they mean something else when saying "women"?
