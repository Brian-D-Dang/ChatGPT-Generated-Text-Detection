First lets make a couple of things clear: I do not necessarily believe that government spying on its own citizens is ok, and thats not what this post is about. The Post quoted the article as stating that "the FBI has determined that there was probable cause to believe that the FBI had engaged in surveillance activities which were unlawful." The FBI will likely have to determine if it acted lawfully since the FBI did so without warrant for reasons unrelated to FBI's assessment whether they violated federal statutes or any other statutory provisions involving surveillance warrants. But from the Post story, it appears that the release of data collected would violate the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches seizures. What does the article say? This from the Post: "It's unclear how many people were targeted by federal agents between January 2010 and June 2012," said Robert Alford, an attorney at Manhattan law firm Kingsoft and partner at Andrew M. Walker LLP who specializes in criminal defense practice, the Post reported Thursday morning. "We can only guess because the FBI asked questions about the surveillance program prior to its completion during the investigation into the case. A July 2012 report by the Justice Department inspector general indicated that four individuals interviewed after the Feb. 12 raid revealed that federal officials raided offices belonging to the FBI, including Attorney General Eric Holder Jr., FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein; they told FBI agent Michael Horowitz they believed the Americans were contacting them via social media networks like Twitter. They also admitted that agents searched their homes while they visited the homes of their friends' families." Maybe the FBI should be allowed to wiretap everyone inside the U.S., but they need proof ASAP before that happens. Otherwise, they could be accused of violating their oath of office with this kind of power grab.
