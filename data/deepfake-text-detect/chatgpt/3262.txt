It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be protected from habitat destruction, poaching, and other threats in the wild. Zoos can also educate the public about these animals and the importance of conserving their habitats. However, it is important for zoos to prioritize the welfare of the animals in their care and provide them with suitable living conditions and enrichment activities to keep them mentally and physically healthy. Strong regulations and oversight are necessary to ensure this. Ultimately, the ethical justification of zoos depends on their ability to balance the benefits to the animals with their welfare and to contribute meaningfully to conservation efforts.
