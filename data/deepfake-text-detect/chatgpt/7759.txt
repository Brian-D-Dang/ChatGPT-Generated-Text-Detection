It is unfair to generalize and assume that everyone who chooses not to eat meat does not care about morality. Many people make a conscious decision to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet due to moral and ethical concerns, such as animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and personal health. For some people, the decision to give up meat may be a difficult and deeply personal one, driven by a strong ethical commitment. Therefore, it is not accurate or helpful to dismiss those who abstain from meat consumption as being indifferent to moral issues.
