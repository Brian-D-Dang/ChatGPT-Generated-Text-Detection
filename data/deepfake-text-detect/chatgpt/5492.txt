I just watched The Imitation Game (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it.... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were no sequels of this movie either... That is what everyone lists above. A lot of people don't know about it because it doesn't happen in the movies anymore mostly because they think that's all you need to watch in order to enjoy it.....but when it does occur it really hits home for me
