Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make it seem like that's the only reason why someone doesn't go but there are so many other reasons for not going. While your comment is interesting, by no means should be downvoted because this subreddit does let you discuss politics without being mocked or insulted. The premise behind rpolitics is to not care what another political party thinks (or their candidates), just have an informed discussion of policy and issues in a nonpartisan way. And it seems like that statement was met with some hostility here.
