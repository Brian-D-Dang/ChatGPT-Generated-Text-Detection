View changed by a combination of the comments of uceleritas365 and uQwerkss: I guess we all understand numbers differently, but ultimately I think it really is lack of empathy more than anything. It's hard to empathize with someone who doesn't get you at least in one way or another. So if your therapist isn't getting those things across then that might be something else entirely for them.
