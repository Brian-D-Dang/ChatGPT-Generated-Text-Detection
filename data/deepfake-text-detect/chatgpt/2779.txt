Snowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned. Snowden did not release anything about U.S. nuclear weapons program, nor did he reveal any tool or technique used by NSA in its surveillance activities or procedures for protecting those tools and techniques." I think there's some confusion here as to what "classified" means (and this goes back all the way to Washington crossing the Delaware). The term was originally meant to indicate documents so secret they could only be viewed with immediate oversight - basically every half-remembered memo from 1930s as well as every single report on atomic research since 1938. This changed in 1941 when FDR issued Executive Order 9200 [URL2] (PDF) which governed classification levels; you can read the full text online: URL0. It has nothing at all to do with whether something is public knowledge or not. In fact, under EO9200, literally everything was considered top level even if it wasn't supposed to have been seen at all... and that includes previously unclassified items like newspapers clippings! So basically, what the government considers classified gets redefined constantly, usually according to their convenience rather than necessity. I would say that Edward Snowden's actions fall squarely within allowable bounds set out in his leaks via declassification policy. He had no need to lie because many of these things were already publicly available anyway... except now we know more details. If anything he got an important thing done: the whole world knows America spies on everyone all day long.
