While it is true that victim-blaming is not productive and can often lead to further harm for survivors, it is important to note that emphasizing the responsibility of perpetrators is crucial in preventing rape. The focus should be on educating potential perpetrators about the importance of consent and teaching them to respect boundaries rather than placing the burden solely on potential victims to protect themselves. We should strive to create a culture where everyone understands and respects each other's boundaries, rather than creating a blame culture that is harmful to survivors. Furthermore, there are many helpful resources and tactics that can be shared without blaming victims, such as teaching active bystander intervention and creating a culture of consent. Therefore, it is possible to prevent rape without engaging in victim-blaming behavior.
