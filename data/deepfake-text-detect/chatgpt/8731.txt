So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor other physical characteristics such as race, creed or national origin in any way that the federal government or state governments do." I would think if they were able to discriminate against them...it could be a good idea for some people to take up residence there? It's probably better than those elites who simply live here illegally (I don't know anyone from northern Europe). It also seems like an increasing number of immigrants will get citizenship when their children grow up, so even if it takes years for them to settle somewhere else, they're going to still have natural rights. Those are points of contention though, and many conservative Republicans oppose immigration reform at the moment.
