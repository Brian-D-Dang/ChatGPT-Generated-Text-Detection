Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same. His views on immigration would not only alienate a majority of the country, it would alienate a majority of his own party. To be honest, I'm not sure which would be worse. Donald Trump will not become President of the United States. I have also been very impressed with Elizabeth Warren, the democratic senator from Massachusetts. Her opponent is Scott Brown, the former senator who gave President Obama his "filibuster proof" majority in 2010. Brown's defeat would be a huge victory for the democratic party. Lately, my focus has been shifting towards President Obama. I am not convinced that he is doing enough to get America back on track. Many Americans have suffered in the last six years. The country is in a deep hole, and it will take time to get out of it. But I am not seeing enough effort from our President. On the other hand, I am seeing a lot of effort from some candidates on the republican side. They are running a very negative campaign. It's not just the candidates themselves, but also the surrogates. The republican party is clearly getting its message out to the American people. They are putting together ads that are very effective. This is no surprise. I think this is a huge problem. I think it has to stop. Americans are tired of negative campaigning. They are tired of hearing about negative ads. Americans are tired of hearing about candidates who are attacking their opponents. Americans are tired of a party that will not stand up for what is right. They are tired of a party that will not stand up for America. We need a party that will stand up for what is right. We need a party that will stand up for America. We need a party that will stand up for the American people. We need a party that will stand up for change.
