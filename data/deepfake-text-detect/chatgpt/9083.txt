When I see debate about'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about'evidence'. If they shift on these things then the debate fails. But if they don't they're just going for the'results'. No one ever says that social science is bad science. Why should we? It's a bunch of bullshit. The problem with your mental health-of course you have it in for yourself. But when you actually talk about it why you would think that you need medical attention or treatment? I'm not convinced by any of your arguments. Look at this graph from 2011: How many times do you hear someone say 'humanity can only fight for itself' and think that they are wrong? This one is pretty much every single decade since human civilization has ended, but it still hasn't stopped fighting for us all along. Greece will never be able to survive without help. Let them live their life as if there were no future. In fact Greece was once considered a country where tourism could flourish, not some kind of tourist paradise. People weren't scared away because of a few decades of poormanagement without support from foreign investors. There are many reasons why tourists left - economic factors for the economic reforms triggered by the austerity measures and the lack of financial incentives to avoid leaving, political instability caused by the austerity measures, and the resulting unemployment. In contrast, Greece doesn't even have a real economy. As an example, almost 50 of GDP come from exports which has led to soaring unemployment (and thus migration). What do you mean when you say 'the world can only fight against itself'? The Universe can always fight against itself. It's right up its alley. Or maybe it's too late. Either way, unless something changes, our collective inability to find solutions does nothing to stop it from happening. A lot of the talk about what we can control "against" each other seems silly. For 1 billion years, animals have evolved together for one purpose. They have been domesticated in the sun and warmed over thousands of thousand year periods, and over millions of generations, millions more have gone wild and moved out into the open. When you mention a recent harvest, you mention the same thing about humans as well. Humans have been around in nature for hundreds of millions of years and thousands of millennia...but after that very long time of evolution, they've been hunted down, destroyed, and replaced by others. No longer have mammals been used in the effort to evolve animals, so we naturally see humans being used in hunt and destruction efforts against each other within the evolutionary history. We know how species get killed off through hunting and destruction and after that they are left alone. And of course we know how animals become extinct due to hunger, disease, pollution etc. Genetically, we already have so many forms of food, water, and resources available that humans will happily feed anyone who wants to go for a snack amongst themselves. Animal agriculture is not simply a tool for animal exploitation. It is vital to end the conflicts between humanity and another species and take advantage of the natural patterns of conservation that have allowed the survival and reproduction of species along side humankind in recent past. An industrialized society might also well be designed around the needs of the population, the naturalistic instinct of the majority of its inhabitants. So yes, modern agricultural systems do exist, but only in an industrialized state, working alongside the common consumer products sector. Understanding these major ecological problems may now help create better economic systems that promote sustainable development. Yes, that's exactly what I said elsewhere. That's the main reason why human culture has suffered under capitalism. We haven't adapted to it yet. The thing that makes us happy is that we identify ourselves with it. Which means that we usually enjoy everything we see and feel in the media and in the news. And yes, we share with our children the most important aspect of our lives; love. Who gives a shit whether or not we're gay? A healthy relationship takes time. You shouldn't be dependent on what happens in the news for your happiness. It's obviously not worth the extra money or time you save "for pleasure."
