It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing I am not sure if there are enough figures in this world of ours who take seriously China's influence on the world stage or just ignore it altogether (I'm sorry, but what happened in America after World War II, did not really matter anymore). China has always been an important factor for US trade policy and should be seen only as an instrument of American interests. But, even more so now, European countries have being able to leverage tariffs from the EU to do their bidding without having to pay hefty taxes, and at any rate, the price of US products gets much lower than other industries. And, India is getting cheaper, which will help add pressure on China's export market which already includes Chinese goods such as mattresses and electronics. As you can see, at some point, these companies will focus on growing their sales abroad rather than making profits here.
