What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy is being challenged, not about the validity of the idea itself. To determine whether an idea is true or false, it must be tested by objective standards such as facts, data and scientific methods. If an idea fails to meet these criteria, then it can be dismissed regardless of political considerations.
