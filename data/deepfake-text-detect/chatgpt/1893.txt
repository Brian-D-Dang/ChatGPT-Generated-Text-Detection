When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether people feel that their behaviour will be monitored and reported or not has no effect on how likely drivers are to abide by traffic rules," says Professor Srinivasan Ramani from Lund University in Sweden, who conducted this study together with colleagues at Ruhr-Universitat Bochum (RUB). Researchers believe quantitative analysis can help identify effective ways for law enforcement authorities to reduce speeding behaviours without affecting other objectives such as public complaints about excessive surveillance. The results have been published recently in Traffic Science Practice. "Our findings indicate a need for better research into why certain methods work when used explicitly against speeding behaviors instead of other types of driving violations" adds Prof Ramani. This is one step towards helping governments develop optimal strategies for enforcing motorist behavior - particularly since most countries allow some degree of driver discretion over whether laws should apply equally to everyone."
