One could argue that killing baby cows for food is actually more immoral than killing adult cows. This is because baby cows are often taken away from their mothers shortly after birth, causing immense distress for both the mother and the calf. Additionally, baby cows may not have had the chance to fully experience and enjoy their lives, as opposed to adult cows who have had more time to roam free and graze in pastures. Therefore, killing a baby cow for food is not only taking away a life, but also robbing them of what little time they were able to spend on this earth.
