I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community, but it's my job as an artist and someone who has been in love many times before with both men and women (and other genders) is simply present them for what they are: tools used by God toward our salvation. This may be jarring or shocking at first glance because we read about Jesus being gay all over the internet and media these days... But remember how confusing things were when you actually believed? As much as Christians want to pretend otherwise - We only know so little! And don't get me wrong; there isn't anything inherently evil within same-sex relationships per se - It just doesn't work according to God's plan which was defined thousands upon thousands years ago through His Word. This is why God made marriage between one man and one woman. For Adam Eve to have children on earth while simultaneously serving Him here to save humanity forevermore. A piece of paper cannot do any of those things without compromising its essence into something else entirely different than intended. Same goes for every single relationship out there though heterosexuality seems more apparent since churches encourage us to marry and reproduce after their own traditions-not necessarily God's will. Though this article won't focus too heavily on the fact that homosexuality is often rooted far deeper psychologically due to abusetrauma in early life etc., I think most should agree that no matter your personal feelings towards anyone homosexual or straight, we must seek wisdom above everything instead of allowing our emotions dictate our actions regarding such issues. Even if a person IS truly born "gay," ultimately hisher choice whether he wants to pursue sinful pleasures against nature remains up to him alone. He can either live eternally separated from God outside Heaven or choose repentance and enter eternal fellowship with YHWH throughout eternity inside heaven. The decision lies solely upon him. As human beings created in the image of Almighty GOD - we each hold free agency. Therefore, no amount of emotional manipulation or ultimatums ever change ones heart unless said individual chooses Christ himself. Not even death itself could separate people from God once they commit themselves fully unto Him. So yes, homosexuals will die physically someday. However, spiritually speaking, everyone dies everyday regardless if you follow god or serve satan. There really is nothing left to lose whatsoever except your soul. If you claim to believe in Yahshua Ha Maschiach yet still wish to embrace sin then go ahead. Just make sure Satan knows where to find you. Otherwise, act responsibly instead of ignorantly judging others based off of your limited knowledge base concerning biblical truth. You might learn something incredible along the way..
