To pull an example of a single thread forum off the web: [here] . The only situation where single threads might be good is where a fixed group is involved, but any other case I'd argue that it's better to just have one big (multithreaded) loop. One thing though - if you are dealing with user input in your code then using separate threads for this can cause problems as they cannot access each others data structures simultaneously which could lead to some unexpected results!
