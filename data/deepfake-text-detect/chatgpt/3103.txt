Hi Reddit. With all the news over the past couple weeks regarding Caitlyn Jenner's transition and coming out, I feel now is a good time to discuss gender's role in our society today. There are 2 genders: Male and Female There may be more than 2 depending on who you ask, but there are only two sexes; male or female Everything else falls under that category Gender Sex Gender can change from your sex, but does not define it Many people think of themselves as transgendered but aren't actually transgender Transsexuality isn't real either Gender roles stop at "woman" in terms of being feminine or masculine It doesn't matter if men do something traditionally considered feminine women will never get anything close to equal positive attention for doing those same things The reason we say, "Women make 77 cents for every dollar man makes," or why many people don't like affirmative action because they want equality without actually having any responsibility to go along with their birth sex Women still have to worry about pregnancy when taking hormones Testosterone has shown to greatly decrease chances of developing breast cancer Men shave their bodies (trimming eyebrows) where as woman pluck theirs They use products designed specifically for them even though these items contain chemicals that are bad for everyone Transgender people should just learn to accept what they were born into We need to teach young boys that playing house is inappropriate Behavior such as this contributes to rape culture yesallwomen
