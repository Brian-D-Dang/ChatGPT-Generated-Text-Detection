I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. You see, they had a hot coffee that spilled on her lap and burned her skin. She filed suit against them for damages because she said their coffee was too hot. The jury found that this wasn't the case at all, but they awarded an outlandish amount to dole out to her as compensation...because you can sue anyone if things go bad for you! In addition, there were no signs posted anywhere warning customers about how hot the coffee was. It is possible that she sat down without realizing just what kind of heat this would cause (or thought she could handle it), so it is not entirely reasonable to put such responsibility on McDonlads. It was a freak accident caused by a negligent employee, which means it was completely unexpected, and therefore caused damage due to negligence. Negligence isn't always easy to prove though, especially when dealing with something like "hot" vs. "cool." Another problem with McDonalds being liable here is that they were already paying close attention to the temperature levels of their drinks: 1) They actually have anti-spill technology installed into most of their drink dispensers 2) Coffee also has a certain tolerance level for the pressure from its container 3) Most people who are ordering coffee know these facts 4) People who want extra hot coffee generally order it while standing near the actual machine 5) There were NO SIGNS POSTED 6) Women who sit at tables don't tend to wear pants with pockets 7) Starbucks offers free refills 8) You only get one cup per purchase 9) For those reasons, they should be able to give someone two lukewarm cups of coffee instead of two ice cold ones 10) If you're going to make your own drink anyway, why shouldn't you have the option? 11) A sign wouldn't help 12) Those terms aren't even mentioned in the law 13) Most people sitting around eating at fast food restaurants will spill something eventually 14) Even my wife spills stuff 15) Some people simply take longer than others 16) Again, there were NO SIGNS POSTED 17) Menstrual cycles vary greatly 18) An oven mitt doesn't count 19) Maybe somebody else didn't mind 20) Believe it or not, some women have large breasts 21) Sorry, but we need substantial evidence 22) We'll let the Democrats decide 23) Ever seen anybody win anything 24) The defendant is guilty until proven innocent 25) Nobody will ever notice 26) He's doing nothing wrong 27) This won't hurt him 28) How many fingers am I holding up 29) The strangest thing 30) Unnecessary 31) No 32) Unlikely 33) When did he say that 34) This changes everything 35) Don't panic 36) What does this button do 37) Only losers believe in miracles 38) She was right 39) Her lawyer hasn't been paid yet 40) Everything happens for a reason 41) That reason is 42) Somebody better call Mable 43) Someone else noticed 44) I'm hungry now 45) Is it lunchtime already 46) Why didn't they tell me 47) Can I come back after 48) These questions aren't going away 49) Tell us 50) Letting everyone know 51) I hope you understand 52) We really meant 53) We forgot 54) We've made a terrible mistake 55) Ripping off other companies 56) Deadlines 57) Mistakes happen 58) Remember our friend Mr. Smith 59) More than 60) Writing another book 61) My sister 62) Technology 63) Who wants more 64) Baby boom 65) Great idea 66) It probably works 67) Call them 68) Don't try this 69) Spiders 70) Look 71) I don't think 72) I think 73) Well 74) Old joke 75) This is stupid 76) Do over 77) History 78) Gee sorry 79) So what 80) Here comes trouble 81) Great idea 82) We like money 83) Not exactly 84) Take it slow 85) Check again 86) Nothing 87) Just kidding 88) Too late 89) Accidents happen 90) Insurance company 91) Good advice 92) Give them 93) Back to top 94) Let's rehearse 95) Hurry up 96) Get moving 97) Stop thinking 98) Because 99) Never 100) KEEP DOING IT 101) Thank you 102) Now 103) Always 104) Done 105) The end 106) Next time 107) Second chance 108) Why not 109) Never 110) HOW COME 111) DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND 112) LET ME EXPLAIN 113) THERE IS NOTHING WRONG 114) Turn the page 115) Excuse me 116) HEY 117) Bye 118) OKAY 119) Thank you 120) See ya later 121) Come on 122) Does this look big enough 123) KEEP GOING 124)
