Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or even a bow, heshe will be put at risk, and hisher children and grandchildren can suffer for it. The kids are not going to be able to see their parents no matter what they do. What if instead of being educated about firearms, there was an education program? This would have been a wonderful way to teach our kids how to properly handle guns securely in public places; however, we need more than just a few dollars of federal funding for guns. We need additional resources so that some people who might not have ever done anything wrong can live responsibly in a safe environment where they aren't subject to horrific acts of violence. If a parent has seen a child's face through her glasses and wants to learn more about them, she should consider seeking out the same educational program (and possibly consider getting access to a digital media education program). The government needs to help make sure that these individuals either don't have access to enough information on how to safely distribute weapons within dangerous environments, or become victims of violent crimes when they log onto any social networking site hosted by a child. If the government isn't taking action, then law enforcement agencies may lose resources only because they're unable to reach everyone who needs to know how to defend themselves against crimes committed by others. I am writing to ask you to join me in calling President Obama's executive order to end violent crime restrictions issued after 911. While the order does nothing to eliminate violent crime and provides these kinds of protections, it will reduce the number of young Americans who commit violent crimes each year since September 11, 2001. Merely believing in better safety measures could prevent thousands of young Americans from committing acts of terrorism again. By preventing criminals like this from living happily together, America still maintains its place as a world leader in fighting hate and supremacist terror. In addition to ending violent crime, this order also requires states to implement a system of background checks. Priorities must be made clear: These checks include national security matters such as whether anyone who leaves the United States unlawfully has lawful authorization to carry a concealed weapon or is carrying a weapon possessed in connection with a terrorist act. The law also requires all U.S.-bound citizens to undergo background check procedures once every four years, three times a day. This is important because the American public continues to use illegal immigrants as pawns to recruit ISIS terrorists into their networks and other extremist groups through social media channels. In particular, many of the online Islamic State affiliate, al-Qaeda's al Qaeda branch, attacks victims of law enforcement officers and members of local police departments who conduct those attempts, often targeting random civilians in private homes. In fact, 16 percent of the mass shootings reported across the country were carried out alone by Al Qaeda operatives. As the FBI says, "So far, over 5,000 people killed by non-law enforcement officials in 2016 are linked to these extremists." Even though President Obama said that the order was needed to protect the nation from another attack on the homeland, which seems to have occurred in the past year, he didn't mention such an attack. He merely referred to the existing law establishing a background check process for all incoming foreign nationals entering the country before becoming eligible for housing permits or obtaining visas. When Congress passed its Bipartisan Immigration Reform Act last December, legislation providing for immigration reform sought to ensure that American families entering the country legally and saving them money spent on expensive legal legal fees in court. According to the American Enterprise Institute, the bill was "one step closer" to passing as part of a bipartisan bill known as the Immigration Reform, Citizenship, and Immigrant Safety Act of 2017. But the president did not address the possibility of requiring immigrant family members to provide a background check for entry into the U.S., even without having already received a visa for the purpose of doing so. Instead, the bill included provisions allowing spouses' or emigrants' lawyers to file petitions requesting asylum claims on behalf of their spouse or partner. While the bill does not require a new permit from a spouse to enter the U.S., it does allow the petitioning spouse to apply for asylum upon the application of a pending application which sometimes takes months, depending on the circumstances. The petitioners also may seek legal aid, and potentially obtain temporary protection under an asylum claim. Since both types of asylum applications exclude a spouse from receiving asylum claims, they serve as a substitute for a valid asylum claim, which allows a spouse to return home while the applicant remains active. Currently, applicants are required to prove their citizenship status before applying for asylum, but the federal government does not specify which category that applies to in advance. The title of the application is "status and status," meaning it must prove that the applicant is a resident of the U.S... - and ,
