While it is true that GMOs are a relatively new development, the idea that they should be treated with caution solely on this basis is not necessarily valid. Many new technologies are created every year, and it is important to assess each on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, GMOs have been extensively tested and have not been found to cause health problems in humans. They have been in use for several decades now, and there is a significant body of scientific research showing that they are safe for consumption. In addition, labeling GMOs as inherently dangerous could be misleading and cause undue concern among consumers. A more informative approach would be to label products as containing GMOs, allowing consumers to make an informed decision about what they want to buy and consume. This would also allow for greater transparency in the food industry. Overall, blanket caution and labeling for all GMOs may not be the most effective or reasonable approach, as the safety and effects of each GMO must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
