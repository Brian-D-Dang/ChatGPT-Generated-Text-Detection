Most social progressives, love democracy, and so it is of relatively little surprise to me that as they have achieved a majority (in Reddit and the West), that they want more. This has been true since reddit first became a thing at 2004ish, and this year's election was no different. What does seem surprising is how authoritarian progressive politics can still be in 2018 - the United States being an exception but otherwise things are really very much not good. I think that there are two main factors here: one is human nature; the other is technology itself. The second may soon change everything we know about both... Human Nature What I mean by 'human nature' is why people generally don't want their leaders to just do what they tell them. Democracy only works when people vote for someone because they agree with herhim on most issues. It seems obvious, but in practice whether or not you like some leader doesn't matter unless he supports your values. A few rock-solid principles bring out all those who share them into a mass movement. In order words, if enough people come together around common beliefs, then voting becomes something worth doing. These common beliefs need not be big ones, especially when compared to real world problems such as climate change. And if these votes were meaningful, the incentives to act would quickly overcome any resistance from the political elite. According to my experience with friends, many politicians remain totally corrupt even after losing elections. They always get paid somehow, either through the hush money system or outright bribes. Many others simply lie to us and say whatever makes them look better than the competition. The problem appears to be largely due to individuals having conflicting interests. i.e., people generally don't care about larger groups such as nation states. For instance, most white Americans will never support black rights. Likewise, most American Christians worry less about gays gaining equal treatment under the law than they do about Sharia Law taking over America, even though religious freedom means nothing without equality. Conversely, the opposite occurs among rich liberals. If they believe they weren't discriminated against during affirmative action and wanted everyone else to suffer similar discrimination, they certainly wouldn't oppose Trump becoming president. Rich western women also appear willing to let Muslim immigrants enter freely onto our shores while claiming that women shouldn't wear hijab. It probably goes without saying that humans tend towards tribalism. We want to belong to groups where we feel accepted and consistently rewarded based on our group membership rather than anything else. As Obama said in 2009: "We see ourselves bound together by culture, by language, by history - -by religion, which could not exist anywhere outside the context of faith. That gives us meaning. But it also binds us together. Our fears bind us together. When somebody threatens our way of life, they threaten what defines us as a society and therefore define each of us as a citizen. So it requires everybody caring pretty deeply about that issue. Being part of a community is important. Which is what made 911 so devastating ...the sense that no place could ever be home again." Indeed, this statement resonates greatly with many lefties today. Of course, tribalism isn't limited to race or gender. It shows up everywhere between countries and within cities. Leftists hold strongly opposed positions regarding homosexuality vs. transgendered men and Muslims vs. Jews. Everyone knows there is a common enemy to unite us behind but right now it definitely feels like there is too much diversity and not nearly enough commonality. Ironically, identity politics seem like they might help solve the problem. Identity Politics may work best under tribeship, however, since identities would give value to narratives and storytelling. Since we are limited to stories anyway, maybe there are ways to use them cleverly? Identity politics aside, democracy depends upon cooperation. People must agree to voluntarily follow certain rules before agreeing to live under them. e.g., we pay taxes although we certainly didn't choose to become subjects of government in the first place. Similarly, we elect representatives to represent us on various matters because we decided to collectively contribute our time, effort, intelligence etc. to the process. However, once elected officials take office, they often begin acting differently than promised. By design or incompetence, the vast bulk do not accomplish their campaign promises. Instead, they tailor legislation to benefit themselves and their own peers. Democracy fails whenever the public expects honesty from its chosen representatives but instead finds dishonesty or corruption. There is even evidence that voters reward dishonest politicians with higher reelection rates. Moreover, as long as half the population believes that irrational hatred exists, the rest of us face increased risk when threats arise against minority groups. A related point concerns trust. Political science tells us that democracy relies heavily on seeing the polls accurately reflect reality. If people believed a candidate would harm them, they might intentionally make sure they lose. Some do try to rig multiple polls. In response, modern polling firms extensively scrutinize the question) doubtful-to-them) -journals) estimation) entertainment! assume) wants) joying).
