First I think I should make all the clarifications I can. By "true Christian," I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ. It is not necessarily the literal teachings, but rather spiritual principles. In any case, the first step isn't quite enough as Jesus taught us in scripture that we need to embrace the Christian faith because they teach a different way than the church teaches Scripture and not because we believe it's true or false just like Christians do today....
