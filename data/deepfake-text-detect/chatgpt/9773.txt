Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 7th century and is currently the second-largest religion in the world with 1.8 billion adherents. Muslims believe that Allah revealed his message to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Angel Gabriel. The primary message of Islam is that there is one God who rules over the universe, and all humans must submit to His will by worshipping Him alone. Islam also promotes peace, justice, equality, compassion, and charity. Islamic teachings emphasize the importance of upholding good behavior and morality and respecting the rights of others.
