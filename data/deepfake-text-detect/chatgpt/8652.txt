It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. The human race is something which has been around for thousands of years from the time of the first human beings. It was controlled by the remnants of the late civilisation before it became a completely separate species. The early humans developed some habits such as self-preservation: they used to run out to find food or medicine whenever there were no available one. I think this should be considered an extreme case of man being selfish in nature since we "have" some sort of religion or something, but still we don't really need a religion. We just know all about science so why not make everyone do something different?
