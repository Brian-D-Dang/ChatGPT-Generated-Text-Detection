First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people . That being said, I personally feel that blackface can be used in a positive way, if it is done tastefully and respectfully. I think it can be used for dramatic effect or can be part of a performance, as long as it does not demean or belittle anyone. It can also be used to celebrate a culture or tradition, and can be a powerful way to showcase the beauty of diversity. Ultimately, it really just comes down to how it's presented and the intentions behind it.
