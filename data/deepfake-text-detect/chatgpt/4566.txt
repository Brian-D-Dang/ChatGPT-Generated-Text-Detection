I submit that Nye's public perception of'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before it was commercially marketable. He has others (such as the hero in an episode of Star Trek) who are said to be scientists but are not usually regarded as having much scientific skill at all nor as being particularly well-read about science. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I think most people would agree that you can't call someone a "scientist" without some acknowledgement of their expertise on particular topics; otherwise they could just say 'engineer'. So calling Janusz what we know him to have been a student and translator of hard sciences isn't unreasonable or confusing. It would seem pretty clear to anyone interested that this translation work wasn't his primary interest. I don't mean that there were no other interests involved beyond the documented ones of translating and writing up papers; clearly there must've been more than that or he wouldn't have spent so much time working with airplanes. But when looking back through 'his story', it seems like his professional focus was on aerospace and its hardware rather than software and the social implications of space travel.
