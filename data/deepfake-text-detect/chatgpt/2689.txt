1.firstly most people who say it is justified don't understand what "justices" and are using it to say "it was ok!"in a more powerful way so a more fitting way would be... 2.the biggest reason that i can remember off the top of my head was because he never really said or did anything wrong! in fact he has no bad traits at all, only good ones! even when they tried to put him on trial for his actions he still got out of trouble but thats another story P 3.like you said if there were any other justice system we wouldn't have gotten anywhere as far as the manga goes right? well this is true for everything else too, e.g. we could've not made it our goal to defeat zygarde or arceus etc. there's something about the justice system in pokemon that makes us want to get rid of evil forces like darkraizoruashiny gyarados (yeah i think those 3 should go next) 4.well its always meant to be murder or death sentence though isn't it? sure, with some exceptions here and there such as charizard which gets life imprisonment instead 5.mewtwo hasn't killed anyone either, as far as i know, except maybe himself during mewtwo wars 2 In the anime, Charizard attempted to kill Ash Ketchum by throwing a huge fire ball after Zekrom drained itself. He doesn't seem to care much about humans other than making them stronger. I wonder why Pikachu cries when someone dies from being hurt by Pokemon in the anime while the death penalty seems to be okay. Maybe just TV censorship since it helps sell toys.
