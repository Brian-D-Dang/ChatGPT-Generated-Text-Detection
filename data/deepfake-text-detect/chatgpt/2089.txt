During the first week alone [32 million people] downloaded a copy of a Game of Thrones episode. Even if only 1 of those people keep the file they downloaded after watching, then HBO gets 3 per person as an adder to their subscription fee for that season." Of course HBO is making more money than ever off its most popular show and other cable networks are doing similarly well thanks in part to bundled deals with internet service providers (ISPs). Comcast announced last month it had acquired Time Warner Cable - the largest U.S. ISP by subscribers - for about 45 billion dollars; together they will have almost 30 percent market share nationwide according to Bloomberg News. ATT also recently purchased DirecTV, which has 20 million satellite TV customers across North America. The result: ISPs now control the pipes consumers use every day to access content like Netflix or Hulu right from your television set, so what happens when you want to watch something not included in these bundles? Is there any way around paying thousands of extra dollars each year just because one of them owns some channels on your favorite streaming platform? For cord-cutters looking forward toward this summer's 2016 Olympics coverage, NBCUniversal provides several options including live streams via both broadband and mobile devices using apps such as WatchEspn, Go90, access through Sling TV and Sony Playstation Vue. These services vary slightly depending upon where exactly viewers sign up but all offer varying levels of programming at different price points starting at approximately 20month. All five aforementioned platforms require users to enter into multilayer contracts typically lasting between 12 months - 2 years before actually accessing content. While none specifically mention "data caps" within said agreements, Verizon FiOS' Terms Conditions explicitly state that usage over 250GB may be subject to additional fees. This means should someone subscribe to multiple plans as many do today, data usage could quickly become prohibitively expensive without careful consideration regarding individual needs versus wants. For example, let's say TQ decided he wanted to catch some Olympic games while visiting family members out West...a simple plan allowing him to connect his phone would cost roughly 30 per month - enough time for him to view two events simultaneously based on 4K resolutionbut nearly double once July 23rd rolls around assuming no changes were made during contract renewal periods prior. He might decide instead to take advantage of PlayStation VUE offering three concurrent streams on Roku device for 50 (3510) however can't stream from his laptop since tracking down wireless connectivity proved difficult given available bandwidth was limited due to numerous smartphones sharing similar cell tower space resulting in poor signal strength throughout much of rural Nevada.Update: In response to our request for clarification, a representative stated "NBC Sports Live Extra app does NOT include a "Data Cap." However we encourage anyone who uses it regularly to check their cellular provider's policy on Data Usage on their managed account (s)." There doesn't appear to be anything stopping future restrictions either even though companies maintain they don't happen very often unless extreme circumstances exist outside user control. Considerations aside, how long until specific sports programs start playing favorites among this growing number of choices? Will the NFL eventually recognize Tivo Corporation founder Ed Carlberg's vision of pay-per-view sports packages alongside traditional televised offerings? Or better yet institute direct subscriptions to professional leagues following successful tests run in Europe? As always questions remain unanswered despite technology advancing rapidly towards providing solutions. Until further notice things look bleaker rather than brighter regardless of whatever misdirection thrown your way on social media sites seeking engagement growth vs actual product development.
