I've recently subscribed to ranime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is just weird enough for me. One of my favourite shows has been cut in half because they couldn't get licensing, but at least this show isn't on SNL or something... I used to love Sailor Moon! The first twothree seasons are sooo good, then it goes downhill pretty fast after that (and we're talking about animes). And i'm still watching ATLA, though its not as great as i remember it being:)
