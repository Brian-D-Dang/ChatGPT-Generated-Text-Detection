NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but new units should not be put under rent control or stabilization. Instead, policies should be introduced to increase the supply of affordable housing in the city, such as providing incentives for developers to build apartments that are affordable for low and middle-income families. This would help to address the underlying issue of a lack of affordable housing, rather than just applying a band-aid solution by limiting rent on a small number of units. This approach would also encourage housing development in areas where it is needed most, making it easier for individuals and families to find affordable, quality housing in the city.
