This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I would argue that many similar problems could be resolved if only the world took the time to listen rather than shouting from the sidelines as it did in Vietnam and Cambodia. I'm no expert on this issue though because my experience with being a child in public school was not good. If you've read any book about racism then you know exactly what I mean when I say "public schools." There were so few Asians at my high school that we ended up having our own little Chinese class inside the general education academy where all other classes met. We weren't even allowed to wear red at home; donned navy blue for basketball games (which is pretty much unheard-of), field trips etc., There wasn't even one Asian girl in my entire graduating class of 2000. Looking back now, I realize how ridiculous these things really seemed: Wasn't there a movie called Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon? It showed an Asian man who kept his head down, secreted himself away into society, silently went about doing his stuff while everyone else just stared off in shock. Our closest friends at the end had been Shaun Toub, Michael Jai White - both white men. We couldn't even imagine growing up like that! But somehow I guess by age four my parents realized they needed to intentionally break us out of our shell. They wanted me to learn how to speak Mandarin so I'd fit more seamlessly into China later on. So until today, I can still speak some Chinese fluently despite never going to China. The point here is that non-Asian families have to take responsibility for their children's lives...not blame others for them falling through cracks. And yes, I understand why people want to protect their kids' privacy right now but there comes a time when your kid needs to grow up seeing diversity around himher instead of feeling invisible. As far as the riots go, I'm also very uncomfortable watching videos online of people getting hurt over something they simply didn't do. I hope police will find those responsible soon. Again, its easy to focus on racial issues especially since most Americans haven't experienced real conflict themselves yet, however whenever someone gets killed unfairly during times of peace it makes me sick too. My heart goes out to Ferguson protesters whose cause isn't completely understood but surely deserves greater attention than outsiders give. Its heartbreaking knowing half America wants nothing to do with justice reform or equal treatment under the law and lets the media convince them otherwise. And another thing, there should absolutely be different standards for policing black vs. brown skin, regardless of race itself. As much as Obama says he recognizes that's a problem, he doesn't seem fully committed enough to fix it anytime soon. He let the community behind the scenes handle the response after Darren Wilson shot Mike Brown which resulted in more deaths. That is unacceptable. My family immigrated to the United States long before Obama came to power so naturally I'll always vote Democrat. However, lately Ive found myself questioning whether that party has become a bit too soft on immigration enforcement and treat minorities differently based on color alone without solving deeper issues such as unemployment, crime rate etc.. Some may call me naive or unrealistic but sometimes fairness seems better than purity politics. In light of recent events nationwide, please adapt these suggestions below into your life. You're probably already aware of a couple anyway:)
