Actually, the idea of eliminating a "gay gene" from the gene pool is based on a flawed assumption that being gay is some sort of defect or aberration that needs to be corrected. In reality, being gay is a natural variation of human sexuality that has been documented in various cultures throughout history. Similarly, there is no evidence that homosexuality is caused by a single gene or genetic factor. Even if such a gene were identified, it would be unethical and discriminatory to seek to eliminate it. It would be akin to eugenics, which has been widely condemned as a cruel and unjust practice. Moreover, it ignores the fact that LGBTQ individuals make valuable contributions to society and have the same inherent worth and rights as any other human being.
