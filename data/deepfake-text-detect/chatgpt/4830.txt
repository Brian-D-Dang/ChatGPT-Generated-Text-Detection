Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between the rich and poor. Unfortunately, even though they were initially created by "the Proletariat" (those who work), these concepts have been hijacked by elitists within governments that seek to keep themselves at a higher pay scale than their workerscitizens while also making it so only those with connections or wealth can get ahead of others; thus, creating what we now know as capitalism- i.e. how moneywealth has taken over everything from politics to our social standing on earth! The problem with socialism and communism is that most people don't understand these ideals nor do they care about them because why should someone else make more money when you could be earning your own? I believe this mentality is caused by the fact that many countries still practice Capitalism so deeply, some may not even feel much difference economically speaking but for the majority of society, living under SocialismCommunist like conditions would mean better jobs, housing, medical coverage etc... which means there will be less poverty than ever before! Less crime too! It's true.. just think about how far humanity has progressed during the last century alone since World War II, yet today things seem worse off than ever! Where did all the progress go?? Because amongst the technology revolution, we've seen some amazing improvements such as cellphones, cars, electricity etc.... We live longer compare to past generations, but unfortunately often times life is harder than ever due to unemployment, lack of reliable public transport, flat screen TVs, homelessness and other environmental issues that compound into overall health problems as well... Sad right?! This is why I encourage anyone reading my articles- if nothing else please allow me to explain in detail what Socialism Communism is really meant to stand for, plus any benefits of both systems if elected into power! There's always good reasons that our current system is failing us everyday, but once again, after gaining basic knowledge and understanding of these two ideologies, hopefully then you'll gain enough insight to decide whether or not you want them implemented into real life around the globe!!!
