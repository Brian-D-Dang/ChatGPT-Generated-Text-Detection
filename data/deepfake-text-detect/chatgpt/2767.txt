First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. She is wearing a scarf with the word "Jesus" written across it and crosses herself frequently while she stands at one end of the aisle (she's very old so there are no seats). A man next to you notices this and says, "Wow! Does that mean anything?" I would say yes because the person who believes he or she has been touched by God should be able to tell others how they feel about such things and not have them ask why someone else gets offended (as if they even know!). My point is: Why do Christians get so upset over those who don't believe? The answer is simple; we want our beliefs respected - especially when the belief involves something as personal as the soul. And here's another tidbit...if Jesus didn't come back to Earth for me then I won't go to Heaven either. After all, what makes Christianity special anyway?! There will always exist people who oppose your faith but why does it bother you so much? It shouldn't matter. If nothing affects us then life becomes boring indeed. The Son of Man will appear from heaven carrying the cross of shame. He will call out: 'Woman, where are my clothes? They will reply: 'Lord, the humans stole them!' He will continue: Where are mine?' They will respond: 'They were thrown into the fire.' Then he will shout again to them: 'Answer me! Tell Me, where is my wife?' They will look up secretly toward heaven and lie: 'Your wife was caught up to heaven too like everyone else. Revelation 21:7-9
