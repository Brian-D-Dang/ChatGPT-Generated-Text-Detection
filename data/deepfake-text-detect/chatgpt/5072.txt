Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable that they would want to be able to travel around the galaxy without being subject to the Federation blockade. The Federation now counts on the Federation to protect them from harm while they fight for their rights as they try and fail to maintain peace with the human world. The Federation is a nation defined by its culture, history and humanity; not just as a shield against disaster but also because it will do anything necessary to keep them safe when enemies come calling. It makes sense that the Federation would consider trying to defend human life during conflict - something the Federation has no problem doing even if it relies heavily on brute force warfare elsewhere: the Federation won't stand for war against the Federation again like the Alliance did after the Federation fought against the Terran Empire in Star Trek: Voyager. But the Federation needs to understand the systems that are vulnerable given the limited resources available in the Federation fleet, especially since they're concentrated near the Federation's borders. Though the Federation isn't hostile toward warring races outside its borders this time around, it can potentially cause a rift between the Federation and the Dominion over who should own the resources needed to support the Federation fleets at large before the Federation eventually gets its hands on the resources useful. Even more important than the Federation positioning itself within the Federation universe is its ability to utilize technology with ease thanks to its incredible speed and precision. The Federation doesn't have a limited number of ships capable of removing enemy forces anytime soon (the Federation currently lacks a unified fleet), so the Federation must rely on the Federation's own technologies instead of relying upon the Alliance's. The Federation could eliminate the Alliance sooner rather than later by using its hulls inside the Federationiverse to block a Dominion attack or destroy a Dominion ship surrounding the Federation space station. The Federation uses its space stations very frequently due to the fact that they allow it access to the Federation canon. So the Federation doesn't need to worry about the Dominion attacking the Federation again until something catastrophic happens - some future Federation villain could wipe out the Dominion entirely easily enough without threatening humanity altogether. With the Federation operating under a single command structure, and the Federation constantly working together with its allies throughout the galaxy to defend people and the planets from threats such as alien invasion, it seems highly unlikely that the Federation would ever risk defeat either. In addition, the Federation already operates independently from the Federation core group starship Federation Enterprise, and even a Federation attempt to destroy the Dominion definitely wouldn't jeopardize the Federation space station crew members' chances of survival. There wasn't much more that the Federation could do right here other than giving them weapons once their fleet was destroyed. But the Federation still falls short when it comes to dealing with the future threat of alien attacks. It simply hasn't learned how to deal with threats beyond the Federation bureaucracy today, or how to handle internal conflicts caused mainly by the Federation bureaucracy. In fact, the Federation might seem unprepared each year regardless of whether or not its space stations exist. The Federation probably only cares about protecting its citizens most of the time, but the Federation might struggle every few years without its main transport vessel for every separate conquest mission. The Federation timeline suggests it had better learn to adapt quickly considering how many times they've been defeated thus far.
