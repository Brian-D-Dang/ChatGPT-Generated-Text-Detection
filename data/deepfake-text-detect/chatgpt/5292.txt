Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked, and keep the cooks in order. The cooking competition showcases dishes from around the world as chefs tackle culinary challenges including French cuisine with ease through simple but tasty recipes written by experts who work for the chefs they're hosting, making it easy for viewers to watch how food can take root inside the kitchens of Michelin starred restaurants while avoiding dessert deserts among other unexpected ingredients like tomato soup or spicy sauces made using variations on the same recipe found elsewhere online. The only flaw? There's no guarantee you'll win, but the judges obviously love the idea because they eat every episode! Next week's episode will feature Italian chef Andrea Vella Campbell competing against other chefs across Italy alongside the judges, including former Food Network star Julie Lechner. The show also features celebrity chefs such as Laura Alexander of Chef Missy Henderson and Jenny Craig of Virgilian. You may remember from previous seasons when chefs weren't allowed into the kitchen in order to have secrets hiding behind closed doors, even though the dish was prepared according to the guidelines set down by the manufacturers themselves. Draft A Taste host Tim Fincher originally aired on Food Network Canada but the program has been revived: Draft A Taste airs Thursday nights 7 p.m., Friday night at 8 PM Canadian time, and Saturday mornings 9 AM local time over the next seven weeks. It streams exclusively on Food Network Canada, where it stars Paula Deen as host. Netflix has officially launched its own reality television series called Set Up Canada.
