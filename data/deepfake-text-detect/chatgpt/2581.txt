Redditors main real concerns about the website were monetization and the limiting of "free speech" in the rfatpeoplehate drama. Reddit has still brought many people on board independent of Huffman 's firing, but it will be a long time before anything like The Fappening or Ferguson are seen as beneficial to the site any more I don't see how 'the fapping' was harmful at all? There wasn't even nudity. It is what we call a distraction from reality: something that takes our minds off things for awhile so we can enjoy ourselves. I mean, reddit makes money now because they have ads on there, right? And posting something doesn't take away someone else's ability to post something.
