So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because he played with his girlfriend. You can see some more information about that here: http: www. magicjudge. com event - details? id 833 and this thread on reddit talks about it now as well (and explains why someone could be suspicious). Good thing is for me at least they said they were looking into it so even if something doesn't change there shouldn't be any problems in the future but still... it's just sad to think that all these years we have been playing MTG and apparently its like "unacceptable" because you're dating your partner.. even though that has nothing to do with Magic when you compare them to each other or what ever else happens outside of our games. And yes indeedy!! I've joined again! Been very busy lately unfortunately which means no time to play much Magic anymore but hope to get back soon enough. Catching up on everything from now until then however is going to take quite a bit of my attention unless i want to go insane from trying to catch up haha
