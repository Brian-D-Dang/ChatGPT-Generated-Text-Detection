I'm not asking anything about why we self harm - trust me I've got many answers for that. My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is a bad thing, but there are people who still do it and most of them have told me they don't see how it's harming themselves. The question now: is it okay to try and convince someone like this? Or should you just give up on trying? So...what should be done when loveable idiots put their thumbs in the wrong holes.? If i had been able to stop myself from hurting my wrist I would never have made the mistake again! But what am I supposed to say so that someone else will learn a lesson before its too late? And also, wouldn't telling himher "it hurts alot less if your thumb doesn't go in the hole" sound really stupid?? Shouldn't I know better than to tell some one something as simple as that?
