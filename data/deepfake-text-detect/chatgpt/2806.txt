I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to homophobia, ect... But then I see stuff like this and if anything can make me forget my hate for lions it's some cute cubs! You should never give in your hatred for Lions! Some funny looking fat cats will not change that fact:P
