So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training , but lets be honest: They barely have any time off from their full-time jobs and these volunteer firefighters are the first ones to jump in when there is a fire emergency (or an earthquake or hurricane.) There really should be more paid staff on hand so we don't see counties being destroyed by fires because no one can get them put out fast enough! This makes me think about what happened during California's recent wildfires last year...
