To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, incest is morally wrong because it has absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality or homosexuality, almost all other sexual organs were generally considered improper for homosexual persons under Christian doctrine until the age of majority rule in the United States. In addition, homosexuality was never illegal here at first but since homosexuality did become legal back then there wasn't much resistance among Christians who didn't believe sex between men could be consensual unless they wanted to commit adultery and homosexuality really had no place on earth except if one person wishes to marry a member of another gender (without consent). This inconsistency makes homosexual persons subjectively immoral, sinful and unnatural behavior abhorrent...and begs the question whether Christians should even allow such behavior as immoral when homosexual people violate the law by marrying members of opposite sexes....I think we need to amend our constitution so homosexuals cannot freely act upon their sexual desires without repentance." - Ron Paul The Obama administration recently announced plans to replace the old Declaration of Independence with an amendment recognizing same-sex couples' rights within the federal government. Obama claims that homosexuality is illegal after the Constitution says "no person shall ever be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law" however in reality this amendment only protects Christians from punishment for sinning before God Almighty while other religions like Judaism also protect themselves according to the United States Constitution, therefore, Obama believes homosexuals shouldn't have the ability to ask for forgiveness before being punished simply because they don't approve of homosexuality.
