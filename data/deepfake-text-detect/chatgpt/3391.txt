I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for a non violent crime, they should be allowed to choose to end their own life in prison? I am sorry, but I cannot agree with this view. While it may seem like a way to reduce the burden on the prison system and save resources, allowing someone to take their own life is not a solution. We should focus on rehabilitation and helping prisoners become law-abiding citizens after they serve their time. There may be mental health and emotional issues that need to be addressed, and we should provide support and resources to help them overcome these challenges. Everyone deserves a chance to turn their life around and contribute positively to society.
