One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? Well... most people have some sort of education in high school (but not notably) so your system will always be mostly low income. But if you're going to pay for it with tax dollars and the government doesn't give it away then yeah.
