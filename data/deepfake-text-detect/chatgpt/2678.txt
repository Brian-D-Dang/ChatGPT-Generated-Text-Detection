First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from a different perspective. Now that we've gotten past my personal feelings about it... The first person should be given preference over the second. There's no reason to give someone who can walk more than 10 feet an advantage in life based on pure laziness or stupidity. Think how long you'd last as a politician if you started calling everyone lazy and stupid just cause they're fat.
