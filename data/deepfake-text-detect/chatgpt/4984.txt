You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the opposite of that statement applied to these two things. But in some ways it does imply there are more than just "the differences." The people who say "there isn't much difference" can be considered equally valid arguments against this argument as someone else (people have been arguing about this for thousands of years).
