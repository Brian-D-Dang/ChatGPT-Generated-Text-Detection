Hello. For a long time now I've felt that there are many people in hospitals and psychiatric homes who will never be able to function independently and will never work, or even be able to look after themselves without society's help. The aim of politics is usually to make sure these people can survive on the least amount possible from taxes - but this isn't always successful because it requires an enormous amount of effort to get them to accept the most basic forms of help we're willing to offer them. With all due respect for those who have made such efforts, how do you justify your (most likely very high) salaries? Are they only based on what countries are capable of paying? I don't think "ensuring people can survive" means advocating their own deaths either, so that would need something more specific than just ignoring them and hoping for the best.
