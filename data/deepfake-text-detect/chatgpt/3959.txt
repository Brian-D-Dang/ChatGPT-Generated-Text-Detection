This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is basically that this type of argument isn't really an arguement at all and can only be used as a way of trying to justify your own preferences (and sometimes, worse) ideas about other people's lives. So really it's just a statement that I think you may find interesting? Or does this go deeper than what meets the eye...
