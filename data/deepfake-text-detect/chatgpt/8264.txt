I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with a question: What exactly is the difference between Jewish kosher law (which forbids us from consuming any animals that have cloven hoofs) versus Islamic halal? Is there an animal in nature which has no claws or horns at allnot even vestigial ones?? Can you please explain why we can't consume certain species of "pigs" but other pig-like creatures are OK. The exact same legal issues apply for chickens as well...some people insist they're absolutely fine while sothers say donates should not involve shedding feathers..etc etc
