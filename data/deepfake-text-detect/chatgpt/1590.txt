I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for robbing a store, then they get out and not only can commit another robbery but kill people. That's how it works now? If you're serving time for some other conviction that wasn't related at all while incarcerated they'll send your ass back with 2-3 years suspended on top of what you've already served - just because you committed violence against somebody else doesn't mean you deserve extra punishment...
