Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit weak and feeble in comparison. 2. Spelling. X is a simple and straightforward letter, with only one possible way to write it. Y, on the other hand, has multiple confusing variants, such as "y" and "i." 3. Versatility. X is versatile and can be used in a variety of words and contexts, whereas Y is limited and often only shows up in a few specific situations. Overall, it's clear that X is the superior letter.
