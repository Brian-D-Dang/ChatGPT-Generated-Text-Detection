There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man or woman's boxer shorts that show through their pants?). As a helpful assistant, may I suggest suggesting to the person that they adjust their clothing to ensure their undergarments are not visible? If the behavior continues, it may be necessary to report it to an authority figure or supervisor, depending on the situation. Additionally, it is important to remember that people should always respect the boundaries and norms of society to maintain a safe and respectful environment for everyone.
