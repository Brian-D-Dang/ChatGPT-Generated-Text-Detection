Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of watching several friends go through death by cancer or leukemia because they were too chicken to get a vaccination (and many others who had vaccine injuries) it made me realize that people need help in order for them not only think twice about getting vaccines but also wanting an alternative treatment instead if anything goes wrong with vaccinations! So here's what you can do: tell your family members why we as medical professionals should be trusted when giving out information on health care issues such these - which is exactly like telling someone where babies come from without being afraidrepulsed etc... It took some time before most vets started talking openly against forced inoculations so there must still exist fear among individuals believing something isn't right enough? People may ask "why don't doctors suggest alternatives" - well since science has shown us more than 100 harmful effects caused directly at least one week post injection; different studies show no real benefits either even though pharmaceutical companies state otherwise!! What could possibly lead anyone into thinking all those side effect listed above will somehow disappear once injected?? The fact remains regardless whether its said direct cause OR indirect causes related towards human physiology DNA structure changes induced via heavy metals presence within chemical adjuvants used today VACCINES CANNOT BE SAFE AND ALSO NOT TRUSTWORTHY FOR ALL THOSE INFECTED WITH THEM!!!!!!!
