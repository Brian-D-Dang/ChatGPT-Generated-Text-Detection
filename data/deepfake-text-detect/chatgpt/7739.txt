Counter-argument: The criticism of "nice guys" is very much valid as the behavior they exhibit is not genuine kindness but rather a manipulative tactic to get what they want from women. They often feel entitled to romantic or sexual attention and become frustrated and even hostile when their advances are not reciprocated. This behavior is not only disrespectful and objectifying towards women, but it also ultimately undermines the possibility of forming genuine connections based on mutual respect and trust. Therefore, dismissing the criticism of "nice guys" is not helpful in addressing the root of the problem and promoting healthy, equal relationships between men and women.
