While it's true that controlling behavior is not considered healthy in relationships, it's essential to note that having boundaries and expectations is a normal part of any relationship. A vital part of having a relationship is being on the same page when it comes to sex and intimacy. If both partners have agreed to be monogamous, insisting that your SO does not have sex outside the relationship is not considered controlling, but rather a reasonable expectation. It's fundamental to understand that all behaviors should be viewed in context in a relationship.
