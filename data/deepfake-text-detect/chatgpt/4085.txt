This CMV was inspired by this post: I believe that being obese is a disability. Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out. It's a disability that a lot of people suffer from and it is only because we are forced into it for the sake of making money. I have seen first hand how bad it can be when someone gets fat of their own free will so I decided to do something positive about it instead of writing an article complaining about how a person should lose weight or finding another way to make some kind of positive change in society but in reality doing nothing at all. So what if I am not giving any other opinions? Fuck them right? Why shouldn't they get mad at somebody who just wants to help those around him? -I think we need more of these posts My argument against obesity is simple. If you don't like it stop eating it! Simple as that really!
