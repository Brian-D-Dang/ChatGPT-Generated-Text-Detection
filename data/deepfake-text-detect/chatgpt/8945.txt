After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the two sides are engaged, a lack of sufficient understanding of how to hunt should result in a cycle of violent behavior that ends with no serious consequences or enough people dying from it. When you have 12 kids behind bars carrying guns it will be difficult for them to get away with anything even remotely resembling a crime for the next 10 years. But when your child is at home with someone who has been seen by multiple bystanders in real time, they can become much more likely to end up spending time alone, so parents really need to be on the lookout for ways to help their children stay safe during this tragic period of our history. Many experts recommend reading HOLD THE CAMPAIGN: The Key to a Safe First Amendment Way of Life by John G. Bowman. He writes about tactics like this that have saved a lot of lives over the last century. "We're living in the 21st century where we do not accept the idea that children can achieve any sort of meaningful goal in politics," says Bowman, author of "On the Road to Freedom." He also points out that many communities, especially those that are predominantly anti-gun, don't support the Second Amendment because children would never require a license to carry an assault rifle or handgun if they were legally allowed. Many states allow gun ownership but only to protect minors, he explains. Bowman introduces another unusual tactic that's known as "rage," which allows opponents to start arguments based on a seemingly innocuous usage of the word "right." In this case, though anyone who believes in free speech in America could call the shots, there won't be very much of a battle between the opposing parties. And although some volunteers might try to fight back against these opportunists, Bowman argues that people are better off without the right to defend themselves. The law was written with the purpose of allowing Americans to prevent mass shootings, but many experts agree that the idea was not intended to make guns less dangerous than other weapons, instead just giving them a place to hide under cover of night. This is exactly what happened in Virginia, the most recent state in the nation to ban weapons purchased illegally online. The tragedy may, however, have turned out to be more a problem with guns being stored illegally, rather than a problem with firearms being bought illegally.
