To my knowledge there are no peer reviewed sources that link GMOs to any negative health effects. There is as much reason to believe genes manipulated in a lab are harmful unless GMO crops were genetically modified, but be careful what you wish for if we accept the genetic modification of GMO's from one source or another I agree with everything you say except that I don't know how genetically modified foods affect their quality at all. If it makes sense then GMO's aren't harmful (unlike other food companies which promote unnatural ways such as corn).
