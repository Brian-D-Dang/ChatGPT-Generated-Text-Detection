I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in my list. Taken together with a few other posts on here (and some very useful comments by others) it's beginning to make more sense: the downbeat ending of Kiki's Delivery Service was one reason; how well - written and believable these characters were another biggie for me). That said ... yeesh! 2. The Iron Giant3. Star Wars4. Beauty5. Aladdin1. Spirited Away2. Ponyo3. Howl's Moving Castle4. Castle In The Sky5. Princess Mononoke6. Nausicaa7. My Neighbor Totoro8. Kiki9.
