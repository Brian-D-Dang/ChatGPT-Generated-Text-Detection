I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by getting into the why of things. We are all who we make ourselves and in my own opinion our happiness is tied directly there...but that doesn't mean people can take advantage! If you read some articles about what makes someone an INTJ - they will almost always say something along these lines: "We practice detachment." That sounds nice if your partner was only doing whatever because heshe wanted attention from others - not true for me at least; being extroverted has nothing do wth wanting affectionate acknowledgement- so technically speaking anyone could be lying through their teeth saying "we want love" just as easily.. It seems like maybe its more than friendships which have changed? Because even when times were good before quarantine...there weren' t any lies involved here- neither one mentioned anything romantic until after lockdown started..... ten months ago!! And she added how much fun camp had seemed during those first few weeks!!! So again no mention then either - - unless u count her hinting around 6mo 1st time telling him i miss seeing his face 2weeks later...... ok.... Good luck figuring them both OUT while making sure everyone else stays safe healthy ...that involves risk assessment too! Dont play games........ now im confused???? Do ur best, stay well. thanks:)
