Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with most SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions but is prone towards radicalization because of its own internal political disagreements (I'm not talking about racism here). Which is why you don't see the black panthers advocating for racial equality while demanding equal pay as a group. The idea in itself isn't bad or even all that far out there - we just need to make sure people are at least paid fairly for their work.
