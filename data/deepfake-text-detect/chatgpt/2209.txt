Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a little bit like the letter y in certain contexts (in this case surrounding e's). 2. Numbering convention. The alphabetical order we use today makes it far easier and faster to find the letters you need immediately when composing or speaking out loud. "X comes after Z because that"s how language works! You should be grateful I even know what those two lette....ohhhh....wait...I do? Well if other people say they come before eachother then maybe my education was wrong all along?! Nahhh.....3. Etymology-wise, both have their roots as v"x"alic words meaning something similar but with different meanings depending on context, so there are no linguistic issues here either way. 4. Most importantly: It's just plain better to writespeak using your preferred system Conclusion1) When doing math problems where "Intuitive" thinking plays an important role - for example: multiplying fractions together by hand, finding area under curves, plotting graphs etc., stick to intuitive reasoning2) If you're trying to figure things out logically without worrying about your intuition, you can probably get away with sticking to your system anyway since most logical systems will tend towards containing at least some sort of consistency across several variables whereas many languages allow separation between numbers which means its not necessarily easy to consistently reason mathematically from one language into another. There might still occasionally be inconsistencies due to differences within particular cultures' standards
