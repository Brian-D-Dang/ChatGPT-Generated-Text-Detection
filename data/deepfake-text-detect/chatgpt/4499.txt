I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually rich, and will go on to some of the top colleges in the world, no matter what they did at their public highschools. Furthermore thanks for learning English... I'm sure you'll do very well when applying to universities overseas since that's where most people with your skill level end up studying these days. Also not a bad idea considering how expensive college tuition has become here in America. Yeah, as much as I wish there were more 'normal' or average typesstudents out there, like myself, sometimes we just can't get past certain things (like this forum) even if we want them so badly. Just look around - half our students aren't American nationals! We also don't really actively try to push anyone into either technical degrees or arts humanities because we know which one fits best with each student. Everyone gets along pretty well actually. It's fun teaching what interests me but then again I love science, so it makes sense.:P
