I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically there's really no way to build a reactor and keep it safe from external attack or natural disaster without basically building an underground city around it. Besides that one issue, though, and as usual my opinion is highly colored by where I also live in Switzerland, here are some other things about nuclear: 1) Uranium mining and processing (also used for fission reactors): most people don't know this, but uranium is very rare on Earth. It takes 10 billion tons of rock just to make 1 kg of "natural" uranium. The average person doesn't realize how incredibly hard it is to extract this stuff. And oh yeah, you need a whole lot of water to do so. There aren't too many places where we can get our hands on enough raw ore to produce even small amounts of electricity using conventional techniques. In fact, most of us probably wouldn't be able to tell if it was any different than getting gold out of gravel. No matter what technique someone uses, they're going to be dealing with massive quantities of waste which will require high levels of protection against radiation exposure. This means large dams, containment vessels, etc., making each project much more expensive and difficult to find financing for. All you need to understand is that it's like trying to dig up coal when everyone knows there aren't nearly sufficient reserves to meet global demand. Maybe it could work someday, but right now it would take vast resources of capital, hundreds of years of research into materials science, geology and engineering, and technology development before people start to talk seriously about doing it. So far, all anyone has done since humans started experimenting with controlled fusion back in 1942-45 is piss away billions of dollars looking for ways to make nuclear weapons. If you were starting from scratch today, using modern consumer technologies (like lasers instead of explosive charges), your best bet would be thorium, which occurs naturally in huge deposits only found near certain mountain ranges in Norway, Malaysia, Chile and Australia. Thorium exists at nowhere near current usage rates anyway, so let's forget about how nobody seems to want to deal with the problem either. Anyway, whatever you end up doing eventually, mining operations will always leave behind thousands of square miles of contaminated areas full of sludge tanks, tailings ponds, and ultimately radioactive sediment. More often then not these sites will become tourist attractions or farm land. Finally, those low grade ores tend to concentrate heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic in their concentrate material depending how harsh they've been treated during extraction. Now consider that in addition to being mined elsewhere to fuel future reactors, we'll be left with...well, mines full of radiated waste products. Another hazardous product? Waste batteries containing toxic cadmiums and copper salts. Those compounds have also been shown to appear inside seaweed samples taken off California beaches after reactors went active nearby. How long until someone tries dumping millions upon millions of pounds of this crap down septic systems? All the above leads me to believe that a holistic approach has to come first rather than continuing to throw money at problems while ignoring them completely. We hit peak oil quite soon at least according to history; why should nuclear energy be exempt from this equation? That's the real question isn't it? But hey, maybe somebody already figured this out! I'd love to hear about it. Oh, wait, never mind Wikipedia says "it's possible." Sure, why not? 2) Nuclear Weapons Proven Deadly Destructive: Accidents happen, but Chernobyl gave humanity a pretty strong lesson to learn. They just haven't learned yet. Here's another thing that didn't occur to me watching CNN earlier, something that should absolutely concern every civilized human alive. Even the New York Times reports that almost 300 metric tonnes of depleted uranium munitions remain outside Iraq somewhere between Baghdad and Basra alone. Think about this for a moment: States who engage in warfare typically throw projectiles weighing 4 to 5 times less, dropping the amount of DU thereon by over 1000x. How exactly does that happen? Not only had these shells remained radioactive for decades prior to leaving the ground in Kuwait, but when they finally made it into Iraqi territory those bullets absorbed equivalent radiation doses per kilogram of steel compared to Hiroshima blasts. What happens when a bullet contains 500 grams of DU? Decimal points of deathly radioactivity. At what dose level will that shell explode? To determine that, we still need time-consuming experiments to test the limits of this substance across multiple parameters by various institutions including NRC labs, DOE facilities, university researchers and beyond. One example might say 1000 millisieverts equals dangerous cancerous cells. A second might say 5000 mSv is equally fatal. Who's to say which number is accurate? Are they both correct? 3) Radioactive Contamination Effects on Humans: As mentioned previously and recently in SF Gate Magazine John P porter's ability to watch-and-watchability is at stake. Talk? Only studies show indicate that. A few weeks ago post-qualify
