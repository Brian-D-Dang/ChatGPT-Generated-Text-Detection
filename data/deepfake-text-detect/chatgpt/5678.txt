Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. While these threats have come to pass, they are a reality. As a result, Jews always need to be on guard. The current threat, according to the Canadian Jewish News (CJN) is that of a terrorist attack by the "Israeli Defense Forces" (IDF). Sounds absurd? Let me explain... On Monday, Sept. 22, the CJN published an opinion by a CJN columnist, Melissa Boteach, that praised the IDF's recent operations in Gaza. Boteach, who is the vice-president of the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C., lauds the IDF for "invasions" that have taken place in Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza. While the Middle East is currently facing chaos, Gaza is under a siege that has been going on for the last year. Gaza is one of the most impoverished places on Earth, with the people of Gaza living in sub-human conditions, with no electricity, clean water, medical supplies and other necessities. This is the reality of Gaza as the result of the Israeli occupation of the strip, where even children are being shot and killed by Israeli soldiers. Since 2000, Israel has invaded and occupied Gaza 27 times, with each attack more brutal than the last, resulting in the deaths of over 1,000 Palestinians. The IDF's latest attack, Operation Protective Edge, has already resulted in the deaths of 2,100 Palestinians, including children and civilians. This is not the first time Boteach has published an article praising the IDF's actions. In a previous article, Boteach called the IDF a "well-regulated, well-trained and well-funded army." Why would the CJN publish such an article? For one, the CJN is a well-known Zionist publication and it was only a matter of time before an article of this nature would come out. The CJN is not alone, as other mainstream media outlets have also published similar articles about the IDF in the past. For example, the Washington Post published an article titled, "Israel's Soldiers are no Supermen, but they are Human" on Dec. 12, 2012, praising the IDF's "tremendous professionalism and dedication" after the last attack on Gaza. Why are the IDF being portrayed in such a positive light? The answer is simple. The IDF is a well-known terrorist organization that routinely commits war crimes, as well as a number of other violations of international law, including murder, torture, rape, child abuse, kidnapping, and the deliberate bombing of civilian targets. To this day, the IDF has not been held accountable for these crimes, and have continued to act with impunity. Since the IDF is a terrorist organization, the Canadian government should immediately revoke the IDF's charity status, which it currently enjoys in Canada. The Canadian government should also officially label the IDF as a terrorist organization, like the Hamas, and bring them to justice in a court of law. The IDF is currently a well-funded and well-armed terrorist organization that has committed war crimes in the past, and is currently committing war crimes in Gaza today. The IDF, unlike Hamas, is not going to go away anytime soon, and will continue to commit war crimes, especially if the IDF is being portrayed in such a positive light by the media. Furthermore, the IDF is not a well-regulated, well-trained and well-funded army, as Boteach claims. The IDF is the largest terrorist organization in the world, and the most well-funded terrorist organization in the world. While it does have the funding of the U.S. and Canada, the IDF is known to receive funds from private Jewish organizations, many of whom are based in Canada. While the Canadian government has denied any involvement in the funding of the IDF, many Canadians have wondered how much Canada has contributed to the IDF in the past.
