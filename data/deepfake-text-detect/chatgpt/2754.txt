I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to create elements artificially. In fact, this question came from my interest of this very topic: why aren't there more stable elements? Why is man-made nuclear fusion so hard? Isn't it possible to make some sort of superheavy element by smashing two neutron stars together? Is there any other way we could get an atom with even higher atomic number than uranium (which has 92 protons)? Or even have atoms join in groups? Such as 2 heliums staightened out into one helium nucleus? Or adding several hydrogen nuclei until you've formed something like [helion] (URL0)? Sorry if these are dumb questions... Forget about for example fissioning heavy metals, which only yields isotopes at most 1 million times heavier than our own. Achieving what they did so incredibly long ago was extremely difficult - the last time it happened naturally was around 300 millions years ago! And yes, before then, neutrons were not produced in large amounts. So right now, all attempts to create new and more massive elements fail miserably since even when they fuse hundreds of thousandsmillions of them together, just a few grams can be obtained; imagine trying to reach your goal while carrying a 100kg backpack: You'll never make it.
