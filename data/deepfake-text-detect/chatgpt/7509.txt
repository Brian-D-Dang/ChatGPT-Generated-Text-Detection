One counter-argument to this opinion is that GMOs (genetically modified organisms) have been developed to address certain agricultural challenges such as pests and crop diseases, and to provide higher yield and nutritional value. By manipulating specific genes, scientists can develop crops that are more resistant to pests and diseases, which then minimize the amount of pesticides and herbicides farmers have to apply- reducing harmful impacts to the environment. Also, due to the increasing human population, it's becoming more difficult to provide adequate food for everyone- GMOs have the potential to help address this concern by generating more yield per acre of planted crops. With scientific advancements and strict regulation and testing, GMOs have the potential to be useful and safe for human consumption, while reducing negative consequences to the environment.
