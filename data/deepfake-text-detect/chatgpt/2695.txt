Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if they were 100 accurate (which is unlikely), it wouldn't affect me as much because not all of our money would be spent on make-up or heels but also because women are still more likely than men to spend their own earned money for those things anyway. The fact remains though that these issues are very real for many people - especially young girls who see the world through a lens that doesn't include male beauty ideals being held up as ideal at every turn. The makeup industry has been criticized for making unrealistic expectations about how men should look while trying to sell products like foundation and concealer - putting pressure on men to meet these standards as well which can lead to serious body image problems in a society where both genders feel pressured towards certain physical features. Men need high quality, natural looking skin care too; we don't just wear cologne to cover up bad breath. This needs to change. Women shouldn't get away with selling themselves short simply by virtue of having smaller hips. And I really hope this article inspires you guys to ask your significant other what exactly she thinks makes her beautiful instead of telling them "because you love me!"
