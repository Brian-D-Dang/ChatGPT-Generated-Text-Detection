To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific harm or cruelty caused by the products available in our supermarkets. Despite this, there are many people who would rather live with their pets than be forced to buy something that is not good for them (but it isn't bad). Animal welfare remains important to us because it is vital to ensure protection of the health of all creatures when eating foods that do not meet our nutritional needs. The human body functions like any other organism - its organs, muscles, blood vessels, arteries and veins - so that each one of those parts has proper nutrition. In fact, most humans have adequate levels of water, carbohydrates and fats, as needed. However, such food source has been polluted over time to kill off these elements within a short span of time. Craig Fairbairn is the executive director of Aotearoa Council, a national association of food manufacturers, farmers and retailers, which represents more than 57,000 suppliers across New Zealand. He emphasises the importance of healthy living and encourages everyone to increase their consumption of animal products if they wish to make serious progress towards sustainable business models.
