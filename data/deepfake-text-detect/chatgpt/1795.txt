I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends . It doesn't even have a hint of bitter aftertaste in my mouth, which is kind of sad. Well it's good that your taste buds are developing normally then!
