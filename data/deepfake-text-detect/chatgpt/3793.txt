This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don't think alien life exists elsewhere in our universe and even here, then it must be our current understanding that we live in a simulation. You do realize this argument was made by someone who claimed to see aliens? Not just some random person?
