Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and as such have no business being here. The next time they are not able to afford a lawyer to do their paperwork, they may find that they can't pay for them instead of having to pay money back on the costs. I think this will be an issue with all the immigration agents who try to keep their jobs these days. I am assuming that when one person goes through visa fraud, there's just as much chance of it happening again than if they go into another country without having passed the test. It would also be more difficult to get involved in helping out someone else. British immigration is so unprofessional let alone legal. That said, let me say this- what happens when you admit your first cousin has a criminal record? What happens when heshe gets deported to England?!?
