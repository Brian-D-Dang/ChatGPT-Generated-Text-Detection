From a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin). It's not like the guy didn't have the best ideas, but he's so personally unimportant that he's not even on the dollar. The new 20 bill shows James A. Garfield, a former infamous bank robber, and the mystery of what made him a hero. The new design takes into account that the figure is a little too familiar and also makes reference to a series of robberies in the 1880s. Among the most memorable is the last robbery of the banking district of Kansas City.
