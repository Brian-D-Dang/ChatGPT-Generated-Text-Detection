I'm referring to this news story about the incident at the community pool in McKinney TX. You can reference it here, the video is down the page and is approximately 1:07 into that article (linked below). Anyways...this kid gets kicked out of a public swimming facility for putting on an outfit which was deemed "menacing" because he had short shorts but long sleeves while playing basketball with his friends after school hours....that's right kids! He got booted from there just cause some people thought they might have seen him do something wrong based upon their own personal opinions alone without looking any further or seeing what actually happened before deciding someone should be punished simply by virtue as being male regardless if those observers are even qualified enough themselves under Texas law ( I doubt many judges would allow them) to make such decisions anyway..... no one askedsaid anything when these two girls who were caught shoplifting doing illegal drugs went through security unchallengedly eitherjust gave em' boys clothes so nobody notices ya know? Are you kidding me?! Does anyone else see how ridiculous all ovahere??!!
