In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me when we were growing up about politics, religion, atheism, etc... Her name was Sandra Johnson, and she was a young girl who died of leukemia in her early teens after being exposed to high levels of aluminum exposure during childhood vaccinations. Her parents had their own children vaccinated against other diseases at that time (ie: tetanus) and they got angry with the doctors for making them do it. They became super-conservative Christians themselves (no matter what happened there). And they went on to get Jenny McCarthy's book (Supervising Vaccination) so they could lecture us more about vaccines (and later make fun of Jenny for not knowing anything about the science behind vaccination.) I don't know too much about Jenny McCarthy but I have heard about her from my friends. But I knew nothing about her before then. So when I saw her on TV the other day, I thought "Oh yeah! She must exist!" And yes, she does. She has a new movie in theaters right now called The New World Order which features a scene where she says something along the lines of how lethal vaccines are and how those responsible for creating these things should rot in prison. I was watching this movie on Netflix earlier today and I wanted to share this bit below so you can see what she said herself if you haven't seen it yet. The scene opens showing Sandra getting a shot of some sort as an infant. Then another young woman is shown getting the same shot. I think they're both Sandra? Who knows? We never find out. But we hear Jenny say "You need two shots." That tells us she's talking about the vaccine, correct? So why did one person need two shots while her other sister was given just one? And why wasn't she told to go back and get a second shot since she'd already had the first one?? It turns out that Sandra was pregnant. Well, it turns out that once she gave birth to her daughter 38 years ago she developed ovarian cancer and died almost immediately from it. While other kids had just a mild reaction to the injection, Sandra got quite sick and died childless soon thereafter. Turns out she also had autism according to her parents - autistic like symptoms that mimic her condition as well. She was also a geneticist and knew all about autism. So perhaps she was put into good companies by government scientists in order to study the effects of childhood immunizations on our health. After all, a doctor shouldn't inject someone to become ill even though they've been injected. Right??? Sandra believes that poor parenting caused her death, which likely killed her mother as well. The family swore off medical doctors until they found a reputable Christian chiropractor who still treated Sandra privately. He recommended that she avoid vaccines, and to use alternative treatments instead. This was fine until she contracted pneumonia and died of breast cancer several months later after having had the flu shot twice last year. This is the point I started thinking about how all of this relates to politics, religion, and atheism. Just how many times did Sandy's parents tell her to stay away from certain kinds of harmful drugs or foods as a kid but never got their own medicine shot? Or maybe told the doctor if she did something wrong or lied about something else, would he be forced to shut his practice down forever and lose everything that made him special? These days, most doctors will no longer give anyone antibiotics over the phone rather than prescribing them over the counter at home. Why? Because the antibiotic resistance gene that comes from prophylactics makes the bug resistant to any drug. Sure, it might kill you faster. I'm sure that happens every other night. But it doesn't mean it won't kill you. It also means that your life will be worse if you die from a bacterial infection. Most new antibiotics are anti-bacterial anyway, meaning they attack bacteria without attacking parasites or viruses, which means they usually kill you before you get the chance to develop resistant bugs to begin with. Now THAT'S dangerous stuff. You read about it here. But my question is - Would you trust a doctor who prescribed antibiotics over the phone? A doctor who placed antibiotics over the telephone over your dead body? I really hope you wouldn't. Because it's probably a better way for a disease to spread than via contaminated needles, syringes, or cups. My mom used to always recommend Avon products to me when I needed hair products. Which meant I bought tons of stupid crap from the 90s Avon catalog. One of the items I bought was a product called "A Day Without Sun," which promised to protect your skin from UV rays and let it heal itself from sunburns. I figured since my complexion was fair that I didn't need sunscreen anyway. On one occasion I showed up to work at 9am wearing this terrible apric salt greenish thing. People did not, however, they asked me to leave. How dare they Asian high school North lim island island of cis coal
