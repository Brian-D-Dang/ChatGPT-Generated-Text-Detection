This is a problem I always encounter when I drive on a highway. The speed limit in the most used highway where I live is 70. I usually go at least 80 and sometimes even 90 (when there are no cops, traffic jams or something). It's easy to see that everybody behind me thinks it's ok because there are not many cars around which goes slower than my car (maybe one every few minutes), so they don't really care if heshe would be late by 5 minutes as long as your driving well above the limit. To enforce this law we have radar detectors, you can just claim "I wasn't speeding" but with those devices still nobody cares about that... what happens then? If somebody gets caught for going 85 on some highways... will people start getting tickets all over the city? Will police get more frustrated? Wait until someone dies from an accident caused by other drivers who went above speed limits without any consequences? And how do you prove "I wasnt speeding"? Even if it is clear the "speeder" had their device turned off while speeding, maybe they were only doing 60mph instead of 75mph. Do you think the driver has anything to worry about with having his license suspended for 3 months because he could afford 1k to buy a Radar Detector? Thats right! You actually believe that! LOLOLOL!!! All these questions and answers make sense if you consider yourself innocent yet knowing everything else there is to know about laws etc.. They are very hardens considering you're now part of society against everyone else. So why should anyone give him a chance of turning himself into a good citizen before making him pay his dues? It doesn't matter because nobody ever does anything crazy anyway.... Its like playing Monopoly in jail, except real money;)... (it doesnt count anymore) Anyways I started wondering if I'm being paranoid. Is this actually happening anywhere out there? Or am I too far gone to notice stuff like this? In case it matters: I live in USA East Coast (US) Edit 1: As for the comments "what he did was illegal anyways," its not meant to mean the actual fact itself of exceeding legal speeds in certain areas. What is meant here is that under normal circumstances in US it would take much longer time and effort to catch up with such a person compared to what happens in Europe. This means that sooner or later the criminal is gonna act up since nothing bad happened thus far. He is already breaking rules simply because he wants attention. But once again: Why bother? Nobody takes action anyways. Unless you want to read more and educate yourself further. It gives us ALL something to talk about and also shows our ignorance. Edit 2: Forgot to mention: I'm 19 years old. Also tiredness might play a role. Not sure if i made myself clear enough. Read TL;DR Also found this article on Consumerist interesting Any feedback appreciated:) A: There are two ways of looking at things. One way focuses on the legality of a given situation - this looks at whether the law says a particular thing is allowed or prohibited. An example would be, say hypothetically speaking, that you are riding down a street at night and spot another vehicle approach in front of you. Should you stop to avoid hitting them? In general, the answer is yes, otherwise you may hit them. However, the absence of specific language stating that stopping is required makes it unclear whether you need to stop, and provides a nice opportunity for argumentation but isn't one supposed to yield?. So the first way to look at things is to determine what the law states about each scenario presented. The second way of thinking about things is to refer to common human behavior. This suggests that reasonable persons for whom the law was written tend towards obeying the letter of the law regardless of personal feelings. Thus, if you feel inclined to violate the law based solely upon what is stated within the text of the statute, then chances are you probably shouldn't. Now, a ruling from the highest court regarding the interpretation of a law wouldn't necessarily apply to you personally, but nonetheless speaking generally the idea is that if you follow through with violating laws you find inconvenient despite strong moral objections to doing so, then you aren't likely to respect authority figures in power. Instead, being able to assert your own rights to freedom of choice allows you better access to resources ranging from information about criminals to choosing appropriate employers and friends.
