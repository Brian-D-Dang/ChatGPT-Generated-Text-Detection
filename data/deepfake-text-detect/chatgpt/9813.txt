I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the ranking when other films of the same directorstudio are ranked much lower. The main reason why Spirited Away is so highly ranked is because it is widely considered to be one of the best animated films ever made. It has a unique story, memorable characters, beautiful animation and music, and has been praised by critics and audiences alike. The film won an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film and is often cited as a masterpiece of Japanese cinema. Additionally, the film has become a cultural phenomenon, inspiring numerous works of art, merchandise, and even theme parks. It's also become a staple of Studio Ghibli's library and has been re-released multiple times over the years. All of these factors have contributed to its high ranking in IMDb's rankings.
