One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? I dont think so either since the college education system in America should be free from the government forcing colleges and universities to provide educational services at will or teachers having their students pay for them by filling out paper forms which cost money because they have no option but to take what ever course offered to fill the form on behalf of their students edit: grammar
