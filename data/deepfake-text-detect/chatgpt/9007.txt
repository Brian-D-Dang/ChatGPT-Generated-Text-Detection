By "practical reason," I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election. I admit it's not always straightforward, but sometimes people do do better when they see proof that their actions are motivated by an objective justification than with evidence based reasons. If the motives behind your votes were simply the result of something other than a lack of understanding or belief in what the politicians are doing, then it wouldn't have been surprising if you didn't know exactly how much that was going to hurt your chances for being elected anyway. I can attest to having voted against Obama many times while I am still running. Not only is there no way around this, although most of those who have voted for Obama tend to agree with me on some points: his handling of the Iraq War has caused quite a bit of chaos; he is far too busy focusing on his own personal issues to be affected by global warming; he has made the Iran nuclear deal so bad, that it results in him turning away from saving American lives, not exactly helping us fight ISIS, which we all know should never happen because we are about to push out our friends and foe from the Middle East; and yet, if we wait long enough to finally start fighting the Islamic State (ISIS) terror group before it gets in our way again, we will start to see how the country really works - not as someone wanting to end terrorism but rather one willing to help it create more trouble, to bring its leaders down. With regard to my opponent Rick Perry, I don't think the question you ask directly relates to whether the measure passed would make any difference at all. The issue here is precisely the same answer, if the man is reelected. In my opinion, he will win with less enthusiasm and less traction. He knows that his legacy means nothing. And frankly, I don't care who wins. You don't need me to tell you exactly where our differences lie. So, this is a question we'll discuss in greater depth later today. But as always, please let me know if you find anything interesting, there is plenty of debate over who passed the bill!
