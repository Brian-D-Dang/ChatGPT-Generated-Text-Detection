After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read my share of fictional works but those are really just recollections from other times in my life (I worry that this happens with real accounts as well). Nonfiction offers me some new perspectives on whatever subject it's about; however when I get tired or bored while reading such a book I don't want to continue because every now and then I find myself wondering why I'm doing all of this. While history reads like a textbook it can also be quite entertaining especially if you're into war stories. So many people casually write these down which makes them available for free download too; they aren't even hard copies so there isn't much value in photocopying one unless you need something for long-term storage purposes... For example, I saw a documentary once where two brothers were documenting their experience traveling around India during the 1990s by taking photographs of everyday objects; everything was rather mundane except for the fact that most of what we would consider "ugly" have been made beautiful through photography. For instance, in Pune the houses no longer resemble concrete structures since they started using brick in the 1970s but at times remnants of old bricks still remain outside homes nowadays due to unavailabilitycost involved in building newer ones compared to older constructions..
