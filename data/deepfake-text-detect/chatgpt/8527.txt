CMV: ISIS isn't about the US, it isn't about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isn't about us, and to an extent its not even really a Western issue (unless your in Europe where they have been taking advantage for years), but more so just like those oil wars that are going on all over Africa right now - unless you're directly involved then no one needs too care: Geez people get off their high horse! I'm talking facts here...Listen closely what this guy is saying....He's telling some truths!!! Where do we decide if someone has done something wrong? Do innocent lives mean nothing?! If he were Muslim would anyone be concerned as well??
