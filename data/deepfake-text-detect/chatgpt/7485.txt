While apples and oranges are both healthy and nutritious fruits, it's challenging to definitively say that one is better than the other. Each fruit has its unique taste and nutritional benefits. Oranges are rich in Vitamin C, which boosts the immune system and improves skin health. Apples, on the other hand, are high in fiber and antioxidants, which help regulate blood sugar levels, and reduce the risk of cancer and heart disorders. Ultimately, the choice between apples and oranges comes down to personal preference and the nutritional requirements of an individual's body. Conclusively, it's a subjective preference, and neither fruit can be deemed as 'better' than the other.
