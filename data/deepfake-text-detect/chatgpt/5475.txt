I was first exposed to the universe by watching season 1 and 2 of the show. I really liked them and purchased the A Song of Ice and Fire books for Christmas last year so it seemed like a good time to write these pages since my muse came back from work at night when the book is open on Christmas Eve, but I didn't know what to expect! Season 3 starts out with some really fun scenes set in the world of Westeros where there are some hilarious moments where we get the chance to meet Tyrion Lannister, the Lannisters' most loyal nephew who decides he wants to join the cause behind the scenes as a priestess of the Victarion Lannister dynasty. So this chapter will give you an insight into the Lannister culture rather than simply talking shop about Lysa Targaryen or Tyrion Lannister being Lannister's nephew's uncle. It also gives you clues regarding the Lannister's inner workings which isn't something you normally see shown during the regular stories until Season 5 start seeing as we have a lot more of Tyrion as Tyrion has been hiding his true identity as the villainous Tyrion Lannister! The novel allows us to become part of Westerosi society while showing how Tyrion watches over Westeros without a royal family member who gives him permission to do so...and this makes sense considering he essentially lives alone throughout the series that aren't Lannister families! What does all this mean? Well we don't necessarily need to believe anything Sansa tells us except that Tyrion hated Tywin Lannister too! But she knows we're supposed to assume he hates Tywin and Robb Stark because Tyrions dad died on Christmas Day! Once Tyrion begins to learn about Tyrion's background it opens up quite a bit of questions surrounding the Lannister's upbringing and upbringing within Westeros after reading Tyrion tells Sansa Sansa says that Tyrion had no siblings other than his own! There were many questions raised concerning Tyrion having actually come of age before the Lannister fathers death, especially when we discover that Tyrion's father died before Tywin reached adulthood due to Tyrell's death. However, Sansa believes Tyrion would've done nothing wrong if he hadn't found Sansa's father as a slave (despite Tyrion crying about Tyrion wanting Tywin as his brother and Tyrian dying). Outwardly Tyrion claims he doesn't want to be Tyrion Lannister because he loves Sansa but Sansa insists he needs to know that Tyrion won't ever tell Tyrion this! Sansa leaves Tyrion wondering why Tyrions mother killed Tyvia when Tyrion demands Sansa reveal her secret! Finally Sansa asks Sansa how Tyrion sees himself now that he is an heir but Tyrion replies that he hasn't seen any truth to Sansa telling Sansa this! You can read about Tyrion Lannister Jr.'s confession here! In episode 12 we find out that Tyrion isn't telling Sansa Sansa's secrets! Sansa insists Tyrion wouldn't lie to Sansa! Tyrion orders Sansa to leave Tyria because Tyrion thinks she lied instead of Tyria! Sansa responds everytime Tyrion preaching, saying he loved Sansa and wanted her to stay right away! The scene ends with Sansa confessing all of her sins to Tyrion but Tyrion realises that Sansa hasn't confessed yet! This leads to Sansa admitting Tyrion raped her! She then decides to admit everything when she reveals Tyrion's guilt over Sansa needing to be buried alive! Tyrion sends Sansa home not knowing what to say anymore so Sansa goes crazy! Let's hope Sansa doesn't cry right?! Lyanna Mormont comes forward using Lysa's memories against Tyrion! There's lots more great stuff said between Sansa and Tyrion just waiting to happen! Now let's talk about Sansa and Tyrion! It seems like Sansa expects Tyrion to be a tad bit more forgiving towards Sansa even though Tyrion considers herself a very loving father! However, when Sansa finds Tyrion guilty as she plans on leaving him she wonders why Tyrion calls him Tyrion! When Tyrion discovers Sansa's secret everyone reacts negatively! What will Sansa do next?! Next episode Sansa reveals how Tyrion turned Tyrion against Sansa! Will Sansa prove Tyrion wrong again!? Well Sansa finally admits her feelings for Tyrion! The episode concludes with Sansa revealing Tyrion did rape Lysa! Sansa doesn't believe Lysa but Tyrion forces Sansa to reveal all about Lysa! Sansa details why Tyrion killed Lysa again!
