This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes.... I am a conservative. I believe in the right to bear arms. I believe in the Lord. I think we should treat everyone with respect, and that we should see each other as human beings with emotions. I believe the conservative movement has gone too far, and we should have more common sense and unity.
