This is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in X-Men: The Last Stand], and then some stories that were actually pretty cool when the creators came to us. They said they wanted to make something about it after seeing some of these references. For example there's an interview that someone posted on twitter that showed the character H-H in the comics. Now I don't know if it was intentional or not but that was one of my favorite scenes from X-Men: Days of Future Past! I feel like this should be a really cool comic, especially as a sequel to the first book's... well, you have to wait until that last issue for a crossover with the series. That being said, it would definitely be cool to see Hyperion andor Hyperion again together! (Photo credit: Marvel Comics)
