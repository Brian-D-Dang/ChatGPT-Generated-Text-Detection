I realize the OP is a bit vague, so let me clarify. Similar to false advertising, I believe that people who release lies (in a publishable, marketable format). This includes spreading fake news or misinformation, can be held liable for their actions. While freedom of speech is an important right, it doesn't give individuals the right to harm others by spreading lies or deceiving them. It is essential to hold people accountable for their actions, especially when their actions have the potential to cause harm or negative consequences. In cases where damages have been caused, individuals should have access to legal remedies to hold those responsible financially liable. It's important to ensure that people are publicly held accountable for their actions so that others can learn from their mistakes and avoid similar behavior in the future.
