Scientists widely accept that climate change is real. Consequently, they say that it will lead to extreme weather, a raise in the sea level, increased acidity of the ocean, reduced biodiversity and more frequent natural disasters. The economic cost associated with those consequences could be devastating: In 2015 alone, global warming-related damages were estimated at 350 billion (300bn). However, many economists argue against such conclusions because research fails to show whether natural or manmade factors - known as externalities - are responsible for most changes observed in our planet's environment over recent decades. For example, some studies suggest that changes brought about by human activities result only from 1 to 7. This means that 97-99 of these phenomena may have been produced naturally. This new study suggests one reason why scientists do not find conclusive proof regarding humans' influence on nature and its impact on us all can be found within their own field itself. The researchers analyzed how previous studies presented data relating to temperature rises when comparing temperature observations between 1850 and 2014 with projections made using climate models used to project future climates based on different scenarios projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) through 2070. They did so before reanalyzing the same dataset looking into three categories defined according to IPCC guidelines. Those included "very likely" estimates; "likely" ones backed up by 90; and 50-50 odds where experts disagree. It was this second stage which revealed serious flaws in existing methods employed during scientific investigations. According to the authors, biased reporting could give an impression that current temperatures correspond much better than expected to what has already occurred historically. But if you look at historical records carefully enough, there might also appear periods where anomalies seem higher than usual due purely to randomness rather than being caused by anything else, explains Veronique Massonnet, coauthor of the article published recently Nature Oceanography. As she says, "These biases affect both observational data and model simulations."
