Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.] It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to five years in prison. Under the The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved legislation that would make lying to federal law enforcement officers a misdemeanor punishable by up to five years in prison. The bill, sponsored by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), would have the maximum sentence for lying to federal agents reduced from five years to two years. The bill, which is expected to be signed by President Barack Obama, would expand the current law to include more than one agency. It also would require federal agents to receive special training in dealing with witnesses, and would require the use of "confidentiality agreements" with witnesses.
