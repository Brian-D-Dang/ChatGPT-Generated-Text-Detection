Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between the rich and poor. This idea requires high standards of humanity that do not just exist within capitalism but also within other capitalist systems which have been ignored by society as well. The utopian dream will never happen unless we all accept that inequality exists at every levelthe principle of equality applies everywhere except China and because it is clearly defined for everyone regardless of economic status, race or gender. This concept needs to be understood so that people can determine what value they bring to our lives; nobody should be punished when millions die under communism alone.
