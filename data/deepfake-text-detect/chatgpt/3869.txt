After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific way. In particular, I am thinking about the atheist philosopher Sam Harris who is known for being outspoken when it comes to his belief that we have no idea what consciousness really means. What do you think? What do you think? Free will could not possibly be true because there is no mindbrain split to make sense of anything whatsoever! How can something that cannot even be defined exists?
