First of all, I want to first express how happy I am with this subreddit. It has always been a hub for civilized discussion on complicated and difficult topics. I would like to thank you for helping me find the answers that helped get me through my anxiety attacks during my period when I was having suicidal thoughts or depression alone because it had outlived reasons such as the help from others who knew what I needed so much more than myself (and even though my husband wasn't there). Thank you! You have made my day!! You're welcome! I'm glad you enjoyed it:) Until next time
