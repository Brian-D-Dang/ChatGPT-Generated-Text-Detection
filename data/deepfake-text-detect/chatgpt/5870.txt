Most colleges do not require trigonometry for admissions, and do not require students to take a trigonometry course. It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math section of its test, so I believe that the SAT should be modified so that trigonometry is not necessary to perform well on it. Many students do not have the math skills necessary to take trigonometry, so they are not able to perform well on the SAT. It also requires more time for students to learn trigonometry than if they were to learn just basic math skills. On top of that, trigonometry is not useful in everyday life. Instead, basic math is important in everyday life. Therefore, I strongly support the removal of trigonometry from the SAT.
