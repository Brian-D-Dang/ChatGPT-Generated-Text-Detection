There are several counter-arguments to refute the opinion that marriage is intrinsically religious and should be removed from government and changed to "civil union." Firstly, while marriage may have its roots in religious traditions, it has evolved to be recognized as a legal and social institution that provides numerous benefits and protections to couples, regardless of their religious affiliation. These benefits and protections cannot be fully replicated by a mere civil union. Secondly, allowing same-sex couples to marry does not impede on the religious freedom of those who believe in traditional heterosexual marriage. Religious institutions are still free to follow their own traditional practices and can choose not to recognize same-sex marriages within their own organization. Lastly, changing the name of marriage to civil union for same-sex couples creates a separate and unequal system that further marginalizes and stigmatizes members of the LGBTQ community. Marriage equality means recognizing that love between two individuals, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation, deserves equal protection under the law.
