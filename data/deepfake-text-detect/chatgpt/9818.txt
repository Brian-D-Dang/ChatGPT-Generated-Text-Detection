I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that are in competition with the party that created the advertisement. This is common practice during elections and campaigns. It is intended to give the public a negative impression about the opponent, in order to make their own candidate look better in comparison. This type of advertising can be seen as unethical because it does not present an accurate and unbiased representation of the opposing candidate or party, and instead tries to discredit them by presenting only the most negative aspects of their platform or personality.
