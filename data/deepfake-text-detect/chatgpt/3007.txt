I'll allow that, in most cases, the misbehaving kid is just throwing a temper tantrum, but what do you do in cases where the kid has thrown himself on the ground and started writhing around? If your answer was "just walk away from him," then I'd say this joke only works if you've got an audience of people who have never had kids. Yes, because everyone knows how to handle every child ever.
