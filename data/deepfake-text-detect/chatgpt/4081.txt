Oat blenders. Mini spooners. Coco roos. Honey Scooters. You know them. You see them in the cereal section of any grocery store. They are in giant bags in a metal box at the end of the aisle. They're so cute! And they look like fun, too: They make great gifts and also will save you money on food if you can avoid snacking on cereal all day long. I think that's happening most days here lately... Well, not really, but it feels like it. I was thinking about this yesterday as I watched my children eat breakfast. One thinks she is going to be sick by 9 am everyday until we figure out what the problem is (and who told her) but then another one says he doesn't feel well after lunch and he only eats Little Debbie snack bars for dinner and now he says he has "no energy." He never had energy before either - why would he? Right? So, where did all these kids come from? Did someone give them soda when they were babies? Or maybe they just have a different set of genes!?! Anyway, the point is, they need variety. They need snacks with more calories than cereal so they won't get fat or get hungry again later. If we stop buying cereal they are probably going to start getting bored of eating what ever they can find instead of the same old thing every morning. So, while many people enjoy their daily bowl of Cheerios, we want to keep the kids' options open and varied.
