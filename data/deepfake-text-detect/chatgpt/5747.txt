First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person, so I'll make some comments and see if anyone wants to weigh in. I'm pretty sure that my mom told me that I should never leave a child alone in a car, even if it's just for a moment. My mom also said she would never leave her kids alone in a car. Ahem, she did. But I'm not going to hold that against her. I am a little surprised that it took all of 10 minutes to call for help, and I am surprised that the neighbors didn't see anything. I know that I wouldn't be able to sleep at all, just thinking about this little girl, who was probably scared out of her mind. It would be one thing if she were asleep, but if she was awake, I'd be a basket case. I don't know if it's because I'm not a parent, but I find it so strange that a neighbor would call the police to report a missing child, rather than the parents. The most disturbing part of the story is that the parents were apparently drinking, and, according to the story, the parents are now in custody. As I said, I'm not a parent, but I'm not sure what kind of lesson I'd want my kids to take from this. I mean, what do you say to them, if you do find them? I think that I'd want my kids to know that this is a dangerous thing to do, and that they shouldn't ever do it again, but I don't know how I'd explain what happened.

I'm not a parent, and I don't have kids, but I know that it's dangerous to leave a child alone in a car, even if it's just for a moment. I'm not sure why the parents left the child in the car for so long. Maybe they were distracted, maybe they had other things to do, maybe they just didn't think it was a big deal, or maybe they did all of those things. In any case, it's a big deal. I'm sure that the child was scared out of her mind. My mom told me that she would never leave her kids in the car, and I'm sure she wouldn't. But it happened.

I've got it set up to post a draft, but I still can't post it. I've tried restarting my phone, but it still doesn't work. I haven't had any luck through the WordPress app either.

I was going through some of my pictures and I realized that I had some really interesting videos, so I'm posting some of them here. I'll try to post some more later.

The first thing I did was try to install one of the Amazon Kindle apps, so I could buy books from Amazon, but none of them worked. I was able to download and install the Amazon Kindle app for iOS, so I think that it's just a problem with the Google Nexus 7. I was also able to install the Google Play Store, and I've downloaded a few things. I tried Angry Birds, but it didn't work. I'm pretty sure that the reason it didn't work was because I didn't have the Google Play Store installed at the time. I'll try it again later. I tried to download a few things from the Amazon Kindle store, and the first one I tried didn't work. The next one did, but it was only 2 pages. That wasn't very much, but I did it just to see if it worked. The other app I tried was a book
