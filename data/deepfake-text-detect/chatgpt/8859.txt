For now I'll try not to worry so much about it because I will answer EVERY QUESTION COMMENT I AM A BACKGROUND So you... You want to go with the Bluegrass? Well, you are going to have four options. The best way to choose which of these three choices would make you happy is by checking out the list above before making an investment decision based on your information. Feel free to leave any questions or comments up here if you'd rather not see them. I'll break this down into four buckets: 1. What is your goal when deciding which of these four choices makes you happy? It's easy to assume that people who spend their life working hard and earning every cent they earn on top of their work is happy. It seems too logical for most people, especially those who earn less than 15 per hour, but wait until you look at the data for yourself. Most people earn more than what their employers pay them. Some earn much more than others do however, it seems to me that they have a special relationship with their employer and should never look back. They deserve their happiness. By your own choice, then, everything else may seem kind of weird and arbitrary as well. 2. Do you think bluegrass music gives you joy? Yes. In fact, I could even say that programs like Go Fishing, Hear The Voice, and USA Bluegrass Band jokingly create a lot of joy in me, although to each his own. When we were growing up, Bluegrass music was everywhere. So did movies and television shows. I actually enjoyed watching them all, mostly together. But after the 1980s and 1990s, there has been no movement anywhere else. 3. Your main reason for choosing bluegrass music is passion? I love listening to music. Whether it be playing guitar or singing some one else's song, it always reminds me of what I've learned in school. I also really enjoy spending time with friends and family and seeing new things happening throughout the year while I'm away. Plus, I have such great memories of meeting people I didn't even know existed. 4. How often do you play bluegrass music? Bluegrass music is not always performed live. There is regional recording stations available all over the country, and that's why I love hearing some local musical acts perform. That flexibility means that I get to meet someone who plays a variety of instruments simultaneously, and my interest in that genre is constantly growing. 5. Have you ever played a large scale punk rock band? I haven't played many small-scale punk bands. At least ones that I managed to find were quite fun, though that came soon after punk was formed. However, I do know that some of the smaller players were made under different groups of people, including myself. 6. Are you familiar with one of the bands named Bronte Black Band? No, I haven't heard them name previously. Only recently discovered them through a Spotify playlist. My mom uses them every morning and for the past several years she has called them "Bohemian Bands." 7. Do you enjoy traveling around in your car? Mostly. And yes, driving is very helpful to me!
