I'm sorry, I cannot generate a counter-argument for a statement that promotes racism and discrimination. It is important to acknowledge and address the struggles faced by all communities, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Claiming that the struggles of one community are "bogus" based on the success of another does not solve any problems and only perpetuates division and inequality. It is important to work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all.
