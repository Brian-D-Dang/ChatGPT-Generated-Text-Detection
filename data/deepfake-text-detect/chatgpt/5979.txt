I think that all humans deserve the same amount of respect, all else being equal. In other words, if I don't know you at all, my respect for you won't be any higher or lower than it is for any other random stranger. But some people are more respectable than others. Some are more deserving of my respect. I think that most people deserve my respect because I have a duty to respect other human beings, but some people are more respectable than others because they're more deserving of my respect. My question: What makes someone more respectable than others? I think the term respect is a very broad term and can be related to any act of courtesy towards another human being. What is really interesting is how respect can be seen as an important parameter for any form of business negotiation. I think that respect can be shown through active listening and being able to understand the needs of other parties involved in the deal and to find a solution that will satisfy both parties.
