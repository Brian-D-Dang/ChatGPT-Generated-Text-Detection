I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit card debt run a city. The debt was when he entered office and the fact you are making such an issue out of this makes me think we need more people like him in politics who will stand up against BS spending
