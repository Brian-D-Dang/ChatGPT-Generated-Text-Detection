Linux is a hard to learn OS and seems daunting for the average Windows user. Many things on Windows cannot be used on Linux (Distros I have tried were Mint XP, XPPro, XPProLite, and XPPeap..) and very few other open source packages. Linux however is a lightweight and fully viable product. It's the most common Linux distribution on the market and is available for free download. The only thing that would make it all the better is that the software itself is free, and the stock kernel is pretty dated.
