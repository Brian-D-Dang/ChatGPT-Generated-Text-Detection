While it's true that Bernie Sanders is facing tough competition in the Democratic primary, it's important to note that polls have consistently shown him as one of the top contenders. In 2016, he won 23 primaries and caucuses and garnered the support of millions of voters. Furthermore, Bernie Sanders has a loyal and enthusiastic base of supporters who are known for their grassroots organizing and fundraising efforts. This could give him an advantage in the primaries, where voter turnout can be decisive. Lastly, it's worth noting that predictions about presidential elections are inherently uncertain. Many pundits and polling experts were proven wrong in the 2016 election, when Donald Trump won despite trailing in the polls for much of the campaign. While it's true that Bernie Sanders would face significant obstacles if he were to win the Democratic nomination, it's far too early to say with certainty that he could not win the presidency.
