This is a view I've read about from various pop psychology sources, and it has become conventional wisdom. I believe it contains some truth. Can you convince me it merely contains some truth? While it is true that being helpful and assisting others can have numerous positive benefits for both the helper and those being helped, the idea that being constantly helpful is the only path to success or happiness is a flawed one. It is important for individuals to prioritize their own needs and well-being before serving others, as neglecting one's own physical or mental health can lead to burnout and ultimately be detrimental both to themselves and those they are trying to help. Additionally, success and happiness can come in many forms and are not solely dependent on one's willingness to serve others. A person can find fulfillment through their own personal accomplishments, hobbies, or relationships, without necessarily dedicating all their time to assisting others. Furthermore, excessive helpfulness can be counterproductive in certain situations, such as when someone is being taken advantage of or enabling negative behavior. It is important to strike a balance between being helpful to others and maintaining healthy boundaries and standards for oneself. In summary, while being helpful and assisting others can bring about positive outcomes, it is not the only pathway to success or happiness, and it is important to prioritize one's own well-being and find a healthy balance in serving others.
