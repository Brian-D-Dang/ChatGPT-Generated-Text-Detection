Thought about this for days, and I can't think of one aspect of the FPH community that made Reddit better: - They are ignorant: Proven by the overwhelming number of them who have been banned. - They're awful: Proved by their constant spamming on every subreddit they visit (ratheism, rTheDonald...the list goes on). Thought about this for days, and I can't think of one aspect of the FPH community that made Reddit better: It wasn't a matter of making reddit better it was just removing people who were not contributing to anything positive. The fact that some mods did things like ban people because they didn't agree with what they saw as politically incorrect content is another way certain members had tried to make reddit less political.
