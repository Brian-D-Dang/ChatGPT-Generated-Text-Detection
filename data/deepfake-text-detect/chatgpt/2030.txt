First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from a very specific kind of person who has had "the struggle" as you put it in their life...and so it's pretty easy reading between the lines when things are posted about certain kinds of jobs or industries they have worked (or are working) within? Is there any way those people could be filtered out?
