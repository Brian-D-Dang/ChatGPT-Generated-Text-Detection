A possible counter-argument to refute the opinion that the disappearance of religion would not reduce violence is that religion is often used as a justification or motivation for violent acts, both historically and in contemporary times. Many wars, conflicts, and acts of terrorism have been fueled, if not caused, by religious beliefs and animosities. While other factors such as politics, economics, or ideology can also trigger violence, removing the religious element could de-escalate some of the most intractable and divisive conflicts. Moreover, religion can also inspire peace, tolerance, and cooperation, so the loss of religion could also harm positive aspects of human culture and morality. Therefore, it is unlikely that the disappearance of religion would have no effect on the prevalence and intensity of violence in society.
