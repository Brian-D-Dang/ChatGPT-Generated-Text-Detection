Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as usual the opinion prevails only in those cases where the opposition is weak or non existent. Hi there - how are you? Just wondering what your thoughts on this are.
