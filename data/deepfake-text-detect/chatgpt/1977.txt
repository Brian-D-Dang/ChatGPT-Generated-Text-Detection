So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern conservatism is based around putting responsibility back in people's hands; taking away their rights and making them dependant upon an ever-expanding state isn't very libertarian at all - it just creates a different kind of dependency (the government dependent). Surely if you're responsible enough not to need public assistance then that should mean your vote counts more than someone who needs help from the system? It doesn't seem quite fair that they would get equal power over others when one group has no use or reason to stay out of society while the other wants nothing else except that freedom given
