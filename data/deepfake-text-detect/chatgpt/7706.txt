Respectfully, I must disagree with your opinion. All forms of sexual violence, regardless of the gender of the victim, are severe and traumatic experiences that can have long-lasting effects on a person's physical and psychological wellbeing. Just because men are often perceived as being strong, it does not mean they are immune to the trauma of sexual violence. Furthermore, male survivors of sexual violence often face unique challenges such as societal stigma, lack of support resources, and a feeling of emasculation. It is important to create safe and inclusive spaces for all survivors of sexual violence, regardless of gender, and provide the necessary resources for healing and recovery.
