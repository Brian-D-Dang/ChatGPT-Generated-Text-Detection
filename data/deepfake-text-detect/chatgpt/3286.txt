The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, and we have many theories about how it might have happened. The most widely accepted scientific theory is the Big Bang theory, which suggests that the universe began as a super-hot and dense singularity, about 13.8 billion years ago. However, there are still many unanswered questions about what came before the Big Bang, and how the universe evolved to its current state. Scientists continue to explore these questions through further observations and experiments, and we can hope to gain a better understanding of the origins of the universe in the future.
