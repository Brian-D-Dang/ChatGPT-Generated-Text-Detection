Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of black Americans, my first thought is: That's a lot harder than you think! The reason for this is that if we define success as "the percentage of X" where X represents some feature such as female scientists or political leaders then the only thing standing between us and 100 success (which would be a state of mathematical perfection) are biases towards that particular definition of success which favors men over women or white people over non-white people. And it turns out there's a whole world full of bias just waiting to trip us up. Here are some examples... I have no idea how many generations ago most humans were born with breasts - but they must've been pretty small because so few genetic mutations can lead to large breasts these days. Yet all through history the assumption has been that a very common form of breast cancer was caused by mammary glands getting too big [1]. On one level, this seems like an obvious mistake which made sense back when evolution was still going on; after all, fat guys aren't known for having super healthy livers, lungs etc., even though we're genetically wired to live long lives anyway. But now, given our current understanding of genetics, it should be clear that genes don't cause disease directly. They might make sure your body doesn't get sick from something else, for example bacteria infecting the lining of your stomach... but what actually causes diseases itself isn't determined by any single gene mutation. Just imagine that every time someone got food poisoning she became obese due to her body becoming overweight.... then we'd expect lots of obesity related cancers to become more prevalent right? Nope! We find exactly opposite trends. As countries develop, rates of chronic diseases decline while levels of sanitation also improve. The reasons why go beyond biology into economics, culture and history. So it makes perfect biological sense not to treat children who suffer from fatty liver syndrome more aggressively than those suffering from alcohol hepatitis - except for the fact that historically societies without high standards of medical care tended to leave less surviving offspring and therefore pass their smaller genomes along much faster than today's society. Unfortunately, medicine hasn't caught up yet. Even nowadays I know far fewer doctors than nurses. Maybe that will change sometime down the road, at least within developed nations. In the meantime, healthcare costs keep rising, sometimes even exceeding inflation. It gets worse. Doctors and hospitals often prefer older patients to younger ones based purely on economic priorities rather than health considerations. This happened recently in the US, where elderly Medicaid recipients had certain procedures done before young adults were allowed access to them. If you ask me, it shouldn't matter whether a 70 year old man receives dermatological treatment twice a month or once a week. If he needs biopsies or does radiation therapy his life expectancy may well depend upon the frequency. What matters instead, is that everyone benefits equally under law.. including you. After all, rich and poor alike are entitled to equal protection against theft, murder, assault, kidnapping threats, false imprisonment and other crimes and misdemeanors.. regardless of age, race or gender [2]. To put it another way, historically in America women weren't killed simply because they didn't look good enough. But that began changing beginning around 1450 AD, slowly leading, incrementally, inexorably toward this day. Nowadays almost everything created by humanity - vehicles, airplanes, buildings, houses, appliances, clothes, shoes, tools, clothing accessories, furniture, machinery, office supplies, jewelry, paints, household goods, bedding sleeping bags, kitchen utensils, medicines, cars - plus all sorts of electronic devices - computers, mobile phones - seem designed primarily for men. Women don't appear to benefit from being included in the list above. Why? Because aside from the obvious stuff like 'women's' hair products, cosmetics and underwear, companies rarely build better features specifically for females (unless the product is marketed for women). Instead - mainly due to social pressures - products tend to cater to existing tastes in male consumers. Everyone knows it works:) More generally, men spend significantly more money on media advertising than women do. Their powerful egos demand it. So... men have vastly bigger brains than women - which means greater intelligence, creativity and problem solving ability. Do you see where I'm going with this? Men invent things whereas women copy things designed by others. Of course copying is necessary too, otherwise evil geniuses could never create anything new or interesting. Similarly, men write books while women publish poems. Men are famous while women are infamous. You name it, whatever category you want to split the population into - men are more likely to win prizes for best performance of each activity. When women do succeed they usually do so either behind closed doors or completely anonymously. Take talented performers such as musicians, actors actresses.... unless there is extreme monetary incentive attached to fame they won't risk revealing themselves publicly until the day they lean totally h,. Only then. Now, operand, nothing! (no?). , opera:
