I'll allow that, in most cases, the misbehaving kid is just throwing a temper tantrum, but what do you do in cases where the kid has thrown himself on the ground or is physically hurting themselves in some way? If a child is throwing a temper tantrum and has thrown themselves on the ground or is physically hurting themselves, it's important to prioritize their safety first. Try to gently pick them up and move them to a safer place where they can calm down without hurting themselves. If the child is hitting or physically hurting themselves, gently hold their arms or legs to prevent them from injuring themselves further, but don't restrain them too tightly as this can escalate the situation. Once the child is in a safer place, try to talk to them calmly and help them understand that their behavior is not acceptable. Try to figure out the root cause of their behavior and address it if possible. Often, when children are throwing tantrums, it is because they are feeling frustrated or overwhelmed. Offer them a comforting item or hug if that helps, and assure them that you are there for them. It's also important to stay calm and collected yourself and avoid reacting with anger or frustration. Remember that this behavior is a normal part of childhood development, and with patience and empathy, the child can learn to manage their emotions in a healthy way.
