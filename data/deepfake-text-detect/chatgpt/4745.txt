Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of working with children in schools it turns out that there's a lot more to autism than you might expect (and what people don't realize is the autistic traits can be present at any age). I also find myself constantly reading about vaccines because too many people still think they're bad or even dangerous. It makes me sad when I read articles like these: Those papers generally omit facts such as the parent who had an allergic reaction to one vaccine. That could be why he got sick later anyway. Not everyone gets autism from every vaccine either. To whitestuff on drugs, stats show that less infants get hospitalized for ADHD now than before. Guess what happened?! In fact there may not even be much difference between ADHD today and back then so it would make sense that if we've gotten better diagnosing what actually does cause problems then doctors should see fewer cases of ADHD! The same goes for autism; overdiagnosis in particular has led to unnecessary treatment, increased costs permanent labels. Of course no doctor wants patients to develop chronic illnesses but that doesn't mean it isn't happening. Autistic spectrum disorders used to include Asperger's syndrome which only affects 2. Nowadays its up around 5. So yes, autism is getting worse yet some studies say that childhood vaccinations have nothing to do with it while others claim otherwise. If anything, maybe people are becoming more aware of the disorder due to studies showing correlations between it and various infections. Unfortunately most of those reports aren't peer reviewed though. The idea of eliminating vaccination also neglects the herd immunity factor where diseases need large populations to spread without being eliminated themselves. If all adults were allowed to vaccinate themselves against polio alone, it'd eliminate 99.9 of the population within 50 years. Ironically enough, ending mandatory flu shots wouldn't slow down the virus since young healthy individuals already have natural resistance to it. We don't know everything about autism by any means but if you look into research, you'll notice correlation between it and various factors including diet. This shows things aren't necessarily 100 genetic nor do genes provide some kind of magic bullet that cures the majority of us. There's definitely something going on. That said, vaccines shouldn't hurt anyone unless someone else inject them first. Just saying "don't trust government" here because I'm sure no other nation provides universal healthcare anymore. My husband works at the CDC with several other researchers. He tells me that they're trying to figure out ways to increase the number of medical professionals who specialize in ASD and give the condition proper attention. Perhaps they're looking to "fix" this way to justify having to pay millions of dollars simply to keep alive as a society, eh? Unfortunately they haven't done well thus far. My brother is studying astronomy and astrophysics at Miami University right now which leads him to believe they've spent hundreds of thousands of funding per year researching mental illness aka 'mental retardation' rather than properly identifying actual conditions that affect the human body. Plus the efforts towards finding cures for cancer (a disease caused mainly by DNA damage) seem quite limited compared to the almost complete neglect given to brain development during fetal stage (even prior to 9 months), let alone having a section devoted entirely to neurological issues. They've found some kind of cure for leukemia - stem cells apparently have a beneficial impact on everyone - so why couldn't they come up with a similar solution for Autism related issues? In short, the US spends money just as fast in attacking its own citizens through lack of education and the forced sterilization of minorities based on race. Why are we surprised it fails to accomplish the same thing when it comes to our own bodies via medical science? To further elaborate on your point regarding the harm brought upon by early infantile exposure to mercury containing preservatives in thimerosal consisting of ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbons in preparation of multiuse syringes. You must understand that at the time this occurred, the world did not know whether or not the human placenta acted as a barrier to prevent the passage of toxins directly across the placental membrane. A study published in Pediatrics, Feb 1994, showed that maternal blood levels of methyl mercury rose following iatrogenic venous puncture of umbilical cord blood samples at birth, although exact amounts remained unknown. Yet another contemporaneous study published in JAMA indicated that high concentrations of methylmercury resulted in cognitive deficits, motor impairment, memory loss, learning disabilities and decreased IQ scores among newborn babies. All of that information was totally ignored by the FDA until 1999. Whether you want the truth.., Amazon Associates inc.? As rate vox plotter trnal hemas zera jness Us
