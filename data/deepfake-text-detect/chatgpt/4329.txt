I have played Hearthstone since its beta and have had great times with it (I still do). My massive issue with the game is that the current meta relies too heavily on RNG in order to win. I stopped playing because of this not long after launch, but I understand if you want a competetive game there are better options for you. The cube was introduced just before the first expansion (a month or two), so it's not like HS has been in an rng-heavy meta for years now.
