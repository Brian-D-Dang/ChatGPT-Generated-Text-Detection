To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific harm caused by humans (see ). Animal welfare is not just about the welfare of humans though. Animal welfare is also includes the welfare of an ecosystem that provides life support for millions who rely on livestock production in Africa. Animal suffering happens only when humans inflict it here on other species such as elephants, tigers or elephants. Animals suffer if they're abused during their lifetimes because humans don't protect them from their environment. Animals are treated like pests due to these conditions being neglected while humans treat them poorly based on society's acceptance of them as pets. Animals need care; humans don't have this benefit. Animal welfare means protecting our own wellbeing rather than treating us like pests. Many people believe that animals deserve respect simply because they did something bad enough with respect prior to being brought into our lives. The idea of respecting animals through humane treatment has become so ingrained into our culture that we may look at an animal like a threat to society as akin to having rights revoked under the guise of protecting its interests. Animals make up 70 of humanity. They do whatever we want but should be respected for what they truly deserve instead of trying to punish us over irrelevant things such as meat consumption which isn't important anymore thanks to the increasing popularity of veganism. Allowing animals to live freely without regard for human rights violates human dignity and justice immeasurably. Animals deserve proper protection against exploitation too that humanity deserves otherwise many people would kill them all day long. I urge you readers to stop wasting your time thinking animals ought to be treated unequally before giving them the same consideration as humans: compassion does not equal respect.
