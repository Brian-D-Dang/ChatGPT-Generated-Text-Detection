I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically I'm not too concerned about the risks of nuclear power plants - if you're a nuclear engineer, you'd be concerned about the risks of nuclear power plants, so what do you think I'm talking about? They're pretty far from my home in terms of radiation - I'm more worried about the risks involved in the construction of nuclear power plants, and I'm not too concerned about the risks posed by nuclear power plants because of the risks associated with nuclear reactors. Ultimately, I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy, but overall I'm not that worried about the relatively low risks involved with nuclear power, as long as the risks aren't too high for my peace of mind.
