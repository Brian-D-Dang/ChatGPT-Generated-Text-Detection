We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been "thin shamed" or "skinny shamed" by another woman. I don't see how that is possible in American society, It is true that thin or skinny shaming may not seem as prevalent or impactful as other forms of body shaming, such as fat shaming or body shape shaming. However, it is still an issue that some people experience and can be hurtful to those affected. Thin or skinny shaming can take many forms, such as commenting on a person's eating habits, implying that they aren't "real women" because of their size, or making derogatory remarks about their body. No form of body shaming is acceptable, and everyone should be valued and respected regardless of their size or shape. It is important for people to be kind and supportive of one another and avoid making assumptions or judgments based on appearance.
