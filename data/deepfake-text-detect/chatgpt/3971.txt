From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on entitlements and all its attendant consequences; our ancestors thought it was a good idea for us not to live in poverty or be dependent upon government programs like food stamps. We've made progress over the years but we still look at things through this prism: We believe everyone deserves to live in dignity and security without having their needs met by anyone else. In order to achieve that ideal, conservatives must dismantle public services, cut taxes, privatize everything, and create a culture of dependency. Liberals think otherwise: they don't want to create a culture of dependence because they think it tells people that there aren't any consequences for not doing so - and thus discourage them from going down the path to self-sufficiency. They also think that no matter how hard you work, if your success depends entirely on getting assistance, then your chances for happiness will be limited. In essence, these factions are inherently different with regards to the way they approach liberty (particularly freedom). But the beliefs underlying those opinions can often cross over as well...I see many similarities between libertarianism and liberal politics. There is certainly nothing wrong with wanting to promote liberty, but identifying yourself solely with one side of an issue usually results in you taking away more than that side.
