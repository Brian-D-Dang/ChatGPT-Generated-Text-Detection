First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are locked in the mountains of China (spotted catfish), they would be a great asset for our country right now if given proper protection just to name one example. However you feel about them as an animal or their role on earth has no bearing what so ever on whether humanity can succeed at protecting it's home planet from ourselves.
