A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off. [Watch the launch video to understand how dangerous this gadget can be.] What is it? Amazon Echo is a hands-free speaker that you control by voice. What does it do? The Echo is a wifi-connected, always-listening device with a far-field microphone array. It can respond to your voice commands by searching the web. This is cool. This is also a huge security problem. Who should care? Anyone that values privacy and thinks that the NSA needs to stop spying on Americans. Who made it? Amazon. How much does it cost? It is free to own one, but the device comes with an annual subscription fee of 99. What's the worst that could happen? The worst is that you will never live in a world where your computer doesn't have to be on in order to be able to communicate with the devices you own. This isn't just annoying, it's dangerous. What if someone has a computer on their network that is not secured properly? An Echo could be used to gain control over that computer. You can be sure that the NSA has already thought about this. Does it work? It works as advertised, and it works very well. I'm very impressed with the technology. How to get one? You can get one by preordering on Amazon's website, and you can get one from Best Buy on November 6. Will it be hacked? No doubt, but the problem is that if you own an Echo, you don't know how bad it's been hacked until it's too late.
