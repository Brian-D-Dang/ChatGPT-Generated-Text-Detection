Headlights are mostly useful for improving the driver's vision while driving in low-light conditions and for increasing the visibility of the driver's car in low-light or foggy conditions. While stationary, headlights can also serve as a warning signal to other drivers or pedestrians in the vicinity. Additionally, headlights can help to prevent accidents by alerting other drivers of oncoming vehicles or pedestrians on the side of the road. Finally, some cars come equipped with special headlights that can adjust to provide better visibility around curves or over hills, helping drivers to navigate challenging driving conditions more safely.
