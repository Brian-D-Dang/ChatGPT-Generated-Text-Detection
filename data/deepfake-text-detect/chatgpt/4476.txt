Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as an actual journalism platform, they're fine. dangoor The problem is people don't read the article or think about what it's about; that's why we need articles to be short (even though for some reason there are some that break 10k words). The fact that so many stories have titles like this one makes me wonder how much time and effort went into this post before it was published.
