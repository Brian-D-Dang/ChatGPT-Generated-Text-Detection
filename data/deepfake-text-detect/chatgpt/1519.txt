I feel like they're acting and it often feels very campy. I don't like how they say "well my brain is more feminine," like excuse me that's something that women are known for but okay whatever you think makes you look good isn't going to make the rest of us feel any better about ourselves We were always told we had a soft voice, even though most kids in school sounded like an orangutan. So this was taken as an insultcompliment at least where guys were concerned (and some girls too). Still can't tell if people hate being called masculine because they know what "manly" means or just love playing with words
