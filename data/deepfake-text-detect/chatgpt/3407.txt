Snowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned. Snowden did not follow the proper channels for reporting his concerns about government surveillance programs, but instead chose to go to the media. However, it is important to consider that Snowden believed that the scale of government surveillance was so vast and invasive that he had a moral obligation to disclose this information to the public. His actions brought attention to important issues related to privacy and government surveillance. It is worth noting that there are arguments for and against pardoning Snowden. Some argue that he committed a serious crime and should face legal consequences, while others believe that his actions can be justified as a form of civil disobedience. Ultimately, it will be up to policymakers and officials to weigh these arguments and decide whether or not to offer Snowden a pardon.
