Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view I hold. My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any one or more than all in your answers if they are relevant to determining the outcome: 1) All three candidates will be very closely matched for first place once there's been enough voting progress (that point hasn't yet come since we're only at about 10 completion). Therefore whichever candidate makes it through this test should win by default because their opponents would have no reason not vote against them due solely being behind second-place votes with little hope after that even without sabotage from third partiesnonpartisans...unless such non partisan voters got together into some well organized crime group where everyone took turns doing things like rigging up results while also spreading dangerous rumors among those who believed said gossip; then yeah sometimes people get corrupted when presented opportunity too good odds otherwise unattainable...which reminds me another factor..religion shouldn't matter here either way......let alone race.....especially considering these days most religions don'nt teach hatred toward other religious groups anymore which could potentially give many believers pause before participating....even though past history suggests religion has never stopped someone willing trying nonetheless..... 2) In today times per Bass answer below "As long...there aren" remember how close Obama was during his last election? So what happened??? The Democrats were caught using dirty tricks....and lost big time! Why do u think Trump won....cuz he had dirt under ones fingernails!!!!! So unless something similar gets exposed soon........the Dems might just loose again!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What sayeth thou?! shrugs Maybe i am wrong tho......or maybe im right! Guess ill find out next Xmas; lolol
