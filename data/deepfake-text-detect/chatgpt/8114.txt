It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be rescued from the natural environment and protected. They are often used as ambassadors for conservation in other countries or to prevent animal cruelty by researching it (see BBC documentary on Cruelty Cams). I'm curious what your thoughts about this topic would look like?What do you believe should happen with folks who abuseneglect apes at home etc.?
