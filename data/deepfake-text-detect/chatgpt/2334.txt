Partial Delta for uDHCKris. I'll give you a partial because I do think that New Friends works as a combination option, but I think my CMV is more focused on the idea of an album that would be better split into two separate albums than it is in suggesting splitting New Friends with itself - at least not at this point.) I see what your saying and agree mostly...just thinking about how much music there was to choose from made me consider doing something like that myself
