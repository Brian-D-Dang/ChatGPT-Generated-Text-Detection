1. Military industry keeps some of the very few manufacturing jobs in US, this industry's survival critically depends on US's defence policies and government orders, without US spending sizeable chunk to buy American made goodsservices; 2. There are no cheap labor alternatives for Mexican or South Korean workers and low skilled foreign employees at best would be a burden to their respective governments' budgets; 3. The Trump administration seems willing to ignore any negative impact from imported products that might cause inflation issues as long it can blame China instead The real issue is not whether President Donald J Trump should follow through with his threat to terminate NAFTA but rather how he plans to replace North America's largest free trade agreement if Congress refuses to pass legislation allowing him to do so by August 1 - precisely one year before the US-Mexico Canada Agreement takes effect," said a report released Tuesday morning by law firm Dickinson Wright LLP (DWT). That deadline could also be missed if lawmakers fail to act during the upcoming July recess: Congressional hearings begin next Wednesday, June 27, when representatives will have up until Aug. 9 to decide what to make public about negotiations between Mexico, Canada and the U.S., DWT wrote. As far as we know, President Trump has a plan. But all those details remain confidential. Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou via Facebook Messenger (cftweets) January 15, 2018 Meng Wanzhou, Huawei chief financial officer detained in Canada since Dec. 1 under an arrest warrant issued by Canadian authorities, used her personal account on Twitter Friday evening to share information she received earlier this month after reaching out to U.S.-based lawyers representing Huawei. "I want everyone to understand I am innocent believe I will be vindicated soon!" Meng wrote shortly after midnight - exactly 24 hours after Canadian federal officials announced they had arrested Chinese corporate executive Meng Wanzhou "at the request of U.S." authorities who say they're investigating possible violations of sanctions against Iran related to its 2015 nuclear deal. In another tweet posted just over four hours later, Meng asked anyone seeking additional information to contact her attorneys. She didn't offer much else other than reiterating her innocence. And there were still dark clouds hanging overhead. Meng may only spend time behind bars in Canada pending extradition proceedings because Meng waived her right to fight bail while appearing in court Thursday afternoon, according to a source familiar with the matter cited by Reuters. Known formally as Meng Wanzhou, and known publicly as Chief Financial Officer of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, Meng held meetings last week with her own legal team including a meeting on Jan 10 with former FBI deputy director Andrew Weissmann. On both sides of the border, eyes turned to Washington as discussions continue inside the White House and among senior members within the Department of Homeland Security on what to do next, CBC News reported. There was little immediate clarity regarding the fate of Meng's family. Her husband, Liu Xiaozong, told reporters outside Vancouver courthouse late Saturday night that he wasn't sure where the couple' daughters - aged 12 and 18 years old - are currently living and declined to comment further. Meanwhile, details emerged early Sunday indicating that the latest episode involving Meng reflects broader tensions between the United States and China over the detention of foreign nationals for potential criminal charges. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Monday Beijing hopes the two countries can resolve disputes peacefully through dialogue "not resorting to coercion, intimidation, or the use of force... [and] I hope Canada can meet our expectations and let Ms. Meng go immediately."
