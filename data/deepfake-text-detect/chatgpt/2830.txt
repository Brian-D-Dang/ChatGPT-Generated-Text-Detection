Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of civilians, most with no military value whatsoever (or even any strategic importance). They did not kill the Japanese soldiers - they killed women and children. The idea that Japan was going to surrender is an argument for why it's arguablereasonable but it doesn't make the bombings right or justifiable at all 2. It wasn't necessary anyway given that we had already inflicted unbearable casualties upon them through conventional bombing raids and then directly by attacking their home islands themselves. 3. Most people involved still think that dropping those two nukes made little difference overall because Japan surrendered so quickly afterwards 4. We would have been better off with out them I don't consider myself to know very much about WWII history. But from what you told me, it seems as though both sides benefited less than if they hadn't happened. Does anyone else agree?
