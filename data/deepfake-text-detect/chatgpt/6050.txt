I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends. I find it bitter and I'm more of a tea person. But I've heard good things about a certain drink, so I thought I'd give it a try! For years, I've been told that I should try a latte (I think that's what it's called) - it's a specialty drink with coffee, milk and a bit of sugar. I'm not one for sweet drinks, so I didn't think I would like it. I mean, what would be the point of sweet coffee?! Anyway, I gave it a go and I'm a convert. I don't drink coffee very often, but I think I could get used to this latte. There are many different types of lattes, but I'm a fan of the classic latte. I like mine with a bit of sweetness, so I asked for some whipped cream. But back to the drink itself - it's delicious! There's something about the coffee that just goes well with the whipped cream. And now I'm ready for another coffee. Gotta love the menu... looks so cool!
