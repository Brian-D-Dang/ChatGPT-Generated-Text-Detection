Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but some opinions are better than others [edit: I am referring to them being morallyethically "better. If you submitted a topic to this sub with the title 'How do i make illegal drugs legal?' and then proceeded to defend your position by saying that they don't have any harm or be considered harmful, people would tell you that it was an irresponsible thing for you to say.] I'd just like to point out there is no ethical justification in doing such things - drug prohibition has been thoroughly discredited time and again, which is why our government considers it something worth of discussion (or at least trying). It should not be confused with any moral claims we may feel towards the issue as well though!
