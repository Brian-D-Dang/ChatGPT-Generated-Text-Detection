This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced by a disclaimer: I am not arguing whether or why we should have more guns in the United States; those are questions for another time entirely (perhaps even never). My claim here relates solely on how they actually work as well their effect upon society at large - it has nothing directly related whatsoever towards gun regulation debates of any sort either domestically within our borders nor internationally across international watersterritories such-like terms like "gun control" would apply both legally morally respectively there[1].
