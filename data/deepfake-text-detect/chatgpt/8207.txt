From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other. The first faction is heavily focused on power and wealth accumulation for themselves (and their friends). Not surprisingly they don't care about racism or sexism as long it doesn't get in there way - whether that's women who want a better life without being forced back home by an abusive husbandfathers; immigrants trying desperately not be ghettoized when all around them succeed economically simply because "they came here legally"; blacks fighting against workplace discrimination although many now own homes worth 200K with no mortgage - unlike those damn white people working minimum wage jobs at Wal Mart etc... The second group isn " t really interested either but rather believes everyone should just pull up his bootstraps so he can do things like vote democrat if you're black even though your community has been run over time after timne since Reconstruction......It goes round nround from day-today depending upon some recent incident where someone was denied service somewhere....you know how these folks roll! But then again this same mindset saw Hillary winning big among African Americans despite her support policies diametrically opposite theirs.....so maybe its actually more stupid than racist?
