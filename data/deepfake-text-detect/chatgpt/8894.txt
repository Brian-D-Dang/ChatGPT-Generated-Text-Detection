I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a'joke' as angry gay men. I don't think that's right though," he said in his own apology for being offended by "the outrage." Biden's speech comes just days after the Supreme Court rejected President Donald Trump's and Republican Party nominee Joe Biden's bid to overturn the 2020 election results. The Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday - including one that overturned an earlier ruling - that two state elections officials violated the Constitution by failing to collude with the FBI, while the other had high-level contacts with Russian intelligence. "The Justice Department failed to fully take into account the risks posed by unlawful interference by Russian intelligence agencies during this campaign," the court wrote in a decision issued Wednesday afternoon. Meanwhile, Democrats are eager to capitalize on the election fraud, because it has already been claimed by President Trump himself - who is now claiming widespread electoral success due to law enforcement missteps and voter intimidation.
