Edit: Thanks for all the info. I more or less quit responding because a couple people effectively changed the way I was looking at the issue. To be honest though, I never did do the reading or research that they suggested. I thought it was obvious. Now that I have done the reading, I am pretty sure I have it right. I can't speak to the specifics of your situations but I think the generality of the information I found online and in books is useful. There are two things that are important: 1. A return on investment that makes it worth your while. 2. An appropriate risk tolerance. It all boils down to numbers. If you have a particular return requirement you will need to run the numbers to see if you can get there with the risk involved. If you can't, you can either change the numbers or the risk. Now it could be that you are already at the end of the line and you just need to accept that you can't get the return you want. But it also could be that you just have to work a little harder to make it happen. I don't know your financial situation. But if you are in the position where you can invest 1000 today and have enough to retire with, then I think you can safely ignore the advice to wait and invest less. My guess is that the advice you have received is based on someone's experience, not on a carefully thought out model. Some of us have decided that this is the time to invest in order to get a better return than we might if we waited. I am one of them. I personally like the idea of a diversified portfolio of index funds. I have my IRA, 401K, TSP, and Roth IRA all invested in various index funds. (I am fortunate enough to have a few jobs that have these opportunities). I will say that I don't have a lot of confidence that I will be able to get my money out of them when I need to. But I have decided that the risk is worth it. But I don't make any of these decisions lightly. How does this work for you? If you're in the military, you're eligible to make a Roth IRA contribution of 5,000 per year as long as you're in the military. If you're also under the age of 21 and you make less than 5,000 per year, you can contribute 5,000 as well. The idea behind the Roth IRA is that it gives you tax free income in retirement. It's a great option for people who are younger than 40 and it's a great option for people with non-exempt income. It's not really a good option for people who are older than 40 and it's not really a good option for people with high incomes because you can't contribute more than 5,000. If you make more than 110,000 as a single person or 173,000 as a married couple, you can't contribute at all. If you're still in school, you can contribute 5,000. If you're an adult and you're not in school, you can contribute 5,000 per year as long as you're in the military. If you're under 21 and you make less than 5,000, you can contribute 5,000 per year. If you want to get started, go to or and you can open an account. I'm not suggesting that you rush out and open a Roth IRA account right now because it might not be in your best interest. I'm only suggesting that you make it one of your options. It's easy to set up a Roth IRA account. It only takes a few minutes and you can contribute 5,000 per year. If you have a TSP, you can only contribute 15,500 per year. If you make less than 110,000 as a single person or 173,000 as a married couple, you can contribute 17,500. This is all public information. It's all available online. There's no need to solicit advice from anyone. You can make up your own mind. Fidelity has some of the best prices and they are very easy to use. I use them to manage my Roth IRA and my taxable investment account. If you're not
