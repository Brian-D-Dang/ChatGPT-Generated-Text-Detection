While it is true that some elements created in a lab may not exist in nature, they still have a place on the periodic table. The periodic table is not only a representation of the elements found in nature, but also a tool for organizing and understanding the properties of all known elements. Additionally, the discovery and creation of new elements can lead to advances in scientific understanding and technology. For example, the discovery of synthetic elements has led to the development of new materials and accelerators used in medical imaging and cancer treatment. Therefore, it is important to include all known elements on the periodic table, regardless of their origin or rarity in nature.
