Some Definitions Islamism - Political Movements that use Islam to justify either their end goals (ie. a religious state, or "caliphate or the means they use (ie. violence, terrorism). Islam itself has been seen as a political movement since its inception in the early 2000s but only recently converted into religion and is now viewed with suspicion by many Islamic countries like Syria, Iraq and Iran which have legalized it for political reasons. The Islamic State group calls itself the Islamic State, ISIL. ISIS used ISIL's ideology of jihad against Palestine during the Syrian civil war as justification for fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. This also meant that Isis members took over areas surrounding Syrian cities including Aleppo where the group carried out large scale attacks against civilians such as assassinations targeting civilians who were aiding Assad regime forces trying to retake Raqqa province from Isis fighters without harming anyone else. ISIS claimed responsibility for 481 deaths between November 2014 and June 2016 while Hezbollah and Hamas are responsible for two civilian deaths each year resulting in nearly 200 deaths across Lebanon alone through bombings and rocket fire respectively. However, the group doesn't seem interested in compromise on its behalf so it isn't afraid to target targets other than Assad allies. The group still maintains an army base near Damascus which Islamic State claims protects in its strongholds from enemy air strikes though ISIS suspects Hezbollah may be behind these atrocities. ISIS has focused on the Western Balkans region: Kosovo in Serbia controlled by Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) along with Serbian Muslims in Bosnia serving under Serbs control. During these months ISIS branded Serbian civil war criminal Sarajevo as the "enemy." Kosovo was hit hard when Serb forces came back into battle at the end of 2014 after the creation of Kosovo Independence Agreement. The group went further towards claiming sovereignty within Kosovo and its borders but no one knows if ISIS planned this attack despite efforts by ISIL terrorists to cover up evidence ahead of time. ISIS' only reference point for attacks are seen in the ISIS propaganda videos and videos glorifying Syria's Assad army commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi whom they claim drove countless refugees fleeing Syria to Turkey via Turkey. In February 2015 ISIS released a video stating that Syrian government forces should "take revenge" for Assad's fall. ISIS admitted attacking Syrian civilians inside Syria but denied using chemical weapons against innocent civilians until January 2017 when ISIS claimed responsibility for suicide bombing attacks. ISIS later blamed German authorities for crimes committed by German citizens belonging to Kurdish minority groups in Syria before releasing another video showing ISIS associates committing murder offences inside Turkey. ISIS continued its attacks throughout December 2016 murdering hundreds of Islamic State supporters which included civilians outside Turkey accusing the Turkish military of waging war crimes against Kurds therein. Despite the alleged involvement of NATO member Israel ISIS continues its attacks inside Syria killing hundreds upon thousands every day while continuing its siege of Syria's Idlib Province inflicting widespread casualties beyond anyone imagined. Even worse is the existence of ISIS around Syria as well as Russian-backed Syrian rebels holding territory close to the Iraqi border and Syria shooting down drones whose pilots hijacked planes whilst taking off carrying militants there killed dozens more people. Algeria's Sharia law which aims to establish what appears to be a statelessness based on Islamic teachings has long been condemned in most Muslim nations worldwide. This includes some governments including Egypt although Egyptian leaders consider Islamic fundamentalists to be non-believers rather than apostates due to the country being part of Saudi Arabia which has strict laws prohibiting any interpretation of Islam and Christianity. Algeria therefore bans all types of faith hate speech except those violating religious freedom. Algeria signed an agreement with the United Nations last week allowing Christians to worship freely bazaar to legitimize jihadist actions following the murder of an American journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Algeria banned Muslim Brotherhood supporters from hosting any international conferences citing threats made against them. Algeria recognises Islamic state sponsors and encourages terrorist activity alongside other Middle Eastern states namely Libya, Tunisia and Ethiopia. Algeria also does not recognise Islamophobia because Islam forbids anyone recognising a deity besides Allah. Algeria also promotes Islamophobia particularly among Algerian youth saying there haven't been enough attempts to unite human rights defenders abroad (see Islamophobia). Algeria hasn't recognised Islam since 1949 but its leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika chose not too criticize Islamophobic remarks by newspapers he once criticized. Algeria has yet again suspended Islamic Jihadist Anders Behring Breivik from flying a plane into a church building believed to belong to Islamist extremists. Algeria's current president Almahned Khalilzad announced a new protocol banning demonstrations calling upon Algerians to support Algeria's independence movement. Algeria has never openly criticised Islam and no longer considers Islamophobia to be valid criticism. Algeria says France imports goods produced elsewhere in Africa (explains why Algerians aren't allowed to export cars). Algeria rejects the notion that it imposes these restrictions as the world sees Algeria as complicit in promoting extremism even though Algeria accepts full membership in NATO. Algeria's Islamist leader Abdelmadjid Tebboune called for everyone armed with weapons to join his 'Daesh'. ISIS uses jihadists via loudspeakers telling Muslims to kill people living nearby.
