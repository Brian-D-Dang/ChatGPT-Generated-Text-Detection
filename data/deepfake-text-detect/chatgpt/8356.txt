I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost impossible to create one. That said: Wouldn't nuclear fusion be considered an energy source? These are unstable isotopes of hydrogen which can fuse into helium - just like how stars work (with some help from gravity). So wouldn't this mean we could get "cheaper" stuff by simply using our own sun instead? But then there must surely still exist limits.. right?? Or am i missing something here..??
