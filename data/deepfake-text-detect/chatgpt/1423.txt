So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training , but there's so little of any type of professional firefighters for this area (which is part of the reason why we have such high fire danger). It seems like no help whatsoever if someone doesn't pay attention to roaring flames and decides not to evacuate their homes until its too late It baffles me as well! But hey at least you get trained in how to build things out of wood...
