While it's true that the United States has seen increased government surveillance and law enforcement presence in recent years, it's a stretch to claim that the country is already a police state. In a true police state, the government exerts complete control over citizens' lives, often through violent and oppressive tactics. The US, on the other hand, has a robust system of checks and balances designed to limit the power of any one branch of government. Furthermore, citizens still have many freedoms, including the right to free speech, assembly, and a free press, that would be severely limited in a true police state. While it's important to be aware of and critical of government overreach, it's dangerous and unproductive to jump to extreme conclusions without sufficient evidence.
