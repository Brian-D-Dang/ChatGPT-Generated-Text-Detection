Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same. His views on immigration would not only alienate foreign-born Americans and put some of them at risk in order to stay relevant here in America, but also make him look really bad for what he did to the Middle East. For example: "I'm concerned that people from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, North Korea and Syria are being killed by the United States" - as if anyone cares about anything else than the family values and interests of their own country. The only reason they could be targeted as such was because there were so many Saudi nationals involved with terrorist activities in countries other than Saudi Arabia. In fact, this isn't even an interrogation question. This is something called the "surveillance state." It refers to the government that holds everyone accountable. So what does the surveillance state have to do with terrorism? And why didn't the CIA and FBI investigate it before its inception? The answer to these questions is that the surveillance state has no control over how governments conduct themselves. We live in the 99 percent of countries we know stodgy terrorists. I don't care if you're from Iraq or Kenya or Pakistan; if you had your security clearance revoked because of some security incident, then you should consider asking yourself: Why? What factors contributed to that decision? How would you feel if someone attacked you? Would you trust enough officials to take action against you without your knowledge? That is exactly what happened in Libya when they didn't want us to invade. They wanted us to come back to Libya. Why wouldn't we just let those targets die in front of the world? You're going to get similar reaction from every human being who doesn't leave behind a scar where they've lived forever. As if that doesn't feel too unfair. That's what happens when you create an environment in which threats aren't considered acceptable. If ISIS or al Qaeda didn't attack you, we might think they'd kill you anyway. Because none of those things are acceptable in any way. You can see exactly the situation in Libya right now. At a time when tens of thousands of civilians have been killed across a range of countries (some around the world), there exists an entire culture of terror toward us. Our republicans have been trying since 2016 to reduce the level of violence occurring within our borders. But that hasn't worked, and it's something we'll continue to work on in order to prevent future catastrophe. In fact, we will begin doing that soon. A surge of new attacks on the American homeland may also exacerbate existing tensions between our two nations. Instead of pursuing an economic solution, our leaders are making decisions based on the whims of facts rather than facts. Their actions have created an atmosphere of impunity and fear among citizens of both sides of the border. While the United Nations Security Council was working in Libya to combat the threat posed by ISIS, President Trump has shown little remorse for his actions. And yet, President Obama gave no signs of acknowledging the threat of ISIS until after the Sept. 11 attacks. He made several statements condemning ISIS, including encouraging members of the group to join the fight. Although he said that it's important to counter terrorists like the Islamic State, Obama didn't actually acknowledge what ISIS was doing that day. Underneath these statements was a general heartache that saw tremendous loss of life and dread and dismay for the nation that bore witness to such a terrible tragedy. President Trump gave no indication he intends to pull out of Afghanistan immediately. He urged the Taliban to accept U.S.-led forces and remain neutral. When asked if he'd keep moving forward as long as the Afghan Taliban remains in power, he replied: "No, absolutely not." - John Frullenbaum is president of Citizens United, Inc., a nonprofit political action committee that represents millions of Americans.
