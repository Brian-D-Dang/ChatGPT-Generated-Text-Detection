Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from recreational). What is it about sports that other activities do not offer? Not only does competition teach you how to bring out best in yourself and others through hard work; there are also specific skills needed for this sport like teamwork, commitment etc. These types of soft-skill aren't found elsewhere except maybe school or home environment where parents push their children without giving them equal opportunities. The purpose isn't winning materialistic things, although some may think so,but rather learning life lessons while having fun with friends and being active at same time! Parents should encourage kids more by offering different sporting options instead.
