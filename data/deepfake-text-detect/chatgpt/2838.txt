Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for "sleeping around," and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise. "That's my opinion." You didn't say that you believed this. Saying something like: "I believe..." would have been far better at establishing your beliefs than what you chose to do here. And no one should be saying they don't care about politics because there are good things happening all over the place...that just doesn't make any sense. I'm sorry if political issues affect you directly or personally but there are always going to be bad things (and sometimes very serious ones) that happen everywhere. There will never be an ideal world where we can focus exclusively on improving ourselves as individuals. That simply isn't possible. We're human beings with millions of years of evolution behind us; we developed into highly social creatures who rely heavily upon each other. Politics affects everyone whether they think so or not worse yet, people seem to love ignoring it until something really important happens. This site has already done some great work focusing on helping our fellow humans out, which is why I made such a big deal about donating money. If you see someone doing cool stuff in their community or local area, then tell them thank you! It only takes seconds and will help tremendously. But saying you don't care about how others live because "there are good things everywhere," is silly. Let me explain further. The idea of individualism seems odd since most people probably think of themselves primarily as part of society rather than being separate from it. However, it makes a lot of sense when viewed through Darwinian logic. In fact, Virginia Woolf says her book A Room Called Silence was inspired by Darwin's theory of natural selection. She writes: "The first thing that happened after Adam was kicked out of Eden - he wasn't quite expelled, but soon found himself alone - was his own specialisation. He...had become self-consciously a member of a species.... When he comes to think of Eve there is a touch of pity even in him: she had been part of the whole. But now, though still loved, she must be kept apart. To bring her too near might imperil her existence. For reasons best known to itself God created Eve as unlike herself as possible..... His creation of humanity was its downfall. And for reasons exactly the opposite of those brought before Eden, nature did nothing less than rise up against his design and gave birth to a new race. From the moment that women were allowed a voice, a life independent of men began." [Virginia Woolf] So long story short, being an individual requires separateness from others. Being able to think freely without having to worry about what anyone else thinks about you allows freedom of thought and frees individuals to achieve greatness. You need to understand that objectivity is subjective. Think about it - whenever you solely base your opinions off of objective factsinformation, you wind up making yourself ignorant due to the lack of context and knowledge needed to truly assess the situation. Objectively assessing situations often involves listening and observing various factors affecting the people involved. It's easy enough to observe an event objectively, however many fail to observe how these events actually lead toward outcomes and subsequently develop opinions based upon inaccurate information. My point? Your worldview becomes extremely flawed when you try to view everything under the lens of objectivity. Experience trumps mere data every time, especially when talking about personal matters. Unless someone lives alone from birth up until death, their take on reality will vary depending on their perspective, and oftentimes influence how they react to certain situations. Someone living in the middle east may find it difficult to empathize with terrorist attacks occuring overseas, whereas someone living at ground zero could find it equally hard to sympathise with surviving family members lost in said tragedy.
