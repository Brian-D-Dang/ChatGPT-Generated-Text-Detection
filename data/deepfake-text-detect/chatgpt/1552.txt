Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a war between two superpowers in regards to resources and power. The USA had an overwhelming military superiority over North Vietnam (many times more) which allowed them to control most aspects of life there even if it wasn't necessarily their own personal country. This led many, including myself at that time, to think of Americans as 'the good guys' while looking down on anyone else who fought in Vietnam as "bad" or simply stupid for not being able to see past America's greatness. I don't really feel like explaining all my thoughts about Vietnam right now but short version is, yes we were wrong because we've seen how mercilessly other countries can be when they aren't forced into a situation or have no choice but to fight under the heel of another nation (see: Iraq)
