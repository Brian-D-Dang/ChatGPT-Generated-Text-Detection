I believe that we are at the point where we potentially could avoid bringing about catastrophic climate change, but to do that we would need to drop absolutely everything, to restore order in our society and calm the population down. "We're pushing back against the forces of nature," said Fissler. "There is a lot of talk today about carbon taxes that have nothing whatsoever to do with climate change or regulation." The study also found that those who want to cut emissions must go further than the average individual states should be able to achieve without exceeding the targets set by governments around the world. It's not just Canada, it's so much wider ranges across Europe as well - including Denmark and Norway. Moreover, Fissler pointed out that Canada has invested heavily on renewable energy projects such as hydroelectric plants rather than relying solely on fossil fuels alone because they can easily pay for themselves over time if they grow their own electricity generation capacity along with renewables like solar panels instead of using coal-fired power stations. In addition, Fissler stressed that climate scientists agree the monthly global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions makes the situation worse overall, making it harder to curtail pollution properly called for under certain scenarios emerging from the IPCC report released last week. Those projections could lead to more ice melt this summer which means a wet winter next year unless the global temperature rises above 1.5 degrees Celsius (2C). Fissler believes so will prompt countries worldwide to reduce emissions drastically faster due to rising temperatures. Canada already produces less greenhouse gases per capita than most other major economies combined; its total amount emitted annually exceeds America's, however fewer people live there compared to other nations' populations. The report says the country currently emits 0.6 per cent of all CO 2, compared with 0.8 per cent globally - showing how strongly climate change impacts everyone differently. Fissler praised Canada as one of only three industrialized nations remaining at sea level which emit between 10 and 12 millions tonnes per annum each year while acknowledging that northern Ontario produces roughly double what Canada does every year. But Fissler emphasized that more supports are needed now before Canadians begin to see drastic reductions in emissions coming through clear signals from the Trudeau government to dissuade them from continuing to manage emissions effectively. He expects Canada to increase commitments to reduce emissions even higher within eight years given the increased urgency amid predictions he sees. And FISS recommends developing a plan similar to measures taken elsewhere when greenhouse gas emission cuts were insufficiently implemented locally during periods of extreme weather events such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. As climate changes are occurring everywhere throughout the world, a better Canada-wide approach requires an international coalition effort alongside larger regional efforts like a Copenhagen conference which includes countries pledging 15 gigawatts of clean energy investment.
