I am a 23 year old male Indian American male. I have never held hands with a girl, been kissed, or obviously had sex. I have never even asked someone out before! Dating is new to me and this whole experience has opened my eyes. My friend told me about it, but he didn't go into detail so I wanted the advice of an older man who actually knows what they are talking about (since I live in India). Now that I know how to do these things properly, please help guide me as best you can since I want to be able to get laid by any woman that wants to. What should I say? How many? What tone? Should I just ask her straight up if she will kisskiss on first date? And if yes, then what happens next? If no...Should I tell her why not (in case we decide to try again)? How much information should I give from past experiences when saying something like "I may come off a little odd because I was molested"? This would make sense for relationships after breakup too (or one-night stands) where I feel comfortable telling people more info about myself. Or maybe talk about some of the reasons I've experienced depression other than being abused during childhood. Sorry if this sounds dumb, but I really need your advice. Thanks ahead!! Good luck and thanks in advance!!!:) [December 28th 2012] Update: Trying to find girls online through Facebook lately - nothing yet though: (Hopefully soon, Hahaha! Hey there bearboy, yeah, sorry I haven't updated sooner; work's crazy right now:- (Sorry about all those questions you had I'm sure some of them were answered here before, but I'll answer 'em anyway. It helps keep guys' minds fresh and lets us remember our own answers better. So; First thing you gotta realize is that unless you're into ONLY ONE GIRL at a time, EVERY SINGLE interaction with a girl will influence future interactions. You don't necessarily NEED to build rapportgetting along together," as most folks tend to call it with each girl you meet. But if you wanna keep having fun down the road, you'd better take better care of yourself than you did last night. OK, let's start with a few introductions:- As far as opening lines go, sometimes the simplest ones always seem to work the BEST: "Hi." Usually works pretty well if you're meeting SOMEONE new rather than trying to hit on everyone. Then you can add a couple details if necessary (but often it doesn't matter): "So, you must be (female name)." Possible replies include: "Yes," "No," "Actually, that's true," etc.. Anything else you need to know about her? Her friends family hobbies interests? Tell HER something interesting about YOURSELF... She likes reading? Maybe ask her which book she liked most recently. Is there ANYTHING you two share interest in? Think about it. Personally, I think it makes a lot more sense NOT TO ASK ABOUT THE FUTURE SOONER THAN LATER until both parties have begun getting closer. Better to let them spend time figuring OUT whether THEY can become close friends FIRST. In fact, if you begin asking about the future RIGHT AWAY, chances are good neither party WOULD LIKE THAT AT ALL. They might WANT to see OTHER PEOPLE, or travel around town, or watch movies, or whatever else... Don't expect anyone to WANT to sit across from you every day and bond over lunch while watching movies or music videos. Unless you're REALLY INTO GETTING CLOSE QUICKLY with an unknown PERSON, wait till later. Letting them "get used to ya" means less pressure, more privacy, and also allows THEM to figure out what kind of friendship they DO want without feeling pressured. Also, once you start giving them reason to worry about YOU, their focus could shift away from YOU towards others in THEIR lives. Best possible scenario. If you'd prefer to avoid such awkwardness altogether (which is perfectly reasonable), it's still important to open WITH A RELATIONSHIP STATEMENT that ensures you understand expectations (and remind yourself of yours): "I'm looking forward to becoming friends with , but I hope we'll continue spending quality time together soon..." That way, it becomes clear WHO IT IS YOU ARE LOOKIN FOR AND WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM THIS FRIENDSHIP BEGINNING, HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES. If you're unsure of how you feel, maybe write a short note beforehand explaining WHY you believe this person will benefit YOUR life. Since you said you're interested in meeting women via internet dating sites, my guess is that it takes longer to develop friendship, usually lasting months to years before intimacy begins to occur BUT as long as you stay focused, IF THIS OCCURS IN THE END, everything WILL BE WORTHWHILE...:- Noting another's mood card record timeshift results show suggest perfection potentiality rate discard setting mean ticks record setting records show holding the save their cause saves
