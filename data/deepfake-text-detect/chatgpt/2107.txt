I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with that opinion they can tell you their thoughts about it without being censored or told to shut up. That doesn't mean the speaker isn't allowed to speak at all; just means people who disagree aren't prevented from speaking as well in response. That's not censorship though... I have every right to call forks stupid but everyone else has the freedom of choice whether fork eating is for them
