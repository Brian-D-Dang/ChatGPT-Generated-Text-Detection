Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a different reason. It's pretty much what everyone else said- it is time consuming and you need 6 hours or so to do it. That said, if you are able to get 5 people together tonight (myself included) we can finish up the set as soon as possible!
