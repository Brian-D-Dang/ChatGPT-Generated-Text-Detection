Counter-argument: While sex may not be a biological necessity like food or water, it is definitely a human need that is vital for psychological and emotional well-being. Several studies have demonstrated that regular sexual activity can positively impact mental health, reduce stress, improve sleep, and boost self-esteem. For many women, sex is also an essential component of intimacy and relationship building. It helps them feel emotionally connected to their partners and strengthen their bond. To claim that sex is only a "want" and not a "need" is to overlook the critical role it plays in our lives and relationships. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that sex is only a "want" and not a "need" for women.
