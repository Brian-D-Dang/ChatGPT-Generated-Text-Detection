I believe that a private business should be able to deny service to anyone for any reason. For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, or Jews only; I would not support the government taking over and regulating their businesses in order stop it (though this is debatable). It's important because without freedom of association you do have tyranny at some level which does make life worse off overall - even though we may currently live with such bad results from these problems due our current political climate.) My main problem here was thinking about having an organization decide what people could spend money on when they had no right whatsoever asking them whywhat etc.? This agency also has been accused using its power against conservative groups as well... so yeah David French isn't technically telling us anything new by just showing where things turned out wrong.......if he ever wants credibility again maybe instead saying "How can conservatives get better" his next article might include how exactly one gets involved socially politically - especially during election season?
