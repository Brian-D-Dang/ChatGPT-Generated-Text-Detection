While it may be true that not everyone may feel the effects of coffee, dismissing its benefits overlooks the fact that caffeine is a psychoactive drug that can improve alertness, attention, and productivity. Additionally, individuals have varying levels of sensitivity to caffeine, so what may appear as negligible effects to one person could be significant to another. Moreover, it is unfair to assume that people who claim to enjoy the taste of coffee are lying to themselves. Taste is a subjective experience, and it is entirely possible for an individual to genuinely enjoy the flavor profile of coffee. Just like with any other food or beverage, personal preference plays a significant role in determining one's taste preferences. Therefore, it is not accurate to generalize coffee as overrated and claim that those who consume it do not genuinely enjoy it or benefit from its stimulating effects.
