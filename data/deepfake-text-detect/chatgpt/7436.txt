While it's true that spending every single moment of your teenage years solely focused on college admissions may not be feasible or desirable, it's important to remember the long-term benefits of investing time and effort into the college admissions process. Attending a good college can lead to higher paying job opportunities and open doors for future success. Additionally, building a strong academic and extracurricular record in high school will also prepare you for college-level coursework and make you a more competitive applicant in the future. It's all about finding a healthy balance between academics, extracurricular activities, social life, and self-care, rather than neglecting one aspect altogether.
