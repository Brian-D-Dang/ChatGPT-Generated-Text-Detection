Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a war for oil. While you are looking at pictures of dead Vietnamese children on your wall in high school, think about that one small fact: it's always been OPEC who controls all the oil reserves around the world; not to mention they have a disproportionate amount of influence with most governments today (especially America). I am starting to believe that if we don't do something drastic soon, there will be another "Vietnam" or possibly even worse. We did nothing after WWII to stop communism from spreading throughout Europe. The same can happen here. It's time to start thinking long-term, instead of short term. And how does our current president feel? Well let's find out..
