So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion. The idea of a "solo queue" for ranked games while only players who are good enough should be able to play it seems like too much work and no reward at all (being gold or platinum elo). I think he's talking about solo queuing that hasn't been put behind a paywall as opposed to having to go through the awful matchmaking with friends system
