I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal products. It's not that hard on your body if you're in good shape or have strong practices at home... but it can be done. Do note: Not all vegans are born with that mindset - some become vegan through dieting (which is easier than most people realize), others choose "vegetarianism" because they want to do something nice for animals, while others might just need more sleep or better nutrition. If this sounds like me, then I'd love to answer any questions! My name is Mireille and I've been vegan since September of 2009, which means I haven't eaten meat since October 30th, 2010 when I decided to stop eating meat over health reasons. I was motivated by my sister who has cancer and she won't allow herself to go without meat due to health concerns. Now I'm trying to convince persuade as many young adults as possible so that they don't choose their own personal lifestyle based solely upon convenience or popularity; It can lead to a lot of bad decisions down the road. That being said, here goes nothing!!
