A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but too loud for me. I really hate the noise at my house because it's so loud. The noise is louder than when I'm playing music though, just like your own apartment would be loud? Though I do appreciate the fun you're having! Thanks again:)
