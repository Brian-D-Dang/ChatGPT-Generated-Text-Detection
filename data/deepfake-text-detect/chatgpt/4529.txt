People who have no interest in politics, and are not interested in learning about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it its a "free country." If I were ever given an opportunity by my state for early voting (I live close enough but too far away to make it easy), I would use that time wisely...to educate myself on what is going on in this world so as to better understand how my choices will affect me personally or negatively impact others; and then decide which candidate (s) I believe most closely represent those values. In other words, I wouldn't feel compelled nor pressured to vote based upon political affiliation; I would do my own research before making my decision. And yes, if it was just up to me, I might even consider not voting at all. But please don't tell me I can't participate because of some weird notion that everyone has the same right to choose their government officials. That doesn't work here! I think we need to change our attitude towards being politically involved. We seem to take great pride in being able to sit back when people complain about politicians and then stand there with our mouths open and say, well I didn't know anything about it until now. I agree wholeheartedly that you shouldn't impose your opinions on someone else simply because they share yours. However, you shouldn't sit around waiting for things like school shootings or terrorist attacks without doing something about it either. Not voting means giving tacit approval to criminals. It says to them: This is okay. If only more people did that, we could show these guys that good old American democracy still works. We had an election today in Canada. All Canadians are citizens regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc., and are afforded equal rights through every aspect of life including freedom from conflict due to different beliefs or points of view. No one has privilege in society unless they earn it. Everyone gets a chance to speak their mind freely. As such, any Canadian citizen is free to openly criticize the Government at anytime. The idea behind having an Election period is simple - it's essentially similar to the way the U.S. does business during presidential terms. Obviously, changes must occur once there is a mandate changeover but the concept remains fundamentally intact. The majority of Canadians supported Trudeau in last night's poll (the first federal election since he became PM). He received 74 support among 18-34 year olds compared to 57 support for Harper amongst Canadians 55 years of age. Mr. Goodale stated Mr. Harper won tonight because young voters turned out en masse while older voters stayed home hoping someone else got elected instead. While I am pleased that his party retained power, isn't it ironic that many Canadians voted Liberal in order to keep him in office? Yet, many Canadians felt it necessary to elect yet another Conservative Party leader? What message does that send to Canadians? Voters clearly showed their frustration in electing three consecutive conservative leaders. Many younger voters may well see themselves as part of a larger worldwide movement against big corporations and military spending -a sentiment echoed throughout social media immediately after the results came in yesterday evening. Is that where Liberals want us to go? Do liberals envy conservatives more than vice versa? Does Justin Trudeau really care about saving Canadians money on gas? When we look at Stephen Harper's track record over the past seven years, we discover that Conservatives have increased spending dramatically both domestically and internationally. They also significantly reduced taxes for wealthy individuals while maintaining low taxes on everyone else. Finally, Harper seems intent on destroying public education and health services across the nation. One thing is certain, however: it looks like Conservatives won nothing except more seats. Will there always be war between progressives and conservatives? Can't we all get along? Many Americans are disappointed with President Obama's policies, especially healthcare reform and higher pay scales. Therefore, many seek alternative options. Those seeking solutions are often referred to as 'teapot tea parties. Tea Partiers are constitutionalists that demand their representatives adhere to strict principles contained within the Constitution of the United States. Personally, I detest the term tea party especially considering none of the founding fathers advocated consuming beverages infused with hot water. Nevertheless, some reasonable arguments exist regarding why America needs 'tea parties' as opposed to conventional liberal ideas. For instance, originalism refers to judging laws according to how they existed prior to passage. Typically, social movements emerge following significant events in history that set precedent followed later by legal precedents. Perhaps, tea parties are inspired by historical events involving civil unrest, marches, boycotts, riots, protests, etc. Currently, Democrats hold majorities in Congress allowing liberals to pass regulations practically anywhere they wish; likewise, Republicans had control over congress during Bush presidency thus enabling progressive actions. Further, statesmen like Ronald Reagan demonstrated how state governments cannot override central authority by vetoing legislation passed by the authority contestation rules governing wide range "new penny off again and teat whom takes their favourite beverage into popularly applying their teeterjackie
