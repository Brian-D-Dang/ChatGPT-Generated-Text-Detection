I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. Reddit is like a shithole in some ways. I'm on Reddit from time to time, and I would say that most of the time I'm just looking for an excuse to sit on my ass and waste time.
