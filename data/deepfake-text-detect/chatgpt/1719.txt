When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Tatooine, they encounter Watto, a junk dealer who owns two slaves, Anakin Skywalker and his mother Shmi. When Qui-Gon learns he cannot buy them because of the Jedi code forbids slavery, Qui-Gon decides to raise them as his own sons.[2] Anakin Skywalker was born in Ahch-To on Naboo, when Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda were visiting there for training purposes. He is trained by Qui-Gon Jinn from Birthright until Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002) while still an infant, then taken into the outer rim planet Korriban where he becomes Luke's apprentice under Master Yoda. As Darth Vader, the young man later returns to Earth with his father after destroying the Death Star at Endor, only this time he does so not as Lightside but Dark Side. Despite having the full power of the dark side, it remains that way throughout most of Revenge of the Sith. While living post-Clone Wars life, the young son of Emperor Palpatine and Queen Amidala gives birth to twins; Padme Amidala and Anakin Skywalker IV. After witnessing the death of his fellow Jedi master and mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, following the events of A New Hope, Ben Solo will eventually be trained by General Grievous before being sent away to continue his education elsewhere due to his failure to show loyalty towards the Empire during Order 66[3]. The film ends with him falling back under Sidious' control just prior to uttering the words "I'm your father."
