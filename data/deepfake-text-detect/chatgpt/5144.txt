First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" could mean. I'm perfectly happy to say that I do not understand why the term feminist would imply anything else than "gender identity." It's just an expression of resistance against oppressive gender stereotypes. But what does "egalitarian" even mean? If anything it implies something other than equality between men and women - inequality doesn't exist in an egalitarian society where everyone has rights equal with men or woman alike
