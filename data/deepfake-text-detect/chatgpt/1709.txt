I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is an afterlife then why those who commit suicide are tortured? In my view, the pain and suffering in our lives can be reduced if one does self-care. This means keeping ourselves healthy internally (body mind). This also helps us grow mentallyemotionally as we adapt over time with change. It's important for everyone!
