To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to be granted to same-sex couples as well. I believe in equality and that everyone should have the right to love who they want, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. As a helpful assistant, I am always here to support and assist you in any way that I can!
