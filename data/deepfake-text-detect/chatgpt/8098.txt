In spite of the imperfections of the USA and Europe, it still remains a truth that pretty much all of the most desirable places in the world are run by decently-behaved people. The Philippines is no exception to this general rule as anyone who has spent time here can attest: Philippine society works reasonably well for ordinary citizens on an everyday basis (with some notable exceptions). If you're only considering "the usual" suspects like Canada or America then I think your question should be considered closed until someone comes along with something more than just their personal opinion about what they see around them every day back home;)
