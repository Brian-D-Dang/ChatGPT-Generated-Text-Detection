First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people being disrespectful and classless. I just noticed that you may have been thinking about racism this way: in fact, you might be right. I also want to remind myself that there are actually a lot more things we can do to help people who feel like they're being subservient to their religious beliefs (which is why I've never done that). But if it's something you find particularly offensive, then I think you'll learn how to better connect with your community without taking it personally.
