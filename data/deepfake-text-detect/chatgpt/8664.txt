I recently saw a video on why the Republicans [can't win] the 2016 election. If we go by raw numbers, Hillary will most likely win the next election. This got me thinking about how Trump has been able to do so much damage following his success in 2016 and I thought it was really interesting that he could do so well with just the right kind of information. Diane Wainwright: I know you're speaking from experience here, but those who are looking for more in-depth analysis - what is going through your mind? What's the latest news that will shape our future or influence the direction of the party? Glenn Hynicki: I believe it has to be Donald Trump, first and foremost. He wants to run around as a populist president, which means he wants to be seen as an outsider rather than being seen as somebody with some sort of deep understanding of history, economics and politics. And then that means he also believes that the Donald is having a problem not just with his own policies and even his ideas, but everyone else's policies too because people don't see their way to victory until they get out there and vote for him. Because if you look at all these last weeks, again, the reason that Donald Trump won this election is it didn't have anything to do with campaign-style attacks on Hillary Clinton and about her other problems, which were actually really good issues that people could fix themselves like the housing crisis, the state budget, the economy, healthcare, employment, education and climate change. So, I think people may have gotten tired of talking about them and changing the subject because the Republican Party couldn't get enough votes without the Democrats. They were never off the hook. But they did want to make sure to talk about the issues in terms of their own personal lives and when they ran for office in November, they wanted to bring attention to the issue that others had raised, which was the corruption and criminalization of immigrants, the fact that South Asians are getting taxed twice more than whites as opposed to American citizens. That has been demonized away from the public discourse on immigration reform, which is now apparently everywhere. The hardest part for a lot of voters, though, is not voting for Trump - it's watching him. It's like watching 20 years ago. You might watch, "Oh my God, someone's gonna steal from me!" But you can turn around and say, "Oh my God, it's our problem. It needs fixing!" Not only can people stop paying tax increases, but they can also bring back jobs, tuition payments, health insurance and many things that 50 of Americans have worked hard for decades over time, such as buying cars, breaking into businesses and owning homes. There is no doubt that this will change the country - it will create jobs, destroy poverty, build infrastructure, lift economic growth and push people closer to solving real problems, not just in America. That said, however, I dream of something that will help solve government debt, which is why I also think that there should be a money for emergencies that goes towards helping people that need it most. When I became President, I passed 2 trillion deficit reduction legislation, which basically means that we cut the federal deficit by 11, which makes us one of the nations worst-off countries in the world. In addition, when you take away debt, interest rates drop, lends, gets rid of taxes, which means we spend less on spending and borrow longer, thus reducing inflationary pressures. We eliminate deficits by cutting taxes, while we raise borrowing costs to pay for a number of programs that are important to society including health care and disaster relief. But once we start putting spending toward those priorities, the focus shifts to making sure to invest in a way that is sustainable long-term, but that keeps the possibility of political upside high and keep people happy. After all, if we don't succeed in energizing voters to vote for Trump, they won't come back to the polls and probably won't get out to vote for Trump either.
