While there may be some feminists who identify as extremists, it is not appropriate to generalize the entire movement based on the actions of a few. Changing the title of the movement would not solve the issue of extremism and would only serve to detract from the progress that has already been made towards gender equality. Additionally, the term "feminism" specifically addresses the systemic oppression and discrimination faced by women, whereas "egalitarianism" encompasses a wider range of social justice issues. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge and confront the issues within the feminist movement while still standing by the principles and goals that it embodies.
