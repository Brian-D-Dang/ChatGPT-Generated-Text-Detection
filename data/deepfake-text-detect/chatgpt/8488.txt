Before anything else, let me say that I am not, nor have ever been depressed, suicidal or abused in any way shape or form. My life so far has been pretty happy and fulfilling... but my happiness is almost always followed by jealousy! Why? Because it's a natural reaction to see someone who you love being loved more than yourself (and believe us we are all guilty of this at some point). So when somebody close was suddenly happier about something they had worked on for years without even putting much thought into if the relationship would work out then our brains can either react with "How does he feel?" Or its opposite: How do i make him be just as excitedhappy etc.. That last one doesn't help anybody though But how could anyone possibly pull off an equally strong connection after having built up such momentum over time?! Right?? Wrong!! All these questions led myself many others here actually started relationships because people were attracted towards them from their very first interaction - yes really!!! We simply fell head-over heels due irrationally feeling like giving 100 full attention whenever possible despite still carrying residual baggage around which made things easier said goodbye quicker before jumping aboard another boat only reap what yas sow kind ova thingy .. And btw keep wishing your heart away won't change those feelings If indeed God exists please explain why He allows humans behave strangely sometimes instead...there's no logic there whatsoever ok.....but yeah maybe im exaggerating tooo
