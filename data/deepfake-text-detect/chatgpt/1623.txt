I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually from families that can afford them, and they get away with not going to class because their parents or guardians know how to manipulate teachers into allowing them special treatment so as to keep up in public education The students at private schools aren't learning anything I'd argue you're just making stuff up right now but alright then
