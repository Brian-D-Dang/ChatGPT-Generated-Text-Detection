The reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using them you make the other person feel like a bad guy for saying something against your beliefs and once he or she says what was said in anger its easier to hammer home how offensive the word really is. It's all about self control at the end of the day but there needs to be an understanding on both sides as well That makes sense... So do we just have these discussions amongst ourselves? Or with friends who understand our valuesbeliefs? And if someone calls us out can't we simply give some vague response such as "Well my good friend John..."?
