In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals . We also have a number of laws in place that prevent animal abuse, such is common with dog fighting or cockfighting (punishable by up 10 years imprisonment). We don't however treat our companion animals any more humanely than this - when they get ill most people do not take care 'to cure' but instead resort back into an age long tradition known only for its poor quality food: feeding it cheap foods like bread etc which takes longer on average before symptoms appear so increasing suffering over time without necessarily providing anything other nutritional value wasting" money)
