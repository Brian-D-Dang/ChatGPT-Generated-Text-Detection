Most colleges do not require trigonometry for admissions, and do not require students to take a trigonometry course. It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math test. In addition to calculus, there are other subjects where trigonometric analysis can be used to determine the effects of math on students' academic success. For example, TRT is used in many mathematics courses (including algebra, trigonometry, trigonometrics) when examining the effects of geometry on student performance. If you use it to evaluate your GPA or marks at the final exam, then TRT might have some effect. Students may choose to follow the principles described above when choosing a math test subject. The goal of these courses is to help students understand what they value most about their academics. Together with our personal coaching, we offer safe, effective ways for students to achieve high-quality academic outcomes. Learn more here.
