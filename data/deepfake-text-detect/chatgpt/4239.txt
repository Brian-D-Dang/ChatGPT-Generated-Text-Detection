I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is one then you are right. But it seems like the universe was created to be viewed as just that, an aspect of creation and nothing more than another entity. It would seem that if we cannot understand God's existence in our world (or even ourselves), then how can there be anything beyond? In other words, given what we know about it all, couldn't everything else be made up of only the same substance (regardless of what side of the fence you fall on) i.e. disproving the existence of god is proving his nonexistence.
