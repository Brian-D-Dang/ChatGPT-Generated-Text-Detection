Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as you know we have a lot here that is really beautiful, and the last thing our government did was to destroy all those things in order for foreigners to come in and buy them. So people should be free to spend money on what they like? Or do you think that the state shouldn't get involved at all? The other side of me says "uh-oh" when I hear such statements but if these are true then where is the balance between freedom of speech and state control in a free society?
