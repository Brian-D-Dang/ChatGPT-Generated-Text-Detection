The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. You can correct a lot of the other facial problems if you want to. I am very happy with my face, I have been very lucky. I did not inherit a bad face, and I worked hard to take care of myself. It took a lot of work and I'm very happy with the results. It is more about what you feel on the inside, and this is what I wanted to talk about. I wanted to give you a tool. Please enjoy this exercise. You can only see one side of my face here. I am sure you will find the same things I do. My right eye is lower, my right eyebrow is lower, and my right cheek is lower than my left. My left eye is higher, my left eyebrow is higher, and my left cheek is higher than my right cheek. I also have a double chin, but it's not bad. I have two chins. But I am very happy with my face. I have never been concerned with how my face looked. I have always been concerned with how I feel on the inside, and how I treat others. I love this exercise. I hope you do too!
