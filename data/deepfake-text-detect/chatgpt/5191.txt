First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and therefore will never make comments like this. I swear everyone is entitled to be nice sometimes! You should definitely try being very careful with your words though do you can't just give someone else an opinion on things it's rude if they don't want it!
