First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean we should go out there and act like animals in the streets or on TV. Just because you're ok with it personally, doesnt make it artful or tasteful in any way (except for maybe exhibitionism). It's low brow crap pandering to morons just looking at tits.
