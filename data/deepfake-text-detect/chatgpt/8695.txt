I am a young black male, who is torn between both sides of the aisle regarding race relations in America. I have experience racial profiling and understand that there is no doubt on this issue (and some people won't agree with me), but my very personal view is that it is not appropriate to discriminate against Muslims because they are black males. I personally believe that our country needs to stop trying to classify each race by its own criteria as opposed to its own criteria which includes religion, gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation, rather than by them being one category over another. I will continue contributing to these discussions. I'm an advocate for civil rights and hope that those discussions help promote diversity in America.
