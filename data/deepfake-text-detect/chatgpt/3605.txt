I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still believe that interrupting a political candidate's speech is not an effective way to bring attention to their cause. It is important to remember that disrupting someone's speech is a form of suppressing their voice, and it can be counterproductive in achieving their goals. That being said, I also understand the frustration felt by the BLM activists. African Americans have been mistreated and oppressed in this country for centuries and their voices have been ignored for far too long. It is important for all of us to acknowledge and confront the systemic racism that exists in our society and to support those who are advocating for change. I would recommend having an open and respectful conversation with your friend about their perspectives and trying to understand where they are coming from. It is important to have discussions like these and to broaden our perspectives as we strive for social justice and fairness for all.
