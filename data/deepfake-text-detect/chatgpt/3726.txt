So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because of his previous criminal history. The decision has caused some controversy within the community, with some arguing that his past actions should not affect his ability to compete professionally in a game. Others argue that Magic: The Gathering has the right to maintain its standards and values, and that they have a responsibility to consider the impact of allowing someone with a criminal history to represent their brand. It is certainly a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides.
