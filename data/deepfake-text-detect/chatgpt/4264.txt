There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man wearing speedos?). I agree - but the question was how to do this without being caught by police? I think that if you want to show people what you have on under your clothes, then put those clothes back on when you are done with them!
