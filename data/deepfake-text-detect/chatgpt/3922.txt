I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium] or [ununtrium] , I got the feeling that it's almost like an emotion. The two reactions seem so similar, and they feel very much "the same." I would say its more of just a chemical reaction with quantum penalties.
