One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? In general no, but it's not always because people need every single one more than others and there are cases where having several degrees can actually be beneficial (particularly in areas with a high cost of living)
