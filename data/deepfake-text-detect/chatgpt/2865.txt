Here's what I see in my neighborhood which has 6 handicapped spots. They are almost always empty. Almost everywhere I go in my city when I'm looking for parking the gopher is already gone before i get there so it takes me about 2 minutes to find a spot if not less. I have never seen anyone take up one of those spaces with their wheelchair or scooter but they also do this at Home Depot and Lowes where you can park your personal vehicle inside, not sure why that isn't more common elsewhere
