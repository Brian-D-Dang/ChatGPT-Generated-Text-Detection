Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I 'm a female, so let me say that the only thing "gender" is good for these days (in my opinion) is making sure you aren't in one of the other gender categories when going on social media platforms like Twitter or FaceBook because they can be very difficult if not impossible to follow along with as it's hard enough trying to figure out what someone's raceethnicity means! Though we don't know exactly how long human beings have been around, some believe our species evolved from an ape around 2 million years ago. Other scientists think man appeared somewhere between 1.7 billion - 526,000 years ago depending upon which side of the argument you take. Either way, there has never existed anything known as "gender" until recently. In fact, according to evolutionary anthropologist James Watson, he first came up with terms such as sex and gender back during his doctoral work studying chimpanzees more than 40 years prior, yet none of those words were ever used publicly by anyone who wasn't male at any point in their lives until 1970s. According to Watson, the term 'sex' was first coined by German physiologist Alfred Kinsey in 1956, but still didn't catch hold among medical professionals and laymen alike until 1973. With no real definition for either word, both men and woman simply referred to themselves based off of biological characteristics: its shape and size; whether they had two testicles or just one, etc... So, Watson goes on to explain why these words are wrong in describing us all - regardless of gender. He states that while biology may dictate certain traits women possess versus men do, being biologically female doesn't make oneself automatically feminine since even animals show signs of their respective sexes throughout their lifetime including imprinting behaviors. However, DNA alone does little to define one's personality, character nor emotional makeup unless one considers it organic chemistry anyway, which Watson himself says should also need no explanation beyond mere science.
