It is pretty well known that the colombine shooters believed in natural selection, a key point of evolution. Just from their [wiki] they talk about natural selection in their journals, and how it should be implemented as part of policy I'm not advocating for shooting people to an unpopular extreme but I think banning assault rifles isn't exactly a bad idea...
