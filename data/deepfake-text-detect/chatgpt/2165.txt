I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty! Let's start with the concerns. When it comes down to eating an animal that has a brain (and other organs), there is always some concern for how humanely they were raisedkilled or even if you are getting what you paid for in terms of quality and freshness. If possible we should all try to avoid consuming animals who have been pumped full of hormones and antibiotics which can enter into our food chain as well as end up being absorbed by us. Some people may also disagree regarding their desire not wanting any part of something from such an intelligent creature...but don't worry about them too much:) Just live your life knowing you did everything within reasonable means to make sure your meal was safe both physically AND ethically:)
