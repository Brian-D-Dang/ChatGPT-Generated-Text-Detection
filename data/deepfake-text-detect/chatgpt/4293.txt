I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience, I know that if the US Government and people ever came up with the idea of invading another country with nuclear weapons they would immediately cease their efforts (at least immediately) because of the utter asshattery it would entail. For example one time back when Enron was still around George Bush said he wanted to start a nuclear war so bad!
