I'm not a native english speaker so excuse me. Alright, it seems like in this world there are only the good things and the bad things, the black and white, It is not uncommon for people to view the world in terms of black and white or good and bad. However, in reality, life is much more complex and nuanced. There are shades of gray and different perspectives that can change how we view a situation. It's important to be open-minded and consider different points of view to gain a better understanding of the world around us.
