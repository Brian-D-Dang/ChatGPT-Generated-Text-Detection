I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically speaking there's really nothing in this country to worry about other than people getting sick from radiation during their lifetime or maybe even dying if they don't have access to basic medical supplies. But what are you thinking? The government has no reason to worry about it. It's not like any uranium plant is going to do anything wrong. No one here says anything about them being dangerous or anything. In my opinion they're probably safe.
