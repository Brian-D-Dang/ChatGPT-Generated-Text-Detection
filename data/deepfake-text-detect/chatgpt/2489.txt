Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of room for doubt in any historical Jesus. Plenty of room at least as much as with other religious figures who we accept without question - take Mithras or Osiris (or Moses). I have always been interested in how you can prove something like this 100? Any scientist would be laughed out if they said "this chemical will kill every living organism" and then proceeded to test their theory by injecting themselves first before testing on rats etc. Yet when scholars do exactly what scientists are supposed not to do regarding proving facts through history...they get applauded! You can't win either way huh?? God loves this shit!!
