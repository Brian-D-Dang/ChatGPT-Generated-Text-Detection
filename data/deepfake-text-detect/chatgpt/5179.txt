I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand how important it is to be able to learn something new every week but sometimes my teacher would say that I need more time than usual because we have to focus on making it up as much as possible. The most boring class I've had was an English class since I only spent about 6 weeks at home with only one of those hours each semester due to being absent for 4 months; otherwise I wouldn't be there writing this way alone anymore (though I follow it regularly). My grades always seemed pretty good until I started taking math last year last semester
