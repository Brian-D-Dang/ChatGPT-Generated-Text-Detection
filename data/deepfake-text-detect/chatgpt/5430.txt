Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than those who didn't make it. Not sure what you mean by "hate" but I can see your point That's because the whole concept of nationalism creates a false sense of superiority, which leads some people into believing that they are inferior for being different from others rather than themselves.
