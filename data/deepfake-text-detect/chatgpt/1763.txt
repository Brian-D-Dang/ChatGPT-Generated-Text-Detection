Scientists widely accept that climate change is real. Consequently, they say that it will lead to extreme weather, a raise in the sea level, increased acidity of the ocean, reduced biodiversity and an increase in disease outbreaks such as malaria. In addition, some scientists believe that climate change has already caused natural disasters like floods and fires - sometimes called "climate-related" disasters instead of "natural." Such events are expected to become more frequent due to rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. This means we may expect increased frequency of these types of disaster for this century alone if no action is taken on climate change. The world's poor people are particularly vulnerable because their homes often lack adequate shelter or other resources needed when severe storms or flooding occur. They face even higher risks from illness and death during demonstrations after large scale food shortages have made them homeless. Killing farmers' livelihoods can also be devastating if water crops fail while fields are burned down by forest fire. It makes sense then that agriculture plays a key role in addressing global warming since it provides one of the lowest emission options available today. But there might not be enough land left over to plant new agricultural land without depleting forests first. And with human population growing rapidly around the globe, current lands could soon run out unless every area loses at least 10 percent of its trees. A recent study showed that about half of all cropland worldwide would disappear within 50 years under present trends; many countries won't even have arable soil anymore (Sara Brooks, Nature 468: 559-562). The problem facing humanity now is how do we sustainably grow food in the future? Luckily, most experts agree that increasing crop yields is both possible and desirable. However, this requires our efforts to be focused on transforming our agricultural systems into sustainable ones - which include using alternative sources for fertilizer, metal fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides which affect soil health, decreasing the use of chemical additives like chlorine and nitrogen, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from farming operations. These methods will reduce pollution but still allow us to produce sufficient amounts of food - only crucial next steps remain in order to achieve this goal. Soil is critical to feeding a growing population. When you're digging a hole in your garden, what part of the soil should you focus on? If you think back, you probably noticed a certain type of texture or color among the dirt particles. Soil science calls those minerals 'nitrogen' and 'phosphorus'. In reality, each mineral matters because it influences whether plants get nutrients properly, make seeds productive and fruit well. Without any phosphorus, for example, plants don't develop chlorophyll and photosynthesis stops entirely. On the other hand, too much nitrogen causes excessive leaf growth forcing fruits to drop prematurely before they ripen fully. Phosphorous helps plants absorb nitrogen in fertilizer. Using balanced amendments like composting manure, worm castings, lime andor seaweed supplements help keep soil healthy. If you look closely though, there are subtle differences between soils based on where they come from. For instance, deep soils contain less oxygen than loamy sandy soil. Nitrate levels vary depending on meteorology and water quality. Even submerged rocks play an important role determining nutrient availability. When researchers test algae, they find different ratios of carbon and hydrogen isotopes compared to shallow marine sediments collected near coastal coastlines. What happens here? Carbon stores are absorbed slowly by red algal cells via natural processes. As the carbon gets stuck inside cell walls, the light energy used up is re-absorbed by nearby dissolved organic matter further along in the trace stream before getting transferred through the upper layers of sediment towards deeper parts of the river system. In contrast, hydrogen makes up just 0.2 of total elements found in crushed rock samples whereas 60 comes from dissolved organic material! How does the environment impact our daily lives? Our oceans are becoming warmer and cleaner thanks to better management techniques. Above all else, humans must share responsibility for keeping nature healthy so ecosystems continue to evolve. We need cooperation across nations and regions to protect species and habitats threatened by rapid industrialization and urbanization. If everyone works together, ecological restoration projects may go far beyond restoring fragile ecosystems.
