I know this is a very controversial subject, and many people disagree with me, and I have to admit, I am not the perfect judge for this. A little background will go a long way here. The Eunuchs in India were mostly castrated children who were selectively placed by their families as servants or eunuch ranjis (men). These men would be forced into a life of sexual servitude through various means including beating, flogging, torture, name calling etcetera until they were absolutely humiliated and broken down completely. They had no choice but to remain subservient to these women simply because it was what they understood. There are stories circulating over time that most of them actually enjoyed being treated like that since its how they felt loved when they grew up without any emotional attachment towards anyone else. But then there's also those who never got used to it at all, so much so where even after years upon generations of living under such conditions some still feel unbearable pain whenever they think about such things which made it extremely difficult if not impossible for them sexually due to the trauma of it. Its only recently though that we've seen more sensitive mindsets among young Indians, especially educated ones exploring such thoughts openly while society remains oblivious. While most of us probably don't understand fully why someone has to suffer the kind of tortures our own relatives inflicted on ourselves, others just can't conceive such pain happening to anyone real, human beings. That's too bad considering how important empathy really is today, isn't it? Yet another aspect of modern day slavery...: We're slowly becoming the next South Africa..:) As far as role models- We might be talking from different perspectives here seeing as my mother raised three of her five kids not knowing either one of the other two existed along with her husband throughout her pregnancies. She didn't want a kid who may need constant attention nor did she wish having an older sibling around. So maybe she wasn't exactly looking out for role models herself! Having said that, both mine and my cousins' mothers worked outside the home doing odd jobs before settling permanently part-time working as domestic help during college break times. And yet again, neither of ours ever wanted anything close to what my mom and dad gave us growing up. But then again, neither do I now.. My auntie married a guy back in the 80s whom I saw almost every year except once between 7th 10th grade till he passed away in 2002 (aged 23), when I moved abroad. He hardly spoke English despite coming from the UK originally and his "jobs" consisted mainly of sitting on recliners watching tv or playing video games. Unfortunately, he could speak Hindi quite well thankfully. When he died unexpectedly at 34 years old in 2011, I couldn't believe it. My uncle took care of him 24x71 hour breaks daily in case my Aunt needed anything, while my parents went back to work and paid off their house loan the same month. This happened within 2 months of each other btw. I always wondered how come you guys could even afford your monthly rent with only Rs 5k per head income lolz??? Even my cousin who lives with her mom is getting by now financially speaking..she runs her online store (with orders from US!!!) full time. It gets frustrating sometimes hearing about rich couples buying multiple houses, cars, designer clothes and expensive jewellery - stuff I'll NEVER be able to buy haha. Then I remember that the financial disadvantage comes solely from starting late in life; from time spent raising kids rather than earning enough money first. Yes, I'm totally bitter right now thinking about it rn lol....but yeah i guess thats the reality folks. If only we loved ourselves unconditionally enough to earn whatever we wanted instead of blindly chasing materialistic goals?! Even my uncle himself admits that they live pretty frugally especially given their situation and does thank God everyday for everything he enjoys owning. Life definitely ain't fair; we gotta make lemonade outta lemons eventually:) Take me for example....heck, look at me!;) But anyways, I digress...backingtrack even further......okay I stopped myself lmao. Enough rambling already. As mentioned above, the point I wished to bring across is regardless of whether you agree with me about it or not, please allow me space to express my views freely. Most importantly, let's learn to empathize better together! Our compassion has evolved drastically in recent decades thanks largely to globalisation and technology allowing us to travel anywhere instantly via social media platforms. The world is likely a lot smaller than it was 50 years ago, and hopefully sooner rather than later we'll reach the stage where everyone agrees that communication is key to progress!
