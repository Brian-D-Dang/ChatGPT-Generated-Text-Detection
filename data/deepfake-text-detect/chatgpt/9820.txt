Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I want to make it clear that I fully support and respect the rights of anyone who identifies as any gender they choose, but these new genders seem like a slap in the face to anyone who is actually transgender or gender non-conforming. The new genders Facebook released include: Agender Androgyne Bigender Cis Gender Fluid Gender Nonconforming Gender Questioning Gender Variant Genderqueer Intersex Neutrois Non-binary Pangender Transfeminine Transmasculine Two-Spirit While some of these may be useful for those seeking to identify outside the traditional gender roles, many of them are incredibly redundant and almost seem like a parody of what it means to be transgender or gender non-conforming. It's important to note that just because someone is not transgender does not mean that they cannot identify with one of these genders - everyone has the right to identify in whatever way makes sense to them. However, it can be very difficult for those who are actually transgender or gender non-conforming to take these new genders seriously when they seem so arbitrary and extreme.
