I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need to smoke? No one smokes a cigarette in the morning before they walk out of bed (unless they're sick or stressed). I don't care what your body looks like after years of smoking. It's unhealthy! Chewing is disgusting too. It depends on how long he has been doing it. If he hasn't had any symptoms for months then i wouldnt worry about him stopping as it may just heal up spontaneously, if there were now health concerns then id definitely talk to his GP lol The Content on this Site is presented in a summary fashion, and is intended to be used for educational and entertainment purposes only.
