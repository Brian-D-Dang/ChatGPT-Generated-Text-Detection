Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to ... i think space debris isn't that big of a problem to our spacecraft or any other mission, it doesn't even hurt the satellites or anything, this is just a part that may have come down to the space station..... it isn't debris from a controlled area in space..... we have no reason to worry about this......
