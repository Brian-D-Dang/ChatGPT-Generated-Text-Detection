The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. Note that this depends on what "fair" means to you and how much of an issue it actually bothers you. If you want a face off between the left side and right side of your head (which I believe might be technically possible through surgery) then yes it would be fair because you have no control over which half gets more features due to geneticsyour birth position; but in actuality it would probably bother most people even more than they already do about their occasionally-asymmetric faces, since you'd never truly get used to it so being symmetrical as close as can reasonably be achieved is almost always preferable in terms of overall appearance.
