Human sentience (or consciousness, or sapience, or whatever term you like) is an emergent behavior of neurons and their interactions, which can be replicated in non-organic systems, i.e., computers. Thus far we have been unable to create a system that behaves as humans do by itself without human intervention; this includes our own actions, thoughts, emotions etc. This makes me think about whether intelligence could ever emerge from biological evolution instead of being created with technology. It's not clear if any particular physical feature would make certain organisms more intelligent than others, but it does seem possible for us to evolve technologies capable of creating artificial intelligences at some point.
