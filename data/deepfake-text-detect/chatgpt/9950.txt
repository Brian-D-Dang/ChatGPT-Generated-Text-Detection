First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100 serious here; not a troll. Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways of expressing emotion are much different than what we see in cartoons. In real life, dogs express their feelings through body language cues and vocalizations. For example, when a dog is happy, they may wag their tail, pant, or bark with excitement. When they're scared, they may tuck their tail between their legs, lower their body, and avoid eye contact. So while dogs do feel emotions, they don't necessarily show them in the same way as Disney characters.
