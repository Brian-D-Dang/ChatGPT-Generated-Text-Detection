Alright, so, I was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while I am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, the question is whether we should have a separate thread dedicated to each "level" (I would think that there are 4 at least). Level 0 - The basics. What does an RPG's math system need? You don't want to go with Unearthed Arcana because then you get unbalanced systems like DD4e which makes everything easier with rules that punish people who do what they used to be able to do in 3E2Ed without much trouble. So, how about: 1) No dice rolls! Like some in other games (notably NetHack), no random numbers means your characters will always win against every opponent; as such, dice become mostly useless for anything but narrative reasons since most characters won't roll well enough on their own to actually beat someone else unless you're playing one-shot adventures where party members all start out level 1. This also helps avoid the balance problems found in many ADnD3E style campaigns, wherein low skill levels make things just too easy, defeating any sense of challenge. If players don't know much about what's going on, having them struggle against foes that can kill them very easily doesn't really work either. However, if you decide not to use "no die rolls," what happens when something bad happens during combat? Does player character survive an attack? Survival chances seem pretty important to me given that fights tend to last longer than they did back in ye olden days before wargames. 2) Supernatural abilities only from classes that grant them. Only classes that provide super natural ability gains should receive these abilities, including Epic Destinies from paladins and bards adding staves, maces, swords, etc., feats like Weapon Specialization from fighters, spells like Quicken Spell from wizards, prestige class features like Storm Giant Barbarian Prestige Class Feature that allow you to add weapons normally reserved for giants to your arsenal, etc. Anything additional granted by these items should require appropriate training options of its type, similar to the idea behind Bardic Training or Fighter Weapons Fighting. That way, gaining access to said extra powers comes as part of being trained in those areas rather than merely picking up the item and hoping to learn how to use it appropriately later. Also, multiclassing shouldn't matter for gaining these abilities, though making sure that each class grants different ones might be nice. 3) Ability Score increases from leveling up similarly to previous editions' methods. There were certain issues that arose over time with increasing scores along with Ability Scores becoming more complex formulas, especially when designing new races. For example, ODD had a score increase between 2d6 damage per hit versus d8 plus modifier, depending upon armor worn, whereas Pathfinder has 16WIS becomes 20 (INT) STR, whereas 5e requires increased Intelligence due to use of INT instead of WIS, although regardless STR is higher now than ever before (due to faster growing creatures). In 3rd edition, AC became based off Constitution as opposed to Dexterity having nothing to do with Armor Classes anymore. Some improvements could come about from adjusting the formula properly within the system itself, perhaps changing 10 CON into 10 CHA AND dropping 0-510 modifiers altogether while instead using ABILITY SCORES to determine this effect. Then again, this may simply mean we see Boosting Bonuses again in place of improving base stats further... 4) Power points gained through adventuring should affect bonuses accordingly, potentially requiring changes depending upon the power point cost. These bonuses range anywhere from 50-150 at maximum. Characters should gain as many bonus XPs from leveling as possible, which might lead to circumstances like a wizard starting off his second wizard level with 150 XP worth of spell slots available to him, allowing for almost double normal casting rate until he levels up again. As far as other bonuses go, consider granting bonuses equal to half-levels (or less, if necessary). For instance, bonuses for reaching levels 9th11th13th equal out to 45XP22Xp18XP respectively in order to keep the game balanced. 5) Base HD equivalent to current level. When determining the amount of HP a creature receives, both at first level and after leveling up, include HD caps from 1st to 8th level, 11th to 15th, 17th to 19th, 23rd to 26th, 30th to 35th, 40th to 44th, and 47th to 51st. Each subsequent cap doubles that number. By doubling it, you encourage players to stay alive long enough that they earn another few hitpoints as experience costs rise steadily upwards. With respect to encounters themselves, I'd say level starts to become significant once your caster gets to around 7th level, if my memory serves correctly.
