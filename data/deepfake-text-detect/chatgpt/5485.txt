I was just reading [this thread] where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. I honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be good for a woman if she doesn't want her children to grow up with the perfect offspring of a hunter-gatherer society who has no morals cause he never wanted them to fuck anyone else or have kids but looked after each other and had no intention on becoming mothers before they were born. From what I've read, women aren't really selfish like men are.
