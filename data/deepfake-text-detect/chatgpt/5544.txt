I believe we should all be held accountable for our actions, both verbal and non-verbal. I believe folks say hurtful and mean things online that they wouldn't say we're they to face you in real life. I don't like to see anyone hurt, but I've learned over the years that no matter what you do, people will hurt you. What matters most is how you respond and how you react to those situations. I'm not always the best person in the world, but I strive to be. I strive to be a good mother, a good friend, a good daughter, a good sister, a good employee. I'm not perfect, I'll never be perfect, but I will always try to be better than I was the day before. I can't speak for anyone else. I can only speak for myself. I can only say how I feel and hope that when I do so, it won't hurt anyone. I hope that you all have a wonderful day. Thank you for reading my blog and I hope that you keep reading it. Kayla you are a wonderful person and a great mom! Thank you for all your hard work and for being such a great friend and mom. You have changed my life forever in the best ways possible. I love you so much!
