While reading nonfiction may be informative and practical, reading fiction still holds great value. Fiction encourages empathy by allowing readers to see things from different perspectives and understand the feelings and thoughts of others. It also helps improve creativity and imagination, which are critical to solving complex problems and developing innovative ideas. Additionally, fiction can act as an excellent stress reliever and promote mental wellness. Thus, reading fiction is not a waste of time rather an activity that boosts personal growth and development.
