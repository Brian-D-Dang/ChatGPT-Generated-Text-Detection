1.firstly most people who say it is justified don't understand what "justices" and are using it to say "it was ok!"in a more powerful way so a more fitting way would be "justice was done!." 2. they were always writing about the "good guy with a gun." even though there are tons of good guys in movies, very few actually have guns that can kill like a cop or military do. It's not justifiable because you want to show the world what an awesome manwoman you are by shooting unarmed citizens. Your actions demonstrate your character right?
