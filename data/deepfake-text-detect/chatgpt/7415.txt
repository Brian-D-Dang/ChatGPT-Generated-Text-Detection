It is understandable to sometimes feel overwhelmed or lost, and to question the purpose of life. However, it is important to recognize that there are many joys and purposeful moments in life that make it worth living. Even during difficult times, it is possible to find meaning and fulfillment through personal relationships, creative outlets, a sense of accomplishment, or contributing to the world in meaningful ways. In addition, suicide not only ends the individual's life but also causes immense pain and suffering for loved ones left behind. Rather than resorting to such a drastic solution, seeking help from mental health professionals or support groups can provide relief and guidance towards finding meaning and purpose in life.
