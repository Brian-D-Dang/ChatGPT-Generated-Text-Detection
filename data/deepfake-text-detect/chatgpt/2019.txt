To get this out of the way early: This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk. An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation. I'm sure that if you disagree with what's being said here (and can do so without resorting to ad hominems), then we would love it if you could offer your own two cents in response - but let's try and keep things civil. Before anyone else says anything about SLICrossfire: AMD does have some advantages; For example their cards are typically cheaper than NVIDIA's counterparts while offering similar performance or better depending on price point.
