Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, do I not do that for my candidates? Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, do I not do that for my candidates? Why do I not look to them for information? Why do I not ask them to tell me what they know about the process? Why do I not ask them what they know about this new system? Why do I not ask them what their needs are? Why do I not ask them about the other candidates? I'm sure you have more questions than I do, but those are just a few that I had. What's the deal? I'm the one who knows the system, I'm the one who knows the process, I'm the one who knows the other candidates, I'm the one who knows the needs of the position. I should ask the candidate the questions I want to know, right? So why do I not do this? I think the reason is that I do not want to appear as if I am biased. I do not want the candidate to know all of the information before I know it. I do not want to come across as if I am pushing my candidate on them. I do not want to make them feel like I am trying to sell them on my candidate. Now, I'm not saying that I am doing any of these things. I'm also not saying that I am not doing any of these things. I'm just saying that I think that that is the reason why I do not ask questions of my candidate. What I am saying is that if you do not ask questions of your candidates, you are doing yourself a disservice. You are not gaining the benefit of the information that they can give to you. This is information that you need to have to make the best possible decision for your organization. It is also a great way to determine whether the candidate is really a good fit for your organization or not. You may be able to tell in an interview, but that's just a feeling. Do you really want to go with a feeling? I don't think so. I think you want to be able to back up your decision. This is where the information that the candidate can give you will come into play. Candidates are going to have knowledge of the position that you are trying to fill, the organization that they will work in, and the department that they will work in. They are going to have information about the process that you are following, the other candidates, and how this job fits into their career path. They are going to have information about the team that they will be joining. Now, I'm not saying that all of this information is going to be provided by the candidate. They may have to do a little research on their own in order to be able to provide you with the answers you are looking for. They may have to ask questions of people within your organization to get the information that you need to make your decision. But you have to ask the questions. Now, I know that you may be afraid that the candidate may not like you. I don't think that this is the case. I think that the candidate would rather that you know all of the information that they have to share with you. They would rather that you know all of the information that you need to make the best decision for your organization. That is why they are there. They want to work for your organization, they want to work with your organization. I think it is your responsibility as a recruiter, as an HR professional, to ask the questions that will help you make the best possible decision. So, take a minute to think about what questions you need to be asking. I think that the more you know, the better off you will be.
