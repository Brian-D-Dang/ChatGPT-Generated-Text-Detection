While one may argue that prisoners should have the option to end their life, it is important to consider the potential harm and negative consequences that may arise from such an option. For instance, prisoners may feel pressured or forced into taking their own lives due to the harsh and inhumane conditions of incarceration. Moreover, the option to end one's life may give prison authorities the opportunity to neglect their responsibility to provide adequate mental health care to prisoners, as they could simply offer the choice to end their life as a solution to mental anguish or psychological distress. Overall, offering the option of suicide for prisoners could lead to a harmful and dangerous environment that fails to address the root causes of prisoners' mental health problems and ignores their right to receive proper care and treatment.
