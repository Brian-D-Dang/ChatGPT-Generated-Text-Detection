Okay, so I'm starting to plan my 21st. And I wanted it to be small, no more than thirty people. Inviting plus ones adds about 10 extra people that I don't really want there (they're not part of the circle), and then we have a few other friends who are invited too but wouldn't make 2 hours for just me - which would put us over 30 guests! I feel like this is an issue every year on Reddit where everyone thinks they need big parties or elaborate celebrations cause their friends all love each others' stuff. Maybe you guys can go out when your 25th rolls around?
