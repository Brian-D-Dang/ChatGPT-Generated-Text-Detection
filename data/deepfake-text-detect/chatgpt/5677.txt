Cows are neither sentient nor intelligent. They don't anticipate the future, they don't make plans, they're not moved to tears by bringing a new little cow life into the world. They're pretty much unemotional creatures who are driven by instinct. They feel no pain and no fear. They are the Earth's ultimate meat eating machines, made to devour plants and turn them into meat and milk. But to them, like every other animal, life is their highest priority. They want to live, and they want to live well. They want to be in good health and they want to feel good. A cow in the wild is a highly intelligent, agile, active and nimble creature that leaps over ravines, climbs tall trees and is a major predator. The most intelligent cows are those that are treated well and have a good life, and the less intelligent and more stupid are those who are treated poorly and experience a terrible life. And that's the point of all of this: we can treat animals well, or badly. We can do it with cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, sheep, chickens, fish, birds, bees, or any other animal. Most people, including many vegans, don't understand that they can have their cake and eat it too. It's not impossible, it's not even hard to do. It's only hard to do if you think it's hard. It's hard if you think it can't be done, or if you think you need to be in a "perfect" situation. Here's the truth: we are imperfect. We are not perfect people, we are not perfect farmers, we are not perfect scientists. We are not perfect. We are all making mistakes every single day. But I am willing to bet that all of us, even the most hardcore, life-long vegans, are not perfect. And we all have more in common than what separates us. We all want to live our lives, and we all want to live well. We all have children we love and care for. We all have families and friends. We all have animals we care about. We all have a stake in this world. We are all trying to make a living and survive. And we all have the power to make a difference, no matter what our circumstances. We all have the power to make a difference. Think about it this way: if your only job was to raise cows, what would you do? What would be the best way to treat them? What would be the most natural way to treat them? If you were the farmer, what would you do? You would not want to have a cow that was in pain, that was afraid, that was stressed, that was sick. You would not want to have cows that were treated poorly or fed poorly or had their young stolen from them. And when the cows started to get old, you wouldn't want to just kill them. You wouldn't want to kill them just to kill them. You wouldn't want to kill them because they weren't good enough to eat. You wouldn't want to kill them because they couldn't be as profitable as a two year old. You wouldn't want to kill them because you could make a lot of money slaughtering them. You wouldn't want to kill them because you couldn't have your cake and eat it too. You would want to treat them well. You would want to make them feel good. You would want to make them happy. You would want to treat them as well as possible. You would want to keep them in their natural habitat and let them live their lives. You would want to keep them with their families and babies. You would want to let them live out their natural lives. And that's what I think the vast majority of farmers want to do, too. I think the vast majority of farmers want to treat their cows as well as possible, and to allow their cows to live out their natural lives. They just don't know how to do it. They don't know how to do it because they've never been taught how to do it. They don't know how to do it because they've been told by their bosses that they have to do it a certain way. They don't know how to do it because they don't have the money to do it. They don't know how to do it because they're afraid of getting in trouble. But they still want to do it. I've spent the last two years trying to figure out how
