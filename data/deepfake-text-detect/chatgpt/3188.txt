Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a complex and tumultuous time in American history, with a war that lasted for over a decade and involved many geopolitical factors. While it may be challenging to fully understand all of the complexities involved, there are several key points that are worth considering. Firstly, the Vietnam War was a conflict between two distinct ideologies: capitalism and communism. The US was fighting against a communist regime to try to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. Secondly, the war was also driven by a deep-seated fear of the so-called "domino theory," which argued that the fall of one country to communism would inevitably lead to the fall of neighboring countries, and so on. This was seen as a major threat to US national security. Thirdly, the war had a profound impact on American society, including sharp divides between those who supported and those who opposed the war. It also highlighted longstanding racial and economic inequalities in the US, with many poor and working-class Americans being drafted to fight in the war. Overall, while there are many different perspectives on the Vietnam War, it is important to continue to learn about and critically engage with this complex period in US history.
