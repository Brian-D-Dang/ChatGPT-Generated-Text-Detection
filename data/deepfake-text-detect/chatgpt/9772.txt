To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting to high school, I understand that Common Core is designed to ensure that students from all across the country are able to compete with their peers and have the same knowledge base. Common Core also sets standards for what specific skills a student should learn in each grade level, thus providing a more uniform education system throughout the United States.
