Although being thin is often portrayed as desirable in American society, that doesn't negate the reality that thin-shaming exists. Just because someone is thin, it doesn't mean that they are free from criticism or negativity about their body image. Thin-shaming can come from many sources, including social media, friends, family, and even strangers. Moreover, it is not just "jelly" women who criticize thinness, but also men and people of all shapes and sizes who see the harm in promoting only one body type as ideal. It is essential to recognize that everyone has the right to feel comfortable and confident in their own bodies, regardless of their size. Thin-shaming only adds to the negativity and harm that many people already feel about their bodies.
