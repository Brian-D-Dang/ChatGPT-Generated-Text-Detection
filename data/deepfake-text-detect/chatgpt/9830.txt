After the number of fictional books and nonfictional books I've read, I've come to the conclusion that fiction is always more of a waste of time than nonfiction. I've read far more nonfiction books, and have found them to be more educational and informative. Nonfiction books often provide facts, figures, and other information that can be helpful in decision-making or in understanding a subject. Fiction, on the other hand, is often more of an escape from reality and can be entertaining, but it lacks the educational and factual value that nonfiction books offer.
