Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not how much you get paid, but when this happens over time... Well then we start getting into problems of dignity at work or labour rights issues (as well as having many other reasons why tipping is evil). - MelkorSep 16 '15 20:53
