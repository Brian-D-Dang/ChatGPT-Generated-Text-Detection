It is not accurate to claim that men have a more balanced number of sexual partners than women. The study shows that men are often encouraged socially to have multiple sexual partners and may even face admiration for doing so, while women are often shamed and judged for the same behavior. This societal double standard leads to women underreporting their sexual partners and men overreporting theirs, creating an apparent imbalance. In reality, both men and women may have similar numbers of sexual partners, but the social pressure on women to conceal their sexual behavior creates the perception of a gender imbalance.
