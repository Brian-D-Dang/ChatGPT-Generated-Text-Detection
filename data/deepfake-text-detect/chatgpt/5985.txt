I believe that it is bad for humans generally that we have patriotism. It leads not only to discrimination. (hello Mr Trump) But also to economic and political difficulties and even wars. We are selfish. I say this because it is the case for the UK. The UK has been in the EU for about 40 years. The UK has a very bad economy. The UK has very low productivity. The UK has a very small economy. The UK has very high unemployment. The UK has very high inflation. The UK has very low living standards. These things are bad. But the UK is a member of the EU. So the UK cannot change these things. The UK can do nothing to improve these things. The UK can leave the EU and all these things will improve. I am not a Brexiteer. I am not a Leaver. I am not a Europhile. I am just a rational person. If you look at the UK and the EU, I see that the UK is worse off than the EU. So it should not leave. If you look at the UK and the UK, I see that the UK is worse off than the UK. So it should not leave. I have no emotional attachment to the EU. I am a rational person. There are two types of people. There are rational people and there are emotional people. Rational people do not have patriotism. I am not a patriot. I am not an emotional person. I am a rational person. I have no problem if the UK leaves the EU. But I will never support the UK leaving the EU. It would be a disaster for the UK. The UK would be worse off than the EU. The UK would be worse off than the EU and I would be worse off. It is a stupid idea. The EU has economic advantages. The EU has political advantages. The EU has military advantages. The EU has a culture and a community. The EU is economically more important than the UK. The EU is politically more important than the UK. The EU is militarily more important than the UK. The EU has a better culture and community than the UK. The UK is economically more important than the EU. The UK is politically more important than the EU. The UK is militarily more important than the EU. The UK has a better culture and community than the EU. So leaving the EU would be a disaster for the UK. The UK would be economically and politically weaker. The UK would be more dangerous in the world. The UK would be more racist. I am not an emotional person. I am a rational person. I don't care about the UK. I care about my own country and my own children. But I also care about the world. I do not want the UK to be weaker in the world. I do not want the UK to be a bad example for the world. I do not want the UK to be racist. I am a rational person. I don't care about patriotism. I don't care about the UK. I do care about the world. The world is a better place with the UK in the EU. The world is a worse place with the UK out of the EU. The UK is a better place with the UK in the EU. The UK is a worse place with the UK out of the EU. The UK is a better place with the UK in the EU. The UK is a worse place with the UK out of the EU. The UK is a better place with the UK in the EU.
