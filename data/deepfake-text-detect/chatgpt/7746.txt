While it is true that some friendships between guys and girls may evolve into romantic relationships, it is not always the case. Many people have platonic friendships with people of different genders and are not interested in taking it to a romantic level. Assuming that all friendships between guys and girls are inherently romantic undermines the value and importance of platonic friendships. Additionally, this notion perpetuates harmful stereotypes that men and women cannot have meaningful platonic relationships without a sexual component.
