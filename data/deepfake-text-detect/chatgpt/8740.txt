Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: "how does it come about that this right is inherent?" What makes this right inherently unique? And what do you think people should be allowed to have in their homes because they are not citizens of this country? As a citizen, I am entitled to self-defense. And I own firearms and I own guns. Because these are tools and weapons that can be used for self-defense as well as when injured or killed by someone else." If there were different interpretations on our rights, we would all get along very well. We wouldn't all have problems with one another. You don't need each other's help just because we're in some sort of conflict. You might see each other, but if you've ever been struck down by an unlawful act, are you going to take your gun away from me and put it back around my neck? That won't happen unless I give you my gun to use against somebody who needs to shoot me. And so should that right come to being undeniably inherent, then obviously, some elements if this right comes to be innate, because at some point in history, we ought to try and set aside every bit of social norms and values that will prevent us from doing that. So perhaps we should examine how we behave towards others where we may disagree, whether we agree or not, because ultimately, our differences aren't a matter of race or culture or gender. But certainly there are certain things that we must understand and worry about when we talk about inclusion, equality, and fairness. And anyone who says otherwise is mistaken, and it is because we cannot coexist; we cannot even admit that we exist. If we let others down, we may become less inclusive and more unequal in ways that no human being deserves. I'm not saying I wish we could fix everything but we shouldn't waste time trying to fix everything. By keeping ourselves free, we'll never forget anything past those moments.
