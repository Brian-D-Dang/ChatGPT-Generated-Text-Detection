[This article] does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article] that lays out some challenges to their validity, and links back to an older more detailed analysis by one Neil Macmillan (who is apparently in favor or Ayn Rand's views). There are also blogs like this which raise questions about whether these numbers reflect actual demand as opposed just what people tell pollsters they want under certain circumstances.[QUOTE]. The problems with crony capitalism seem kind-of obvious but it seems much harder than usual nowadays just because most everyone has bought into its basic premises; i think if you try telling someone "basic income" won't help cure all sorts o' ills caused be modern corporate business practices then there will always rise up angry mob demanding explanations why your saying such unthinkable things!: On second thought maybe not?:
