Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and it's obvious for me to see how women can be raped by men; but what about the other way around? Can you imagine someone raping your daughter or sister while she was sleeping in her own bed at night (or even if he coaxed them into believing their partnerboyfriend had permission)? It sounds like something outta some horror movie... And although there are cases where males do commit sexual assault on females too - they're usually seen as extreme acts rather than normal ones: ehem....rape rings...... But anyway my point here being this..can't we all agree together now why "male" would definitely imply'man'?:) Mostly because its so ingrained within us from school days itself since childhood when one first learnt things.....Thanks Regards:P
