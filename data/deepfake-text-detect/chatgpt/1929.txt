A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a pellet rifle her father had given to her for Christmas, while the "Supervisor" was standing next to her behind some safety barrier holding his own Super Soaker watergun in one hand (that he agreed with me should have been point up) and an AK-47 style semiautomatic assault weapon in another. The sad fact is that children who want guns will get them whether they are legal or not; I would rather see parents educate their kids on proper firearm usage than worry about making laws against it.
