I'm not a cop hater. I like to think I'm a relatively reasonable person but I'm honestly not even 100 sure how I really feel with the constant barrage of police brutality stories right now and seeing all these people posting their lives are in danger because they're black or have dreads makes me wonder at times if it's just no better than stormfront forums The lack of introspection on your part is telling... You don't need an organization that advocates white supremacy for you to believe you are under attack by cops, or should be doing something about it.
