Not trying to start a flame war, I'm looking for a new tablet and I would consider an ipad, but I just don't see the appeal just yet. What on earth is special about it? I'd say it's amazing how fast apps load vs android where you have to wait 5 minutes before they even render The screen size makes me feel like i can do more with my hands (like typing)
