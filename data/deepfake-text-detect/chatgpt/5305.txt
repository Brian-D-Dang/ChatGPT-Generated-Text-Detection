I attribute my agnosticism to this very theory. Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in the universe before the Big Bang existed but that everything after it had been created already because of all the possible outcomes of an instantaneously occurring particle accelerators and particle accelerators. This explains why it would have happened anyway since there is no such thing as instantaneous motion around the Big Bang where not only does no matter exist immediately afterwards but also the entire universe itself did not exist on its own right? Bryan Cranston showboated: Would you accept a theory like this one if it were true (and if so, how does it fit into the universe)? With all due respect, Bryan Cranston I dont believe you are aware of this kind of skepticism when discussing the Big Bang theory yet. Anybody who says that, especially the proponents of Big Bang Theory should do their research first. If you don't like the Big Bang theory then there shouldn't be any confidence in it either. You forget that there isn't even a single particle accelerator here except for the core of Milky Way galaxy. There's plenty more than just particles going through the universe.
