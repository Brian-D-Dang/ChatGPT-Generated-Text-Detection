I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that are mostly funded by the same 2 parties, Liberals and conservatives, it's a lot like the US. Same in Australia, we have a few main parties but mostly it's the Labor and Liberal parties that are really active in the media. People don't really like the Greens, but the Greens have about the same amount of voting power as the Liberals, so I guess the Greens would be like the Democrats in the USA. We also have a few small minor parties like the Christian Democrats but they are really small and don't get much attention. I wish we had more parties here in Australia. I don't want to see the Greens get into power, but I think they are a good thing. There was a large number of minor parties that were in the senate, but they're all gone now, so we only have the 6 main parties. What I'd really like to see is more balance in the Senate. Currently the Senate is mostly run by the conservatives and liberal parties but there should be more balance in the senate. Can you imagine if we had 6 parties instead of 2 and it was a coalition government like in the USA? I'd love to see that. I'd also love to see a party that is honest about their political views and not pandering to get votes. I'd vote for a party that was honest, just like the Democrats. It's my vote and I'll vote for who I want to. I'm sick of seeing political parties attacking each other on TV and in the media. I don't care what party you are, there should be no attack ads. So many of the politicians have a lot of power and they do a lot of things that the people don't agree with. Politics should be about the people not about power. It's also why I'm sick of seeing politicians turn to their party after a scandal, they should be held responsible for their own actions, not hide behind the party line.
