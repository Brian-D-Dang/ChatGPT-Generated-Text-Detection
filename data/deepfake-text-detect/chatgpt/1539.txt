I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is. The consumer gains little to nothing from this unless the price has already been cut at some point in time." There are many reasons companies do not charge their customers what they want, and why we have all paid more on our bills since deregulation began blowing up gas lines across America. Consumers who had previously paid 5 per gallon for gasoline suddenly see it jump to almost double that amount! There's only one explanation: A monopolistic corporation like Chevron is taking advantage of people with monopoly power by taking a loss so long as there is still demand for its product.The same goes for electricity and telephone service which, incidentally, was deregulated along with natural gas supply nationwide. If the cost of running your home or business jumped significantly after being freed of government regulation, would you choose to use your new found freedoms? I betcha wouldn't...in fact, like most Americans today, if I could get my old rate back (higher yet!), I'd happily pay a higher bill just because I've decided freedom isn't free anymore! Anytime you hear an outrageous story about theft, fraud, etc., look into where it occurred; chances are high it happened right here in Texas! As far as I'm concerned any attempt to create a state-run electric grid needs to be stopped immediately. It will eventually lead us down another path very similar to Nevada's the government wants complete control over everything, even when doing so leads to disaster. Don't be fooled by those who tell you "we're good guysgals." Unless someone steps forward now to say exactly how much money has actually been stolen during this whole bailout mess (700 billion), perhaps none of these politicians or officials involved ever really cared about what happened until the spotlight faded away....and then there were no more stories left to write. At least now we know what happened, but did anyone care before all of this started happening? Probably not! Not enough Texans came out to vote anyway. Monday, March 16, 2009 Cause I'm bored.....:) In case you don't follow me via Twitter (TexansFired, TXIdeas nwhouston), take note that I tweeted out yesterday afternoon regarding the illegal actions of Houston mayor Tommy Schaefer, TXGOP chairman Allen West and Steve Munisteri regarding the Janus ruling: That should keep you busy until Thursday morning's hearing! Keep sending more tweets!!! Whether we win or lose tonight, we need to send out some "Schaefers" to someplace else soon!!;) It seems like every day the Houston area gets slammed with news headlines concerning the city's corrupt and inept police department. Now we find out that Houston City Council member Helen Giddings may have been illegally spying on police officers making arrests last year solely due to her political beliefs. According to the article linked above,... A top aide to Mayor Annise Parker says she ordered a former city worker with whom she didn't always see eye to eye to spy on Houston Police Chief Charles McClelland while he made arrests last summer. But that person - Darlene Woodard, who headed Houston Public Works - told investigators Tuesday night that she never saw or heard anything others reported about McClelland's behaviour, according to documents released Wednesday evening under the Freedom of Information Act. Her testimony deals a significant blow to plans by two council members to subpoena her for information related to the scandal. Those lawmakers' lawyers filed motions in federal court late Wednesday asking U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes to block subpoena requests they said were politically motivated. One motion asks him to order the release of all records requested by the attorneys, including criminal investigative reports, 911 calls and internal communications between senior staffers outside the metro government complex. Another argues that Hughes shouldn't accept arguments from the two council members that "the existence of the subpoenaed materials somehow threatens to impede public access to governmental meetings generally." ... Woodard also claimed her reporting of concerns she raised directly to McClelland during a July 10 meeting violated city rules governing employees' participation in citizen advisory groups. She resigned amid questions surrounding her involvement in surveillance efforts against McClelland and Assistant Chief Jeff Martin, both men facing possible indictment for allegations ranging from inappropriately trying to influence HPD investigations to improperly hounding political opponents.... In an affidavit supporting her request for immunity, Woodard disclosed seeing what appeared to be text messages on her mobile phone that showed other Houston media outlets identifying a man arrested by undercover officers as Craig Young, a candidate seeking the Democratic nomination to succeed state Rep. Cecil Bell Jr. - who represents parts of northeast Harris County near downtown. He denied knowing anything about the incident until reporters contacted his campaign office days later. Asked whether she thought it might have come from either of the four eight nine10 digital group. Group.. group. All Interveniof and Inter... Ins. one.
