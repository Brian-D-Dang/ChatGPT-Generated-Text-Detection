First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised. Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, so of course there is no memory involved in feeling any degree or sorta-sortta amount (other than the rare occasion) discomfort caused by being uncircumdiced anymore; this makes my skin around where they cut open and sewed up very thick with scar tissue - which for some reason has made masturbation less pleasurable now since adolescence but still great fun regardless! The only downside about having been circ'ed while alive would be if you were ablewilling enough through adulthoods changes removals etc., procedures one could foresee down time when their penis might become somehow damaged due too much wear fighting against nature inside them selves during such events...the most painful part comes from knowing how bad things get afterwards after even minor bouts held over short periods like maybe just an hour before bedtime: likely "seizures" instead called 'erections'. As well,if your lady had access she may have poked her finger into those same delicate places under what we call foreskin back then resulting on soreness..painfull infections are possible also.... But oh wait...there's more!! Now imagine yourself taking extra long showers....and baths without lather soap wash cloth protection.....Men generally don't use thingie lotion anyway........Soap buildup dry cracked tender flesh again making swelling worse......you can bet boys will start developing blisters soon right out side next genitals area once our parents decide its ok..... (where did he learn all these new words???) Why do girls freak anytime football players fart? And why cant guys take deep breath unless gasping??? Seriously folks check yourselves know whats going outside bodies cause thats exactly gonna happen whether anyone wants us men go along willy nilly each sexual experience..be careful ...especially white males!!! You got plenty chances ahead possibly cuckold first born child syndrome consequences coming....... (just asking). We old timers look forward seeing young lovers enjoy themselves doing others together always best friends forever! No matter kids grow older sometimes better ways come thru later years yet wonderful treat moments should never stop happening [...]
