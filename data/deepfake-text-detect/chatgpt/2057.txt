People who have no interest in politics, and are not interested in learning about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it its somehow their duty. It isn't - you're doing your country a disservice if all you do is cast one-party votes because they fit into some vague notion of what 'the right thing' is That's very true; I imagine people like that don't even know how voting works or why we get elections every 4 years (I certainly didn't).
