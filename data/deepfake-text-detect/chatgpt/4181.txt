It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet. I've always found it interesting how some bicyclists will ride their bikes on the sidewalkstreet and never use any sort of protective gear or helmets, despite having no reason to do so (except maybe because if was a woman she would be told off by another female cyclist on a scooter who hasn't even seen her). But EVERYONE knows motorcycles aren't welcome anywhere but on a paved road, right? My point is that motorcycles were allowed to pollute more than cars and trucks on our country's roads when we weren't too concerned about the environment. It wasn't until recently that stricter laws began being enforced against non-polluters like motorcycle riders, especially in urban areas where car drivers often get away with abusing the streets and their fellow citizens. As for your question regarding being respectful, I agree entirely! In fact, most "bikers" have almost zero respect for anyone else and expect everyone around them to share the road as well - which is why they're assholes to begin with. If you want to act like an idiot and put others at risk, then just stay home, go inside, and let us former bikers enjoy our freedoms without getting shot or killed. I lived in the US from 1981 to 1988, as one could only imagine from my username. The ride back was much smoother, although the ride back to escape the heat wave there was not without its challenges: 1) There was no such thing as a left turn lane; unless you went down a public street. 2) We had very few lanes on the highway; except for the shoulders, which you didn't need to use all the way up to the exit ramp. 3) People still drove on the shoulder. Back then you'd try to merge onto the highway as soon as possible and avoid the traffic coming towards you. I remember seeing cabs driving the wrong way on freeways. 4) Most highways were congested enough before the '80s, and now they were getting worse. 5) When we traveled together as a group, the first person to take over when someone got sick was usually the driver. Nobody wanted to wait.... 6) Most of what we saw along our travels was devastation. Very little infrastructure provided adequate protection against natural disasters. 7) Our speedometers read 65MPH, not 70 because the auto manufacturers couldn't figure out how to make it work. 8) And of course, the inconvenience factor. All the extra time pushing face buttons and looking for signals made that part of the trip rather tiresome. 9) Even watching news reports about natural disasters was tough because they happened so fast that you really didn't notice them. Then again, they did happen faster than today... 10) Many places have laws requiring businesses to give free water if there's a fire, tornado, etc., even though these things can also occur rapidly. Why shouldn't banks close when there's a hurricane coming? Same goes for stores after tornadoes. 11) I remember seeing a sign that said something to the effect of "Sorry, the rain sticks here." This was on a section of highway with lots of puddles. I think the GMC truck behind me started pouring into this puddle before he hit the sign so he had to stop. Silly truckers. 12) One day I pulled off the interstate and bought a gas can, filled it with diesel fuel, and drove through town pumping it into each tire as I passed gas stations that were closed due to Hurricane Sandy. All of the pumps were working perfectly fine, but none of the filling stations seemed open yet. The lines were long and it took two hours to fill up the tanks. 13) More than once I saw a bus lose a wheel due to poor handling. A couple times it actually ended up on its side. Of course, bus owners will tell you they love it when a wheel falls off and that it doesn't affect safety since wheels rarely fall off anyway...but that's beside the point. 14) Once upon a time I used to have a friend who worked at a chain store. He would sometimes deliver candy bars to small children were his van wouldn't start. After delivering several dozen candy bars he finally gave up waiting for it to stop raining. Instead he parked in front of the building and waited for a while. Eventually the kids would come running and grab the candy bars and run off. Usually that's why gas stations close earlier. They end up scattering candy everywhere to keep the street clear for deliveries later. My friend wondered why nobody ever counted the amount of candy bars thrown by the kids. Another friend asked him how many children ran away with candy bars once they were done eating them. His reply: even plants requiring the teenagers would give day. They were chyana. They messed with aquatic plant. I saw there was. last April, but it has huge
