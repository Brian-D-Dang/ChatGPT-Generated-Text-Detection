(A) Work part-time in high school; Then go to college (B) Work full-time before you go to college (C) Work while you study in college. I was a spoiled lazy bastard, but I don't think this would be an issue for me if I just went to school once and didn't try to get caught up with my studies. I've always been interested in what it takes to do the same thing and study hard. I'm going to take something at least like 3 or 4 classes so far
