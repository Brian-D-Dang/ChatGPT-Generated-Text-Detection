I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by asking himher about hisher opinion of me. So...am I being too sensitive? If so is there any way around that without causing the same sort of hurt feelings as if they have already made their mind up and just won't admit it yet? Or am I misunderstanding something here? A: It seems like you're confusing your own evaluation of yourself with some kind of self-doubt about how others will evaluate you. While under certain circumstances it might be appropriate for someone else to "unwelcome" you - such as when people are friends who go back in time and meet each other before they become lovers etc. - in general, most people would not feel comfortable telling someone else whether they like them unless either party has explicitly asked, which makes perfect sense. If he finds himself lacking confidence in one area of his life while still having an abundance of confidence in many areas (that does happen from time to time), then chances are good that it wasn't really "him" who was feeling insecure; rather, it was possible social dynamics situations at play that caused a temporary lack of confidence (such as coincidental media attention).
