I was only able to find one other thread about this topic, and it was kind of a train wreck. Common arguments: "It's not Jraphics Interchange Format" by that logic, no normal image file is either (you can just specify the pixel format in Photoshop). The W3C also agrees with me on all my points above except for Silverlight support; they say there are limitations but won't elaborate much beyond saying you should use HTML5 instead if possible... Also related question Is GIF89aG9 allowed? which I think answers none or almost nothing at least as far adagio goes..
