While it's true that labeling people based on their race or gender can create divisions, it also serves an important purpose. Recognizing the accomplishments of historically marginalized groups brings attention to the systemic barriers they have faced in achieving success. Additionally, it highlights the progress we have made towards creating a more equitable society. For example, acknowledging someone as the "First African-American" or "First Woman" to achieve a certain milestone shows that progress is being made towards more diversity and representation in various industries. By recognizing and celebrating these achievements, we can encourage more individuals from diverse backgrounds to pursue their goals and inspire future generations to do the same.
