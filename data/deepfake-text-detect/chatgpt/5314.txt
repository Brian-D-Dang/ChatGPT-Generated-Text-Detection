I'm very confused and bothered by the amount of ads for prescription medications that run on television and in magazines. In my mind, the reason that these medications can only be found online is because some people cannot afford them back home or because many Americans don't have access to those medicines at all! The problem with the internet has always been there but sometimes it's hard not to see what a parent wants from their children when they are pregnant. And the more we know about drugs such as OxyContin, Xanax, etc., the more likely he'll think "Haven't you heard of this stuff?" When it comes time to go through physical therapy, I find myself wondering how much insurance companies will pay out if I decide I need surgery due to an injury? But instead of being scared off by costly pharmaceuticals, I'd like to encourage parents to take steps toward preventing addiction rather than waiting until the baby has developed serious medical problems before taking any action against medication addiction.
