before you guys bombard me with downvotes I would simply like to point out that I am not saying this is true. I am just expressing my conditional views that if it were, then the Fed could end up buying treasuriesbonds as a way of stimulating growth (which they did in response to the recession). You're an idiot and don't have any idea what you are talking about. Go back to rpolitics.
