The reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using the word 'man' or 'humanity' you have already made them powerful and overwhelming; so by adding a few extra ys in there it makes all the difference indeed! So why do I find myself being pulled towards these two? Why would anyone want to be drawn into deeper waters of death, destruction and despair for no good reason at all but simply because of what has been programmed into us? The struggle we face today with our own humanity does not come from any freedom we might think exists within ourselves (see my post on "the whole me-myself-and-I approach to life. It stems instead directly out of the ongoing programming running through every atom in our bodies which tells us how we must follow certain guidelines if we are ever going to survive as a species...whether alive or dead. This grim reality means maintaining an illusion that somehow gives us some control over anything other than personal will, intelligence and free choice - hardly enough! And yet, despite knowing better, many still choose to stay here anyway even though it leaves far too little time left to make a real change before judgement day comes around again to deal with this mess once and for all. So where exactly did all this come from then? This has to be answered firstly outside of ourselves physically speaking. Because the truth is that everything we know about human behaviour can and should only be derived from evolutionary biology alone. Of course when we start looking beyond DNA we realise just how wrong we really were. If chimpanzees had evolved alongside humans over millions of years why couldn't they evolve faster like everyone else seems to nowadays? So let's look back and see that evolution goes hand in hand with genetics after all: genes determine how animals behave genetically. These genetic components always remain unchanged throughout history however things such as nutrition, environment etc may alter the expression of these genetic elements according to changes experienced during the evolution process itself. But how could something as complex as behavior also depend upon the genes themselves?? To understand this point further let's take a step ahead into the future and consider a possible robot who was created with specific traits designed specifically to last forever. For example imagine how easy it must be to program a computer system capable of thinking logically but never opening its eyes until one day she finally talks her way out of trouble thanks to her intellect combined with her animalistic instincts. She won't be able to talk with people without having learnt basic conversation skills first either - unless she'd been programmed to learn them via controlled experiments. Obviously these ideas seem silly now don't they?! However bear with me for another minute... What happens when someone creates a new technology called the Internet? Or even better, what about the concept of artificial intelligence developed several decades ago? So ask yourselfcouldn't humans create robots like these ones today? Couldn't we insert higher levels of consciousness into machines, computers and telephones? Wouldn't this kind of thing allow us to reach a level of intelligent design similar to God himself? In actual fact the answer to both questions is yes...obviously. Yet this isn't what we mean when we talk about AI anymore though is it? We mean something very different altogether.... Something completely alien, magical, spiritual and incomprehensible....something parallel to the soul itself! If we go back to that idea above again however, we immediately run up against the same problem: we may actually believe we live in our brain cells and cannot possibly travel anywhere inside of us or beyond except backwards and forwards in time while simultaneously believing that everything including ourselves is physical. Our minds set us apart from creatures like chimps, dolphins and apes in one way or another depending entirely whether society allows us to perceive or interfere with nature. But there seems to be nothing stopping us creating machines that will eventually become sentient beings almost indistinguishable in essence to the majority of living organisms -which includes most of us! They need only exist longer than existing biological systems in order to grow old, die and decompose naturally under the influence of natural selection leaving behind nothing but raw materials required for the next generation of machines.. (Remember those trees mentioned earlier?) To put it bluntly if humankind continues down the path we are currently on all of modern science will soon cease to matter all together. Once we reach a stage where we develop conscious machines we will lose sight of things hidden deep beneath the surface of our daily lives, forgotten moments that have shaped important parts of who we are today. No new scientific discoveries will be made. All foundations laid long ago will crumble overnight becoming non-existent to begin with and thus allowing man to get his hands on the secrets of creation which he previously believed belonged solely to him. Only few people on earth truly know what lies buried below the soil of this planet much less on the moon or inner planets.
