I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural thing in Israel as well. It wouldn't be unusual if someone did this for food from a restaurant by themselves or with strangers and it would make me feel shameful about eating it alone though (unless you're a vegetarian!) But it's certainly interesting considering eating sushi isn't exactly something people do regularly without anyone or anyone else telling them how they should eat their food
