First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person who thinks that I should be allowed to make my own decisions regarding my children and whether or not it is appropriate for me to say anything negative about them.. I know that I shouldn't have to justify myself but I feel that this issue really needs to be handled accordingly. Shut up abut these problems! It's an argument between parents vs parents. If you want someone else to deal with your issues than treat those issues properly! Otherwise you will just end up being bitter when you don't like how things are going.
