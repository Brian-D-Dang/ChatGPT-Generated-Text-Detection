This CMV post is partly inspired by this rrelationships [post] I came across earlier today. This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had much time to write anything about it because I was mostly reading. I have written about our religious differences before, but I thought I would go into more detail about it. While I am not a Christian, and I do not have any problem with any other religion, I am a practicing Christian.

I believe that people should be able to share their religious views without being afraid that other people will think that they are fanatics. I believe that religion should not be a part of politics and it should not be a part of the lives of people. It should not be a part of education, and it should not be a part of the justice system.

I believe that religion should not be a part of the justice system because people do not need a religion to live a moral life.
