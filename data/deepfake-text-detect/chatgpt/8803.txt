First of all, the law I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general. Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. She's on a wheelchair and doesn't want you to call her at your place. Instead she will ask if you'd like to go out for dinner with someone (I know it is easier that way) then leave you to your own devices. You've got no intention of actually calling her anyway. That's what I thought too but it seems the lady was listening on speakerphone and decided not to listen. So she does seem very interested, although I don't think it should be that bad. Would she walk around pretending to be friendly so we can talk about our problems? Or do you think it would make more sense to leave the house rather than continue talking on speakerphones?
