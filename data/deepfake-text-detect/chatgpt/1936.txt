Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for preferring a stick shift as far as daily driver choices are concerned though - again this isn't to say they're not fun but you can find joy from driving an automatic just fine too:) I think the most important argument is that those who enjoy cars tend to be more passionate about their car than your average person so if there's something like shifting gears then why should he ignore his passion? And i'm sure my gf would love me even when she has no idea how much horsepower her jetta makes or what its top speed actually is:p
