I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still disagree with them on what they do not agree with and why. You should not be defending people for disrupting your political opponents' speeches. Especially when it sounds like you were annoyed at being interrupted yourself because you didn't want to hear a certain point made by someone else. Not all protest is about being heard or getting your message across. It's also supposed to be for change, no matter how small. The problem was that he was interrupting his own speech...
