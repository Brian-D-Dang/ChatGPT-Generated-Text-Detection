I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for raping an 11 year old, they could go ahead and kill themselves when they're done. I'm not sure I agree with that. A person would be expected to show up in court to face punishment; however, there's no "default" punishment. If this was done as part of sentencing (similar to what happens with murdermanslaughter), then it may make sense.
