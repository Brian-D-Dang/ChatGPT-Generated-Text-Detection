I been using Google Chrome as far as I remember (probably since 2010) and it's been my default browser on all the computerslaptops I've used. Chrome was fast, reliable and did not need much of system resources when in use that time.. Chrome has improved its speed a lot! And it still requires less memory than other browsers like Firefox or IE11:).Since Microsoft decided to only support Internet Explorer 11 through Windows 10 will be no more updates for this version, so there is almost nobody left who uses IE.Many people are now moving towards Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc...It would seem strange if an updated browser would remove your data from the previous one?
