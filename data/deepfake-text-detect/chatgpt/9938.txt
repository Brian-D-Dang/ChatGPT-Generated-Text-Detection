Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes. Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities. The cabotage law is meant to protect the US aviation industry by preventing foreign airlines from competing with domestic carriers in the US. Additionally, it ensures that foreign carriers must meet the same safety and labor standards as US-based airlines.
