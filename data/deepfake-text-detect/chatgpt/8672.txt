Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by reason or logic. This means, as we've seen before, that something needs to get done in order for society to thrive. I'm not arguing that a certain level of rationality - which was the backbone of our species at some point in time - cannot work very well here; it's just that all rational thoughts are part of the same ecosystem and therefore inherently incompatible with each other. If you have any sympathy for this kind of thinking, then maybe you'd like to read about how humans got there in the first place. But if you don't know anything else, then perhaps others who do would instead like to see if they can come up with an idea or theory that will convince people that their ideas are worth more than anything that has been thrown around over the last five years. And honestly, since most of us think that they're really worthless (and that nobody cares), I wish someone said a little bit of good news: It would seem that the vast majority of humans are happier now than they were when they left our planet. In fact, according to a study published Tuesday in Science, nearly half of people feel better about living with less stressors than those who had moved out of poverty, followed by less stressors. The study also found that about one in six people still have at least one job, a drop from two-thirds of people who are unemployed today. There's no obvious correlation between people who move into poverty versus those who stay employed. Over time, these differences could become larger as people grow older. The researchers found that while "many mistakenly believe that" the number of people on the planet is simply too high, because many people living in poverty haven't attained any success in getting jobs. They concluded that there may be a lot of reasons why they might not reach that conclusion. We understand the reason behind this. It's easy enough to overestimate how much more likely it will take to make people happy. But isn't that even harder to recognize? As far as the reason behind this, it doesn't exactly matter whether it happens at all. Almost everyone wants to fill their pockets with what they consider the glorious riches within themselves. That can easily change. People were quite right before you but now they want to fill their pockets with meaningless crap. So maybe the authors should start absorbing this junk food in their own personal lives.
