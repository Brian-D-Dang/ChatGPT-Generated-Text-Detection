So, I saw a commercial today about a pill that helps with BED, and I did a bit of quick research on it. From what little research I did, it seems to work by inhibiting the re-uptake or bindinginhibition GABA receptors in your brain.. which is great! I have no interest whatsoever at this point... but if someone has tried taking one (or other similar things) for insomnia before? Did you notice any difference vs placebo effect when trying out new drugs like these ones are usually not covered under insurance because they're considered "off label" use - meaning there's nothing official backing them up as an effective treatment option yet so people can get drug companies' money back from selling more pills per year than healthy sleepers could ever need desire:p
