When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether police are enforcing traffic laws solely to catch and fine motorists who break them is not as important an issue as whether their rules have been applied fairly in the first place." A spokesman for Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter said all drivers would benefit from efforts such as more education around road rules but acknowledged that enforcement alone was not enough. "The only way we can ensure our roads remain safe is if everyone complies with the law," he added.
