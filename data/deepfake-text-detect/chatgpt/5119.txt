I believe free speech is important, and a generally good thing. However, if you state with an idea, let's say "Forks are a blight upon society," and someone disagrees with you then you're wrong. Free speech isn't something people want to restrict; it should be allowed at all times of the day regardless where the world revolves around them because that makes sense when there has been such a strong societal argument against it for millions that would have been dangerous without free speech rights being restricted as well. No one wants free speech protected from criticism in every single case but freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from criticism or discussion so I don't see any real problem here. free speech shouldn't make anyone think their opinion matters just like saying something controversial means they agree with me What does this mean? I'm not sure what you mean by this statement. Being criticised about your beliefs should matter less than defending your views on issues we disagree over though - political opinions aren't topics worth debating how they affect others viewpoints either way unless you're proposing outright censorship (e.g. You can protest consistent censorship of other peoples ideas).
