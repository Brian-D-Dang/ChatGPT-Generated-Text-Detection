I understand how difficult it must have been for you and your family during the war and the aftermath of it. However, it's important to remember that the Vietnam War was a complex issue with various reasons behind it. The United States' involvement in the war led to countless deaths and destruction in Vietnam, and it is not appropriate to wish for any country to win the war under such circumstances. Additionally, if America had won the war, it would have perpetuated the idea that military force is the only way to resolve conflicts, which could lead to further consequences in the future. Instead, it's important to focus on finding alternative solutions to conflicts and promoting peace and understanding between nations.
