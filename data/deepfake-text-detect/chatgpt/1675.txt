One main argument I've seen against the Bernie Sanders "free college tuition" idea is that if everyone has a college degree, the value of a degree goes down. Is this true? This was one of my first thoughts as well but then I thought about it and realized most people don't go to school for their job so maybe no one loses out?? The only thing is you are never going to make your parents happy with having all these degrees lol
