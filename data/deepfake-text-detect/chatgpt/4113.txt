First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea. However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from people who are trying to get their employers or other organizations to pay them off. This doesn't need a "this is sooooo different than the norm" disclaimer but not everyone has every job in the world locked down and benefits covered - especially if they have students that depend on tuition reimbursement etc. If you don't agree - move along however I could see how it could be considered spam
