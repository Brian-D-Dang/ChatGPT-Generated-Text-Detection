I do not support GMO's and do not want to consume them. Many other countries have restricted GMO's because they don't consider them safe alternatives. I personally don't believe that GMOs are unsafe, but this debate is contentious as well as controversial at best! It seems like it is the US who decides what foods should be usedchilled or not. Think of all the food you might eat if someone had your medicine in their pocket. The same could apply to corn. From my research, there are 4 different types of corn: (1) soybeans; 2) cornmeal, 3) soybean flour, etc. There has been no scientific study done on those two materials.
