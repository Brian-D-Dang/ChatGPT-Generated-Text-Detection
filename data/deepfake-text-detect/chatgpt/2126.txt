It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. Self driving cars will not make road travel safer for pedestrians or cyclists. They increase the number of moving objects on the roads, but create no additional capacity nor do they act as traffic regulators to ensure good behavior by drivers (they can't). So I would argue it just makes things worse overall while failing miserably at its primary goal: reducing auto emissions from fossil fuel burning vehicles. And this isn't even considering whether autonomous vehicle companies have any incentive whatsoever to reduce pollution since there's nothing stopping them from prioritizing profits over safety. If we're really going down the route towards fully automated public transit systems with zero carbon footprint then let us focus our efforts more appropriately such as through investment into high-speed rail infrastructure which has been proven time after time again to be both a cheaper alternative to air travel and better environment friendly option between cities via electric trains vs planes.
