Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view I hold. My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any point in the game for yourself if that makes sense. I think I'll take it because this is my first time playing the game. I'm pretty sure I've seen this kind of thing before with the dlc, but haven't played since like the end of 2005 (or maybe even earlier)?
