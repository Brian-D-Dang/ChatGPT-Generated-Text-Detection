This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding. For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force us to pay for a lot of channels that in reality, you don't watch. The only ones who benefit from these sucky subscription deals are the TV providers themselves because they get to keep more money flowing into their pockets instead of yours. With netflix (and now Amazon) there was another level of competition offered by the service itself which cut down on prices considerably. There were no longer any extra fees tacked onto your bill each month when using them. You got what you paid for! They also could offer less content than traditional cable companies if they wanted too since they didn't need to carry live sports events all around the country. We started getting great deal after great deal before Cablevision decided it wasn't worth keeping NetfliX customers anymore so they raised rates dramatically. Then came Netflix's new plan where they charged 10month per account for unlimited streaming. This means even heavy users will be paying over 100month to use this service but still can't stream as much content as they previously did under their old plans. So how does anyone actually justify giving an existing subscriber one thing while adding a third party like Netflix at twice the price? It makes absolutely zero sense, especially when many people do not want to subscribe to two services to save a few dollars every once in awhile. And why should someone subsidize your Netflix addiction with our own tax dollars? I think the biggest problem here comes down to greed on the part of the media industry. Many networks refuse to ever give up complete control over the production process; thus, forcing consumers to hand over large amounts of money in exchange for limited rights to "their" shows. Once again, everything is about driving revenue - nothing else matters. If you've seen some television commercials recently promoting the show being broadcast during Family Guy tonight, that's probably because Fox execs realized last week that the ad-supported ratings would tank without bringing viewers back next weekend. That doesn't mean we shouldn't consume ads...just that sometimes advertisers have to go along with our demands so that we don't cancel our cable package altogether. Other times, though, it seems that producers feel entitled to charge high ticket prices year after year based on minimal viewership and then expect you to fork out MORE money rather than lowering prices or offering better product. No wonder everyone hates Hollywood! Hopefully this trend won't continue forever. The solution isn't going away. People love sitting on couches watching movies - always has, always will. What's changing is technology: it used to cost more to provide access to video entertainment, but now its becoming easier and cheaper to make good quality files available online. Personally, I wouldn't mind paying ten bucks a movie rental either...you know instead of seeing three hundred crappy prints of "Titanic" displayed across town. Even restoring a burnt VHS tape costs a pretty penny nowadays. Several generations ago, storing data on floppy disks lasted until 1990 - today, most of my generation and younger charges dozens upon dozens of credit cards to store and retrieve information digitally on various devices. Our demands for higher resolution video sound haven't gone anywhere either. DVD players improved significantly between 2000 and 2006, sure, but let me tell you its amazing how far HDTV has come within the past decade alone! A 3D Blu Ray player might look nice, but switching on my PS3 right now gives me a full 1080p experience (with surround audio!) while barely consuming an inch of space on my shelf. Hell, maybe the future really IS satsilicon chips crammed inside televisions. Or holographic screens projecting images directly into my eyes. Perhaps someday soon, we wont even bother buying flat screen TVs with built in computers attached after we plug our phones or tablets into them through 'power cords'. When the world becomes virtually obsolete overnight, perhaps we'll forget all about aging file formats and start demanding higher resolutions everywhere. Until then, why stop using technologies developed long before digital became standard practice?! Technology will never cease developing and improving, so dont give up hope yet! I understand that studios will lose money if nobody watches anything otherwise why spend millions making the latest Harry Potter film when audiences seem to tune out halfway through things? But if fewer folks enjoy films made from 1999 to 2009, who cares? The fact remains that piracy statistics indicate people prefer content produced prior to digitization anyway! Look at music download numbers...there's NO WAY people spent 80 billion dollars downloading pirated rips of songs in 2007-2011 other than to prove how much they loved those printed dollar bills. Digital files cant compete with physical products when it comes to value for money, so if we want to truly preserve those masterpieces, we must find ways to encourage their creation AND promote distribution outside of brick and mortar stores and labels alike. In addition, content creators must learn to adapt with new technologies instead of expecting those investment schemes to workmanagers reluctantly accept less noblemen of the real estate company.
