Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than those who aren't. I am not saying that everyone should be allowed to go off track, but it does seem like a little bit unfair to assume that every single person served solely as an object of hatred and hate towards other groups because someone else joined the party or was a member of it too.
