There is no denying that homophobia can stem from deeply entrenched personal beliefs and values, but it is important to recognize that people can and do change. While someone may have held homophobic beliefs in the past, it is unfair to assume that those beliefs still exist without giving the person the opportunity to prove otherwise. It is possible for people to recognize the harm their previous beliefs may have caused and actively work to change their mindset and behaviors. Therefore, assuming that someone who was previously homophobic is still so is not only unfair, but it also undermines their capacity for growth and change. It is important to create a safe space for individuals to learn, unlearn, and grow, regardless of their past beliefs.
