I have recently been told that my pro-life position is "forcing my ideas on others." I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary. If you are going to force me, a person who has never raped anyone in any sense of the word and will probably live out their whole life without ever raping someone else when they do make mistakes into paying for your contraception which was forced on them by another party as well but most likely yourself than what stops this from being extended further? What stops us from making people with certain religions pay for other's abortions because we don't agree with said religion either? Rape victims should be allowed access to safe abortion facilities. Women seeking an abortion must receive counseling regarding options available including adoption assistance (for those whose pregnancies threaten their lives), prenatal care referrals and support services such as case management, childcare, transportation, housingfood subsidies, medical supplies and educational opportunities related to parenting skills. They also need legal representation at no expense whenever possible so that all women may secure fair treatment under our laws,"
