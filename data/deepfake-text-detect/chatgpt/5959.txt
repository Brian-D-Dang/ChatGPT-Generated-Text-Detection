Improv, as an art form, is a medium almost exclusively to be enjoyed live. SNL, while having improvised elements, does not fall in this category because most skits are rehearsed and written to a degree, with the improvisation being a secondary aspect. The improvised music of Dixieland Jazz, however, is a very different animal. The musicians must be capable of improvising on the spot, in real time, as the audience is listening. When the musicians have the right chemistry and are at the top of their game, it can be an absolutely thrilling experience. The Cory Weeds Quintet, with Weeds on tenor saxophone, Brad Turner on trumpet, Geoffrey Keezer on piano, Kyle Bolden on bass, and Dylan Fosse on drums, was a perfect example of this. They each played off of each other as if they were improvising for the first time, but somehow managed to keep it together, and keep it interesting. The crowd was rightfully enamoured. The night started with the title track from Weeds' latest album, Evolution, which is an original composition of his. The group displayed both the power of the horns and the precision of the rhythm section in this song. Weeds also had some great solos, including a bluesy tone on his tenor. The quartet then dipped into the catalogue of Thelonious Monk, playing a few of his more upbeat tunes. This was a fantastic decision because it highlighted the upbeat nature of Monk's music, as well as the incredible chemistry of this group. While all five members were stellar, Weeds was outstanding. His playing was clean and energetic, and he even added some vocalizations to his solo. The group then played a very nice rendition of Duke Ellington's East St. Louis Toodle-oo. I thought that the trumpet playing was particularly great on this one. It wasn't too flashy, but had some great dynamics and highlighted Turner's versatility. Afterwards, the group dipped back into Monk's catalogue, playing Monk's Dream. This song had a more ominous feel, but the group still managed to keep things light, which is what makes this group so special. The group then played the lesser known, but still great, Monk tune, 'Round Midnight. The group really nailed this one, and had the crowd in awe. The highlight of the song was Turner's trumpet solo, which was a masterclass in keeping it simple. After the Monk set, the group dipped back into Weeds' own catalogue, playing the title track from his 2015 album, Beauty the Beast. This song also featured Turner's trumpet, and he nailed it again. Turner's playing is not the only thing he brings to the group, as he is also a very entertaining soloist. The group then dipped back into the Thelonious Monk catalogue, playing Monk's classic, Blue Monk. This one was a fun one, and featured some great bass playing from Keezer, and some great interplay between the horns and piano. The group then dipped into the catalogue of Kenny Garrett, playing his tune, AKA, featuring Keezer on piano. This was another great track, with some nice interplay between the horns and piano. The group then dipped into the catalogue of Wayne Shorter, playing his tune, Speak No Evil. This song featured some great, unison playing by the horns, as well as some nice, upbeat playing by Turner. The group ended the set with a great rendition of Chick Corea's Spain, which was the perfect choice, as it showcased the incredible chemistry of this group. The group took a brief break, as Weeds was joined by pianist and vocalist Michael Kaeshammer, who played on some of the tunes that Weeds and the group were about to play. After Kaeshammer left, the group played some of Weeds' other tunes, including a beautiful version of the standard, What A Difference a Day Makes, featuring a great drum solo by Fosse. The group then played a great rendition of the Monk tune, Blue Monk. The group ended the set with a fantastic rendition of Thelonious Monk's In Walked Bud. This song was a great choice, as it was very upbeat and featured some great solos
