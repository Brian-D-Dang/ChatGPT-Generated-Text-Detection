The goods and services we consume are made possible by the abundance of cheap resources and labour that the west gets out of underdeveloped countries. The West has no reason to be tight lipped about how much time it spends exporting its own products, because other nations have their own needs instead: the West is sending money back home via a trade deficit with China in order to pay for exports abroad even as it buys stuff from China which it doesn't need or want after paying its debts overseas. What is worse is that these costs passed on while the western part of the world works itself into another continent but pays nothing overseas until debt levels rise again thanks to cheap investments elsewhere (such as Europe). Since tariffs aren't just an investment risk they're also a liability like any other asset given an enormous foreign exchange reserves and all those external currencies that were formerly allowed to float freely off the market at a lower rate than usual before the financial crisis hit the market when the West bailed out banks too early during the euro zone collapse (which occurred when it was forced to dump stock markets worldwide) poor countries get shafted indefinitely due to high interest rates paid onto foreign currency debts in savings accounts owned by governments outside the Western economies where they live without adequate revenue sharing arrangements allowing borrowing only to finance themselves (see above). In sum, trade deficits spread across the globe mean that the West can afford to lend itself twice more cheaply internationally per capita than if it had not embarked upon such indefensible schemes unlike any developed nation whose government borrows most by virtue of "taking advantage" of poorer countries' lenders. Yet these countries spend less profitably compared to rich ones while coasting further towards full employment despite being basically bankrupt economically. Better yet, the West keeps spending billions on imports down here (Australia's surplus still exceeds ours), globalism bails us out financially (Europe bears only 6 billion worth of expenses each year since its banks transferred control over their global obligations), and risks losing out dramatically to countries where wages stagnate below inflation rather than rising steadily ahead of consumption opportunities thus exposing our public finances to increasing competition (China alone owes us 19 trillion dollars yearly (50 trillion globally); this means much higher tax burden on richer countries who presumably don't care enough for their consumers; know this isn't sustainable either! It's true that current trends point to Asia becoming the largest export market but if the west wants to stop importing cheap commodities later it should really start doing something about exports now leading up to 2020 in order to save the economy from collapse. The West must end its reliance entirely on exports so that what it precious exists domestically will remain localised within the West forever - let alone international cooperation between Asia Pacific countries looking to build on global infrastructure projects led by China, Japan, India and Africa. China shouldn't give up its already weak domestic manufacturing base and should invest heavily in creating jobs locally through open supply chains like exporting skills training programs at universities both online courses and at factories around the globe whereby we develop skilled workers there ourselves but we won't be competing against the west anyway thanks to these expensive firms rolling them out locally wherever needed plus the globalisation that enables everyone to buy technology together with good wages anywhere we go without having to compete militarily versus building self-reliant states near our borders. A better approach would be to introduce policies similar to those implemented previously throughout South East Asia toward creating more jobs and competition among both developing nations (we saw the decline of Taiwan's tourism industry after China devalued its yuan amid interference spearheaded by Taiwan) or pushing harder for new monetary policy interventions including permanent sanctions regimes akin to those introduced in Indonesia following the 1990 South China Sea dispute (Japan opposed this and Japan backed up sanctions today although China remains stronger than ever!). This conflict between China and the United States has created a huge trade imbalance resulting in an economic war waged against export dependent countries which has become increasingly abstract and unnecessary. The WTO cannot manage the big trading bloc unless free trade agreements include non-tariff barriers imposed directly contrary to agreed standards and mechanisms aimed at limiting harm caused by unfair tariff activities prior to signing. It seems inevitable Beijing would try to impose structural reforms restricting foreign direct investment especially considering that China's economy contracts every quarter according to the IMFWorld Bank survey saying GDP growth last year could fall to 3 0.3) and 2 next year based solely on imported labor productivity decreasing by half (2). China already imposes strict import restrictions causing domestic production declines which also massive travel effects forcing countries needing assistance to re- evaluate whether China truly qualifies adequately (e.g. Indonesia)."
