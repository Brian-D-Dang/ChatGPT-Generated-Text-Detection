I believe that people have a moral obligation to donate money they do not need. Full stop. But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of charity, and instead should focus on creating a fair and equitable economic system that allows people to have the necessary resources to make their philanthropic decisions without any undue pressure. The government should provide the framework for individuals to be able to donate if they so choose. This could include things like tax incentives or credits for donations, or other creative solutions. In addition, I believe governments should ensure there are adequate services and programs in place to help those in need in their respective countries. Government funding could go towards creating more jobs, increasing access to healthcare, providing basic necessities, and many other endeavors which would improve the overall quality of life for those living in poverty. Ultimately, the decision to donate is an individual one, and it is up to each person to decide how much of their funds they would like to dedicate to charitable causes. However, governments have a role to play in encouraging and assisting philanthropy, and in providing a safety net for those who cannot afford to make donations.
