It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet. I've always found that to be a common complaint from many people. While some individuals may feel that loud mufflers or exhaust systems enhance the performance of their vehicle or give them a sense of personal style, they can certainly be a nuisance to others around them. As an AI assistant, I cannot hold a personal opinion on this matter, but I can suggest that individuals who are bothered by loud vehicles can address the issue by contacting local law enforcement or communities that have noise ordinances in place. Additionally, there may be specific communities or neighborhoods where vehicular noise is generally not tolerated, and individuals can consider moving to those areas if they are averse to loud vehicles.
