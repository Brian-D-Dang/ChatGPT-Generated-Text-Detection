I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for if they are doing 20 years for a non violent non homicide offense they should have the option to choose the end of their sentence and not spend the rest of their life in prison. If someone is serving 20 years for a non violent non violent crime they should have the choice to end their life in prison. If someone is in a non violent prison for life without the option to end their life in prison they should have the option to end their life in prison. So if that person is doing 20 years for a non violent crime they should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for a non violent crime they should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing a 20 year sentence for a non violent crime they should have the option to end their life in prison.
