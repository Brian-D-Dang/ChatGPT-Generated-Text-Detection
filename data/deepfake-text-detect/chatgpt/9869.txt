tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting? I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to my favorite teams, I make it a point to watch as many games as I can. The regular season is exciting for me because it's where the storyline of the team begins to unfold. It's thrilling to see how the team adapts and grows over the course of the season, which can ultimately be the deciding factor in whether or not a team makes it to the playoffs. The regular season also allows for plenty of opportunities to witness great individual performances, such as a player hitting a milestone or making an incredible play. And of course, there's always the excitement of the possibility of witnessing history being made. All these reasons combine to create an exhilarating atmosphere that I'm more than happy to experience.
