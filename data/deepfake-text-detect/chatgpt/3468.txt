Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for "sleeping around," and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise or respect. This is a societal double standard and is highly problematic. Both men and women deserve equal respect and praise for their choices and actions, regardless of their gender or sexual activity. It is important to challenge and dismantle these harmful ideas and create a more equitable and just society for all.
