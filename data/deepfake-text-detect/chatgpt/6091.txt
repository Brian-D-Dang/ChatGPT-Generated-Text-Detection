Before anything else, let me say that I am not, nor have ever been depressed, suicidal or abused in any way shape or form. My life so far has been amazing and I could not ask for anything more. I am an extremely happy person who feels like they are meant to do something in this world, something which helps, inspires or creates a difference in the lives of others. I know that this post isn't going to be the most popular post on my blog but, as you can see from the title, it is a post which is extremely important to me. I know that I am lucky to have everything that I do but that doesn't mean that I don't have bad days. I have bad days, maybe not as often as other people but I do have them and this is my outlet. I'm not sure how this is going to come across but I can't stress enough how important it is to be open about mental illnesses. There is still such a stigma attached to it. It is important to say that I am not in any way comparing my own experience to other people's experiences. I'm saying that it is important that we all talk about it and that we all understand that it's not an easy thing to deal with. People can never understand unless they have been through it themselves. People can never understand unless they've been on the other side. I'm not saying that people who haven't been through it aren't sympathetic or try to understand. I know they try. What I'm saying is that unless you've been through it yourself, it is impossible to fully understand. It is something that you can't explain and it is something that you cannot really understand unless you've been through it yourself. I am not someone who has been through something like this but I can say that I have friends who have. I know that it's hard. I know that it can be a real struggle but I'm not saying that it's an easy thing to go through. I'm going to quote a friend of mine who has been through this. She said that it's not something that you can just 'get over'. The best thing I can say is that you just have to get through it. I'm sure that she will be able to explain this a lot better than I can but all I can say is that it's so important to get the help you need. It's so important to talk about it. She said that talking about it, talking to friends and talking to professionals helped her so much. She said that she got through it and that she got back to her normal self. If you have any questions, please ask them and I will try my best to answer them. If you are going through something like this, then know that you are not alone. It's okay to talk about it. It's okay to get help. It's okay to not be okay. I know it's hard to think that you are not alone in this but you are. There is always someone, somewhere who has experienced something like this. What makes me really sad is that sometimes people take their lives without telling someone or without letting them know how they feel. If you are someone who is going through something like this and you want to talk to me or anyone else, please do. I can only tell you that I will always be here. I will listen and I will try to help you in any way that I can. I hope that this post helps someone. I hope that this post helps to raise awareness and to create more understanding. I know that this post isn't going to be popular but I wanted to write it anyway. I wanted to talk about something that is so important and something that means the world to me. I'm going to be completely honest with you, I don't have a clue where I am going with this. I have no idea what I'm going to say but I'm going to try. I'm going to say this now. I'm going to say it now because I want to say it. I don't care if it makes me sound like a total cheeseball, I'm going to say it anyway. I love you all so much. You are all so amazing. I love all of you and I love being able to write this blog and to be able to share my thoughts with all of you. This isn't going to be a 'serious' post today, it's just going to be a post where I say that I love you all. I want to say that I'm so lucky to have you all as readers. I'm so lucky to have all of you.
