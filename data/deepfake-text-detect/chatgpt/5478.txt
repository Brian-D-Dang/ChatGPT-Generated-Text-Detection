While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established players rather boring. Second, at least there's some perfectionist quality to it all. Maybe I'm just being cynical but that would be boring if a guy like Nimmo was paid 10 million for 5 years instead of 8m per year by his agent.
