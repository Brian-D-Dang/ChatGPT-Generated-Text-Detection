Hey, So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about..... this just doesn't make any sense to me. How do these "debris" get up there in the first place? Are they new satellites being launched all the time and never falling back down because of human errorwarp drives etc.? Or is it a case where some spacecraft are so old and worn out (like Voyager 1) that even if you wanted them to come down eventually no one will be able to figure out how to deorbit them properly without hitting other stuff. Or is it more of an unknown thing? Is everyone way off base on their predictions? What does anyone know about this problem?? Thanks for reading my rambling post!
