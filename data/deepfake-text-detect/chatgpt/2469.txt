So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because he targeted one specific opponent with his deck. Here is what happened: In round 6 of the Star City Games open last weekend, Zach and his teammate Brian Kibler were facing off against each other on camera when they both decided to run their burn decks at blue mirror match up (as it turns out these two teams have been doing this for years now). This has never ended well so instead of playing normally they ran some really degenerate combo from their sideboards that made it impossible to win without drawing into an answer or winning through infinite damagedamage reflection loop which means nothing ever actually finishes! Anyway after about 20 minutes of this nonsense happening over and over again, someone finally got fed-up enough by all of this shenanigans to call a judge who ruled them as having broken several rules including game loss since neither team had won yet due to "intentionally stalling." No prizes awarded for either party involved since everyone gets free entry anyway... As far as we know though none of the players received any kind of penalty aside from being DQ'd from the tournament even if judges didn't technically rule anything illegal per sey. So basically ZJ's career just went right down the toilet because the guy couldn't control himself like every normal person would do under similar circumstances; ie don't go crazy and start breaking the rules yourself.. Forgive me while i rant here but holy shit has Magic gone full retard lately? Forgetting about the fact that there are people dying everyday fighting real wars around the globe only to come home and get treated like criminals just for trying to enjoy themselves with friends makes my blood boil quite frankly. If you want your children to grow up thinking violence solves everything then fine let's ban video games too cause clearly those things make kids violent. You can keep banning harmless cards forever until college students graduate without even realizing its detrimental effects or you could take your heads out of your asses and realize that banning whatever isn't going to magically stop adults from acting childish online anyways!! To me magic should be fun first foremost else why bother paying 70 dollars shipping costs to play? Do i think running same old boring netdecks 24x7 365 days a year will suddenly improve anyone's life quality no fucking way! But maybe someday Wizards might figure all our problems out along with making more money than EA did during SimCity server meltdown incident:D Jokes apart i am deeply saddened by this whole situation cuz what exactly does WotC stand for anymore? What direction are the company leaders taking us towards?? The future looks very grim indeed...
