Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: to anon979 for a thoughtful, well-reasoned argument in support of my position. This is not really about being right or wrong but rather trying to understand each other's positions; that makes all the difference when discussing contentious issues such as these. We may never agree on everything here (and probably won't), but we should at least be able to respect one another enough to have good discussions over them. Thanks again!
