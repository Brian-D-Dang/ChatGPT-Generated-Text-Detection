For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due to the fact that my parents are getting divorced (which may have influenced the timing). I guess I'm just looking for a little advice on how to best handle this situation. I've always considered myself a bit conservative when it comes to sexual issues. I've always thought of myself as a "player," but I've never had the balls to actually do anything about it. In the past, I've had some intense sexual feelings for girls I've gone to school with, but have never had the guts to act on them. There have been times where I've had sex with girls I didn't really know, just because I was bored and horny. This behavior has always been a little unsettling to me, because I always feel a bit ashamed about the situation afterward. Ever since I can remember, my mom has always had a boyfriend or two. I've always found this behavior to be unsettling and immoral, but I've never had the guts to bring it up. The thought of sex with other people in a marriage has always been a little unsettling to me. I've always wanted to stay true to my marriage vows, but I've always had a nagging feeling that I was being hypocritical. Last summer, I came home for a visit and my mom had this really hot girlfriend staying in the house. She was always around me, and was always wearing little shorts and T-shirts. There was definitely sexual tension between us, but I didn't have the balls to do anything about it. We're pretty good friends, and I've always had a feeling that we could have a lot of fun together, but I've never had the balls to pursue it. One time I went to my mom's house and this girl was there. She came into the bathroom while I was showering. She had seen me naked before, but this was the first time she had ever seen me naked. I guess I was distracted, and I didn't realize it until I was done. I didn't notice it at first, but I couldn't stop thinking about it for the next few days. Ever since I was a teenager, I've always been attracted to older women. I've always thought it would be really cool to have an affair with a 30 year-old woman. I've never had the balls to do anything about it. I've always been afraid of becoming a complete hypocrite. I've always wanted to stay true to my marriage vows, but I've always had a nagging feeling that I was being hypocritical. My problem is that I feel like I'm making a lot of progress in my life, but I still have a lot of issues to work through. I want to get married and have a family, but I'm still afraid of the sexual aspect of marriage. I still have a lot of sexual issues to work through. I guess I'm just looking for some advice on how to best handle my current situation. Any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. I'll start with this. You're 18 years old. You're a young man in the prime of your life. You're probably going to be in college in a few months. You're probably going to have a lot of friends. Maybe you'll meet someone and fall in love and get married. Maybe you won't. Maybe you'll meet someone who will turn your world upside down and make you want to be with them every moment of every day. Maybe you won't. Maybe you'll meet someone and be in a relationship for a while and then break up. Maybe you'll go through a series of relationships and breakups. Maybe you'll be single for a while. Maybe you'll be in a relationship for a while and then break up. Maybe you'll go through a series of relationships and breakups. Maybe you'll be single for a long time. The bottom line is that you're only going to be 18 for so long. And then you'll be 19. And then you'll be 20. And then you'll be 21. And then you'll be 22. And then you'll be 23. And then you'll be 24. And then you'll be 25. And then you'll be 26. And then you
