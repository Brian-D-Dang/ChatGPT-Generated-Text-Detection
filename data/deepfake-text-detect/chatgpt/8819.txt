NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization. Both of them should be abolished, though gradually. I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, though with reasonable mechanisms to enforce the restrictions, but not yet so as to prevent landlords from making unreasonable demands on tenants who are lawfully living in those units. The other option is to make the city's Rent Control Act "prohibitively" construction in neighborhood or apartment buildings (see Current Law). The ordinance imposes a limit of 1,000 per month on property owners, who are fully responsible for constructing new housing projects. A similar statute applies in public buildings such as private homes, schools, parks, warehouses, metro stations, etc., where this type of restriction can impede seniority. These requirements have been passed by City Council during the past several years; one of these was voted down last year as part of an amendment requiring approval from the Council.
