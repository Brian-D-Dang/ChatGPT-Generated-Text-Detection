I'm a lifelong veggie, and I've been vegan for a while in the past although I'm not anymore. I don't believe you can make a rock solid case for being healthy from eating only plants because most of them require so much energy to produce (corn) or are loaded with unhealthy chemicals that our bodies need protection against like pesticides (spinach). It turns out humans have an innate ability called "herd immunity." This is when everyone has some level resistance no matter what their vaccination status might be due simply by living among other people who also live amongst us without getting vaccinated themselves - this includes children as well! When we're together there's always enough antibodies around circulating within all those different peoples' bloodstreams which effectively neutralizes anything harmful before it gets into your system at least long-term if they haven't had any exposure already through travel etc where maybe less herd effect occurs but still happens.. If someone contacts measles virus say... The body will try its best whereas fighting off viruses such these onslaughts even though many vaccines aren'nt 100 effective,they do help reduce risk considerably however..its very true i hate how uneducated society thinks just "go ahead" eat everything meat cause u won heart disease anyway,,yeah right "beefcake culture,"no thanks.,i could go onto rant forever about my opinions regarding mass media brainwashing one would think was intentional except prove me wrong and comin back o vegetarianism veganim again: yes vegans actually get nutrients directly form food instead vitamin supplements since plant based diets contain plenty vitamins naturally. Plant sources high fiber source too helps combat constipation; low fat diet besides having more protein available than animal products does;which makes sense considering vegetarians tend consume healthier overall meals including fresh fruit vegetable intake vs consuming lots processed foods full sugar stuff junk snacks often filled w fructose sugars'vs real whole natural fruits vegetables.;also 1 study found higher bone density results over 10 yrs old participants ate lower amounts simple carbohydrates compared heavier consumption raw calorie dense complex carbs per day.less osteoporosis chanceanother reason why diabetics should consider avoiding excess carbohydrate containing refined starchy white bread made bakeries especially versus nutrient rich brown rice flakes:brown doesn " t mean inferiorit means nutritionally wise superiorespecially re grains....vivamore mama says"well good luck!!"
