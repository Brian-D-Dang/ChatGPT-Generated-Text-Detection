I was only able to find one other thread about this topic, and it was kind of a train wreck. Common arguments: "It's not Jraphics Interchange Format" by that logic, I could use a different file extension on all my images and it'd be fine. "It's a lossy format" by that logic, I could use a lossy format like PNG and it'd be fine. "It's not vector" by that logic, I could use raster formats and it'd be fine. I'm not really going to give you a solution, because there's none that I'm aware of. I'd love to see one, though. So, what are your favorite image formats? PNG and SVG. Easy enough to edit with any program and it's a great format. GIF is very simple, I like it. PNGs are just great! I use them for everything. It depends on the type of image. If it's a simple graphic, I'd use PNG or JPEG. If it's an animation I'd use GIF or MNG. If it's a logo, I'd use SVG. My only problems with PNG are that it can't be animated, and it's uncompressed, which takes a lot of space. Also, why is it considered a "lossy" format? I guess the PNG is still lacking some features that GIF has, but I still prefer it. I do most of my graphic work in Photoshop, and then save as PNGs. For vector graphics I use Inkscape. I like to use SVGs for text, but I don't like using them for pictures. PNGs are my favorite format, because they're easy to make and edit. And they're uncompressed so they don't take up as much space. I hate GIFs because they're so slow, and they're not even very good quality. I also prefer PNGs and JPGs. SVGs are nice, but hard to edit. GIFs I also do not like to use. I don't really like the formats that I've heard of. Maybe I'll try out those I haven't tried before. I prefer SVGs, and I like GIFs for simple animations, but I would like to try PNGs too. I also like .gif because it's easy to make and a great animation format. I really don't like JPEG, because it takes so much space, but I suppose it's fine if you're not going to be viewing it at a large size. I think .png is a great format. I think I'll use .png. I like PNG for simple graphics and .gif for animation. I use PNGs in photoshop. I use .png because they are easy to make and I like their compression. I prefer using SVG, GIF, and PNG.

I use PNGs in Photoshop, they are good. PNGs are easy to work with. I like the PNGs because they are easy to make and edit. I think the JPEG is good, but too big.
