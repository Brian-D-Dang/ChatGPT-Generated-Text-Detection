There's been so much uproar over Sweden and the Netherlands and other countries that have been dealing with immigration issues. I would like to move to another country in the European Union, if possible. But at this point, it doesn't look very optimistic because of Brexit. As a group, we work really hard on how we can still maintain our rights as employees when jobs are being outsourced from Europe or transferred out of Europe; maybe even more things than before. And yet we see countries such as England leaving the EU making decisions which will hurt us all by taking away our right for freedom of movement within the 28 member states. You know what the big problem is? It makes no sense whatsoever. How do you start talking about free trade agreements but then act against your own citizens' interests who need access to each other's markets? If you want to make sure people join the labor market, particularly young people, you should be opening up borders rather than closing them down. Right now not only does Brexit take away my passporting rights, it takes away my ability to go abroad and find work there - which means moving home could become an option again. This is not good for me personally. The UK government thinks they're helping a lot of people, pushing us to become entrepreneurs and builders. Look around! Just look at companies trying to figure out whether they might lose their existing contracts after Brexit. They've had enough time already. We're exhausted and terrified: People are losing jobs right now. Companies are cutting back hours. What else isn't working properly anymore? Are these politicians thinking through everything properly? Or just using rhetoric to get votes? Because I don't care one iota about politics any longer. All I'm worried about is getting food on the table. I think the general public has lost faith in democracy recently. Is it worth living here under this current regime? Definitely not.
