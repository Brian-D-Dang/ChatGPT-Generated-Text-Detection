It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be used to bring attention and education about the wild. I appreciate this as I know it's really hard for kids (and adults) today in a period of rapid animal extinction to care deeply enough when there are so many more pressing issues going on around us all at any given time; having locations which allow people access close-to-home helps them feel connected with what might otherwise seem like an abstract problem. That said though, the argument here isn't over whether or not these places should exist anymore than it would have been had Monet gotten his ass back inside before he started painting the water lilies...it'll always be necessary because we need to learn from where they came from, even if some things suck trying to live up to their origins. So long story short? You're gonna get another lecture soon recapping what happened!
