WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in my life are minorities (non-Hispanic blackLatino) and they've been through alot, some have not made it out alive...and most of them can't even bear to discuss racism anymore because its just too painful for many reasons. So yeah, this is probably going to be a long read but I hope you stick with me all the way! Those few Black men who I know personally, defended me when my mom began abusing her Hellenic boyfriend. They were always there whenever she needed help or protection during those years. The ones that jumped on their respective bandwagon seemed like good guys at first, until one day things started dying down and then they became quite shady about every subject whatsoever. And once again, I'm left wondering why these guys don't want to talk about race issues as well? Why do they never seem interested enough in discussing anything related to racial injustice??? Seriously....why?? I guess back on track now......The following story comes from our very own Ricketts family tree.....my uncle, John, was a young boy growing up, he eventually ended up marrying his sweetheart (now wife), who grew up being a full fledge Greek, her name was Maria (she went by Mea). She had 2 sons, ages 9 11 at the time their father passed away after an accident which involved him falling off a roof while working on the construction crew. Sadly, both kids lost their dad completely unexpectedly only 4 months apart. However, despite everything that happened, no one ever questioned any sort of discrimination against My Uncle since he wasn't white. He did however get blamed though before we found out what really caused the incident (which still remains unknown till today.) Well anyways, fast forward to present day where my cousin, who's into Hellenistic culture, decided to go ahead and get married in Greece to a non-Greek guy whom happens to be mixed Caucasian Filipino. His mother approved the wedding, so thats how it goes right? We thought nothing more would happen than maybe someone from her side might ask her son if anyone of his friends has complained about certain actions taken in regards towards My Cousin, including physical threats given to him in front of other guests. But regardless, everyone knew she'd already done her research beforehand especially considering My Cousin isn't the vocal type. Well needless to say, ONE person asked him amongst ALL THE PEOPLE IN THAT COUPLE..where is your "white" friend...who's the better American? As soon as this man said in response to this question "Yes, My Mother is," that was the last straw. Thats when shit hit the fan.......His whole entire extended family stood around him staring daggers at him saying "We will NEVER speak to YOU EVER AGAIN!!!" Needless to say, he broke down crying uncontrollably, shaking like crazy and told us he wanted to leave Greece forever. Now obviously no one believed such claims, unless you believe in fairy tales, but hearing something along those lines hurts nonetheless. It took along time before my brother finally convinced My Sister to move in with MY Grandparents.....My Grandmother, Grandfather, Auntie and Uncles insisted that My Brother should stay there instead. Over the course of several heated arguments, My Father stepped between (unfortunately again,) and tried convincing My Grandmother that My Brother deserved to live with them since he was trying so hard to prove himself worthy of living here for another couple decades anyway.........since apparently he 'wasn't exactly perfect' either........he could hardly express himself properly due to English being his second language, yet somehow figured out how to drive a car.
