I'm going to clarify that by'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tagdisclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg . PTSD, panic attacks) in certain people at any given time. This is not intended for anything remotely approaching 'censorship'. The trigger warning isn't about "what could upset you." It's there because if someone has issues with triggers they can avoid reading something like this and potentially start crying or having flashbacks based on it despite knowing what happens. The reason most use them are when discussing things which may have happened late last year as well since those sorts of events tend to come up due to their nature while triggering events occur more frequently than others so get used less often
