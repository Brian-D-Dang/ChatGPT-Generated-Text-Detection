GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE. Reasons being: 1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job and I don't pay bills. So if I did have to give up that money I'd be homeless in a week and my family would be pissed at me for being homeless. 2. I like my friends, I don't want to have to give them up just because of some stupid stupid rule. 3. I have a GREAT boyfriend and I wouldn't want to give him up just because of this stupid rule. 4. I'd like to see him, too. 5. I have plans for my life, and this rule is completely against my plans. 6. That last point kinda rhymed, and I know I'm awesome. But anyways, I'm sorry I'm ranting but I really am not a fan of this rule and I would really like to know what you think of it. I'm looking forward to reading your comments!
