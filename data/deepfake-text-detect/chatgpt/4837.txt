People seem to feel right now that Sanders is just not well-known enough to even have a chance at the presidency, and that it will stay that way. Everyone has their own theory of why this is so - the media bias against him; the fact he's been in Congress for 16 years, which makes his record look bad compared with someone like Hillary Clinton who was elected senator only four years ago; his lack of charisma or ability as a politician (and I think that can be overstated). But maybe what really matters more than any single reason is how many people are actually aware that Bernie Sanders exists outside of New York City? Is there anyone out there who doesn't know about him? According to an informal poll that we did last week, the answer appears to be no: according to Facebook usage patterns, most Americans do indeed know who Bernie Sanders is. The majority of respondents fall into one of three categories: People who use Facebook but aren't familiar with Bernie Sanders; Some degree of familiarity with Bernie Sanders beyond being able to say "I don't know who that... man is"; And those who had heard about him before, either because they were on Twitter during the primary campaign last year or through other sources. (By the way, if you're wondering where the data comes from, the numbers come directly from our Kagan Campaign dashboard.)

States whose residents tend to be younger have less awareness among them than states whose population tends to be older, presumably due to them having grown up watching TV news shows without seeing much politics coverage. However, online advertising still dominates the landscape - almost 90 of respondents said they saw ads related to Bernie Sanders' presidential bid prior to voting day. (There may be some indication that younger voters are more likely to turn off TV when going away for collegegraduate school, increasing exposure to internet content.)
