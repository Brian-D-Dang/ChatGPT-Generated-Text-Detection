A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but the show my friends put together was phenomenal. They had a four story building with a rooftop deck that faced downtown Atlanta. The entire roof was covered in an elaborate display built from scratch (with some funds borrowed from relatives), including red white blue lights outlining all angles and appropriate patriotic tunes playing over speakers throughout for about 30-45 minutes before it launched. There are no words to describe how cool this sight is when you first see it - truly something memorable That's awesome! You should have gone up there yourself with your own fireworks:)
