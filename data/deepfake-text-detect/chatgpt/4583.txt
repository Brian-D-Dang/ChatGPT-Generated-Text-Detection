Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same. His views on immigration would not only alienate Latinos and African-Americans, they'd also drive off many of the white liberals whose support he needs to win in November. He has no actual plan for how to deal with illegal aliens or even what to do when Mexico stops sending them back. And that sort of thing could turn out badly, especially in light of the fact that the Mexican government just legalized marijuana use there last month. On top of which, we're almost certainly headed into another recession right before next year's elections. So why bother? That said...he does have one very good idea about getting the rust belt fired up again: The Wall! In case you've been living under a rock lately, here are some key points from official sources: "A border wall paid for by U.S. taxpayers will stop large scale entry of drugs including methamphetamines. Construction begins immediately." (White House Press release) "The construction must be built where it poses minimal disruption to ongoing efforts at our landair ports of entries; i.e., pedestrian fencing may suffice at small ports along those borders." (Presidential memorandum issued August 2017) "Mexico's drug cartels continue their reckless slaughter of innocent people across America..." "We need a strong barrier because I don't want to wait 10 years like President Bush did on building this fence," says Donald J. Trump. "I'm going to build a wall today. We can begin immediate work on Phase One of my long promised Great Border Wall TODAY!" "Our country cannot afford to keep acting as if nothing bad happens in the world beyond our shores. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best....they're bringing crime. They're rapists. " "Drug dealers and gang members pour through our southern border. As president, I'll finally secure our border and take brand new steps so we never forget that safety comes first. Over 1 million illegals try every single day to enter our country illegally. If someone doesn't think that's an invasion, then tell me what else it is. (CNN interview remarks made during presidential campaign.)

I got tired after awhile, though, so hopefully I didn't miss anything crucial.-Tony Davies, Mailing Address Tony Davies AT . com 1 fan of Donald Trump. Sunday, April 29, 2014 New York Times columnist Frank Bruni recently wrote a column entitled "Trump Is Right About Race - Way Wrong." In essence, he told us that Donald Trump was wrong about race relations being better now than 40 years ago. Presumably, Mr. Bruni meant that although things are still far from perfect between blacks and whites, there are fewer murders each year involving black victims. Of course, there hasn't been anywhere near enough coverage of the recent riots over Michael Brown and Eric Garner plus the shooting death of Laquan McDonald. Maybe he means that racial tensions haven't exploded yet in Chicago either. Or maybe I missed something in his article. What's clear is that Mr. Bruni isn't exactly enlightening us anymore. Instead, he seems determined to make everything sound racist while taking great pains to point out how much closer racial harmony actually is these days. Here are two examples: Another recent example occurred in St. Paul, Minn., during the state's Republican convention, where delegates chanted 'Build That Wall!' and booed speakers who offered civil rights histories without mentioning slavery or segregation. And later: At a rally Friday night in Michigan, supporters cheered him as saying they wanted walls and waterboarding, which had once defined torture. Afterward, [Michigan governor Rick] Snyder said that when Trump called him earlier in the week, " it kind of put it in perspective, " adding, " [T]here are ways that diplomacy works better when you recognize different perspectives sometimes.' Like most journalists, Mr. Bruni tries to appear fair and balanced to viewers. Yet he takes care to give equal time to both sides when arguing his various positions. This results in odd contradictions like the following: If only, Mr..Bruni writes, Republicans hadn't become racists since 1980. Then I guess we could blame Carter and Obama for the resulting mess instead of Reagan, Nixon and George H.W. Bush. Or perhaps blaming Clinton should get credit as well. Ahhh yes, let's blame Hillary Clinton for the 2008 financial crisis, among innumerable other disasters. Except that she wasn't really responsible for any of it. She simply followed orders. Which is precisely why Ronald Regan had her removed from office. Democrats aren't nearly as malleable as Mr. Bruni holds them out to be.
