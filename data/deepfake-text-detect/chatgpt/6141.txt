First lets make a couple of things clear: I do not necessarily believe that government spying on its own citizens is ok, and thats not what this post is about. I also do not believe that Snowden is a hero, or that he should be seen as a whistle blower. It is clear that the NSA has been collecting large amounts of data on the phone calls and email messages of US citizens, without any warrant. This is a violation of the fourth amendment, and should be seen as such. I would be shocked if Snowden was not in possession of a lot of information regarding the extent and purpose of the surveillance, and given that this is not an area that I feel knowledgeable about, I would like to hear more from him regarding how he obtained the information, and why he decided to release it. I also don't believe that he has done this for purely selfish reasons. He has also stated that he does not intend to reveal any more information. My primary issue is not with the surveillance program itself, but the way the NSA has chosen to justify it. They have claimed that the program is necessary to protect us from terrorism. That is simply untrue. If they really had that information, the terrorists would have used it. The whole program is an exercise in profiling, and has nothing to do with protecting us from terrorism. The NSA has also claimed that the program is legal. In fact, they have stated that they are not required to get a warrant before collecting this data. They have also stated that they don't even need to ask the FISA court for approval to collect data. That is simply untrue. Section 215 of the Patriot Act was passed with the specific intention of requiring the FISA court to approve any collection of data (or any surveillance) based on the phone records of US citizens. The NSA has claimed that they were not collecting data based on the phone records of US citizens, which is also untrue. Now, before any of you NSA apologists tell me to mind my own business, I would like to point out that the government is not gathering any information on me. They don't know anything about me. They have no idea what I do, where I go, who I talk to, or anything else about me. They have no right to know that information. I would also like to point out that the NSA is not gathering any information on you either, because they have no interest in you, and because there is nothing they can do with that information. They don't have the resources to read it. If you want to be paranoid, just remember that they are spending millions of dollars to gather information on everyone in the US, so they probably have no interest in you anyway. My intention here is not to point out who is right and who is wrong regarding the surveillance program. It is also not to defend Snowden. My intention is simply to point out that the government is lying. The NSA has lied to the American people about the extent of their program, and they have lied to us about the legality of it. I will say this. If the NSA were to get rid of this program, I would have no problem with that. If the program were to be used as a tool to track down terrorists, I would have no problem with that either. But if they can't be honest with us about it, I have a major problem with it. If you're going to violate our rights, at least be honest about it. The NSA's response to this has been to try to dismiss Snowden, and make him out to be a traitor. They have also made some claims that they are not violating any of our rights, and that they are not violating the fourth amendment. Well, they are. They have violated the fourth amendment, and they are violating it right now. And they are doing it knowingly, and with malice. The American people have a right to know what the government is doing. The government has a responsibility to tell us the truth. And the government has a responsibility to protect our rights. They are not doing any of those things. I don't know what Snowden did to gain access to this information, and I have no idea what he is trying to accomplish with it. I don't know if it was a crime to release the information, or if he should be prosecuted. But I do know that we have a right to know the extent of the spying, and the NSA is not telling us the truth. That is a violation of our rights, and it is wrong. Update: The NSA has released a statement regarding this issue, and I
