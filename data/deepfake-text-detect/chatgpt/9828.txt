People should be able to do it safely and without fear of persecution or exploitation. People in the industry should have access to basic labor rights, including the right to collective bargaining and appropriate working conditions. Furthermore, decriminalization could help reduce the stigma attached to sex work and make it easier for those who choose to engage in it to access social services and resources.
