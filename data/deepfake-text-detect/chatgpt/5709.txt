Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as of late, this belief has been proven wrong. It's like the saying, 'don't put all your eggs in one basket.' It's good to have a 'Plan B.' Even if 'Plan B' sucks. Another thing that's good about being able to speak other languages is that you can see other cultures. And in this way, you can gain a good sense of what's out there. Well, you know the quote: "Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer." Hope this helped!:P Hi I'm a beginner in German. I was wondering, do you know about any easy ways to remember the hard ones. Yes, I know a lot of people, especially Americans, don't like having to learn a second language. But I personally think it's a great way to get to know different cultures. I've lived in Europe, and I've been to places like France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and more. And I've noticed that people from different countries have different ideas, different manners, different views on life. And I've noticed that the more I learned other languages, the more I began to understand the culture and history of other nations. My German teacher was a Hungarian woman named Miss Bartos. She was the nicest woman you'll ever meet. She told us stories about her family and her life, and showed us pictures of all of her family members. She even invited us to her house for lunch one time. And I was amazed by how much German food she knew how to make. She'd even make German apple pie and apple strudel. She taught us a lot about German culture, and I learned a lot from her. I learned more from her than from any other teacher I ever had. If only my other teachers could have been like her. I don't really have any tips, but I think the best way to learn a language is just to practice it. I took German in school for 2 years. And the only reason I really learned anything was because I had a classmate who was from Germany. We would talk every day at school. And sometimes she'd even call me on the phone to talk. I never would have learned as much German if it weren't for her. Her name was Irene. And she really taught me a lot. She taught me about German customs, about German food, about German holidays, and so on. So I guess you're right. The best way to learn a language is to meet someone from that country. And I believe that you'll learn a lot faster if you learn from someone who speaks the language well. I'm not sure if you know this, but I'm 15 years old. I've taken Spanish and German for 2 years in school. My German teacher was the nicest teacher I ever had. She's from Hungary. Anyway, I'd like to get a job at a company in Hungary that sells baby products. I want to learn as much Hungarian as I can so I can understand what's going on at the company. I'm just not sure how to do this. I know that the best way to learn a language is to meet someone from that country. And this is the case with Hungary. I just don't know how to find someone in Hungary to meet. Any ideas on how to do this? Thanks, and keep up the great work!:D You have asked a very interesting question. I personally know a lot of people who say that English is a hard language. But I think it's hard only because it's so unnatural. I mean, I don't know about you, but I find languages that are similar to English easier to learn than English. For example, Spanish. I studied Spanish for two years in school. And it was easy to learn. I think learning Spanish is easier than learning English. And even though I don't speak Spanish well, I can usually understand Spanish. But I can't understand English. So I find English to be harder. But this isn't because English is a hard language, but because English is unnatural. It's a language that was created by people to communicate. I believe that a language that was created by nature to communicate is easier to learn
