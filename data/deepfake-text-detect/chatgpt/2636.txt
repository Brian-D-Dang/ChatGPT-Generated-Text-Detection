Hello CMV, I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from local leagues) and then just recently picked up competitive swimming again after almost 10 years off of it. Is there any benefit for you kids or are they just going through the motions? I think that parents should be grateful if their kid is willing to play sports at all - especially ones which require such dedication to learn and practice... it's a sign that they're healthy enough to do so! As far as benefits go: The physical fitness alone will pay dividends in terms of better health later on. Aside form that though...it teaches discipline, teamwork, competition, how to work with others towards one goal winning can mean coming together over something bad like losing a game rather than fighting each other etc. There are many ways to apply those lessons and life skills even outside of the sport itself.
