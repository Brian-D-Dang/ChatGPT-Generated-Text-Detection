If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be replaced and as income rises, people can afford more health care services and higher education costs that they may not have had access to previously. However, if we continue to see extremely low unemployment (due to lack of innovation), then it is possible for this trend to flip around and become a burden on our society's efforts to provide opportunities for others. If this happens, there would likely need to be significant changes made by social securitywelfare programs, such as free college tuition and universal healthcare. The cost associated with these projects might prove too much for the government to sustain today while some other issues also remain unresolved.
