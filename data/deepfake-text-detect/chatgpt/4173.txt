First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean I don't think it's a little weird when someone is walking up to me while wearing nothing more than their underwear (and I imagine there are people out there who would be creeped out by this as well). I actually wouldn't mind if they outlawed all public decency laws What about the whole deal where people wear white clothes?
