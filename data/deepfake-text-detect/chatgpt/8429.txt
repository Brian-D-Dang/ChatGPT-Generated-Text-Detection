I'm Korean-American and I have family in Korea. I disagree with many of those I encounter who usually tend to also be of Korean descent when I don't get all the accolades they do because my parents are actually white, so we're not "pure" Koreans from birth (despite having a very unique mixture). The soap opera is pretty much accurate about some things but there's just stuff that doesn't make sense or could've been done differently for dramatic effect other than it being based on real eventspeople...but sometimes certain details were exaggerated like what happened between Jung Ryeo Won Lee Young Ae was changed slightly except their names..cause apparently most people here thought she cheated at first cause he tripped her by accident while trying protectively guarding his girlfriend against fans after an interview where someone asked if one would ever cheat outta jealousy!? It made no logical since especially given how close everyone worked together as actors back then off camera during filming....and why wouldn'it happen now?! Just curious though lol
