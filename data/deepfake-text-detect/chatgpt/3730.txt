Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of debate and disagreement among scholars regarding the historicity of Jesus. Some argue that he was a real person, while others argue that he may have been a mythical figure. It is important to understand that historical analysis and interpretation is often subjective and can vary depending on the scholar's perspective and the evidence they are using to support their arguments. It is up to individuals to evaluate the evidence and arguments presented and come to their own conclusions.
