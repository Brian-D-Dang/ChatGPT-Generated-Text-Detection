I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is far superior to a bidet in every way except one - it doesn't get you clean like a good old-fashioned cloth towel does! Wait.. are we talking about wiping our butts or your face?
