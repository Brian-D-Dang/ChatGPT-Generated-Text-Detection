So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training but still it doesn't seem like enough. Can someone explain to me why volunteer fire departments are so much more effective than full-time paid firefighters? In the case of small towns, you may be right. But in larger cities and suburbs (especially those with strict zoning laws), there's usually not many volunteers who would put out a wildfire because they don't have time for it or because they're too busy working their 9-5 jobs.
