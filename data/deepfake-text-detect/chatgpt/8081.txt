Most social progressives, love democracy, and so it is of relatively little surprise to me that as they have achieved a majority (in Reddit and the West), that they want ordinary people on their side. "Stable" here means relative - in absolute numbers many more are now democratists than not; but just think what percentage would shift if another election came along!
