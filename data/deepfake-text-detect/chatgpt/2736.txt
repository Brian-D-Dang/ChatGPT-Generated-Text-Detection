Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same. His views on immigration would not only alienate many of America's most respected institutions and thinkers - they are also flat out inaccurate." Miguel Fornes The Cut "President Donald J. Trump's executive order barring refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim countries has been denounced by critics as xenophobic, isolationist, racist, discriminatory against Muslims, unconstitutional, un-American, shameful, pathetic, cruel, heartless, outrageous, horrifying, and many other things that should be said about it because those things are true."
