When I see debate about'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about'evidence'. If they shift on these subjects it's only because the evidence changes. Or rather that what counts as 'the best available science', which is how we should collectively evaluate controversial claims in a democracy really doesn't matter all too much when there are so many more pressing priorities - such events and concerns can be recognized for their own merit without being validated by any formal processes of inquiry into truth-claims per se" The extent you want this enforced though will depend upon specific institutional settings... if someone wants some important decision made according with your criteria then those who seek an alternative outcome have two choices: convince them not via rational means but instead through political ones; take over said institution yourself using force after convincing enough others within its wallsmemberships etc., thus either enforcing adherence based purely from internal threats towards dissenters OR refraining altogether due lack thereof resulting simply instinctually passing decisions along unquestioned?
