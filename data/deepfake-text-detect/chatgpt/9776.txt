Human sentience (or consciousness, or sapience, or whatever term you like) is an emergent behavior of neurons and their interactions, which can be replicated in non-organic systems, i.e., computers. Thus , it is not something that can be definitively defined or measured but rather something that can be inferred by observing the behavior of a system. A number of tests have been developed to determine whether a computer system exhibits some aspects of sentience. For example, the Turing Test (developed by Alan Turing) is a method of determining whether a machine exhibits human-level intelligence in natural language conversations. Other tests, such as the CAPTCHA challengeresponse test, evaluate a computer system's ability to distinguish between humans and machines. In addition, researchers have developed various models of artificial neural networks that attempt to replicate the emergent behavior of neurons in the human brain. These models can then be evaluated with respect to their ability to exhibit certain aspects of sentience. Ultimately, however, sentience remains a subjective concept, and cannot be definitively proven one way or another for any particular system.
