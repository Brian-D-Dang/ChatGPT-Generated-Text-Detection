The expense of a higher education has been a hot button issue for a number of years but the fact that students take on huge loans and graduate with huge debt is not an anomaly. The problem begins much earlier than university - college, high school or even elementary school. Student loan rates have risen steadily since 2009-2010 when they were at about 6 to 8. In 2015, 2013 student loan rates decreased from 5.04-5.08. Student loan rates are still low compared to other types of debt such as mortgages (3), vehicle financing (4) etc... However in light of rising tuition costs many parents want their children to be educated without incurring massive debts so this can pose challenges when it comes time to secure funding for postsecondary education. In Canada there exists private lenders who offer funds when traditional institutions do not provide the desired amount. These alternative options require careful consideration before you apply because some may charge very steep interest rates based off your credit score and income level while others have strict application requirements that will deter certain applicants. As important as choosing where to study is taking full advantage of the opportunities available during your studies especially if you plan on attending a major research institution. Research universities often fund research initiatives which include fellowships and scholarships beyond those defined by the federal government. Some faculties also receive large endowments creating financial aid packages specific to each department within these schools. If your interests lie in research then it's imperative to find out what resources exist through your faculty to help finance your studies. There is no better way to learn more about all the different sources of support you stand to gain than talking directly with someone from the relevant office.
