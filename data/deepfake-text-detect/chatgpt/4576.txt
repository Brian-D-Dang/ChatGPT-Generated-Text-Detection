I love to eat Asiatic food but I could never really use the chopsticks thinking "Wow, that is much better than usual cutlery." Using chopsticks is at best a cultural thing. But this time I tried eating with my hands and surprisingly it worked out very well - I like how you can eat faster when using your fingers because of being more aware of what's going on in front of you. It also allows me to hold onto my food longer so there is no need for wiping stuff off all over the place after each bite...
