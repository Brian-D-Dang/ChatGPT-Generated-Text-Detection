Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a rocs game, and I'll bet you've read some of the other articles about it. I don't know how to even begin to describe it. I do think that the more a person talks about it, the more they will make sense of it.
