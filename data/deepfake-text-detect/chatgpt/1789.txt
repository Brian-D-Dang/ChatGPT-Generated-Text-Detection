First I think I should make all the clarifications I can. By "true Christian," I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ. To be honest, I'm not sure what a person has to do in order for them to qualify as a true Christian anymore. That's fine! Thank you so much for your response and answering my questions:)
