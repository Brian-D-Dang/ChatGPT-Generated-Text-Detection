I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the entire situation. Firstly, I think it is pretty clear that McDonald's is a public space, and that the customer should be held accountable for her actions in that space. Secondly, if the woman was really hurt, then the amount of pain and suffering she went through is unimaginable. So in that sense, I think she should be compensated. Thirdly, even if the amount of pain and suffering she went through was great, what she's suing for is 12 million dollars? That's just obscene! I mean, how much could she possibly need that money for? The woman must be crazy. I think this whole thing is a pretty black and white case. I think the woman should be compensated for any pain and suffering she went through, but that's about it. I don't think the woman should be suing for millions. If she really suffered, and is now disabled, then I think she should get compensated. But I think that compensation should be limited to what she will need to live on now. I think she should be compensated for medical expenses, pain and suffering, and lost wages. But I don't think she should get 12 million dollars. Especially when she was totally at fault. I think she is totally insane. I mean, if she was really hurt, then she should get the medical treatment she needs. But I think 12 million dollars is way too much. I don't think she should get 12 million dollars. I think she should get enough money to pay for her medical expenses and rehabilitation. I think that's reasonable. But I don't think she should get 12 million dollars. I think she should get enough money to pay for her medical expenses, rehabilitation, and to live on now that she can't work. I think it's reasonable. But I don't think she should get 12 million dollars. I think she should get enough money to pay for her medical expenses, rehabilitation, and living expenses for the rest of her life. I think 12 million dollars is too much. So I think she should get enough money to pay for her medical expenses, rehabilitation, living expenses, and to pay her children's college fees. I think 12 million dollars is too much, so I don't think she should get that. So I think she should get enough money to pay for her medical expenses, rehabilitation, living expenses, college fees for her children, and to pay for her future care and rehabilitation.
