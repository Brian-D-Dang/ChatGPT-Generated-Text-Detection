I think its fair to say that most people dont give a single shit about morality unless they're driven by compassion"their conscience" or worried about being judged by others for their actions. At least on reddit, I've never seen this claim actually backed up with evidence or examples. The vast majority of the time it's just another way to belittle those who do care about things like human rights and moral arguments.
