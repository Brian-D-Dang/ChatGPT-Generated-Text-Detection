Cigarettes are the leading cause of preventable death, responsible for roughly 480,000 deaths per year in the US. 41,000 of those deaths aren't even those of users they are the majority that are prescribed cigarettes and use them to quit smoking. I don't know what your definition is of saving lives when you're completely wrong in saying that it's something we should never do because it would have a devastating impact on society if every single person in this country smoked their way out of cigarettes... It's not "saving" the world but actually stopping smoking once it becomes prevalent throughout our lifetimes. I'm not really arguing against the citizens' right to live a life that's full of opportunity without having to smoke cigarettes. I just think it's dangerous to use marijuana to quit smoking so much because it can make people feel more miserable than either life-killing or prevention activities.
