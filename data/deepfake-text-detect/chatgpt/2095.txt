I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say "entertainment," but I think it's more than just that. Most works of fiction do scare or disturb the reader in some way; How can they be enjoyable if you're scared by them? What makes a book good isn't its ability to make us scream (though there are plenty like this), but how well thought out each part is. When books first began being written down, people had trouble remembering things for very long periods of time- which made writing everything down extremely important. Nowadays with computers having become so handy at storing information, most of those records no longer matter as much... The only reason we keep on keeping track of all these stories through millennia past is because something magical happens when words are put together into sentences: They come alive. It doesn't take any special skill to write - anyone who knows legible handwriting can create their own story, whether it will ever see the light of day again is another question entirely. But once an author has created hisher work, even without reading it back he sees inside himself what went into creating it. Writing becomes self-reflection rather than material for others' enjoyment. We learn from ourselves while sharing our experience! That's one of my favorite aspects of storytelling, along with the fact that new readers discover old favorites, discovering authors whose style speaks directly to their interests. This process continues throughout your entire life until you finally die, leaving behind little snippets of personal history waiting for someone else to read over, perhaps passing onto new generations altogether. In a sense then, every piece of published literary work represents a page left blank within the pages themselves, and human beings continue filling up those empty spaces as though nothing were missed. And eventually somebody comes across these hallways between genres filled with forgotten tales, deciding to try on the persona of an unknown character halfway around the world thousands of years ago. A book begins, leaving behind the chance to meet characters unlike anything known yet today....
