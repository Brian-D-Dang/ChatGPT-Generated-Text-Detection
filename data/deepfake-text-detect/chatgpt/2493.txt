CMV: ISIS isn't about the US, it isn't about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isn't about us, and to try to make this all about our President is simply silly (and a bit racist). I think in general we have been very slow at taking any action against ISISIL until now when they are attacking Baghdad again for example
