Bernie Sanders offers a categorically different approach than others, making him such a direct threat to the status quo that there is no way corporate America will allow him to win. Regardless of whether or not you can get behind his policies on economic inequality and social justice (or their lack thereof), we should all be able to rally around one thing: if Bernie says it; it must be true! In this video from Sean Hannity's Fox News show Fox Friends Sunday 10716, co-host Steve Doocy asks Senator Bernie Sanders about some of the issues he has addressed in his campaign for president, namely immigration reform. The topic was brought up during an interview with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush who said "It seems like every single month something new comes out where someone needs a visa because they worked at Facebook." Steve Doocy asked what Bernie would do as President regarding the United States' relationship with Mexico which makes the most sense given many immigrants come here through our southern border crossing into California. In response, Sanders started talking gibberish before quickly correcting himself by saying ..."we have got to stop deporting people..." but then went ahead and continued speaking nonsense without finishing his sentence.
