I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a "slut" the poster gets railed for it. The sentiment is usually that they don't think it's okay to judge someone by their sexual activity. It does appear that there is a double standard on Reddit when it comes to slut-shaming. On the one hand, users tend to be very vocal about not judging people for their sexual choices, but on the other hand, any comments that suggest someone might be judged for being promiscuous are often met with criticism and disapproval. In general, Reddit appears to be very accepting of different views on sexuality, but there is still a stigma attached to those who have multiple partners or engage in casual sex.
