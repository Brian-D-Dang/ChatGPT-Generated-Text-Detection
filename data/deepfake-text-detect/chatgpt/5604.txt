You always hear the saying, "it's like comparing apples and oranges," in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the opportunity to show why. As one example, let's say you were comparing the prices of gasoline and soybeans. I'm sure you've heard gasoline is too expensive and the oil companies make too much money. People often say that soybean farmers are underpaid. So let's look at the data. The data from the USDA shows that in 2009, soybean farmers received on average 692.63 per acre (corn received 594.62 per acre) and gasoline at the pump averaged 2.46 per gallon (this includes the price of crude oil, refining, and distribution). You might look at this and think soybean farmers are underpaid, but that's not necessarily the case. In 2009, farmers received 2.19 per acre, while they produced only 1.81 per acre in soybeans. Soybeans have a much higher production cost than gasoline. Let's now look at the comparison in a different way. Let's look at the price of a gallon of soybean oil and gasoline. In 2009, a gallon of soybean oil averaged 35.42 (this includes crude oil, refining, and distribution). That same year, a gallon of gasoline averaged 2.19. The price of gasoline was lower than the cost of soybean oil, but that's not necessarily bad for soybean farmers. Again, soybean farmers received 2.19 per acre, while they produced only 1.81 per acre in soybeans. Soybean farmers actually sold soybeans at a loss for the year. So you can see that comparing gasoline and soybeans isn't apples and oranges. Instead, it's like comparing apples and oranges. It's like comparing a food item to a fuel item. The prices for the two commodities are different and it is perfectly reasonable to compare them. Gasoline and soybean prices are different and that's because they are different commodities. People should stop saying that farmers are underpaid because they are not paid for all of the things they produce.
