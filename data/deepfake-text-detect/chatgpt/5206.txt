One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse culture, but it also makes it easier for people with different views and opinions on issues like immigration, gender equality, homosexuality or other topics to reach consensus about difficult problems that affect minorities such as raceism, economic inequality, morality, abortion rights or gay marriage. The fact that affirmative action policies are implemented rarely leads to disappointment among many Americans who tend towards portraying someone else's policies unfairly. The result can sometimes lead them to abandon their own ideas altogether because they feel overwhelmed by what they perceive as unfairness in favor of others' opinions - and indeed, some have become hostile toward those whose viewpoints outside their own. But when people resort to this tactic whenever the facts change - such as a change in climate change writer John Robinson argued - many American citizens will suffer irreparable damage from political divisions over matters like immigration laws, reproductive liberties or free speech. More fundamentally, these types of hostility could prove disastrous if we're not careful: In this scenario, the administration would likely further divide America into two camps; one elite class of voters opposed to affirmative action and the other believed in those tenets while thinking themselves superior to anyone else due to their unquestioning support for affirmative action programs. In that context, the issue might seem trivial now since Republicans have historically tried to win majorities through strikes against affirmative action programs - otherwise known as "tolerance" - but an ideological conflict between liberals and conservatives poses huge challenges for American society today and there isn't much time left before the 2020 presidential election.
