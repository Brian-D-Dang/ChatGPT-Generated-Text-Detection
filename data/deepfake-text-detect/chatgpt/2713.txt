(Edit: My view has been change though there is still some interesting stuff in here) First I want to state that my opinion doesn't lead me to hate or judge people who are gay, bi etc. That being said... I have a hard time understanding how someone could be proud of something they had no control over and also why so many LGBT's feel the need to flaunt it. why so many homosexuals feel like they must flaunt their sexuality (not just homosexuality but bisexuality as well).
