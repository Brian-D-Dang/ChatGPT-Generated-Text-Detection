I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm not exaggerating). I was perplexed by this because he doesn't even know my name and has never met any of these women! One guy once said to his friend "oh, my girlfriend's been sleeping with three guys so far." Yeah...
