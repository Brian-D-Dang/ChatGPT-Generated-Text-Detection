WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that. Most of the people that I look up to in person don't seem to be in my league anyways: (I'm not sure if you know this but there are a lot of awesome posts on rmensrights as well on how men are about women and if they have any issues with women's rights they'll just ask them to go 'to hell' or something like that. We all get it!
