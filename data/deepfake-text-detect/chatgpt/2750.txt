I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form. The lady spilled hot coffee on herself and sued for damages because her skin burned. How is that their liability? If you are liquidating your assets before a divorce proceeding, would some people consider this to be fraud if they did not know about the impending proceedings in advance?
