I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters. The first battle I remember was the Battle for Berlin in 1945 just after my 4th birthday on May 1st. It is also one of only two battles that we had fought with tanks against them - the other being Operation Bagration or "Big Red One." The Americans were very proud when they took over the suburbs from the Russians who destroyed Berlin's sewers so no food could be passed out to anyone starving there before it reached its destination. We would later see their arrogance as they dropped bombs all around us and wanted our candy store. What you fail to mention is that Hitler decided to go back into Russia shortly after this which resulted in more death than what happened then. No matter how many times you try to rewrite history, it still stands true today. God Bless the USA! You are an incredible country with wonderful people. But you will never ever forgive them for letting your grandfather down by sending him off to die while he believed his government told him lies about why Germany invaded Poland.
