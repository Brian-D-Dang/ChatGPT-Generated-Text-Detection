First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't mean nudity isn't acceptable for the majority of people in this country. I don't know why you're downvoted. This is just an opinion man.
