A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but I find that buying and setting off fireworks on my own is often a bit underwhelming. If you're going to spend money on fireworks, I would recommend doing some research and finding high-quality, professional-grade fireworks that are safe for home use. You can also enhance your fireworks display by creating a theme or setting up a good viewing area with seating and refreshments. Finally, always be sure to follow all safety recommendations and local laws regarding fireworks use.
