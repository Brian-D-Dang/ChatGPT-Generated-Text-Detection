It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified: The animals - especially endangered ones - can be saved and the joy of seeing them alive cannot possibly outweigh their suffering. The fact remains though... What if you could never see any animal in a cage ever again? Wouldn't it make sense to just let nature take its course instead until we run out on our planet completely extinct some day at best or worst cause an apocalypse like Rama did after he was done with us all??
