Why I hold this view: 1. America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, causing immense and long-lasting damage to entire communities. The use of atomic bombs as a means of warfare sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the principles of humanity and justice. 2. There were alternative options available that could have ended the war without resorting to such extreme measures. For example, the United States could have continued with the blockade of Japan and intensified conventional bombing, which was already causing significant damage to the country's infrastructure. 3. The decision to drop the atomic bombs was not solely based on ending the war, but also had political motivations. The United States wanted to demonstrate its power and send a message to the Soviet Union, which was emerging as a rival superpower at the time. 4. The use of atomic bombs had severe long-term consequences for the environment and health of the people living in the affected areas. The radiation exposure caused cancer rates to skyrocket, and some victims developed lifelong health problems as a result. Overall, the use of atomic bombs on Japan was a senseless act of destruction that caused immense harm to innocent civilians and undermined the values of justice and humanity.
