So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor culture as they are just like other people in that respect (...right?). However, since these things were created by whites to oppress them, it's kinda racist for the ethnics groups to use these methods while oppressing others? You keep using those phrases interchangeably when there is a big difference between each one and if you would get your terminology right, then perhaps we could have more productive conversations. The first question, however, is really whether or not racial discrimination exists at all-and even if you think otherwise, why do you believe so strongly? It does exist, but its effects vary depending on where you live; some places being less oppressive than others and there's an economic basis behind it all too. In terms of "reverse racism," also known as blackfacebrownface makeup, black actors don't need to be Caucasian to portray African Americans-theres tons of black men playing role models to kids in public schools who look nothing like them! Even with regards to Hollywood casting directors (whom generally aren't racially conscious), why can't someone else play Abraham Lincoln instead of a ngger dressed up like him? There are plenty of examples of culturally diverse casting nowadays, though most of the time I see movies made by non-white filmmakersactors (as opposed to ones made primarily by white males), it doesn't hold back on being misogynistic towards women, homophobic against gays, etc. So yeah, reverse racism is pretty much alive and well in America, especially compared to the rest of the world, but its only here where cultural appropriation gets complicated. If anyone wants to watch videos on this topic, I suggest watching the video from Racialicious titled Why We Can't All Just Get Along which talks about the ways our society has structured itself around oppression and how it reflects upon race relations today. Also, read my response to YesAcidRain below! I am very interested in your opinion. Please elaborate further. When I was younger, I believed both sides had similar values. Then, I saw something that influenced me greatly in life. Someone said to another person, "Man, you got lucky son." That struck a nerve within me. At first, I didn't know what he meant until later in life. And now... Oh man, that moment changed everything. Now I realize that while differences may exist, similarities are stronger. They shape us into different characters through nature and nurture. That makes sense isn't it? Anyway, thank you for writing such an insightful comment. This will definitely help many people gain insight into new ideas. Much appreciated!:) The phrase "racial inequality" actually means equality regardless of ethnicity - not necessarily equal outcomes across races. You're assuming that people who work hard deserve better careers based solely on skin colour. whilst obviously true at a societal level, it ignores the fact that the real reason we still continue to employ discriminatory practices in identity politics is because of petty power struggles and personal envy rather than anything ideological. A lot of literature written before the 1960s talked about abolishing racism without talking shit about capitalism. But because certain politicians realised they could get votes out of it, this language became institutionalised. Although it's easy to blame modern forms of privilege and exploitation on an abstract concept called 'racism', it's kindof dishonest to say that institutions weren't already built up long beforehand. So no matter how disparate the systems currently employed to disabled access might seem, the same underlying principles apply. Obviously this applies to ANY group oppressed under colonialism, slavery, feudalism, patriarchy, ableism, etc., but i'll limit myself to Western nations alone for brevity. Western Countries used to struggle along with a rigid caste system, and class structures where dominated by wealthy landowners. These two factors combined together helped create institutionalised casteist attitudes towards lower classes, which ultimately caused European colonisation, due to the blatant disregard for indigenous peoples' lives, land rights, and freedom - basically, enslaving colonial powers attempted to justify themselves by establishing the idea that native cultures deserved inferior treatment in order to survive due to their supposed laziness and lack of ambition. As a result of this violence and exploitation, indigenous populations suffered from malnutrition and disease, endured slave labour conditions, were forced to perform manual jobs previously performed by free labourers in Europe, were denied education, family planning, birth control, self care products, healthcare services, legal representation, child custody, property ownership, etc. these are all IMO systemic problems and inherent issues that stem from colonization. But wouldn't any form of liberation automatically solve these problems? How exactly did European countries successfully transition into postcolonial times? Well yah, everyone deserves basic human rights-like living standards, having enough food shelter to stay healthy, job security, reproductive health care, etc. But quite frankly, none of these items should be granted access to 4th rate qualities among 5 star quality materials substances in the pressurichrisvalue}acklatexa]
