This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I would even say they are caused by a singular cause: the selfishness and self-centered nature of human beings! I don't know whether it is true for this specific case but there are times when people make decisions based on what they want to do rather than making an objective decision in accordance with their values. This kind of behavior can be found everywhere from politics to relationships and business, unfortunately. It happens all day everyday, every minute. How does this happen? Why can we get so caught up in our own desires that we ignore other important considerations, like those pertaining to others? Well, because of two things; firstly, these external factors cannot occupy our consciousness over any longer time periods than we need them to do (this will come back into play later); secondly, we're not designed to handle cognitive restraint well at all. We evolved without foresight beyond a few minutes, which means very little intuitive processing power. Consequently, at some point in history when humans had no ability to foresee anything more than a couple hours ahead, we developed an innate tendency towards self-serving motives. As you may already suspect, this makes us quite easy prey for manipulators who use our own greed as leverage against us. The thing about free market capitalism though is that its rules are actually made to protect us from exploitation - if you didn't sell your labor voluntarily then you could hardly demand money without being accused of theft. But because of the way it was set up, where the value exchange doesn't really take place until after several stages of negotiation between buyer and seller, it also gives everyone else plenty of room to exploit. When one person takes advantage of another, heshe isn't necessarily acting maliciously, they've just put themselves in situations where getting away with stealing is easier. And since Humans are right now far less adept at negotiating than most animals, the system has taken advantage of that lack of skill and become a powerful tool to warp society. With hindsight, however, just how badly off were we ever going to end up if we hadn't allowed ourselves to fall victim to the same sort of tactics used by manipulatees? Who knows? Selfishness leads to the creation of systems, many of them unworkable due to government intervention. Public servants tolerate laziness simply because it allows them to keep up appearances of working hard while not having to deal with the real issue of too much manpower. Meanwhile, businesses prefer low prices above quality products because it saves them money, allowing them to spend the saved capital elsewhere. And when it comes down to somebody managing a relationship personally, especially one involving intimacy, it seems to me that the best option anyone should realistically expect apart from committing suicide is to run away screaming. A truly healthy relationship requires work both partners must contribute to maintain. If neither partner wants to make that effort, something needs to change before either party becomes emotionally attached. As long as individuals aren't held accountable for their actions, obviously nobody knows where or why such sad outcomes occur. Bottom line is that when someone's self interest threatens to destroy everything around himher, we develop mental "blinders" to prevent us from seeing the problems outside of his immediate area of influence, thus perpetuating a cycle of bad choices. These blinders probably serve another purpose besides keeping us oblivious: they allow us to justify our failures within our minds. Once we convince ourselves that whatever happened wasn't OUR fault, we feel justified in blaming the problem on anybody but ourselves. While I am highly critical of the individualistic worldview, my faith in humanity remains firm. Despite only having myself and my internal compass for guidance, I believe everyone genuinely wishes the best for fellow human beings. Even if we tend to go astray occasionally, ultimately we still care for each other and strangers alike (if only subconsciously). What we fail to understand though is that sometimes we attract similar negative influences too, resulting in further deterioration into destructive patterns. By failing to recognize the effects of other people's actions, we wind up contributing to a situation. While this might seem frustrating at first, the truth of the matter is that we HAVE to eventually wake up and face the consequences of our actions sooner or later. So instead of avoiding personal responsibility and turning victims of external manipulation solely onto something else, the solution lies in developing empathy. Empathy involves learning to see yourself in relation to everybody else, attempting to identify commonalities between different types of personalities despite differences along lines of culture, religion etc.. Then, once we realize that we share certain traits in common regardless of cultural background, we begin to appreciate the importance of recognizing the skills and attributes of others. From here, we can add to our knowledge base through introspection providing new insights into our own personality type (s) which would allow us the chance to save the world otherwise needed carbon junkie killed clean rate required track in the hands that is, decided weather pattern?
