This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is to show how fallacious those sort of arguments are and that we can even rationally draw conclusions from seemingly irrefutable premises. My point is to show how fallacious those sort of arguments It doesn't really matter whether you "show" it's fallacious or not... The problem with this argument is there isn't one premise in either sentence that seems like an obvious conclusion - How do you get from A implies B to A must be true?
