I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If I was a non believer and non theist, If there is a God or afterlife, if in the next life or afterlife, if a soul did exist, I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural,If that if it existed.
