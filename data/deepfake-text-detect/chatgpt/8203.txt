Edit: Thanks for all the info. I more or less quit responding because a couple people effectively changed the way I was looking at the issue. To be honest though, if you're only interested in building games and not learning how to work with large librariesframeworks then it's probably best that this thread go away so as many other beginners don't get stuck on things like these obstacles we had here (especially since they will continue indefinitely.)
