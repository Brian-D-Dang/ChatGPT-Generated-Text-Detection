Im probably going to ramble on and such so I will make my point clear from the way I see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice or classy as that would mean there are people who can read past facial expressions, tone of voice and body language which is something I tend to do a lot when making statements about other groups especially racial ones. So this isn't just a rant but an explanation within a frame of reference while also giving others enough information for them to form their own opinion which ultimately makes me happy because more thinking less anger happier individual. The world needs to learn how to think before they act because the moment you start acting based off emotion your actions won't lead anywhere except to self destruction in the long run since the logical brain has already made up its mind what path the action should take with no room left for doubt. The only reason why we don't have any peace today was mainly due to all these inner city kids growing up in single parent households where gangs were formed along side their drug addiction andor mental illness by "Selling Drugs" (aka Marijuana) to get money to buy food for themselves as well as getting dope for free during school breaks and college if they had any discipline at all. They got into this lifestyle through peer pressure alone which wasn't very strong with most under the age of 14 being too immature and therefore too young to understand or even care about anything like honor codes. This scenario leads us here where violence has become normal everyday life simply because most of our population weren't taught morals at home back then and instead told to live the gangster lifestyle which eventually turned out bad. However because you're "Living Your Life" every day now without knowing or caring about anything outside yourself, "Gangsters" won and you lost. You need to realize though that these same ideals you learned leading up to your current situation aren't necessarily right either. These guys didn't really grow up learning that those things matter much besides scoring drugs, guns, women and alcohol...a few girls maybe. And honestly none of that stuff matters and yet you're still trying to prove otherwise? You've been living your life for years never questioning it until recently yet you're suddenly concerned over someone else's decisions to live theirs differently than yours which is fine because actually doing nothing and letting "It Go," means YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU DONT CARE AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU A GANGSTER! In addition once again thanks to social media, everyone is able to hear everything you say and thoughts throughout the entire process thus creating two scenarios. 1: People listen intently to some random guy saying whatever he wants about certain issues 2: People ignore his opinions entirely[...] I'm dedicating a thread to show people how they've gone wrong and feel justified against black males as well as minority females. It doesn't matter what race you're talking about but I'll use white female for simplicity reasons. All yall learned from reading books and watching movies is that men commit violent crimes against women but every rape and murder case you find shows that the vast majority of rapists ARE male and the majority of murders committed are done by MEN to men and WOMEN COMMIT RAPES ON OTHER WOMEN! [...] If black history month existed it's pretty evident that blacks wouldn't know what happened in America and vice versa. Blacks have been enslaved in this country longer than whites were allowed to work and earn money legally with white slavery starting around 1750 with the first census taken in 1800 resulting in 7 million slaves with 3 million of those having children. Meanwhile whites were busy building the western frontier as well as becoming one of the largest industries in the nation which led to new laws regarding labor and employment allowing them full rights to claim property after working 100 days as opposed to 40 days like slaves did where they couldn't keep any possessions after 30 days unless it could fit inside a tree trunk.[...] You can tell a person's character based upon their decision making skills whether it comes down to good or evil consequences, short term gains vs long term losses, lessons from mistakes rather than doing better the next time based off experience and etc. In fact in regards to morality if you study Game Theory or Sociology you'd find it quite interesting because once you look deeper into the history it becomes obvious just how many times humanity has failed in regard to making correct choices in order to go forward. Thus meaning given the chance and the ability they choose to come hell bent on destroying itself beyond repair! For example Hitler believed in National Socialism and wanted Germany to remain powerful economically and politically. His policies achieved both goals however eventually he became fed up with failing to turn the economy around and decided resultantly it was necessary to kill 6million Jews and anyone deemed physically weak. He went further to believe to eliminate as many gypsies and cripples and restore health to Germans which resulted in massive starvation deaths among civilians as well as soldiers and higher death rates among the German military!
