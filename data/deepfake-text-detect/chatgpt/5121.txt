First, I know "egalitarian" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word "feminism" has nothing to do with feminism. Nowhere does it mean anything in a feminist sense either; it's just one way of saying it applies to all women and men. It also means nothing to me personally except as an umbrella term for feminism itself: the more you get used to it there will be fewer feminists around. The catch here though is that feminism isn't meant exclusively to be about equality or gender parity but rather about supporting oppressed groups like women who struggle against societal expectations which would normally exclude them from having equal rights such as equal sexual rights, equal opportunity for everyone else (though this cannot be ignored), equality between men and women regardless of sex preference etc., patriarchal attitudes towards masculinity etc.. All these things are complicated issues and each should not be treated as simply a woman's issue until the need arises when it comes time to ask whether they're worth fighting over. The words feminists use mean everything because feminism can only ever exist if we listen closely enough to our inner voices. If we want equality then we must respect those voices too! We live in a society where the majority of people think their opinions matter less than theirs, yet none of us really understand why in the first place. In a world where every single person owns their own opinion, comparing yourself to others shouldn't lead anyone to believe you owe things to them due to your privilege at least somewhat. Let alone genuine feelings of oppression like emotional rape victims whose lives were ruined by bullying or harassment even after being victimized by other people in a relationship. On the whole, speaking up matters quite passionately throughout life both politically (the people who disagree most strongly) and sociallyemotionally (those who agree most vehemently). Living in an era where many politicians spend half their time attacking someones ideology instead of addressing its causes makes no difference whatsoever apart from legitimizing their views to themselves through rhetoric so how could anyone say they aren't realists? It also distracts from the important work we do on behalf of marginalized communities everywhere along with ensuring equality across generations without expressing any personal beliefs regarding who deserves equality. This doesn't actually take into account the minorities who have been living under genocide and oppression since before we arrived in the Americas - women might dominate society now much sooner than we expected but it wasn't long ago countries like India weren't considered to belong solely to white supremacists (whereas today's poor nations haven't fared well relative to rich ones despite being part of Europe)? And let's look forward to the day when our country finally stands together again:)
