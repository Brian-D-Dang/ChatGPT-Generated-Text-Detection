I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a new one doesn't seem financially prudent. He had 500 payments through the end of next year and he could make them easily at his job that will pay him less than half what is was paying now (he got laid off). The depreciation wouldn't be as bad because they are still under warranty for 6mo45k miles on each part plus another 12 months or 36,000 more miles before needing maintenence as well which would save you money over time compared with having higher maintenance costs when your out of warrenty
