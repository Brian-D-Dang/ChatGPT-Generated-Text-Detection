growing up in america I was condition to believe women's breast are sexual organs do to the fact that we over sexualized them too much. it wasnt till recently that the scientific evidence on this topic has been more and more mixed, its just a mindset thing. I'm not saying there won't be some people who read this post saying "it would have been so much more convincing" I actually said something along these lines: I remember reading somewhere that if you had sex with someone larger than your penis (not rape) they would've developed an erection that was well within their standard of view.
