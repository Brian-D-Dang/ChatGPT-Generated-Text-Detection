Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do A few weeks ago I wrote a short story about my first time flying in a hot air balloon. It was published in an online magazine, and I'm going to share it here. The story was about a woman who wanted to see the Northern Lights. Although she had read about the Northern Lights before, she had never seen them with her own eyes. She wanted to see them for the first time, but was afraid of heights. I can't imagine why she was afraid. It's not like she was flying in a plane that was very low to the ground. It was a hot air balloon, and she was flying low over the trees. I don't think she could see them at all. She was so scared, she started sweating, and she started to vomit. I don't remember if she was sick for a long time or if she just started to feel sick. Finally, she fell asleep. I'm sure there are better ways to describe her reaction, but I can't think of any at the moment. I'm sorry if the story is old news, but I just wanted to share my experience with anyone who might find it helpful.
