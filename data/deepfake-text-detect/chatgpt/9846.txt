As a german, especially in the city I live, there's honestly too many turks and muslims here. My old school was 80 turksmuslimsguys from eastern europe, which seriously lead to many problems in our school. It is understandable that you may feel uncomfortable with the presence of a large number of people from other backgrounds. However, it is important to remember that everyone has a right to live somewhere and people should be treated with respect regardless of their background. It is also important to recognize that diversity can bring positive change to communities, such as increased cultural understanding, new ideas and perspectives, and economic growth. Rather than focus on differences, try to find common ground with those around you. Seek out ways to learn more about other cultures and engage with members of your community. This can help create a sense of shared identity and understanding that can benefit everyone.
