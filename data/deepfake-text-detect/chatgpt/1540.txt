It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing I wish we could do more often in this conversation is ask what it means for our children's future? If you read the press releases from Chinese firms talking about their growth or their plans, you would think (at least) that there were no concerns whatsoever over pollution; nothing at all negative seems to be mentioned. But if you look closely, many have voiced concern on global warming, water scarcity and food shortages... The truth is: We will need both governments as well as individuals working together to tackle these issues effectively. It can only happen through coordination between government agencies and private investment groups, international organizations such as the UN, university research institutes and non-governmental institutions like NGOs and faith based ones - who know better than anyone else how best to address problems caused by human activity impacting the natural environment around them. The problem now is too big and complex to ignore any longer! And it boils down to climate change which not only impacts nature but also threatens mankind itself with ever increasing levels of illness due to increased airwater pollution etc., and increasingly severe droughts. Yet once again, "the rich get richer while poor suffer." Too bad we don't have the same kind of focus today among those who are responsible for making decisions affecting us. Or leadership skills in general....
