While East Asian languages can be highly valuable for developing business relationships in East Asia and gaining insight into the culture, it is important to also consider the practicality and usefulness of learning a language. Due to the widespread use of English in international business and trade, it may be more practical for a global English speaker to learn a European language such as Spanish or French, which are popular and widely spoken in many nations. Additionally, it is important to consider personal interests and connections, as learning a language can also be a means of connecting with heritage or pursuing personal passions. Ultimately, the choice of which language to learn depends on the individual's goals and priorities.
