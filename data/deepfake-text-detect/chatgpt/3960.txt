Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I don't know if there is a specific reason for this line of thought but it seems rather silly. This is false; colours of objects in the spectrum (even blackwhite) reflect differently depending on their temperature. Therefore explaining why the colour red doesn't have a lot of wavelengths reflected by objects would fit nicely within current scientific understanding of our universe. That's true! It just gets me thinking that they're saying something non-existent
