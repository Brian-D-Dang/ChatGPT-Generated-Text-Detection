So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern governments are far more corrupt than any socialist republic in Europe it's no wonder they're being called socialists! The Democrats will win against us all because we can't do anything about the oligarchs! Insane people like Trump wouldn't EVER fall into that trap. You guys must not understand economics. He'll just continue on his merry way until he gets elected and then BAM! he's president!!!
