If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is a long-term investment with high returns and can be quite the boon if your job requires it; I wish my boss had taught me Russian when he was younger as well:)
