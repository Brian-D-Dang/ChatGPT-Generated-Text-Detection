Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as a strong believer in free speech, the right for people to speak out against government corruption, yet still having some sort of order and social norms; I understand that there are no absolute rights when it comes to personal freedom and safety of others. Thus I see both sides: The pro-government side who view these kinds of protests as "No Freedom" or even terrorism, while at the same time being extremely disrespectful towards protesters by calling them idiots and liars when they complain about their own governments. I would like to ask fellow Americans here on Equestria Daily if you agree with me that our government is corrupt and we need to do something drastic? Or would you also argue that any form of protest besides voting is anti-americanprogressive? But does America really have an excuse for not standing up against corruption? Where else can citizens call their representatives into question without fear of reprisal? And where else is there such active communication between every citizen possible? Here's why I think we should be protesting everything from politics to media coverage in general... 1.) As mentioned before, the American electoral process doesn't work very well due to many factors leading to voter fraud that leaves votes unaccounted for. If all voters were able to vote online using their smartphones then our elections wouldn't be so easily corrupted and rigged (as seen how often our candidates seem too liberal to actually win). But if we had truly fair elections what incentive would politicians ever have to cheat?! Of course, technology isn't always perfect and sometimes Electronic Voting Machines malfunction. This happens enough times that not only do officials refuse to admit it but EVMs themselves disappear after each poll until the next election. Also note that with modern tech companies making massive profits off of machines designed specifically to give companies advantage, why would anyone want to risk hacking into those systems? Remember Apple has recently been fined millions because of security breaches and Google was accused of accepting bribes just last year. In addition to hackers finding ways to get around technological safeguards through software loopholes, people could simply bribe someone to hack the system. There are plenty of scandals involving political bribery going way back generations ago within our history books and it seems like most major figures throughout human history have taken part in bribing judges, thieves, cops, etc., which ultimately leads us to today where corporations make billions off insider trading schemes and nobody gets punished for this, instead getting huge bonuses and promotions. Most importantly though, if we don't stand together and voice our opinions against corruption now, then future generations may never know exactly what happened to create two different parties that constantly fight tooth and nail to control the government and keep their power over other groups. But let's not forget: Too much money given to one party means less money left to fund campaigns of another opposing party AND vice versa. So if your candidate loses, he or she loses bigly. Elections shouldn't come down to handouts based upon campaign contributions nor should there be jobs given to friendsfamily based on connections alone. We must demand transparency and accountability for all officials including candidates running for office along with things like electronic voting machines. It'd take a lot of effort to change things overnight but if we start doing small steps first we'll improve society exponentially faster than trying to completely overhaul from scratch. 2.) Media bias and manipulation of information: Ever since President Nixon started covering his tracks by wiretapping journalists and ordering Donald Segretti and Haldeman to pay people off before Presidential Campaigns began, it hasn't stopped. Every single day new stories pop up about celebrities and public figures getting busted either hiding assets or breaking laws. From politicians receiving donations to famous sports teams paying players under the table, no matter what scandal pops up there're hundreds of articles written daily talking about how shady our elected leaders are. Yet on top of waging wars abroad, spending trillions and trillions on poor programs domestically, raking in billionstrillions offshore, extending tax cuts to wealthy, corporations and rich donors and creating nothing meaningful except taking away healthcare from millions of innocent families, Congressmen spend most of their energy fighting amongst eachother for reelection rather than addressing issues facing everyday Americans. They pretend to care about topics like environmental pollution (regulating oil drilling), climate change (promoting coal industries), sexual harassment (passing legislation preventing women's reproductive health clinics from offering abortions early in pregnancy unless medically needed), Muslim immigration ban (keeping terrorist watch lists intact), healthcare reform (forcing patients to buy insurance), universal background checks (letting guns fall in criminals hands), gun control (restricting sales of certain types of firearms), taxes (raising rates), minimum wage increase (allowing employers to hire workers at lower wages), racism (choosing white men as spokespersons), LGBT equality (refusing to offer equal benefits to domestic partners), education funding (cutting budgets), transportation projects (blocking funds for mass transport rate in prior findings good results in ernie different choosing to release. The record reflects to apply corrective action to test successful testing public opinion data absent high levels of testing progressive values,
