Hi. Whenever I read about people trying to - increase the number of women in science or engineering - increase the number of women in politics - increase the number of women on boards, etc., all my head just starts going "I am so glad you are not president."

And then there's college campuses, which right now (with two exceptions) it seems like everyone applauds. But when they were having their first anti-feminist protest at Berkeley... boy oh boy...
