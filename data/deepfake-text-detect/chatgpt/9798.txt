I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my extended family, but I know that I'm loved and accepted by my parents and siblings. They have been very supportive of my decisions in life and have always encouraged me to be myself and pursue whatever makes me happy.
