Generally speaking, you have two sides on the "Fat Debate": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, etc.). The fat acceptance movement is a social and political movement that seeks to challenge the stigma surrounding overweight or obese individuals and promote self-acceptance and health at any size. This movement argues that weight should not be used as a measure of health, and promotes acceptance regardless of body type. It also advocates for access to healthcare and fitness activities for all sizes and body types, and encourages people to adopt a healthy lifestyle without focusing solely on weight loss. The fat shamers are those who criticize overweight people, often with language that is derogatory, such as calling them "lazy" or "unhealthy," and attempting to pressure them into losing weight. This shaming can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and self-hate in those who are overweight, which can further lead to unhealthy behavior. Fat shaming has been linked to increases in anxiety, depression, and even eating disorders.
