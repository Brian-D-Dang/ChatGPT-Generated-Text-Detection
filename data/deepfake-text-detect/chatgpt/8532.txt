I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the "safe space" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao on this subject. Does anyone know of anything specifically stated by her? Or are these things just being inferred through common sense and what has come out about Reddit in general since she took over as their leader last month (euphemistically known 'as interim' until November 9th)? kyuubi wrote a blog article which quotes Dave Huffman confirming earlier reports I'll try my best summarize it here: The only users who can downvote each other will be those with established reputations or moderators Users won't see comments they don't like unless there was sufficient upvotes for them previously; otherwise spam gets kicked off right away without viewscomments ever getting seen (source) [ref] This seems natural considering we're talking webpages after all...but does explain why some people may dislike such changes if rPopular doesn've always worked so well before..[heh...] This could also mean more repetitive content posted again Again simply because others never saw previous submissions leading ultimately into an anti-wasteland scenario
