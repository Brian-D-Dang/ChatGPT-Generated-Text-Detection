I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer use excessive force or misjudge a situation and end up causing harm to children or innocent people? One reason could be a lack of proper training and education on how to handle high-pressure situations in a non-violent way. It is also possible that such officers may have personal biases or prejudices that affect their judgment and decision-making. In any case, it is important for law enforcement agencies to take these incidents seriously, thoroughly investigate them, and take steps to prevent them from happening in the future. Additionally, improving community relations and building trust between the police and the community can also play an important role in preventing such incidents.
