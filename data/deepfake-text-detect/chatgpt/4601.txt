Personally, I'm not religious, so I guess I'm trying to get some insight here. Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything you want, but there are no rules; things just happen because that's how they're supposed to be (ex: people die). Imagine for a moment if everyone did what they wanted and there were no consequences. In fact imagine that every day someone decides whether or not this will be their last day on earth, but somehow always manages to escape death by doing something he wants to do instead of his assigned task... If this happened frequently enough then eventually everything would end up like what we see around us now with wars, famine, etc., instead of living as one big happy planet. Everyone has an unassigned job which puts them at risk each day, thus making all life more challenging than it needs to be, while still having free time available. Also, since most of us know our jobs could change tomorrow, why should any individual take risks? The only way out is chance, but chances become less likely each day because people choose to avoid taking those chances. Why go down the road when its possible to just stay home and play video gameswatch movies? That's pretty much my point, though I guess it doesn't make sense for me to talk about such a hypothetical situation unless I was actually born into that kind of society. But anyway, I think what I said makes sense, especially since the narrative says that this story takes place after Earth has been destroyed due to war. So maybe Earth didn't lose any battles against aliens from outer space, but lost the war itself because nobody followed orders anymore. Eh, who knows. My point isn't really meant to apply to real-life situations, it just seemed like a good pick for a topic. Okay, let's see... Well, first off, I'd have to ask myself what exactly your character thinks and feels towards this sort of societal structure and if your setting allows him to express himself freely. If yes, that gives him agency, even without being able to influence events directly. Even if he can't completely control the outcome and it seems like he never does he'll probably feel resentment toward anyone who disagrees with his ideas. To understand him better, look past the idea that humanity might need to stick together to survive, if you really liked that part. Instead, try asking yourself how the problem affects your protagonist emotionally. Does he hate inaction or rather think other options are pointless? This may lead you somewhere else entirely! I am sorry if these questions seem obvious to you, but I find discussing such topics helps me gain new insights even when they sound trivial or stupid. It is also nice to hear how others approach similar issues. Thanks once again! well I personally don't care to act on my beliefs because it is really hard to convince other people of something that may seem idiotic to them. And I doubt many people believe in god so I dont bother preaching there either. Now for the second question - well lets say the guy keeps thinking about these thoughts ALL THE TIME, regardless of current circumstances. He often stares blankly off into space, loses sleep from getting overthinking and mostly lives alone. wouldnt that make him depressed? Maybe they civilization survived long term but died quickly because of lack of socialization (people stopped caring) Wouldn't depression cause problems as well? Isn't depression caused by feeling helpless? The reason I asked about "lack of" socialization is because I read through Wikipedia today, and learned it means 'to connect socially'. When I thought about it, not following orders made asocial people. I mean, wouldn't everyone eventually rebel?
