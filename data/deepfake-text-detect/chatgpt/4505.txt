This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this is a tough topic for me right now as it was the first time I have ever witnessed something like this and I don't want to see it happen again! Hahaha....I guess that makes sense. Anyway, here goes: This site has made comments about "anti-vaccine movement" being the next big thing. For those of you who are not familiar with what we do over here on BLCM...we keep up tabs on various things happening within our community (including biological sciences). As part of our work towards trying to educate people about the current state of affairs regarding vaccines... there are times when we post news articles where they mention issues surrounding vaccine lawsregulations etc. We never extend ourselves by giving personal opinionsopinions on anything unless requested...at which point we will take down said request if given permission...however, we often see links posted stating how "vaxxers are idiots" or especially worse statements such as asking us all to boycott them because we come off "dumb." But we also know that people put themselves out there regardless so naturally people feel free to comment. It can be hard seeing negative posts in groups that only serve to try and help spread awareness. However, this is just one person posting their opinion and should not reflect the views of Biologos nor lead anyone away from the truth. So why is a scientist taking issue? Well, I would like to think that most scientists understand the dangers of science gone bad and would agree that spreading misinformation CAN cause harm. Especially when the information provided seems impossible to disprove...and even more so since it is usually sourced through non-peer reviewed sources; i.e., . Some believe healing prayer to be real medicine while others believe quackery is taught as fact. Noted biologist PZ Myers recently had his reputation tarnished after he learned that many were duped into believing his blog contained anti-religious stuff. He apologized profusely via twitter and basically spent the rest of the week doing damage control, addressing concerns raised by disgruntled readers claiming his credibility was lost due to anti-religion beliefs. To make matters worse, The Skeptics got involved too saying that any criticism of religion gets him labeled as anti. In other words, he agreed with the statement that shows ignorance and intolerance against religious belief. There is no place for this kind of thinking as far as we are concerned. For example, if someone believes God created humans and does not accept evolution then that person cannot claim to follow Christian Science. If a fellow scientist claims that people get cancer because they lack faith, then they will lose respect amongst peers in the field. That same logic applies to alternative health care providers touting homeopathy yet rejecting vaccinations altogether. You must be able to explain your beliefs without name calling or assuming everyone else follows them blindly. I'm sure Dr. Gorski would agree when she states her own philosophy in regards to tradition vs. evidence based practice: "Early 20th century physicians taught growth promotion methods using medicinal herbs, homoeopathic remedies, and sugar pills. Fewer than 10 percent of Western medical schools still teach these practices today. Unfortunately, this approach provides little basis for scientific research. Because few traditional practitioners view disease processes mechanistically, they usually base treatment on anecdotal experience, rather than laboratory experimentation. They ignore modern diagnostic techniques and rely exclusively on monitoring patient responsiveness to herbal preparations or sugar pill regimens. Also, medical ethics codes prohibit doctors from prescribing medications that haven't undergone double blind studies. Consequently, many of these ancient treatments remain untested and may prove toxic or ineffective in certain situations - since they're largely unregulated. Even though they are neither established scientifically nor endorsed officially by conventional healthcare authorities, unproven therapies continue to thrive." - Allan A. Schore PhD So let's start off with something simple. Are we talking about measles virus here? Or herpes? Sadly, yes and sadly, there have already been cases reported. Now, I realize that you might say "who cares!" but unfortunately, I think that is short sighted. First off, one case could easily turn into hundreds. Second, it isn't always easy to tell difference between a viral infection and food poisoning. Third, once infected, it becomes harder to catch another round and hence, the numbers go way higher causing the fear factor to rise exponentially along with anxiety levels. Fourth, because it spreads through contact (usually coughs) and possibly airborne means that a single person is actually capable of infecting dozens...if not hundreds. Now, to tie everything together...the stats show that the United States ranks 1 in number of reported measles cases each year (highest rates worldwide), followed closely by Somalia (2 highest rate in world). Here's hoping we remain vigilant and preventative measures can sustainably stop thriving is successful. Unfortunately, two doctors having unintentionally endor gazletshatteries encounteris becoming less frequent instances. After all
