To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental differences. To me, the differences between men and women are the same as the differences between the right and left hand. Each has its own purpose and own place in our world. Women and men are the same in so far as they are different. We all know that men and women are different, both physically and emotionally. But I believe that the differences between men and women are different from the differences between different ethnic groups, or between people of different ages or social status. Men and women are a separate group, because of their physical differences and their emotional differences. We have different, but equal, roles to play in our society and it is our differences that make us stronger as a society. In the last ten years, there has been a lot of talk about the differences between men and women. The focus of the conversation seems to be on the ways in which women are different from men. Some have suggested that women are more emotional than men. They say that women cry more, are more sensitive and are more compassionate. It is certainly true that many women are emotional. In fact, I think it is true that most women are emotional. But what is emotional? I think that being emotional means that you care about the things that you feel passionately about. It does not mean that you cry a lot. I cry very little, and I certainly do not think of myself as emotional. I am very sensitive, and I am extremely compassionate, but I do not think that I cry more than the average man. I also know that there are many men who cry easily, and who are very sensitive to the feelings of others. I think that being emotionally involved in your work is not a weakness, but a strength. If you are emotionally involved in your work, it means that you care about what you are doing. I am very emotional about my work, and I think that it makes me a much better person. Some have suggested that men are physically stronger than women. I think that this is also true. Men are, on average, stronger than women. I think that both men and women have the right to feel strong. Both men and women have the right to feel physically powerful. It is the women who are physically weaker who have to suffer the most from our society. I think it is unfortunate that people are not judged on their abilities, but on their physical appearance. Women are judged more on their appearance than men, but both men and women are affected by the negative way in which our society views people who are not physically strong. I think that, in our society, both men and women are judged by how they look. Both men and women are judged by how they look on the outside. I think that we should try to be more accepting of the fact that we are all different. In the last twenty years, there has been a lot of talk about the differences between men and women. The focus of the conversation seems to be on the ways in which men are different from women. Some have suggested that men are more aggressive than women. They say that men are more assertive and more likely to initiate physical contact with other people. They say that men are more competitive and more likely to be controlling. I think that it is true that men are more aggressive, on average, than women. But, as with the emotional discussion, I think that being aggressive, assertive and competitive is not necessarily a bad thing. Aggressive, assertive and competitive people are often successful. If you are not aggressive, you may not be successful. If you are not assertive, you may not be successful. If you are not competitive, you may not be successful. I think that we should try to be more accepting of the fact that we are all different. We should not all feel the need to conform to the same model of behaviour.
