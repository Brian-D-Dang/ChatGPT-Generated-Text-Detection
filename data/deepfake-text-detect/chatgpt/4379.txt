I feel like they're acting and it often feels very campy. I don't like how they say "well my brain is more feminine," like excuse me that's something that women do, not men... They try to be cute at times but it gets old fast for most people. They should have just kept the fake wacky persona with a few of their ideas added in this episode instead of trying so hard to sound convincing
