After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the debate gets heated, inevitably someone will say that this time it's not about guns; this is a fight against terrorism! The argument goes something like this: "We have to take extreme measures now because we can never predict what crazy psycho might pull out his weapon next at any given moment so we need to make sure no weapons are accessible by anyone who should be barred from owning them due to mental illness or criminal behavior. We don't want another Sandy Hook situation happening again" blahblahblah. Of course there are always exceptions here but usually they involve people suffering from far more severe psychological issues than those of normal everyday people (like serial killers). However, if you look closely at these cases and find yourself wondering exactly how many mentally ill shooters were on psychotropic drugs when their crimes took place, then I suggest looking twice before siding with your strong opinions too strongly. A recent article showed a disturbing trend among mass shootings involving psychotic individuals and it seems as though some are just playing the odds - taking advantage of lax gun control laws while others clearly had a clear goal in mind which was to kill as many innocent civilians as possible using whatever means necessary. First let's talk about David Hogg, an 18 year old student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School near Parkland Florida who has become one of the most recognizable faces after becoming heavily involved in the anti-gun movement following the massacre earlier last month. He regularly appears on TV news programs and boasts over 100k dollars donated into a GoFundMe account for him personally where he complains about NRA members being scumbags despite the fact he himself got millions raised for his organization without ever having been shot at nor even going through proper training. This guy claims to know better than all of us how to run our country's firearms policy yet somehow still finds himself without a job. As for why somebody would donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to such a deluded individual, well that remains a mystery since almost nobody else would do anything remotely close to that kind of thing unless they really believed everything he says. If anybody does happen to come across evidence to refute Hogg's accusations, please feel free to share it below in comments section along with links proving me wrong. Otherwise maybe he could use that money towards paying off his parents mortgage? Nevertheless, this kid continues to show his true colors each day while making himself seem less credible with each passing week.
