I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community despite growing up in an anti-homosexual environment, but as gay men it's our job to put ourselves out there and show people how supportive we are (and by "supportive" I mean showing them what being gay is really about). One thing that has always puzzled me about homosexuality is why some guys get turned on when they see another guy with big dicks. Guys - look at that gorgeous ass! Who wouldn't want to pound away? It may seem obvious to you now, but until you have had sex with someone who was packing 15 inches of cock into your tight little hole, just don't tell us. All straight women know exactly which part of their body turns you on: boobs, butt, legs... go down any list and find the sexy spot; literally all of you do. Well guess what??? You missed out. We can only imagine the size those jeans must be!! The real question here is why doesn't every man out there try his hardest to give himself the same pleasure as he gives others?? Do you think luck plays a factor for him too? If so then that sucks because you will never experience how good something feels to yourself. But if you're lucky enough to get laid, shouldn't you enjoy it? Why not appreciate beautiful bodies and stop looking for flaws? What kind of animal can't help but let themselves become aroused over such beauty?! That pretty much sums up my argument and although most gay men agree with me, we still keep quiet. Just remember going through puberty changes everything and I recommend listening to Andrea Bocelli while getting naked together (again) ....
