I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too many. It's very quiet, the air is dirty, the buildings look dilapidated and the people are boring and uneducated. The smell of pigs and horses is everywhere, and the roads are too dusty for me to even drive without hurting myself with the dust. The internet is patchy, there are no nice shops, and the stores are tiny and unprofessional. So basically, if I want to buy something from the country, I have to travel to a different town which is also tiny and dirty. And even the city is not that nice because the land is flat and they're building a bunch of ugly high-rise buildings, and the air is still very dirty. I've never lived in a big city before, so I'm not used to the noise, but that's just the way it is. I can't afford to live in the city because the apartments are expensive. So what's the alternative? I want to have a more interesting lifestyle than the one I'm leading. I want to be more social. I want to be able to drive without hurting my lungs. I want to be able to play a variety of sports and go to a decent gym. I want to be able to eat healthy food. I want to be able to get to a nice dentist, or a plastic surgeon, or an MRI machine, or a good hospital. I want to be able to go to a nice doctor. I don't understand what all the people who like living in the countryside are thinking. Things I've changed my mind about Driving. I used to think driving was fun, but now I think it's boring and stressful. I'm glad I don't have to drive anymore. My last job. I used to think I had a good job. It was interesting and I could work on my own. Now I'm thinking it was a bad job, because I wasted too much time and energy on it. My boyfriend. I used to think he was a great guy. He's fun and he cares about me. Now I think he's a jerk. The countryside. I used to think it was a nice place to live. Now I think it's boring and dirty. I don't want to live in the countryside. I want to live in a city. What do you think of people who like living in the country? Last edited by lilith6; 09-06-2012 at 09:15 PM. I have to say I don't understand the appeal of living in the country, especially when it's a small town. I used to think the countryside was beautiful, but now I think it's boring and dirty. The only thing I'd like to live in the country for is to have a huge garden. And live by a lake. i'd like to live in the country, if only to be able to live without a car, be closer to nature, and have a few chickens I feel like the country is a lot more enjoyable when I get to visit. I like to visit my parents, but I have no desire to live there full time. I love the wide open spaces and big skies. I do like living in a city, I just don't like the pollution. I want to be able to live in a house that's not dirt cheap. I want to be able to eat healthy food. I want to be able to get to a nice dentist, or a plastic surgeon, or an MRI machine, or a good hospital. I want to be able to go to a nice doctor. I don't really understand what all the people who like living in the countryside are thinking. I'm just going to take this opportunity to gush about how much I love country living. I've lived in a town for a total of two years (grew up in the city). I'm now living in a small village, which I'm just starting to get used to. I think it has a lot of advantages over the city. For starters, it's a lot quieter, and I find it very soothing. In the city, you can't really have a conversation unless you go outside. But in a village, you can just walk through your house and talk to your friendsfamily. It's a lot more
