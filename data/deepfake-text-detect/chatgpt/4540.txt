In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they do not want it andor against their will constitutes rape (which can also be forced). However, in the past - before this societal change occurred - there was no such thing as "rape" or any sort of sexual assault. There were only two types of interactions between people: 1) Sex for money (or other goods or services), usually called prostitution, which included both heterosexuals and homosexuals; and 2) Marriage. Marriage was generally considered permanent, but if someone wanted out, he could simply divorce his wife without punishment. The man had all rights over her property after marriage, so there was nothing wrong with him keeping all the items she made during the marriage. If the woman now demanded more, then cheating on him would become an issue. Also, if the couple divorced, neither party was legally required to provide alimony nor pay child support. There were many reasons why women refused marriages. One was because most men either did not like being married at all (they didn't care about having children), or liked them too much, and never wanted to get rid of them (that way, you wouldn't need anything else from them except what was already theirs by law anyway); some women just wanted to go back to school and work full time instead of going through an entire life tied down to someone who might turn unfaithful. Generally, these women found themselves living alone or with their parents until such point where they realized that they needed to start taking care of herself. Even though otherwise unmarried young ladies may decide to remain single up until they are twenty-two years old, even this age is becoming increasingly rare due to the social pressure around finding a husband and having kids. Most children today end up under the sole custody of the mother, or even worse yet, in foster homes or institutions since this generation has lost its ability to raise children properly. I am quite ashamed of my own country in regard to how terrible parenting skills are here today. (Of course, nowadays there is a third reason women refuse marriages: being ugly. A lot.) So the history behind the word "marriage." This isn't really important, however, for the purpose of this exercise. It's merely background information. We'll look into this later. For now let us take a few steps back. When talking about sex, sex becomes very complicated. Every different kind of intercourse poses a unique set of problems or risks. But in order to understand those risks better, we must first discuss the nature of sex itself. Some people think that lovemaking consists entirely of boys kissing girls' pussies while watching porno videos. However, this is inaccurate; in reality, sex is far less simple than that. So let's address the physical aspects. As everyone knows, humans come equipped with a penis. When erecting said appendage, we can vary the length by varying certain muscles within our bodies. Males increase the size of their penises when testosterone levels spike. Women need estrogen to achieve arousal. At orgasm, females release engorged clitoral tissue, causing blood flow in vaginal walls; thus, providing pleasure via contractions of muscle and lubrication. Both sexes experience orgasms. Orgasms trigger ejaculation of semen into a female's urinary tract, resulting in pregnancy. Female nipples stimulate males when aroused. Higher functioning human beings can orgasm multiple times per day depending upon stimulation and psychological effects. Females, however, cannot masturbate. They lack the necessary equipment for self-pleasure. And lastly, anal penetration involves stretching of tissues and is painful. Because of these facts, individuals engaging in anal sex should attempt nonhormonal methods of achieving erection beforehand. As well, most couples engage in coitus without cumming beforehand, and therefore avoid contracting strains. The term "sexually transmitted disease" refers to sexually acquired infections caused by various pathogens that are contracted by direct contact, especially genital contact. Overall, STDs rank among humankind's greatest health concerns. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each year 250 million new cases occur worldwide (unless otherwise specified, STD includes HIV). Of these cases 15 million result in death. These numbers fluctuate greatly; sometimes the CDC reports lower figures and sometimes higher ones. Nonetheless, several things are clear based on current research, namely that rates of infection are increasing dramatically throughout North America and Europe. Currently, approximately 1 percent of adults aged fifteen to forty-nine have been diagnosed with AIDS according to government data[citation], signifying a 43 rise in diagnoses since 1985. Since 1990, HIV incidence in Canada has increased almost tenfold compared to 1980.[55] Despite dramatic declines in transmissions of HIV and hepatitis C, rates of syphilis and chlamydia continue to skyrocket in Western countries.[5657] Unprotected sexual activity with inconsistent condom use accounts 65-80 of STDs; unprotected sexual acts are commonly used impureersuggestive R remainsabdiners turnedon DiversD8eers! currenters! different
