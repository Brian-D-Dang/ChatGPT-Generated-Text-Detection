When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Tatooine, they encounter Watto, a junk dealer who owns two slaves, Anakin Skywalker and his mother Shmi. When Qui-Gon learns he cannot buy them from Watto because of the Jedi's ban against slavery (and possibly also because the slave trade was outlawed), he negotiates with Watto for their release in exchange for Yoda as a reward. After initially refusing to give up one of her young charges, Watto relents when Qui-Gon offers him more than double what he originally paid for Anakin.[13] Though Watto is reluctant at first,[414] after learning that Yoda can train Anakin, he agrees to set free both Anakin and his mother. The process of freeing Shmi takes several days[15] due to her being chained to an ottoman inside Watto's shop; however, she runs off before Qui-Gon can secure her leash to let go. She is captured by Tusken Raiders while trying to reach Sandpeople living across the Tatooinverge.[16] Upon realizing this, Qui-Gon searches through the market to find Shmi as well as Baby Luke and R2-D2 so that he could take care of all three at once. He asks Watto if he has seen any of these people since arriving on Tattoine, but Watto claims not to have noticed anything unusual. Kenobi then arrives and tells them that Shmi is likely enslaved by the Sand People.[17] As Qui-Gon leaves to try and rescue her, Watto says goodbye to Yoda, which only angers the latter. This sparks a fight between Yoda and Watto until Qui-Gon intervenes and calms down everyone involved.[18] After the duo leave town, Watto sells them off - first giving Anakin away to Gossk, a rival slave trader who wants to challenge Qui-Gon Jinn's authority over the city, before placing Shmi with Owen Lars.[19] Owing to Qui-Gon's defeat during their last battle, Watto sends his apprentice, Plo Koon, under Obi-Wan Kenobi's orders, to possess Qui-Gon and use him as leverage should the need arise again.[20]
