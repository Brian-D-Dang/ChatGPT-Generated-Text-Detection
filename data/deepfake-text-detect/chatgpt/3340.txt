In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they do not want to is considered a serious crime and is commonly known as rape or sexual assault. It is important to understand that someone cannot give their consent to sexual activities if they are being coerced, threatened, drugged or unable to communicate their wishes clearly. Consent needs to be freely given, enthusiastic, and ongoing throughout any sexual activity. It is important to respect someone's boundaries and understand that it is never okay to force someone to do something they don't want to do, particularly when it comes to intimate activities. Furthermore, it is important to speak out against these types of behaviors and support those who have experienced sexual violence.
