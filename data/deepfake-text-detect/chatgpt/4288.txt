Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not the money, but still... I don't think many people realize how much of their income is being taken away by tipping. You're paying for quality service, you shouldn't have to pay more than 15 if someone does a good job.
