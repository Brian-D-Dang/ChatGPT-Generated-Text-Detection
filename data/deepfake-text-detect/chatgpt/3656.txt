I can only see socialistic systems (The harder variety that imposes 90 tax rates and such) work out in ethnically, culturally homogenous societies like the Nordic states, or certain Orthodox Jewish communities. In these communities, there is a strong sense of community and shared values that make it easier for individuals to agree on the distribution of wealth and resources. However, in more diverse societies, it can be much harder to come to a consensus on what is fair and just. In addition, some individuals may be less motivated to work hard if they know that a large portion of their income will be taken away in taxes. Therefore, a more moderate approach to socialism mixed with capitalism and individual freedom may be more feasible for diverse societies.
