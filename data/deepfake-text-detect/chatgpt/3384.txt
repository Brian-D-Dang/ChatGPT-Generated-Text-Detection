The idea is not to infringe on anyone's right to express themselves. If someone wants to have and film adult consenting adults having sex then they are free to do so as long as it is done in a legal and consensual manner. However, it is important to keep in mind that there may be laws and regulations surrounding the production, distribution and consumption of adult content in different countries and jurisdictions. It is also important to respect the boundaries and privacy of those involved in the filming and to ensure that no one is being coerced or exploited. It is always a good idea to seek legal advice and consult with others in the industry to ensure that all legal and ethical standards are being met.
