Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. They just say the same thing over and over again. Look at Lil Wayne, he raps the same thing over and over again. Rappers are the same as the people they rap about. I think it is just because the people who like rap don't have any standards. What do you guys think? I think rappers are annoying. This is a good topic, but I'm not going to be mean. I think most of the people who say they don't like hip hop, are really just saying they don't like the lyrics in it, or the rapping. They usually don't like the music. I like music, even if I don't like a particular artist, I like their music. I'm not an expert in rap, but I do listen to a lot of it. I would have to say, that a lot of rap songs have good music and most of them do have good lyrics. I agree with most of what you said, but I'm just not going to be mean about it. I don't like it. Not even a little bit. Lil Wayne is really talented. He's like a freestyler. He's good at it and he can make up lyrics on the spot. He's a good rapper. I know that he's talented, but I just don't like him. He annoys me. I just don't like his lyrics, or him for that matter. I like it, but I don't listen to it often. I'm more of a rockpop fan, but I like rap. You're right. I don't listen to Lil Wayne. He annoys me too much. I like rap. I listen to rap. I think it's cool. I'm not a huge fan of Lil Wayne, but he's an okay rapper. I just don't like his music. His music doesn't do anything for me. I like him. I think he's great. Well, I like Lil Wayne's music. I don't think he's a good rapper, but I like his music. I like some rap, but I don't like most of it. I can't stand the rap that's like in every other song.
