EDIT: a portion of replies I'm getting are focused on the defination of'libertarian' and the rainbow of american groups that claim it for their particular beliefs. If in doubt, replace'libertarian' with 'progressive' or'socialist'. If in doubt, replace'libertarian' with'socialist.' That's like saying "if you're gay, replace your homosexual with a lesbian," or "if you're black, replace your blackness with white." Sometimes its just easier to say what you mean instead of trying so hard to be inclusive.
