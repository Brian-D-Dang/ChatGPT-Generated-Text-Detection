So if you haven't heard already, there was a recent [shooting in a Charleston church.] Many reports are coming out with evidence that points it as a racially motivated hate crime," said David Austin, a spokesman for the Charleston church shooting survivor. "It's not entirely clear to me why the shooter used such language or whether he thought about how people of color could be targeted by white supremacists - but we need more details from police on this issue."
