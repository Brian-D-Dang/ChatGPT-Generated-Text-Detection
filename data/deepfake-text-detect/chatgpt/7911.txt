While it's true that emerging technologies such as self-driving cars may eventually become the norm, it's premature to assume that the current generation will be the last to drive. There are still many factors that could slow down the adoption of this technology, such as regulatory hurdles and the cost of the necessary infrastructure. Additionally, self-driving cars are not flawless and are not yet capable of handling certain driving scenarios, such as inclement weather or construction zones. Even if self-driving cars become widely available, there will likely still be a demand for traditional cars, especially for recreational purposes such as off-road driving or racing. Finally, there are still many people who enjoy the act of driving itself, and may not want to give that up even if self-driving cars become widespread.
