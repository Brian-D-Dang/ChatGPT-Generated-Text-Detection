I'm very confused and bothered by the amount of ads for prescription medications that run on television and in magazines. In my mind, the reason that these medications can only be prescribed to a doctor is so they're done safely with all possible precautions taken (such as testing their side effects extensively). When I see an ad running around me about "prescription drugs" being available over-the counter at any pharmacy - or even sometimes just from your local grocery store... How safe are those products? Worse yet: what if you suffer some sort injuryillness when taking one such product; will there really ever exist anyone capable enough within our medical system who has knowledge how this drug would react inside someone's body under certain conditions because it could have been reccomended offhandedly without knowing anything more than its name Lets try Viagra!? Can we guarantee against premature death like no other medication given today does? And certainly not compareable safety standards anywhere close!
