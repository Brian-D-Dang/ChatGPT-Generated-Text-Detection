I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say. Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I also have many female friends whom I truly believe are strong-willed and independent people who can make their own decisions. (Although they may not realize it.) There were several things that made me more comfortable in participating rather than attending an eating disorder support group: 1. We don't talk about food or body issues at work - this would be awkward; 2. Men love talking about sports and other men's activities on Facebook (yes, even though I'm one of those "guys" whose interests tend toward nerdy things); 3. If we did start discussing our personal problems (e.g., we both had bad days), there would be no lingering doubt as to what was being discussed; 4. It's easier for me to discuss these topics with someone outside of my family (which has its positives and negatives). When I began working full time after college two years ago, I found myself going through periods where the weight loss became intense enough to disrupt my everyday life. And since getting married last year, I've become much busier professionally. A lot of women speak out against the pressure to maintain low weights when you're pregnant or nursing. But I feel compelled to point out how ridiculous it seems to expect new mothers to perform well athletically while putting themselves at risk for long-term health complications because of poor nutrition choices. People seem so quick to blame new mothers for gaining back all those baby pounds, but what kind of message does that send? Obviously, pregnancy isn't easy for everyone! Pregnancy brings physical changes to your body, including increased muscle mass and natural endorphins that make you happier overall. However, if you want to participate in recreational athletics during this period, then do it intelligently. There are plenty of books available for both beginning and advanced runnerscyclists. Your doctor should be able to give you advice regarding healthy nutritional habits before, during, and after childbirth. You have every right to enjoy your pregnancy, whether it involves exercise or just enjoying yourself generally without guilt. The "dieting mom," however, who prevents herself from doing anything enjoyable due to her perceived lack of willpower will find herself suffering the consequences far earlier than she might think possible. So yes, having children doesn't mean that you lose control over your diet or eating behaviors altogether. In fact, becoming a parent makes you even less likely to succumb to negative influences because kids teach us to imitate them. Even though you'll gain some extra fat tissue around your middle, it won't affect your ability to move forward with fitness goals, either. This theory certainly applies to mothers of young children, too, especially once they get past infancy. Let's face facts here. Women aren't meant to be chubby babies or skinny mature adults. We grow up learning appropriate body image standards based upon social norms. When we reach adulthood we take away certain freedoms that made us feel safe and secure in childhood, like driving alone, wearing short skirts, drinking alcohol, etc. Staying within reason when developing self-esteem shouldn't involve forcing ourselves into restrictive diets - it should come naturally via positive reinforcement (more on that later!). No matter what stage of motherhood you're currently experiencing, if you remain vigilant, motivated, and disciplined, everything should go smoothly. Ladies, let's try to remember that the road ahead travels onward regardless of conditions. Yes, we all need to eat regularly throughout each day, but balance must always exist between filling up and starving, learning to define foods as nourishing versus calories vs. empty carbohydrates, etc. Knowing which foods are good for you and which ones contain excessive amounts of unhealthy fats, carbs, sugar, artificial sweeteners, preservatives, additives, chemicals, etc. - that is knowledge anyone can use. Also know that your relationship with food affects relationships with others. Just as it allows for comfort in times of stress, overeating lets you off the hook for responsibility with regard to living healthier lifestyles. Lastly, how you look at yourself determines how you see yourself. Ironically, any woman who feels insecure about her looks becomes vulnerable to cravings for candy bars or fastfatty junkfoods. Of course, there are genetic risks involved, as well as smoking cigarettes, abusing drugs, not exercising, and consuming processed sugary stuff. These factors, along with environmental triggers (air pollution, sunshine exposure, cold air) contribute to the development of obesity. But it all boils down to maintaining proper blood chemistry, making smart lifestyle choices, balancing emotional needs with immediate gratification, taking proper care of oneself physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, and remaining responsible towards human beings. Now is not the time for self-loathing, ladies! Having gone through bouts of extreme starvation, binge eating, purging, laxative abuse, constant diet plans, calorie counting attempts, reckless exercise sessions, and excruciating length workouts only to regain lost energy, strength, and success, chances are now standing evidence of failure warning Janaos: Notiefs: On the way: Because: The coppery pj
