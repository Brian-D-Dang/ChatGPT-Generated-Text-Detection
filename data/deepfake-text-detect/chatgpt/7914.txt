One potential counter-argument to this opinion could be that the Nuremberg defense is, in fact, quite problematic. The defense, which essentially argues that an individual was "just following orders" when committing heinous acts, has been criticized for allowing individuals to shirk responsibility for their actions and for enabling tyrannical regimes to carry out atrocities without fear of legal repercussions. Moreover, the Nuremberg trials themselves demonstrated that the defense was not an acceptable justification for atrocities committed under Nazi rule. By holding individuals accountable for their actions, the trials helped establish important principles of international law and set a precedent for future war crimes trials. In short, while some may view the Nuremberg defense as a way to escape culpability for horrid actions, it ultimately undermines justice and accountability, making it a problematic legal and moral concept.
