I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is very disgusting - it's so soft! When someone else tells me there are things in their bathroom (or anywhere) they don't like about themselves or what they see when looking at them naked, how should I refer to it? If not insulting, how to say something without making myself sound moronic by answering "It just looks dirty"? This applies both in private conversations with friends as well as public situations. For example: "Hmmm... you're dressing weirdly." "You mean this?" [points to underwear] How could I phrase this other than sounding ridiculous? It may be more appropriate to ask if one can help suggest phrases instead of asking direct questions, but I'm interested in all possibilities. Note: This question was inspired by How to tell people who wear revealing clothes around nudistsswimmers while keeping your dignity?, which does not answer this specific question because it only concerns avoiding being caught off guard if somebody asks you such an embarrassing question. The answer says that, depending on the situation, some euphemisms might work better than others, which answers my original inquiry quite nicely, thank you:) Many thanks, everyone! EDIT - Thank you so much chewie908, TommyBaker311 and Kartik-T for providing much needed feedback. Cheers to you all! Also, so many great comments from those who want evidence here comes piles upon piles of links including the entire Wikipedia article on body parts excuses. Here's another good link... although contains pictures. Also thank you macrosamurai30 for pointing out that there are probably lots of places where we'd never discuss our own bodies; sometimes all we need is to hear the word "vagina." So that makes sense, too. Now I know. Thanks again! A: Remember, people generally find cleaning up after themselves unpleasant even though they have no idea why they feel that way. They won't appreciate hearing about feces and urine. You don't really want to come across as insensitive you just want to avoid seeming rude or silly yourself. Be sensitive and nice. Try using colorful language and try saying "That seems gross..." rather than "Wow, what do you call THAT?!"
