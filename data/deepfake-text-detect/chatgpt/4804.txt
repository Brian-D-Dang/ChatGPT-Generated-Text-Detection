For those who don't know, the trolley problem is this: You and another person are on a bridge which is over a trolley track. 5 people are tied to the tracks below you but there's also five people attached to the tracks in front of you. There's no way for any one of them to save all their friends from being killed by an out-of-control train, so it seems like the morally right thing to do would be to run down the middle (where at least two can survive) rather than pull up your friend and leave him or her behind. One argument that is often used against utilitarianism is that we should not sacrifice our own moral values just because statistically more will live by doing so. I believe that there are ways around this objection though - namely by claiming that we act according to reasons, even if they're irrational; i.e., giving into some kind of gut instinct. It doesn't seem obvious then that merely acting for reasons isn't enough to make us equivalent to an impartial spectator. For instance, consider Google's famous "Donate 250" button, where users donate money without asking themselves how much good donating really does for anyone else. By intuitively following reason alone they become treated as an impersonal bystander when deciding whether or not to click the Donate button. According to Kantian ethics, we have a duty to ourselves never to violate others' rights. This principle says something about what makes other people matter to me besides my utility function specifically, their freedom and dignity. As such, punishing crimes committed against only myself is immoral. If someone murders several hundred innocent bystanders but ignores his victim, he violates rights, yet still has the same amount of utility from murdering his neighbor as if he had instead murdered himself. Is this fair? No. We cannot tell why these trespasses happened to occur, nor judge them correct or incorrect. The best we can hope for is understanding the human condition better, trying to prevent the possibility of similar acts occurring again. In contrast, allowing murder of many would certainly imply permitting murder of few, since we could simply kill off each individual with impunity, knowing full well that our victims couldn't possibly get away from death. Yet even though we wouldn't punish every single crime, we'd discourage murder through the mere fact of punishment. Thus, according to Kantians, having many lives matters essentially because of the absence of consequences. A utilitarian perhaps might say that killing off hundreds of thousands of people and letting millions of people die is equally evil, while Kantians feel differently. Of course both ethical systems disagree here, and there must surely be room within the confines of rationality to accommodate them.
