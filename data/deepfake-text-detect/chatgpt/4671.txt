There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud "woo-ing" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. Edit: I think it's just that he can't hear his voice as well as others so his sounds are more like vocalisation than any language that we know of I don't want this life but until you let me have some love these next five minutes won't do... In order to save your life, they must destroy mine and now I am hung up in heaven waiting for a sign of hope.
