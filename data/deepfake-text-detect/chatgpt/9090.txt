I have played Hearthstone since its beta and have had great times with it (I still do). My massive issue with the game is that the current meta relies too heavily on straining mana. A lot of people seem to think "the card advantage is a feature because of a lack of FUD.... I can't play anything else if mana needs to be rationed" but this strategy has completely failed in the past few weeks. You don't understand what you're talking about, quite frankly he's right! If you build so much sustain they start to lose value due to running into imbalanced matchups more often than not.
