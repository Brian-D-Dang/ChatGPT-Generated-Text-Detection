To start: I am not saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing. However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, the arguments that incestuous marriage is "unnatural" or "immoral" are no longer valid arguments since we now accept homosexual marriage. Therefore, in order to make a case against incestuous marriage, one must look at it from a different perspective. One argument could be that allowing incestuous marriage would lead to increased birth defects and genetic abnormalities due to the close genetic relationship between the two people involved. This could have serious implications for any children born of such a union, and could even lead to an increase in physical and mental disabilities amongst future generations. This could be seen as a public health concern, and something that should be considered when debating whether or not to allow incestuous marriage. Another argument could be related to the potential emotional effects of incestuous relationships. Incestuous relationships can be incredibly damaging psychologically, and may involve feelings of shame and guilt, as well as various forms of manipulation and control. Allowing such unions could also have a negative effect on society, as it could potentially create a culture of acceptance for such relationships, which could lead to more instances of abuse and exploitation. Overall, it seems that there are enough potential risks associated with incestuous marriage to warrant caution when considering such unions. While no one should be judged for their lifestyle choices, it is important to consider the potential consequences of allowing incestuous marriages.
