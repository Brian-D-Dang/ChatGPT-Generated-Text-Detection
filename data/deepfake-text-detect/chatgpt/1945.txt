Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as homemade and not nearly worth it when all of you could have made something better at home with ingredients that were probably cheaper than what they charge for their overly processed pizzas. I'm glad this comment was here because I've never seen so many people rally against freezer pizza! lol
