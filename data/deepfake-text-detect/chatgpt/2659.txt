So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training but still, an army needs to be supplied with more than just weapons and bullets... I'm pretty sure the fire service is one of those things where you get what you pay for (in terms of price).
