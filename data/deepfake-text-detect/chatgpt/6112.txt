New here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong. Before I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal experience. I have a friend who recently took a sabbatical, and he told me to do the same, so I did. I took a month off and stopped playing video games for the first time in almost 10 years. After the first week I noticed that I was feeling a lot better, I was less stressed and a lot more happy. After a month I feel that I have a new lease on life and have a fresh perspective on my life. I am now going to start going to the gym and start making healthier choices in my life. I would like to start seeing some of the game developers that I have enjoyed playing games from over the years. I want to ask them what their thoughts are on video games and how they feel about the impact that video games have on the mental health of gamers. I feel like there is a lot of stigma around mental health and there needs to be more positive and factual discussion around it. I am trying to have a conversation with a few developers about it, but they have been ignoring me and not engaging with me in any way. I have been trying to send messages and PM them for 2 weeks now and have not got a reply from them. I am just curious about what they have to say about it and if they have experienced any of the same mental health issues. I have seen that there are quite a few other people who have been trying to get in touch with developers and they have not been responding, does anyone have any information as to why they would be ignoring people? Has anyone else had any experience with this? Have you managed to get through to any developers? I have heard that some developers do engage with their fans, and I would like to think that these developers are the ones I am trying to get in touch with. Has anyone had any success in getting through to developers? Any information that anyone has would be greatly appreciated. -Jake. Edit: I wanted to add a few more details and give people some extra context about why I am doing this and why I feel this is a big issue. I have seen a lot of people who have been struggling with mental health issues and it has really hit close to home with me as I have had my own struggles with mental health in the past and I feel it is important that I help these people as best as I can. I have also spoken to a few people who have had similar experiences to me and have had the same experiences as me and I am hoping that I can get some help. I know that talking about these things is not easy, but I feel like it is a conversation that needs to be had, and I want to be a part of it. So if anyone has any advice on how I can get through to the developers or has any advice on how I can help myself feel better I would greatly appreciate it. I have also seen that there have been some people who have tried to get in contact with developers, and have had some success, but I have seen that most of them have been the people who have been making the more negative comments towards video games and the people that are defending the industry. Any ideas on how to get them to engage with me and help me out? I feel like I should also mention that I have tried to reach out to other developers who I feel like have a more positive relationship with their fans and those who have been more open about the negative sides of the industry. I wanted to make it clear that I am not just trying to reach out to developers who are trying to tell people that video games are bad or that there are no problems with the industry, but I am trying to reach out to the developers who are willing to have a discussion about the issue. I am trying to get the good and the bad from both sides, and I know that the developers who are not willing to talk about the issues are a very small minority. I would like to start a conversation with them and I would love to hear about how they feel about mental health and how they feel about the impact that video games can have on it. I am not trying to start a war or anything, I just want to start a conversation. So if anyone has any information on how I can get in touch with the developers, or has any advice on how I can help myself feel better I would greatly appreciate it.
