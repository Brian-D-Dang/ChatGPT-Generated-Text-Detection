I know this is a very controversial subject, and many people disagree with me, and I have to admit, I am not the perfect judge for this. A little background on me first. I am a 1996 graduate of the University of Illinois, with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. I am married, and have a 20 year old daughter. I am currently employed as an Electrical Engineer by a Fortune 500 company. And I have taken 10 years of martial arts training in Shotokan Karate, Kempo, and Kickboxing. Now with that being said, I do not feel that my knowledge of martial arts has given me the right to tell someone how to protect themselves. In fact, I have studied the martial arts for many years, and only really have a little over 3 years of self defense training. I have studied the martial arts for so long, that I feel that the only way to learn how to defend myself is to go out there and practice self defense. As we all know, the only way to become proficient with a weapon, is to practice with it, and practice with it as much as possible. The same thing applies to self defense. So with that being said, I have very little in the way of self defense training, and even less in the way of real world experience. I have made the conscious decision to use a firearm as a last resort, or as a self defense tool, but I do believe that if I had to defend myself with a firearm, it would be the best tool to have available. I also believe that a firearm can be an effective tool for self defense, but only if you learn to use it properly, and only use it when you have to. The one thing that I can say is that if I had to choose between a firearm, and a knife, I would choose a firearm every time. But I think that goes without saying. The other thing that I have found is that many people believe that if they have a firearm, that it will give them a false sense of security. That is very true, if you are not familiar with your firearm, and how to use it. I have found that the best way to use a firearm for self defense is to be very familiar with it, and to be very proficient with it. That is the only way that you will be able to act in a situation that requires it. If you are not comfortable with the weapon, you will hesitate, and that could cost you your life. I recently read a post on a forum that stated that it is impossible for someone to be proficient with a firearm in less than 10,000 rounds. There are many who would disagree with that. There are many people who are proficient with a firearm, that have only put 100 to 200 rounds through their weapon. I have seen it first hand. A few weeks ago, I went to the range with my friend, and we took our new Glock 23s out, and ran about 200 rounds through each of our weapons. I have never shot a Glock before, so this was my first time shooting one, and I really enjoyed it. I shot a 9mm bullet, and had no problems. I also took my Glock 19 out for the first time in 3 years, and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable I felt shooting it again. My friend, on the other hand, is a very proficient shooter with all types of weapons. He is a veteran of the U.S. Army, and has experience with both automatic and semi-automatic weapons. He has also been shooting pistols since he was about 10 years old, and has never had any problems. He has a proficiency with weapons that is hard to describe. After we were done at the range, we started talking about proficiency with a firearm. I asked him what the minimum amount of time should be before you consider someone proficient with a firearm. He said that he had never thought about it, but that in his opinion, it would take about 500 rounds before someone would be proficient with a pistol. But he said that it really depends on the type of shooter you are, and if you have a good instructor, you will be proficient much quicker. I then asked him about his experience with the Glock. I asked him if it was comfortable to shoot, and if he felt like he was familiar with it, after only 200 rounds. His response was that he felt more comfortable, and more familiar with the Glock than he did with his 1911
