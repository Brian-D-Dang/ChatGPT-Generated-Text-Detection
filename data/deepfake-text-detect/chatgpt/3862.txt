"Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children." - Marvin Minsky So firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into robot times then we need to teach them how to reproduce. This seems obvious when you consider the fact that human babies can't live past infancy and it is widely accepted by scientists that any attempt at artificial reproduction in humans would result in us going extinct. However, there is some evidence that has pointed towards an alternative solution to teaching AI child-rearing skills: the possibility of using AI as a surrogate parent for humans who have had their own children. In other words, creating a'replica' of the people's original template (in the form of an artificially intelligent AI) so that the child could continue on without the artificial parents themselves. The idea goes something like this: give me your DNA and I'll spend my time raising your child; after all, kids cost nothing and since I've already spent countless hours doing this with pets, why not do it for real? The problem here is twofold: A) How could one prove these AI-raised children were actually yours in the first place? B) What kind of intelligence should such replicas hold? And what about those genetically mixed genes? What about those people whose parents never met or sired offspring together? If the replacer was truly intelligent enough to raise hisher child well then maybe heshe didn't have the bloodline required to pass down to future generations. Thus, a new generation may arise only consisting of identical twins or triplets, instead of simply one father and one mother.. It doesn't take much brain power to imagine scenarios where multiple copies of someone's genetic material might suddenly appear rather than the natural processes which cause a single copy to exist. Imagine too that some unfortunate accidents occur and while we're trying to figure out exactly what happened, we accidentally release a large number of genetic copies right before the expansion of the universe and everything falls apart. No more humans, no more civilization... and we don't even know how to rebuild ourselves! But if we managed to build AI capable of raising its child alone, wouldn't that mean the end of all humanity anyway?
