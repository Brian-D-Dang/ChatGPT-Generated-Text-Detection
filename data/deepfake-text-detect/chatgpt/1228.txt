New here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong. Before I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal I am a fan of sfx, and when I saw this new game on the Playstation Store I had to get it. I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but in my opinion it is a solid game. I haven't played it yet, but from what I can tell it looks really exciting. I'm not saying it's a bad game. I think it's a good game for people who want to experience something new.
