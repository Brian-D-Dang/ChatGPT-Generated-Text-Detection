Firstly- I'm a Brit, so if I'm missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies! While having a conversation over the phone about a movie (the name of the film is "The Devil's Advocate," so I can't really have an answer for that), I do consider myself part English speaker and the first thing he said was "good job." It made me laugh out loud. He also said "I got you a drink of soda" when he heard my accent. No need to be rude.;) Haha thanks!:) I understand what you mean by second language!
