This CMV was sparked by the reaction to Donald Trump from the right in the recent GOP Candidate Debate but extends to everyone who intentionally used political incorrectness for personal gain or to create a divisive atmosphere. The use of political incorrectness may appeal to a certain portion of the population, but it can also be harmful and hurtful to marginalized communities. It can contribute to a culture of discrimination and prejudice, which can have real and lasting consequences for these groups. Furthermore, the use of political incorrectness can also undermine the credibility and integrity of the person using it. It suggests that they are more interested in appealing to a certain base than in engaging in thoughtful, respectful discourse. In general, it is important to be mindful of the language we use and how it may affect others. We should strive to create a culture of inclusivity, respect, and empathy, rather than one of divisiveness and prejudice.
