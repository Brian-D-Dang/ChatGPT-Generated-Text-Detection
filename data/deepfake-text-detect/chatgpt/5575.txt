Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as a decent pizzeria's. That's not surprising; frozen pizza is inherently not as good. However, it is a bit surprising that the very worst frozen pizza is still not as good as the worst pizzeria pizza. This is a tale of two pizzas. The worse frozen pizza I've ever had was Bubba's. The store-brand had a crust that was incredibly thin and dry, so dry that it was crumbly, and tasted of nothing. There was no topping in sight. The whole thing tasted of cardboard and pesticides. The company website proudly announces the "Bubba Burger." The frozen pizza, as far as I can tell, is a proud, frozen descendant of the Bubba Burger. I ordered a pizza from my local pizzeria. It was a bit dry, but nothing horrible. It wasn't the worst pizza I've ever had. That's one of the things that made it so strange. The texture was fine, though the crust had some crispness to it. The taste was...almost edible. It was unmistakably pizza. It wasn't good pizza, but it wasn't awful. It had nothing in common with the frozen pizza. I'm not sure what to say about the frozen pizza. The flavor was clearly pizza, but it had none of the pizza's textures. It wasn't pizza. It was just a sauce and a crumbly, unedible dough on a plate. It was almost edible, but I'd rather eat nothing. It's an interesting thought experiment: What if pizza was made of nothing but crushed graham crackers, smothered in chocolate syrup, and covered with plastic cheese? What if pizza was nothing more than a plate of mashed potatoes, a plate of cheese fries, or a plate of mac and cheese? It would be utterly inedible. I'm not sure what I'm trying to say here. I just found it interesting that two very different foods can be absolutely disgusting when compared to each other. Pizza doesn't need to be frozen. If you really want pizza, order from a pizzeria. If you really want frozen pizza, make it yourself. There are people who really want frozen pizza. They may be disappointed.
