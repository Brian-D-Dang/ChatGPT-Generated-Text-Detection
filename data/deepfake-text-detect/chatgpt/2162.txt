If this is a duplicate post, I apologize, an AutoMod told my my old version was too short and that it was removed. Here's my logic, though: If I get 500 karma for the original (which never happens) then why not? Not preaching, just trying to understand. I'm fairly certain posting your own stuff on reddit violates some rule or another... but you're probably fine lol
