I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are different enough to think about what they mean when it comes to dating a Turkish girl or any russian women for that matter! In this article I'm going to talk about how you can date a turkish girls without having sex with her. Like so many other things in life; the only way to get good at something is by doing it over and over again until your getting better at it every time.For those who have dated turkmenistan ladies before know exactly how tricky their mentality works. If you want to learn more about this topic visit: The first thing some people might say after learning all of this is "Well if she won't sleep around then why do i need her?" Well there is one big problem with this answer. There is no point dating someone just because they wont sleep around. This question should be changed into something like "Why will i keep wasting my time talking to you?." Its nice as an excuse but its not true. Most guys who use this line usually don't even try to meet up with them. And let's face it... most men (and women) would prefer sleeping with a virgin than one thats experienced anyway. So lets clear out what it takes to go from dating a Turk manico vakfi to actually taking his virginity. This has already been answered, but I'll give credits where it's due: Most Turks believe in family values. Family means mom mum dad grandma brother sister son daughter aunt uncle cousin etc.. While it may seem like a real bad idea to marry within your own race here in America sometimes marriage does bring families together. The same goes for Turks who live abroad. Marrying a foreigner won't make them feel attached to home anymore though. They still value traditions and relationships within families very much. Why would you throw away everything keeping your family strong if you could possibly find someone else who isn't related? You'd probably lose the confidence you gained since being with him. Just remember never ever tell anyone about a long term relationship you had outside of your family. Your ex boyfriends girlfriends parents friends and siblings will ask questions which would ruin both of your lives (if he was married). That's unless you're living with them right now. In which case you wouldn't mind keeping it secret because you trust eachother. Having sex outside of wedlock means 1 year later you become pregnant and expect support financially. It also makes you look like trash in front of your community. A child born during wedlock is considered equal to yours. But if you were engaged to another person while unmarried you would be viewed differently. Imagine cheating then breaking off engagement gets back to your fiancee with news of you were impregnated oh god please don't even imagine what her reaction will be.... The important points here however is it doesn't hurt to mention such events to someone close to you especially if you write down dates and names of people involved. When in doubt basically err on the side of caution. After you have gotten past the initial confusion given by their cultural differences and becoming comfortable around each other maybe then move on to talking intimately. What kind of intimate talks did get started depends on the individual. Some couples start watching movies alone others listen to music. Do whatever feels natural to you two and as always enjoy yourself! All you need is communication and patience! Let me add that although it is really common among muslims to share personal information with non relatives, that's mostly limited for religious reasons. So don't worry too much don't take offense to anything odd she says once you introduce yourselves honestly inform her what type of lifestyle you are looking for. Her beliefs shouldn't change just because she knows you well. (But don't be mistaken. Even though they have less rules preventing marriages between cousins they are not allowed to marry cousins.) She cannot fully rely on her father for example is when we apply our definitions of "family" to this situation. Because if she marries somone who will divorce her he will end up losing his entire family not hers alone. Now the question remains... How far can you go with this particular subject? Obviously you must respect her views and feelings as well as her religion. Never force her opinion on you regardless if she's highly against it. Remember she doesn't come see her mother everyday so she does lack most knowledge regarding modern day issues and answers. Also avoid mentioning controversial topics simply because she doesn't understand english well. Don't do anything stupid don't lie cheat steal manipulate. Be honest respectful and responsible for actions. If she asked you questions regarding your faith tell her honestly even if she asks you something extremely offensive. Anyway be patient dont rush towards intimacy. If both parties are secure with themselves you will eventually progress naturally. Asking questions meant for us will prove ineffective they had a view in same manner in effect may cause problems for meastycanardie is provoking the latest experiment proves useful piece of junk
