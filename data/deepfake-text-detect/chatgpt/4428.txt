I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the list. When I saw it (about a year ago) and as many others have said here, it seemed like an average Ghibli film with little depth or emotion, It's not until now when I've watched several of their films back-to-back on VHS tapes at home. But they are all very different from one another! They seem to me to move at varying speeds - some slowdramatic bits mixed between action sequences which heighten tension more than any other genre would allow. My question is: how does Miyazaki manage all these elements without falling into cliche? Is there anything you could recommend I watch alongside them? A few weeks later I read The House of Strife by Aoyama Kyouhei who has done extensive research about Miyazaki's early life his influences during those years before he started his own studio. In my opinion he's definitely worth reading if only because we get an insight into Miyazaki's childhood his family background which may help explain how the man became such highly skilled animator. Also fascinating to see how much influence Western animation had on him (though sadly excluding Disney). For someone who wants to find something lengthy but lighter fare e.g., Tales From Earthsea (Porco Rosso), Rurouni Kenshin, Princess Mononoke etc... then perhaps check out Hayao Miyazaki the Movie Guide Encyclopedia Vol 1 - Vol 2? Although clearly written by Western fans rather than Japanese ones, it's still got lots of interesting facts. I think it also accompanies most DVD releases of those movies mentioned above plus features chapters dedicated to each of the 10 main characters' lives which explains why they were created the way they ended up being. There are also various interviews with voice actors taken from TV broadcasts, newspaper articles magazine articles posted online on certain pages within the site too. So far I haven't seen anyone mention this book, though looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it. All the best Japancakes! The following link should take you straight to the page containing the article: Hi Braidie, love that point re "Grave Of Fireflies" specifically - although personally i'd argue that Miyazki came of age after watching Grave Of Fireflies. Then again, I probably wouldn't put Marnie, Castle In The Sky or even Ponyo and Totoro in the same bracket as ROFF; maybe putting them amongst the Studio Ghibli classics instead of say Hero of Tea or Howl's Moving Castle... Anyway, thanks abunch, definately look forward to seeing how things go...; Cheers JH Asparagus wrote:I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in the list.

You're quite right about the fast pace, which makes sense given the subject matter. Although many people believe that Studio Ghibli consists solely of magical Nipponese fantasy (which is fair enough), and while I certainly agree that basically everything else falls under that heading, Spirited Away flatly refuses to do so. As it progresses, the film goes through almost every possible human reaction, occasionally flitting across the line between comedy and drama, culminating in its heartrending final scene. For the first time since...well.... possibly Porco Rosso (!), it feels surprisingly honest and real. Even though it's largely populated with cardboard cutouts, the emotions involved are genuine, flowing organically throughout the entire picture. There isn't really anything similar to Spirited Away in terms of plot structure, thought. It comes close to Chariots Of The Gods!, but overall lacks the longevity required to become so emotionally charged. That doesn't mean it was better, just less usual. If anything, Searchlights represents a good balance between lightness and serious substance. Though I don't remember feeling anywhere near so conflicted after finishing it as I did in comparing the movie to that panelist.8 9This study of the three members. Buttoast urnatervel of its
