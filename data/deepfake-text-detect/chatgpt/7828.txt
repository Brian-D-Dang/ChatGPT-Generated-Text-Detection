While the idea of posting armed guards in schools may seem like a feasible solution to curbing school violence, it could actually have the opposite effect. Research has shown that having visible security measures, such as armed guards, can create an atmosphere of fear and anxiety in students and exacerbate tensions that may lead to violence. Furthermore, the cost of hiring and training armed guards can be quite high, and this money may be better spent on implementing comprehensive programs that address the root causes of school violence, such as mental health support, conflict resolution programs, and building positive school climates. Additionally, it is important to consider the potential for armed guards to make mistakes, such as mistakenly seeing a threat where there is none, or using excessive force in dealing with a situation. This could result in serious harm to innocent students and staff. Rather than relying solely on quick-fix solutions like posting armed guards, we should take a more holistic and thoughtful approach to addressing school violence that involves input from a variety of stakeholders, including educators, mental health professionals, law enforcement, and students themselves.
