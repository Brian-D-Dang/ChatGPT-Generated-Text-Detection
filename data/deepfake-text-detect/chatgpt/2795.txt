I realise that this is a meme one itself nowadays, but as a black man I have absolutely no sympathy for any redditor who was on coontown. These people hate you and everything about you. You think they just suddenly developed hatred of minorities? They were treated like shit by the whites until recently and now we're doing it to them again. We've been experiencing colonialism for over 100 years yet all these white supremacists are popping out everywhere in the past few months and don't seem too concerned with racism against blacks or other minorities anymore except when its convenient. Edit: Just want some context
