View changed by a combination of the comments of uceleritas365 and uQwerkss: I guess we all understand numbers differently, but ultimately I think it really is lack of empathy more than anything. I also completely disagree with your original statement that "in general you would rather pay 1 for 100 lbs of oranges over 1 lb of apples" while perhaps true in some cases (e.g., if your household only eats apples), this overall sentiment could not be further from reality once applied to any other fruit or vegetable. There are many different types of vegetablesfruits that taste great raw at market rates (1 per pound) yet don't make sense cooked as part of a meal because they just aren't necessary calories-wise carrots, green beans, onions, lettuce, etc...
