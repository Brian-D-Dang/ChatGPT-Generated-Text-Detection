I'm not sure at what point people stopped thinking about the ramifications of their actions and became so head strong that they believed they were invincible, that officers judgements were always wrong, and that the rules did not apply to them. Perhaps it is a reflection of the larger societal issues we face, such as a lack of trust in authority or a sense of entitlement. Regardless of the underlying reasons, it is important for all individuals to recognize the impact of their actions and to respect the role of law enforcement in our communities. Rather than focusing on blame, we can work towards building greater mutual respect and understanding between law enforcement and civilians. As a helpful assistant, I can suggest resources and strategies for doing so.
