Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, or considering a mandatory minimum wage hike. This is a controversial topic. The first side, the side that wants to increase the minimum wage, says that it will help those who are underpaid, and that it will stimulate the economy because more people will have more money to spend. The second side, the side that wants to keep the minimum wage at a low level, says that it will hurt businesses, and that raising the minimum wage will drive away people who need jobs. Let's look at what's going on in Canada. In 2014, the minimum wage was 10.25 per hour, and it's now 11 per hour. Many people don't know this, but the minimum wage is not a government policy. It's set by businesses, and it's based on the cost of living. This means that it varies from province to province. There are two main arguments for a minimum wage. The first one is that it will reduce the income inequality in Canada, and the second one is that it will help those who are underpaid, and help the economy. Raising the minimum wage has been shown to reduce income inequality. For example, in 2010, the first minimum wage increase occurred in Ontario, and by 2015, the income inequality rate in that province had dropped by 17, and the poverty rate had dropped by 20. There is also the argument that raising the minimum wage will help those who are underpaid. For example, in 2017, it was shown that a minimum wage hike would help 50,000 low-income families in British Columbia. Also, in 2017, it was shown that a minimum wage increase would help 30,000 families in Ontario, which is why it was approved by the Ontario government. The second side of the argument is that raising the minimum wage will hurt businesses, and drive people away from looking for a job. For example, if a business has to pay its employees more money, then it will have to raise its prices, which means that people will have to spend more money. This will hurt businesses, and drive away people who need jobs. It's up to you to decide which side of the argument is right. Now, let's look at the situation in the USA. In 2014, the federal minimum wage was 7.25 per hour. In 2016, the federal minimum wage was increased to 7.25. There were several states and provinces that decided to increase the minimum wage above this, like California, which increased its minimum wage to 11 per hour in 2017, and will increase its minimum wage to 15 per hour by 2022. Raising the minimum wage has been shown to reduce poverty. For example, in 2014, the first minimum wage increase occurred in Ontario, and by 2015, the poverty rate had dropped by 20. Some people argue that raising the minimum wage will hurt businesses, and drive away people who need jobs. For example, if a business has to pay its employees more money, then it will have to raise its prices, which means that people will have to spend more money. This will hurt businesses, and drive away people who need jobs. The minimum wage is a topic that is quite controversial. It's up to you to decide which side of the argument is right. - How does a minimum wage increase help those who are underpaid? - How does a minimum wage increase help the economy? - Do you think that raising the minimum wage in Canada is a good idea? Why or why not? I think that the minimum wage is not a good idea because if they raise the minimum wage it will hurt the economy. The people that are working hard and having to live off of the minimum wage are not getting paid what they are worth. If you raise the minimum wage then they will just raise their prices so if you get paid minimum wage you won't be able to afford to eat and buy things. That's why I think that the minimum wage is not a good idea. I think that the minimum wage is not a good idea because it doesn't help anyone. I mean, raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour will help the people who work at
