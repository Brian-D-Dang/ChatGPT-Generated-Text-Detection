This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. This needs to be prefaced by saying... I am a HUGE believer in the power of music when it comes to healing. Some things are just more powerful than others....but what about how we listen? Is there anything wrong with listening to loud rock music while you're trying to heal yourself from something horrible; regardless of whether or not it's actually causing discomfort at all? Should you only use soft relaxing melodies as well? There have been loads of studies done on these topics - here's some links (and unfortunately you'll need to know something about psychology to understand what they mean): etc...etc...... Just like any other type of therapy I guess! It really depends on your personal preferences though:) But if we look back throughout history, isn't it obvious that certain types of music were always used for different purposes? In my opinion, classical would work best for relaxation and meditation whereas alternative songs could help raise energy levels quite nicely. And then it really does come down to preference after this point..... People who suffer from TS seem to also enjoy classic metal and heavy metal bands. Why do you think this is so? Do you personally prefer soothing sounds over uplifting ones? Or perhaps even heavier music that stimulates adrenaline rather than raises it...? Whatever the case may be, if someone wants to play the devil's advocate on this one, please comment below!:) Previously answered questions have already received their answers, so please don't ask them again:D Commenting seems to turn into another thread entirely anyway, which can get annoying..Anyway thank you everyone for reading through this long post!Hope you enjoyed it!! xxx Don't forget to click "Like" and follow us Twitter - Facebook - Instagram - Pinterest - YouTube - Twitch
