Most social progressives, love democracy, and so it is of relatively little surprise to me that as they have achieved a majority (in Reddit and the West), that they want people (and not just feet) in their shoes. It's interesting how some people on reddit are willing to stand up against those who don't want them or are too afraid to speak out because it will be more difficult for them to get appointed to positions with power than others, but then again this is all going on at the moment because they know politically that they've literally voted to keep us safe from the far left so they can justify their voting preferences by saying we're doing things they think won't benefit them.
