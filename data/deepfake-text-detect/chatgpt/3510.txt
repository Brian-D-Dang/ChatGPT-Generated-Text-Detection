Countries need children in order to sustain themselves, without a younger generation the country will not advance and will not be able to sustain itself. Elderly will not be able to work and support the economy, and there will not be enough people to maintain important infrastructure and services such as hospitals, schools, and emergency services. However, having too many children can also create issues such as overpopulation, strain on resources, and strain on the economy. Therefore, it is important for countries to find a balance in their population by encouraging responsible family planning, promoting education and women's rights, and providing support for families.
