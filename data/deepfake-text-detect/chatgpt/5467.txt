So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor race but the racial components are interchangeable? Not necessarily true. Many people think that Whites don't use race to further their own agendas which is why we have a lot of hatred towards whites even though there's plenty of evidence that they're racist themselves. They also believe that people who identify as white should be treated equally due to their ethnicity when it comes to economic issues.
