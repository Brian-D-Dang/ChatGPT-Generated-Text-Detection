Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news x] , [x] after delivering a speech in which she said that "for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of black boys running around with their pants hanging down and bags swinging from their necks is just normal." And when I heard this quote on TV, I was stunned. How could she say such thing? What kind of prejudice does it take to think like her regarding blacks?? Is there something wrong with how we are as human beings, or have they not read books at all? Or perhaps they are racist because of what they were taught by their parents?! These questions had been eating away me for days! So, today, I took out my time machine (a laptop) and went back to 1985!!! Imagine you're walking into a library and see a book titled: Race Relations in America Today...as you start reading through it, you get surprised to find yourself thinking about your own life while going through some really deep stuffs - things you've never thought before!! In the first chapter discussing race relations one can clearly see many stories written by white writers taking points against black folks, saying negative comments towards them and blaming every single ones' problems on the color of their skin! Quite frankly i'm ashamed to be an American citizen if'most Americanswhite people actually believe this way!!!! How would this even happened in our day??? We know better than being ignorant anymore; yet sadly this is still happening in America everyday, and very much alive these days. But here's the question for us - aren't we supposed to improve ourselves and make sure racism doesn't exist in this world? When will we learn? Surely, sooner or later...but so far, no progress whatsoever. If anything, everything seems like getting worse instead of improving. Just look at the number of black deaths in police brutality incidents....more than 10 times more than whites!!!! And who cares???? This is pretty disturbing! And why should we stop comparing apples oranges....when they both come from same fruit tree? Because now, due to several reasons, black men do crimes that go unreported....turning our lives upside down. Most videos are shown online without any commentaries attached on social media sites...yet Facebook ads sometimes seem to turn up shocking results too!!!! Black women too are also targeted by criminals, but hardly ever caught......while statistics show that only 5 percent of black girls reported rape to cops compared to 90 majority of white girls. Again, talking about black vs white crime rate....where the FBI says that "Black males commit violent crimes 49 higher than other races"!!!!! That's scary huh? Why can't we understand each others different perspectives and experiences? Maybe we don't care enough to study history properly and let it guide us? Could it be possible that we might not remember racial discrimination and segregation in schools until later stages of adulthood? Do we need to teach children right then? Frankly speaking, having lived most of my life during the 80's makes sense as to why younger generations are encountering racism issues nowadays.....no wonder teenage pregnancy rates grew significantly among African Americans in comparison to White teens already did. It started late 70's and throughout the next 30 years, everyone knows how bad it got until society became aware of illegal drugs problem. Nowadays kids are literally seeing how drug dealers or gangs operate, meaning that kids are selling themselves in exchange of money and using it for their own needs. Are we doing a good job teaching them differently when they grow older? They'll become adults soon....how are they coping with this issue? No words gotta tell it.....being raised by their families alone isn't always convenient, especially since their family members probably lack information concerning raising children. Anyways...i'd appreciate if someone could help point me out where can I correct myself rather than making excuses. Afterall, nobody likes hearing those comments coming from anyone directly under their nose. And yes, obviously, ignorance IS A choice....the one made by millions upon millions of people worldwide...who choose to ignore reality in favor of fairy tales and myths. I am not The One To blame. You cannot prevent someone from making dumb decisions based on nothing. Letting anger rule over common sense is NEVER EVER a wise decision. All the laws regulations in the world won't guarantee safety and security in public place. I guess that's why we call them government agencies. How ironic! Nowadays the trend of cyber bullying is quite popular amongst teenagers mostly. Many students end up losing valuable time surfing internet looking for ways to express themselves freely. However, ugly thoughts whether true or false remains unaltered forever. Some of them actually use threats and psychological torture to intimidate others....just like that matter of fact Timmy didn't lose his pocket knife yesterday but he lost almost half of his life......only because somebody threw him off the cliff and stabbed him 4 times leaving him seriously injured while staring at his mother crying hysterically with blood dripping everywhere.
