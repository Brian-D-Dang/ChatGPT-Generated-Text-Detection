While addiction can be a result of habitual behaviors, it is also a complex brain disease. Addiction significantly alters the brain's chemistry and functioning, leading to compulsive drug use despite negative consequences. In fact, addiction causes long-lasting changes in the brain, making it difficult for individuals to quit using drugs or alcohol. Additionally, addiction is recognized as a disease by leading medical organizations such as the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization. Therefore, reducing addiction to a mere habit ignores the extensive research and medical evidence that suggests otherwise.
