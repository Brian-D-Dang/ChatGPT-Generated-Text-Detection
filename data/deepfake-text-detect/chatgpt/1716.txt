This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point in this post was simply to address some of those - and related "logic from hell" types which bring up examples like Hitler being an atheist as proof that no one can ever be truly evil because they could never act on their beliefs so therefore faith cannot result in evil (which has been all over the news lately). But I will say there's nothing wrong with thinking critically about any religion even Christianity just don't go around saying it's morally superior to any other ideology and try not to poison people's minds against reason by using fallacious reasoning to make your case.
