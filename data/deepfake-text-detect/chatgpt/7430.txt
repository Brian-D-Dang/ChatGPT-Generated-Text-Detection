While it is true that individuals who identify as transgender may experience gender dysphoria, which is recognized as a mental health condition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), it is not accurate to label being transgender as a mental illness. The discomfort or distress caused by gender dysphoria can be alleviated by gender-affirming medical treatments such as hormone therapy or surgery, which are recognized as effective and necessary by medical experts. Calling transgender identity a mental illness perpetuates harmful stigmas surrounding mental health, and may discourage individuals from seeking necessary medical care. It is important to support and affirm individuals in their gender identities, regardless of medical interventions they may choose to pursue.
