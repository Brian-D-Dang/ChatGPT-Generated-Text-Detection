Crossposted from a comment on rskeptic I've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of bad writing happening in these arguments. I am sure we would all love for them not to be so - but this post will simply deal with one particular aspect: argumentation style... Toni Morrison once said "The function ... [of art] is not to provide answers; its purpose is to raise questions." And what better way to do just that than through criticism? But while neither nobody has an obligation to have their work critiqued or to engage critically (which can feel like criticizing), if people are going to criticize they should know how properly critique something. This blog entry though was written as much out of amusement at seeing such poor thought processes employed by those who don't seem to fully understand the complexity behind many philosophical concepts nor really even try to get close. Since my time was limited when trying to write about this topic, I decided instead to give examples where someone's use of logic seemed flawed b c maybe others might find themselves thinking the same thing after reading my response to their statements despite attempting to disprove or disagree. A good introduction into philosophy isn't any old textbook you're probably familiar with since books aren't always great sources of knowledge and learning because textbooks tend to only take simple ideas and simplify them without engaging us intellectually into why things may actually be more difficult then first meets the eye.... The Fallacy Formulation There is no doubt that anyone could Google up exactly which fallacy Mr. Jacobsen used here but using deductive reasoning alone means nothing w o context of associated premises. This formulation however leaves several holes open to interpretation depending upon your own understanding of definitions thus rendering his statement itself dubious. To begin, he begins stating 2 separate fallacies yet seemingly never states 1 3 simultaneously anywhere within that paragraph given how closely related each one appears to him. He immediately assumes premise 1 based solely off of associating himself with Christians despite being raised Buddhist himself implying therefore God created religion assuming humans originally had none..... That makes little sense unless you ignore everything else known about human history including evidence provided BY HUMANS IN THE PAST explaining otherwise....... Then again religious texts were the FIRST ever writings to present anything other than tribal superstition due TO THESE PREMISES...... he concludes incorrectly i suppose. His next logical leap is incorrect also due in part perhaps to ignorance regarding what the word 'know' signifies specifically when discussing epistemology......... Knowledge cannot necessarily mean 100 certainty in science either.......... And lastly, using this type of faulty deduction leads to conclusions thPosted by
