I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small townvillage, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too vast between city life, rural areas and urban sprawl for me to think they can all be compared with eachother or deserving of any kind of respect from one another. This is an interesting point which will probably get downvoted by people who live remotely as if everyone's tastes have to match their own. There isn't much "culture" where I live (very little artmusic scene outside my home) but there's plenty going on that has nothing at all to do with being housebound. It just depends what appeals to you and whether your lifestyle requires getting out into nature regularly etc
