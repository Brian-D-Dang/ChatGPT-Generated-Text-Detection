First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are wasted on keeping them alive when it would be better spent elsewhere. But doesn't the fact that there's a "natural" killer mean humans can " t do anything to stop its extinction? That seems very sad for such an intelligent animal.
