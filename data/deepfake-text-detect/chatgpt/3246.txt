People talk about'natural' or'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like "free speech" or "free association" are'inalienable','natural', or'God-given', how come so many people don't have access to them? That is a valid question. In theory, all individuals should have equal access to the rights that are considered inalienable, natural, or God-given. However, in reality, some people may face barriers to accessing these rights due to various factors such as socio-economic status, historical oppression, or discrimination. This is why it is important to advocate for and uphold these rights, and work towards creating a more equitable society where everyone has equal access to them. Ultimately, the concept of natural, inalienable, or God-given rights is a philosophical concept that has been debated by scholars for centuries, but what matters is how society and its laws recognize and protect these rights for everyone.
