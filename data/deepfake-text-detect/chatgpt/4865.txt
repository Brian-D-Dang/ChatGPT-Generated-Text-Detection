While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously "earning" the respect of less experienced and established people boring. I'm sure their intentions are good, but it seems like they only really care about how much work you have done for them in order to give out your certificate or award, which is fine if it's a couple years ago, but when someone's been working on something for more than half a decade... this just feels flat-out disrespectful to me. Surely there must be some way for these folk to say: "Well, our industry is changing so fast right now; we think your project really demonstrates great progress towards what it takes to prepare graduates for modern software development across all platforms and technologies..." without implying that anyone else isn't as advanced which sounds very hasty and patronising. So my question is: What would be an acceptable response from somebody who doesn't want to go down that route? It can even be phrased neutrally It seems like you have lots of experience with X etc.. But ultimately, I'd rather they didn't try at all! (Also note that I am not asking whether my own personal attitude should change, nor do I wish to suggest that anybody has acted disrespectfully (or indeed any differently) in terms of ageism.) Many thanks:) A: You shouldn't feel entitled to accolades based on title alone. You may look young and inexperienced compared to others, but the fact remains that "being old" does not entitle you to recognition over newer folks. Respect still needs earned by being a diligent worker regardless of the company's feelings toward your maturity level. Your efforts will speak louder than anything written anywhere. The best thing you could possibly do next time your supervisorcoach says 'What have you accomplished lately' is simply respond 'Since last week I worked diligently on this assignment until late at night every day while also spending quality time with family and friends outside of schoolwork. As such, I was able to complete the entire 10 page research paper ahead of schedule and with clear evidence supporting its validity. Additionally, I'm proud of myself for continuing to cultivate reading habits beyond merely consuming media content. After I finish writing up my results from today's test tomorrow morning, I plan on using Google Scholar to search for additional sources relating to the topic. Lastly, since I finished early tonight, I decided to participate in a Sunday Bible study with some relatives instead of going out drinking. In doing so, I was able to learn valuable lessons that were previously undiscovered within the pages of scripture and practice faithfulness in implementing sound methods for dealing with stress.'
