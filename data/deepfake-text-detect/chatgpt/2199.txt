Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view I hold. My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any one or all in your rebuttal: 1) The existence of the internet mitigates network effects (a key part of monopolies), because people now have more options for communicating without having to rely on main stream media controlled by large bureaucracies. As communication tools become cheaper they will be adopted far faster than before due to their ability to allow decentralization which allows new communities free from traditional power structures to form rapidly at little cost. This also means that mainstream corporations are less able to control information flow within these groups - such as what news services someone uses etc... Information spreads quickly online allowing alternative views opinions to enter into our collective subconsciousness making it harder over time to keep these ideas out of peoples heads through censorship alone. In fact this already appears to be happening with google trends showing 'vaccine safety' searches rising while pro-vaxxer ones fall off since 2015[0].

And the implications could lead us down some very dark paths if we don't find ways to continue supporting journalism and critical thinking skills along side modern technological gains like AI, Blockchain et al. But ultimately my belief stems back to the idea that the spread of knowledge helps shape reality itself in addition to shaping the minds of those who seek truth. If governments want to censor info then there are always other avenues available even when that avenue has been shuttered entirely. With enough free thinkers anything is possible!;
