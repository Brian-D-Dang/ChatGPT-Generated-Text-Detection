So, I'm confused about this whole, "appropriation of white supremacy" and "reverse racism" not existing thing. From what I understand: ethnic minorities cannot discriminate because of their skin color andor culture, but whites can (and do) discriminate against minorities just for being a minority? Can anyone clarify that? Does the fact that one is discriminated against becuase of his or her race mean heshe has been appropriated by whites and thus implicitly endorsedendorsed by them as well? If it does, doesn't that then imply that if an oppressor group acquires status through racist practices, they are thereby rendered oppressive? And what would be a more appropriate term than reverse discrimination to describe someone who gains power from oppression while simultaneously oppressing others in order to maintain said authority? Also, how big is the difference between reverse discrimination (is it ever used?) vs. appropriation of whiteness? Is there any real difference between these two things at all? Because you know, when I google both words together I get mostly results pertaining to affirmative action - which seems like another very different concept. Can we talk about this please? Thanks! P.S. This question was inspired by receiving a comment on my last post regarding terminology Thanks again everyone! A: To start off with, let's clear up some confusion over terms. You will find lots of people using "white privilege" broadly, but pretty much noone uses "whitewashing." The broader usage refers to advantages accruing to members of historically dominant groups, such as women, LGBTs, blacks, etc. The other part is that yes, the word "privilege" implies something that isn't fairly balanced out by disadvantages; that is why you hear so many complaints about "panicked," "over-reactionary" and similar claims made against its use. It can also lead too easily into overly generalised thinking, e.g. saying that women have privileges because men aren't allowed to say certain things. That may seem logical, but it misses the point of actual female empowerment - amongst other reasons, because gender roles don't exist outside human imagination. It also leads to conclusions that are hard to support empirically, e.g.: most of us never spent time with our families dressed only in blackface... As far as whether people can accept criticism without accusing them of stealing ideas, maybe try imagining yourself as a future archeologist discovering evidence of slavery. Would you consider them guilty of theft for pointing out where it happened?
