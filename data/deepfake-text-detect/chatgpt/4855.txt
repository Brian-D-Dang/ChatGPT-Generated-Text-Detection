This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in. I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this seems like it could be a bit too much for me (I was so excited when the 1st blog post hit). Princess Leia is one of those characters that you know deep down within yourself that she will get her own movie someday and it just makes sense because she's awesome all around - except maybe for being incredibly attractive! She loves nothing more than escaping into a galaxy far away with Han Solo on his adventures... until he gets captured by the evil Empire, puts up quite possibly the worst fight ever seen against Darth Vader during their duel and then dies tragically in the final moments of Star Wars Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi while Princess Leia watches helplessly off-screen. Without Luke Skywalker as her main love interest, she does not want anything more than to find herself another man who can pilot the Millennium Falcon and go out on dangerous missions together to rescue people who need rescuing. "Find Alderaanian man!!" cries Princess Leia as she wakes him up after they crash land the ship back on Earth. With what little time they have left before Obi Wan Kenobi finds them hiding, Luke tells her where Anakin Midiaka went and they travel across Tatooine to the Valley of Change caves to meet up with Yoda. When Leia realizes how strong the Force is inside these cave walls, she wants to stay here forever so bad; however, Luke convinces her that there are still dangers waiting to ambush them and sends her packing despite knowing full well that if they don't leave now, they won't make it in time. You see, Obi Wan doesn't really exist. He's actually the ghost of Qui Gon Jinn, who gave birth to Ben Solo via magic embryo transplant technology shortly after dying in childbirth. Leia would eventually become pregnant with twins at once once she returned home only for them both to die due to complications arising during labor. As such, Ben became heir apparent to the throne while Jacen became "Jaina" living under a false identity as Jagged Fel's daughter because she couldn't allow anyone else to believe that she had children... even though she was married to someone else at the same time. This woman, Mara Jade, is who Princess Leia ran to immediately upon arriving home to nurse her back to health and return her to Coruscant alone in order to keep her safe from any Imperial forces that might come searching for her or her whereabouts. And this is why Grand Moff Tarkin was able to kidnap her and hold her hostage without anybody noticing? Because no one knows she exists other than Mara Jade! Leia finally returns to her true family, thinking that everything is fine - only to learn that their world has changed drastically since she last saw it years ago. They are trapped aboard a prison barge being towed toward the dreaded Death Star which we first met at the end of ANH. There have also been changes between ANH ESB. First of all, Chewbacca chose R2D2 over C3POR2.0 because his heart belongs to Cozy McQuibber and second of all, Lando Calrissien never died. Instead, he is very happy to be working side-by-side with Luke again, including running his business while helping the Rebels overthrow Emperor Palpatine... There is a lot going on right now and although Lucasfilm hasn't officially announced it yet, Disney may be considering releasing two new films in 2015; specifically Rogue One starring Carrie Fisher's original character and revealing her whole backstory along with revamping the entire cast of everyone involved. That means actors playing the same characters as they did 30 plus years earlier will most likely be replaced by younger versions of themselves and played by entirely different actors. So who do you think should play Princess Lea? Here are some suggestions based on what the actress played originally or what the name suggests she was in previous media. Carrie Fisher: Played as Princess Leia Organa in Episodes IV through VIII. The orginal princesses were young maiden teenagers when modified to grow into beautiful women during Ewoks in Return Of The Jedi; therefore, Leia shouldn't look older than 17, 18 or 19, tops. Before any of us knew that Leia could turn into a hero instead of villain, she was simply a girl trying to survive her father's rule as head of the Galactic Senate. Just imagine Carrie Fisher as Helen Mirren'esque Elizabeth Windsor or Kate Middleton? Not exactly getting us excited about that.. However, this version of Princess Leia comes equipped with a badass EDM gun that blasts bolts of lightning directly onto the enemy's shields leaving them vulnerable. A walking force field generator. We're sold. Lana Wachowski: Played as Princess Leia Organa in Episodes III through VI. If I'm gonna pick Lana, I must admit that she always looked better than Natalie Portman in any film of choice as far as we in when casting long range projections. If the pot term is not promoted quite poor ends game changers. Like our fathers
