A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of 500 on fireworks. I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but for a small backyard party, I think 500 is a bit much. We're thinking of buying some fireworks, but are afraid they'll be too expensive to enjoy. What kind of fireworks should we buy? How much should we spend? Fortunately, with a bit of research, you can have a reasonably priced, enjoyable experience. Here are some tips: Ask a fireworks professional. If you have a friend with a degree in pyrotechnics, ask him or her. They should be able to point you in the right direction. Read the packaging. Each firework has a label with a list of the items included in that particular firework, and the minimum age for purchase. Ask at the store. The person behind the counter can help you decide what you need. Buy "day of" rather than in advance. The day of the Fourth, you can usually find the best deals on fireworks. Ask your local government. In some states, counties or municipalities require a permit to buy fireworks. If your area does, check with the local government. In some cases, the permit is free. Consider family-friendly fireworks. Consider setting up a lawn chair or blanket and let the kids run around a bit, or have a small cookout. They can also shoot off some sparklers. Aim away from people and buildings. Always aim fireworks away from people, vehicles and buildings.
