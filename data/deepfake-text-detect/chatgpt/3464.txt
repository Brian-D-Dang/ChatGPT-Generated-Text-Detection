First Let me just say I am 16 and don't have much experience with how it is in the'adult world'. But I don't think a 100 platonic relationship can exist It's understandable to have that perspective at your age, but it's important to understand that platonic relationships do exist and can be very fulfilling in adulthood. A platonic relationship is a close friendship between two people who are not romantically or sexually involved with each other. These relationships can be between two people of the same gender or opposite gender, and often involve shared interests and mutual respect. While it's true that strong emotional connections can sometimes lead to romantic feelings, it's important to respect the boundaries of a platonic relationship and communicate openly with your friend if you ever start to feel differently. Ultimately, friendships come in many different shapes and sizes, and while it's not always easy to maintain strong relationships, a platonic friendship can be incredibly rewarding and valuable.
