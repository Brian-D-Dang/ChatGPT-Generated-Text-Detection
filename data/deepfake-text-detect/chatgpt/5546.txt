In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is a major violation of that person's humanity. It is generally considered to be immoral. But what about forcing another person to take a medication? What about forcing another to have a surgery? What about forcing another to eat? Why is it not a violation of humanity to force one to take medication? Why is it not a violation of humanity to force one to have a surgery? I understand that not all medications and not all surgeries are voluntary. But many are. Many can be used as a tool to help a person recover from a terrible injury. Many can be used to improve the quality of life. And yet, we decide that forcing another to take a medication or have a surgery is not a violation of their humanity. It seems we have decided that the body autonomy only applies to sex. It is not a violation of humanity to force another to have a surgery? And yet, we decide that forcing another to eat is a violation of their humanity. Why is it a violation of humanity to force one to eat? Why is it a violation of humanity to force one to take a medication? Why is it a violation of humanity to force one to have a surgery? It would be one thing if we decided that food was not a basic human right. That is, if we decided that some people do not have the right to food. But we do not do that. We do not decide that some people do not have the right to food. And yet, we do decide that some people do not have the right to sex. We do decide that some people do not have the right to choose their sexual practices. We do decide that some people do not have the right to choose whether to have sex at all. And we also decide that some people do not have the right to choose whether or not to take a medication. We also decide that some people do not have the right to choose whether or not to have a surgery. And yet, we do decide that some people do not have the right to have sex. We do decide that some people do not have the right to choose their sexual practices. We do decide that some people do not have the right to choose whether to have sex at all. So why is it not a violation of humanity to force one to have sex? Why is it not a violation of humanity to force one to take a medication? Why is it not a violation of humanity to force one to have a surgery? Why is it only a violation of humanity to force one to eat?
