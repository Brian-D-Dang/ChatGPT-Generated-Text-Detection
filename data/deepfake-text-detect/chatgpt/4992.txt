While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems. I believe that such a thing should be impossible! The only way we can guarantee peace and happiness is by being so patient as to not try to take advantage of others who are unable to move beyond their own nature." Now he estimates that the world's largest charity organization will need 200 million dollars more than they have already spent on their projects over the past three years in order to survive - money they sent in money to pay for their rescue missions around the globe from the beginning. "The average charity donor pays 25 per donation," he explained. "But the only cost saved significantly decreases when the project costs far exceed the total amount raised each year!" By hiring volunteers, Grant said, "Our mission statement was designed based upon the vision of giving back to the people affected most deeply: those adversely impacted during the pandemic due to COVID-19 lockdowns caused by coronavirus disease 2019 technology shifts caused by a lack of access to healthcare workers helping people living paycheck to paycheck because they couldn't afford insurance coverage under the existing programs like Medicaid. However, this work has been partially funded by donations from businesses donating time away from their usual duties; businesses donating their salaries while keeping their employees' livelihoods afloat versus employees working every day doing nothing at all. This involves funding grants, volunteerism efforts involving volunteers which include doctors volunteering together since they're paid full wages (including overtime) disabled veterans serving overseas deployments abroad, working alongside doctors evaluating patients suffering chronic illnesses including cancer, maintaining an emergency fund providing medical supplies donated directly from businesses participating in the organization's relief effort, producing training courses available online via virtual platforms where students gain valuable experience learning how best to support more local communities rather than just earning profit out of their daily lives, utilizing social media tools such as Facebook Live and Skype meetings, and setting up a website featuring information about how the nonprofit organizations benefit society globally using a variety of resources including technology such as Zoom conferences meeting rooms, virtual fundraising events hosted by Grant's own company Share Your Passion virtual event venues set up by mutual funds and nonprofits, and live streaming video conferencing services such as Zoom Conversation Rooms, Zoom group chats, webinars and social networking channels that support the organization's mission statements. Grant also helped administer grants throughout 2020 and oversaw the construction of a new facility dedicated solely towards disaster relief assistance operations across the country. The grant program continues today thanks to the generosity of donors supporting Grant teams worldwide both large and small and individuals alike benefitting from Grant packages ranging from 25 percent off the typical donation size to 100 per person to 12 percent off the normal donation rate. Each week Grant partners with organizations supporting disaster victims families including organizations including Charity Navigator, Samaritan's Purse, United Way and Gaia Foundation to provide free meals to help children impacted by disasters in Tanzania and Uganda during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as child protection agencies on behalf of the World Food Program. Additionally, Grant hosts events including fundraising dinners presented virtually by Grant team members and the Impact Fund and gives back to those in need resulting in support for nonprofits engaged in humanitarian aid initiatives nationwide.
