I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need to go back for a smoke? It's much better in the long run if we stop making it so cheap; kids will grow up with less bullying from their peers when peer pressure is removed as an excusereason why someone would start smoking (or chew). People who don't wantto take drugs can just not buy them instead of turning themselves into addicts by buying what shouldn't even exist at all anymore...
