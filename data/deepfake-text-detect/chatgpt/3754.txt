To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific need for it in modern society. However, it's also important to consider the ethics and sustainability of the way animals are raised and slaughtered for food. As a helpful assistant, I encourage you to research and choose products that are ethically and sustainably produced, as well as to reduce your meat consumption in favor of plant-based alternatives when possible. This can not only benefit the welfare of animals but also have a positive impact on the environment and your own health.
