While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to be the president. Period. I think there is something wrong in your statement that he doesn't have what it takes to run. He wants to do so just like Trump does too but I don't see how anyone can reach this conclusion from the interviews and videos he has done.
