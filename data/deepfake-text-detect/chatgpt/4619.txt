Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a short war in which we lost: we went into it with great intelligence about what they could do to us long term (and lo and beholdthey did everything that we thought) but just couldn't win. We had soldiers who were not prepared for combat because they hadn't been trained prior to deployment, and men on every level refused to participate or even carry out their duty as enlisted soldiers. The whole thing was an absolute failure from start-to-finish. Now Iraq? The American forces are outnumbered by insurgents (about 2.5 million), Iraqis hate them, most Americans don't care too much, the nation hasn't gained anything since we started there, and if you think things aren't going to get worse when power transfers to new hands then you're wrong; look at how well things have gone so far! Our troops are being killed by friendly fire more than ever before in history, including our own navy sailors (and those unfortunate souls still trapped inside Fallujah). Now, I ask this question seriously: why are we occupying another country's land at all, especially when neither they nor ourselves want us here? They can go straight to hell if they feel like it, despite claims otherwise. A few years ago, President Bush announced he would send ground troops to invade Afghanistan if necessary; now Congress has ruled against funding any such plan, meaning he will be unable to follow through on his promise. But hey, let's continue down that road...why? And please tell your fellow military members not to kill civilians, okay? There really isn't anyone left over there, anyways....There are no major battles on the horizon to prevent nuclear proliferation or terrorism for that matter either..yeah, right, like America cares whether Iran gets nukes or not once we leave Iraq. Oh wait, Russia already has one in violation of UN Security Council resolutions, and you never see anyone talk about that again, huh? No wonder everybody hates us...I guess my point is, it seems almost impossible for us to lose a war, no matter what happens, as long as someone else picks up the tab. It's kind of amazing. I mean, we stopped raining bombs down on Germany during World War Two and yet they still managed to use gas and other methods to defeat us; what makes us believe that a couple hundred thousand U.S. troops would stop the Iraqi Army dead in its tracks should they decide to fight back? What happened to "freedom fighters victorious" after 911? Are freedom fighters only supposed to help themselves and show others around them how righteous their cause is? Did God decide to give the Middle East to us for free after making sure there wasn't enough oil to last anyway? Personally, I've always believed that the reason for starting these sorts of wars is way beyond simple greed - maybe something along the lines of getting annoyed at everyone else having all the good stuff without paying for it - but whatever the case may be, it doesn't seem like we learn very quickly. So when is enough known? How long does it take before somebody knows they shouldn't shoot first anymore? Is it for real? Or just part of some grand conspiracy where people try to make money off of war games? Don't answer that question. Instead, just listen to yourself: something tells me Uncle Sam won't change his ways anytime soon. By the time we finish fighting each other though (if we ever do), nobody will remember our name anymore. "You fucking idiot!" -Jeannie
