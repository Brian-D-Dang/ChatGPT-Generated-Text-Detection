I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends . For instance, I just bought some beans and roasted them yesterday. They are fantastic! Right now they smell great and feel good in your hand when you pick it up off of the roaster tray. But after an hour or two their aromas have disappeared. My question is: Am I doing something wrong? Should I wait longer before drinking it just because I can't appreciate right away how delicious it smells? Or should I judge a bean's quality based on what it smells immediately after being roasted? Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Oct 21st 2011, 04:22 AM SaraB Re: Help with roast times... Quote: Originally Posted by bobbyscotland;; It all depends on who you ask.

He has very thin walls which helps somewhat not sure exactly what kind of machine he uses....we've been tempted to go talk to him about his setup one time though D Coffee wise, we always make iced americanos as well as regular decaf type stuff. Yes, you'll lose most of the aroma fairly quickly especially considering the size of your batch, however, there are ways around this too such as keeping the beans warm until brewing or cold brew methods such as french press. If you do decide to keep the whole thing hot simply stir occasionally and add more water each time..you don't want it boiling. We generally prefer Americanos over cappuccinos although both taste delicious here if thats your preference. Espresso drinks tend to be less popular with people domestically than world travelers which is sorta why I think its important to get into practice if you haven't yet. There are boutique stores everywhere these days specializing in espressos and caffees.....no shame in one of those people. On average ours takes at least 40 minutes from start to finish depending on consistency factor etc., but again, no standardization process exists unless you choose to take part in one of the online ones. You might also consider trying out different types of coffee. Less common varieties will often give better results because of higher acidity levels, high percentage fiber content, lower caffeine content among other things. Also look see where your favorite restaurants buy theirs vs the places close to home in case there's any difference in flavor profiles. Some beans are especially acidic and others aren't necessarily sweet tasting but sometimes even just subtle differences can make a big impact. Hope this helps:D thanks for the information Sara as usual:) Oct 22nd 2011, 02:40 PM bobbyj007 Re: Help with roast times... Ok - sounds similar to what I'm looking for. Thanks guys I am concerned though with the notion of waiting weeks to drink isn't that going to result in stale coffee? In addition, wouldn't fresh ground coffee taste way worse than freshly roasted? Is the idea then to store roasted beans long term? Thanks!! Oct 28th 2011, 11:45 AM quagmirelgator Re: Roast Times... Are you referring to "roasted" beans or dried?? Obviously aging does change the flavors of coffee but I know dry beans last quite awhile provided humidity stays low. And yes, I was thinking about storing the beans long term. Of course, I'd probably put them in zip locks since air circulation is limited. My concern is that such storage conditions may dull the flavor aroma of the beans. Will not water bath help preserve them? From what I read, that seems counter productive given that water bathes destroy the natural oils developed during fermentation? The only time I ever stretch the shelf life of beans while roasting is sifting powdered sugar onto them prior to packaging in order to prevent drying out due to heat damage caused by filters. So far, the best guide I've found regarding coffeemaking retention of coffee oil are various posts on CoffeeGeek.com. A few threads there talk about using talc powder or wax paper wrapped packets of ground coffee. One recommended wrapping 2 lbs. of roasted coarsely ground beans in aluminum foil and putting them back in the freezer. Presumably excess moisture would evaporate through the packet. You could try it yourself if you wanted to experiment. Just wrap a pound of ground coffee tightly in some parchment paper and stick it in an ice chest inside a black garbage bag. Make sure the bag is sealed pretty tight and check every couple hours. It might work!
