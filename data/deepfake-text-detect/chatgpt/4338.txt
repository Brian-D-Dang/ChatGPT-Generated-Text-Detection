I believe this comic expresses the argument most cogently: Now, to my wall of text: I run a small software company that's reasonably successful. I've been doing this for the past 10 years and have never considered leaving because some new marketing concept has come along and made me more money than all those other jobs combined. This is an excellent point and it seems like a lot of people would be tempted by anything that came along with the "brand name" attached they were still left wanting when in reality I think you find very few people use their brand name for any real purpose. You can't trust your own instincts or strategic thinking if every day something else comes up which will make you richer. What are you trying to accomplish? You're not even sure what you expect to happen! What do you really want out of life? That about sums it up right there.
