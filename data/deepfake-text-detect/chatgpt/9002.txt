I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still think it is utterly inappropriate to interrupt a presidential candidate's remarks so close to the election and then go on devastatingly negative attacks about his opponent's race after they are first registered as candidates. Given these issues, my opinion was not supported by other political commentators or even the president himself. In fact, I found this position particularly distressing and uncomfortable for me. It seems absurd to me that certain leaders within the Republican Party would use such racist language towards the minority community from someone who has little or no racial equity. In any case, Trump supporters have been using such language against themselves all along. They cannot possibly be serious when they attack a Black person because they do not know how to handle racism like it has existed since its inception. Presidential campaigns speak in terms of unity rather than solidarity among major parties. It means their message will resonate more strongly with their target audience - even if they might call out their opponents based on their affiliation. This is why the country should have two governing administrations: one where everyone understands what each party stands for, and the other where every single voter feels comfortable engaging in politics together. What Diaspora Americans Need To Understand About Just How Racism Drives They Vote Trump supporter Josh Barnett, director of programs at the Family Research Council Center for American Progress, said he was surprised by the level of support Trump generated during the 2016 campaign. "He had over 40 percent of Americans saying we need him now - which is great, but not what our team in the White House expected given the way President Clinton took the microphone last night," he told me. But he added, "Their enthusiasm for Trump may be limited, but their willingness to put forward ideas about how we can make America better makes them uniquely qualified to be leading this field. This looks very good." Barnett worries however. He believes it's time to look outside the box to find solutions. Over the past few months, voters have become more concerned about the future of our nation, especially under Donald Trump. This is a pivotal moment for a party with the worst record in front of them, and him and Bill O'Reilly have spent the majority of their time advocating against candidate-specific policies. To make matters worse, many of those voting for Trump have been members of a white supremacist group called The Proud Boys. Of course, while Republicans are eager for Trump to win back the presidency, they also want to hold onto power. If Democrats refuse to take control of both houses of Congress, there could be very real repercussions for Donald Trump and the GOP, too.
