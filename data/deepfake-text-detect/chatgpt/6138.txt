CMV: ISIS isn't about the US, it isn't about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isn't about us, and to think it is is a denial of reality. The Islamic world is a giant Islamic world, not a series of fiefdoms. The whole world is in a global financial mess. And the best plan is to ignore it, as if it's a local problem, like those crazy Republicans want. I doubt the situation is as clear-cut as we'd like it to be. This isn't like a military battle or a political election. A lot of things are going on. And a lot of things are going on behind the scenes. And the rest of the world isn't as naive as you would like to think they are. The rest of the world isn't as naive as you would like to think they are. I'm saying we should ignore the mess. I'm saying we should ignore the mess. We have had 45 years of mistakes by the United States in trying to fix the problems in the Islamic world. We should stop trying to fix it, and try to avoid the consequences of those mistakes. And I'm saying that we shouldn't think the Islamic world is going to take our advice, any more than the rest of the world. And I'm saying that we shouldn't think the Islamic world is going to take our advice, any more than the rest of the world. Those countries want to control their own destinies, and they want the US out of the picture. We should keep quiet about this mess. I agree with you. We should keep quiet about the mess, and we should pay attention to the mess. Yeah, it's funny, when I was young, the government was going to help you get a job. That was the slogan. Now, the government is supposed to fix the problems in the Islamic world. I agree with you. We should keep quiet about the mess, and we should pay attention to the mess. And we should keep quiet about the mess in the Islamic world, and we should pay attention to the mess in the Islamic world. And we should keep quiet about the mess in the Islamic world, and we should pay attention to the mess in the Islamic world. The way things are going, our government will be in the Islamic world fixing things for decades. The way things are going, our government will be in the Islamic world fixing things for decades. And we will be in debt for decades. And we will be in debt for decades.
