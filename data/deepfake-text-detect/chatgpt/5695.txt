I am a husband and father of two. I love my wife, and I love my children, but I am not a fan of Father's Day. I feel the "holiday," as it is called, is a marketing scheme by greeting card companies to get more sales. I'm not trying to diminish the role that fathers play in their children's lives. If you are a dad, be a good dad. If you are a mom, be a good mom. If you are a grandparent, be a good grandparent. If you are a mother-in-law, be a good mother-in-law. And if you are a child, be a good child. All of those things go without saying. But Father's Day seems like a day for everyone to tell their dads how important they are. To the businesses that promote the day, it's a day for them to make money. So, I want to tell you how much I appreciate my dad. He's a wonderful man. He's loving and kind, compassionate and strong, selfless and giving. He has a great sense of humor and he's a wonderful storyteller. He's a good listener and he's a wonderful husband and father. He has always taught me to be honest, respectful and to be humble. He's always taught me that hard work pays off. He's taught me that being a good person is more important than anything else. He's taught me to be a man of faith. He's taught me by example and, frankly, I could go on and on. I think he's pretty awesome, but I hope my wife and kids do too. I'm just thankful to have him as a father. I'm thankful to have a dad at all. I know a lot of kids who grew up without fathers. Some of those kids became adults and, sadly, some of them turned to crime and caused some of the world's problems. I'm sure there are a lot of kids who grew up in broken homes or with abusive parents. I'm thankful to have had a good dad. I'm not sure how much more I can say. Happy Father's Day to all the dads out there. And just remember, it's not a marketing scheme.
