I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately. I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural. If there is such an entity, then why are some people evil? Why do they commit the most hideous crimes imaginable and leave behind indescribable suffering for their victims? Is God really all powerful and would he allow people that choose to be born into sin be eternally separated from him by our own selfishness (the devil)? If we were able to peer into someone's mind, what type of person would you see? Would you think one was good or evil? Could you foresee which path hisher life would take based on the decisions made at birth? How long did you imagine those thoughts existed in your head before realising them consciously as words? And if so, how much time passes between each conscious realization until the next decision is contemplated? Assuming true believers, perhaps a different answer can be provided; considering the question "where does morality come from?" I believe that primitive man had free will to make moral choices due to the lack of social conditioning. However, at the same time, society exists via these morals and actions. Without rules enforced through government authority, chaos ensues. Therefore, if humans truly had free will, could we say that the need for government and laws (which enforce said values) arises? If the answer is yes, then who created society? Is society merely living proof that its creator has abdicated responsibility for creating his creation properly? It seems impossible to me to assume that humans without societal influence evolve naturally towards anything concrete... Not unless evolution developed in tandem with human behaviour, forcing us along two paths simultaneously: forward progress vs. regression. Perhaps both occur simultaneously, simply because we're all stuck together now instead of being isolated entities roaming around at random. Regardless, morality is only something given to us by others (society). We cannot claim to know whether everyone else agrees with our values, nor should anyone expect us to agree with theirs. There will always be odd outliers here and there - some peckerheads who'll seek out ways to hurt themselves, others who never cared about hurting anyone else first off. Wherever we place our limits within mankind may differ, since none of us actually agree on where said boundaries lie. The simple fact that we disagree means that our faculties aren't shared amongst every single individual. Anyway, the point is this: No matter how useless we feel we might be to society, we still strive for survival. Society itself provides the very procedure necessary to survive for everyone. Survival doesn't necessarily require acting upon specific ideologies, theories, or even religions. For example, during wartime, many people foolishly follow whatever political party holds power for reasons pertaining more to politics than religion. Yet, the result of war serves both parties better than either individually could accomplish alone. In my opinion, belief systems serve little purpose aside from what religious beliefs offer - immortality. Since no one knows beyond what we've seen, the afterlife becomes another thing - another realm we hear stories about, yet haven't touched ourselves. Seeing the world differently gives context to what happens elsewhere. Reaching further away from what we already know makes sense logically, although admittedly, questions arise, like "what happened thousands of years ago?" Is violence ever justified? Can you honestly conclude that non-violence does nothing but help the aggressor? Do Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, etc., worship false gods? Does the concept of the Bible apply outside of Christianity? What if Jehovah suddenly died tomorrow? Who gets to write the epitaph? Should universal truths exist? If so, shouldn't they affect everyone alive regardless of ideology (s), culture, race, gender, sexual orientation, nation state, language, skin color, intelligence, height, weight, IQ, education level, personality trait, character, age, profession, occupation, gender identity, sexual preference, appearance, etc.? My personal opinions: To live peacefully requires compassion. Compassion doesn't just mean empathy though - it also entails understanding. Imagination plays a huge role too. Without imagination, people remain unable to grasp concepts other than what is right straight in front of their eyes. A child living in poverty isn't going to grow up believing that everything they'd want is afforded to them... Sure, maybe they'll learn that lying works sometimes, but sooner or later children must learn to distinguish reality from illusion. Some kids don't learn that distinction early enough, however, seeing as it takes awhile to figure things out. Poor mental health causes slow thinking. Poor physical health leads to pain. Animals and computers won't let you get away with cheating, lying, stealing, raping, killing, bullying, mutilating, beating, torturing, abusing, imprisoning, or discriminating against anyone under penalty of death. That's why poor mental health keeps you from learning proper ethics. Plenty of things happen automatically. Most notably, addiction.
