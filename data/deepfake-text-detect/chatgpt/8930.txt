The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as a tank top) except with minimal makeup. You don't have to look like you're wearing something that doesn't exist because your tattoos are clearly applied to you like I am. But what if you are actually wearing something, and you really only want to wear it for fun? Then you would keep the key or epoxy, which they are just going to add. They aren't going to change the way you look unless you absolutely need them otherwise.
