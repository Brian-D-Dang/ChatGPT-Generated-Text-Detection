Greetings! I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay. However, as a Hungarian nationalist myself, I can't hide from the fact that we're already seeing strong trends in our society which could lead us down an untrodden path wherein the true nature of our culture is forgotten or rather ignored entirely. We have all sorts of "cool" alternatives going on these days like hiphop-culture coming from Cali, la dolce vita etc., but somehow I feel that we are heading for trouble and becoming blindsided by other cultures' influences without even noticing them anymore - at least not in time. In California to be precise. I think you'll find that music has changed dramatically since the 80s too. The ways people listen to music now, especially rock roll, although developed around 197080's, was heavily influenced by disco. That would mean heavy influence laid upon the youth movements in late 70's early 90's...and i'm sure you know what I am referring to here.. As for your statement about Hungary being culturally decaying; I guess things evolve as well and adapt themselves to change. By doing so, I don't believe any nation or culture is "decaying" because evolution never stops until there is no longer anything left alive. It might just seem that way while modernizing sometimes we may lose certain aspects that were once considered important; however, keep in mind that when something dies it doesn't necessarily leave nothing behind because some new thing takes its place instead. Some things due die out naturally, others do through man-made means...which brings me back to my initial point: Isn't the world changing? And isn't mankind adapting accordingly...even if gradually? Anyways, hope you enjoyed reading this post and sorry for making it quite lengthy. If interested to read more posts like this please visit Thanks again!
