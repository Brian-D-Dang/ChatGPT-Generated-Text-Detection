Hello everybody! I was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as possible, etc. I'm sure you guys can guess where this is going. I think it's great to encourage people to save for retirement but at the same time, I don't think it's a good idea to encourage people to put in money for pension. For one thing, pension contributions are compulsory and it's hard to get out of it once you are in. Secondly, pension contributions are a form of deferred tax, i.e. you only pay the tax when you withdraw money from the pension. I think it's better to encourage people to invest in a tax-advantaged manner, e.g. max out your 401k if you have one. Then when you are ready to retire, you can take out all the money and pay the tax, which will be a lot less than what you would have paid if you had put the money into a pension instead. So my question is, what do you guys think about the advantages and disadvantages of using pension for retirement? I think the word you're looking for is "pension" not "pension" Agreed that it's not a good idea to force people into a pension. I'm currently saving into a pension, but I'm also saving into an ISA and a SIPP (the second of which is solely for the purpose of holding my Isas), which I also contribute to, and I'm not going to force myself to retire early and draw out my pension. As you say, if you don't invest in a pension, you only pay tax when you take the money out. I agree that pensions are a deferred tax saving and a forced saving. It is also one of the biggest disincentives to work as a contractor. I can't see any value in a forced saving that is never really tax efficient. I think I'll be setting up a pension for my wife in the near future and we'll contribute a maximum of 36,000 each per year to it, which is maxed out from 201516. I have a monthly pension that is paid from my salary, which is then taken out of my net pay as I do not want to pay tax on my pension. My pension is currently 11,400 per year, and will be 13,500 after 2015. So I'm paying 4,400 extra tax every year because of my pension contributions. I can afford to do that, and I'm in a lower tax bracket than most people, but for people who are earning less, it's a massive disincentive to work. I think pensions are a great thing, and I wish they were not compulsory. I do also agree that there should be less tax on pensions. I'm in a similar boat. I was all for pension savings but never got around to contributing to one. What is the best way to invest in pension? Sorry, I don't quite follow. You are paying tax on the amount that your employer adds to your pension. Also, you can deduct that amount from your taxable income. How much you pay in tax is down to your salary. That is great to hear, I do agree that pension is a great thing, just not sure I'd ever like to be forced into putting money into one. I'm not sure if I made myself clear but I was talking about what I pay in tax, not what my employer adds to my pension. Hmm, I will check that out, thanks!
