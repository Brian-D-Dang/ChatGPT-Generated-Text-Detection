Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for "sleeping around," and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of attention because she sleeps with him. This is a common reaction to men who do not sleep around. In an age where sexual harassment and assault are widespread, this response can push back against male feminists trying to make their lives easier by making them feel superior - something that women should be doing rather than being sexist about when they do-not-sleep around. When we talk about rape culture, we often say in respectful terms that it is a case of social media posts comparing rapists to men. But, like I said earlier, this doesn't even seem to address how the victim consents. While living with a friend at two different locations, I had my boyfriend ask if he could have dinner with me on his way home after work on September 26th. My partner asked if he could go to dinner with his buddies, and I didn't know what I was going to do then. The only thing you would see in the room past midnight is what someone else thought outside of the bedroom. What I did think out loud though was that I really wanted to have dinner with my best friend, so I just stayed there. It seemed like date night was just another day off from the company dinner. After all, eating out wasn't necessarily out of the question: I wouldn't want to be having dinner with strangers or sleeping with someone who had literally nothing to do with me. So, why does it matter? If your boyfriend wants dinner with you, and he knows it's wrong, let him choose what the meal will be, by choosing only one item. But if your boyfriend chooses just one food item, they're not expected to sleep with each other anymore (unless they really made up your mind). This isn't the case here. Your boyfriend is likely doing the deciding act knowing that your girlfriend has already slept with someone else. And if he comes back later to eat with you instead of leaving you alone, you may still decide to cheat on him without telling anyone anyway. If he does come back later, it might even allow you time to talk to him before when you were with her again.
