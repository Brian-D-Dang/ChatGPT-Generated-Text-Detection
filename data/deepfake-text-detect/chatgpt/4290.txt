I really like Coke (hell look at my username), like really. I made the trek to Atlanta about a year ago for the sole reason of visiting the Coca-Cola Museum. I have been drinking soda ever since, and still do. It's so good! So my question is this: what are some must visit places in Atlanta? Chapel Hill is delicious
