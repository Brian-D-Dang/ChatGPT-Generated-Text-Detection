While it's true that requiring submitters to post their faces could be seen as invasive or sexist, it's also important to consider the context of the subreddit. rladybonersgw is a place where people voluntarily share pictures of their bodies, often for the purpose of receiving validation or compliments. In this context, it's not unreasonable to ask for a full-face photo as part of the submission process. Additionally, many other subreddits have similar requirements for verification purposes, such as rgonewild. It's important to remember that participation in these communities is entirely voluntary, and individuals can choose whether or not to post photos. If someone is uncomfortable with the submission requirements of a particular subreddit, they can simply choose not to participate.
