Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than other countries or people. If there's anything that you've read so far that has convinced you that it is wrong, please point out what it is and why. We'll be following this thread very closely.

There is some truth in what you say, but I think it's a bit naive to say that nationalism is inherently a bad thing. It's not like we can just all get rid of our national flags and stop identifying ourselves with the country we live in. In my opinion, the good aspect of nationalism is that it encourages people to work towards a common goal (for example, improving the country, defending it, etc). The bad aspect is that people can become too nationalistic and too extreme. When this happens, nationalism becomes a negative force in society. Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by "when this happens." I'm sure that "negative force in society" will be defined in terms of an example or two. I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. For example, if a person is so nationalistic that heshe will kill anyone who isn't from hisher country, then that's obviously a very negative force in society. I think we need to distinguish between the concept of nationalism and its extreme forms. The concept of nationalism is a positive thing. For example, you can't really be patriotic without being nationalistic. The extreme forms of nationalism (like nazism, for example) are negative and harmful. Here's what I'm thinking of when I say "when this happens" I believe that "nationalism" is a concept that we must all grow out of if we want to live in a world full of peace and harmony. Nationalism is basically the extreme love of one's country and I believe it is actually quite harmful to the world.

I believe nationalism is a positive force that helps to unite people. I love my country and am proud of being a citizen of my country. I would consider it a great insult if someone spoke badly of my country. I do not agree with the generalization of nationalism as a negative force.
