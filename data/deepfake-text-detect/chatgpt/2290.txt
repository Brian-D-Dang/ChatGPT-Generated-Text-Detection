I attribute my agnosticism to this very theory. Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in existence before it happened for an infinitely brief amount of time and then all matterenergy condensed into one singularity which exploded outward creating space-time as we know it today with planets forming out of star dust etc.. I can't explain how nor why such a thing would happen but logically speaking...it's the only explanation possible if you take everything else under consideration including what some people have termed "The Multiverse Theory" (which is quite interesting by itself) Science doesn't claim anything about God because science isn't interested in claims made by any deity unless those deities actually exist. Beliefs are not proven true based on lack of evidence but rather through repeated testing until they pass muster; so your entire premise falls apart here. Science has repeatedly tested gods. They don't hold up. So no more god talk from anyone who wants to be taken seriously around these parts please!
