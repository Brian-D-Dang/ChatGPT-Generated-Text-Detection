Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be "free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean you can't face negative consequences for what you say." This is because the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects individuals from being censored by the government. However, it does not protect them from potential civil or criminal liabilities if their speech incites violence, targets a protected class, or violates other laws. It also doesn't protect people from being criticized or ostracized by others in response to their speech. People are free to express their opinions and views, but they should be aware of the potential consequences that may result from their words.
