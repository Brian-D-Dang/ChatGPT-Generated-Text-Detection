Hello everyone, with all the media coverage lately regrading transgender individuals I find myself uneducated on the particular subject and would love to be enlightened on the topic. I support equal rights for anyone in this country including transgendered persons but since there are so many levels of gender identityexpression it's hard sometimes trying figure out what you should call someone if they identify as a man or woman etc... In general here is how we refer them:This person who identifies themselves by male pronouns has MTF (male-to female) status which means that at birth their body was considered masculine from outward appearances yet internally she feels like he did not feel appropriate until later years due his brain sexualizing him into living more feminine lives despite having been labeled masculinity most her life....how do i say "he" instead? This one seems easy enough.....I think ive met only two people our entire history where both identified initially using different genders names then eventually changed after talking things over........either way when referring either case must always use correct pronoucements based strictly off physical appearance unless otherwise stated......as far ad expression goes these days its almost impossible without going back hundreds year ago before transexualism existed! However thankfully today society accepts each individual according whatevere path chosen while taking responsibility through yourself recognizing your own situation freely, never imposing another upon oneself beyond allowing those already placed within positions such ones given above take full resposibility. It can't hurt being called faggot now n' again..lol
