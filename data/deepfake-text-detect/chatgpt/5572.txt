I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that are not of the same party as the one doing the attack. Let me give you a few examples: The liberal Party of Canada (LPC) which is in power at the moment is attacking the other party NDP. They are claiming that the NDP wants to raise taxes on business which would hurt Canada's economy and make it harder for the businesses to invest in new equipment which would make it harder to create new jobs. However, in the exact same ads, they claim that it is important to have a strong economy in order to create jobs. So in other words, they are telling you that we need the NDP's plan to create jobs. In addition, the LPC is also attacking the conservatives (CPC) who are in power before the LPC and are now running again. They say that the CPC is not protecting Canada from terrorists and that they are not doing enough to help veterans. However, they are now saying that the CPC is a security threat and that it is important to re-elect the LPC in order to protect Canada. In other words, if the LPC is in power, we will have more jobs and more security for our country. Now, I am no fan of NDP, but the LPC is not being fair. They are attacking all parties for the same things and all the parties are doing the same thing. Most people think that the parties are attacking each other because they are being honest about their views on the topic and want to inform you about their plans. In reality, they are only doing it to make the other parties look bad and because it works. You often see polls saying which party you like the most. The polls are based on how many people think that the party is the best and not how many people actually voted for that party. In the end, people will vote for the party that they like the most and that is the party that most people think is the best. They think that the best party will be the one that can create the most jobs and protect Canada the best. In reality, all the parties are trying to create jobs and protect Canada. What I think should be done to fix this problem: If it is a good idea to put up posters, ads and TV or radio commercials, then all the parties should be allowed to put up their ads. No one should be allowed to attack other parties or candidates. We should have a law saying that all the parties can make their own ads and campaign and attack the other parties on their own.
