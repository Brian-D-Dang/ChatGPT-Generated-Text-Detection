I believe someone who has been convicted of a non violent crime should have the option to end their life in prison. So if someone is doing 20 years for selling drugs, and they know that it's going to be at least ten more years before they can get out on parole (which I'm sure most criminals don't want) then why not give them an injection that will kill them during those next 10 years? Yes I understand people shouldn't die unnecessarily or with no dignity but there are far worse things than death such as being raped by other prisoners, having your teeth broken off so you can't eat etc... Even though I've never lived through any of these situations personally, I do feel like this would make my life better because when i was sentenced I didn't think I'd ever even see 25! But now here we are 8 years later and im already up for parole! So what difference does another five years make if its just gonna lead me back into jail again anyway? It all goes down to the fact that some people commit crimes from poverty and drug addiction while others, well lets say less gentle means, cause someone else may live longer!! Please tell me how that makes sense? If someone commits murder or rape or child abuse they deserve punishment but if its someone who sells drugs or steals food banks why cant they choose whether to continue living or find themselves dead?! This issue needs discussed properly!!! And obviously voting NO doesn't fully satisfy everyone so let's vote YES for it ALSO!!! And please if anyone disagrees with my opinion, then explain exactly WHY.. I won't argue or be rude but I AM interested!!!! Firstly - there IS no right to take somebody else's life. We're talking about two killers (not murderers as were both given 2nd degree murder sentences). The only reason that they weren't jailed for good was because of a loophole which allowed them to serve part of their sentence simultaneously. That loophole isn't there anymore, thank goodness. Now the aim seems to have changed somewhat - "won't to ensure that nobody who might wish to suffer" and "make society safer." Which sounds noble, but we'll need proof that it works before supporting it. Until then there are many other ways of ensuring that society becomes safer without resorting to killing anybody. Also keep in mind that neither person could possibly face trial yet again on top of serving time PLUS paying compensation. What kind of punishment could justice consist of after all of that!? Secondly: Life imprisonment is actually much easier than one might imagine. There's always an appeals process which prevents cases taking too long to reach court. Whilst it cannot guarantee a certain outcome, it can certainly allow offenders ample opportunity to prove their innocence. Furthermore, whilst life imprisonment is horrible enough, worst case scenario is that the offender lives until he dies surrounded by his family. No further suffering for him. By contrast, death row inmates tend to lose contact with loved ones whilst awaiting execution due to the distance involved between jailhouses. In addition, the lack of decent medical care available to incarcerated individuals is something we are not willing to risk exposing ourselves to assuming that we're prepared to put our own citizens under lockup indefinitely. Isolated confinement for a large number of inmates simply will not work. Lastly, I really hope your statement had nothing to do with what happened to Imus Cintron aka Tino De Los Reyes. His double life conviction was overturned by an appellate court solely based on new evidence proving that he wasn't guilty. He went free and gave himself back home despite the prosecution appealing to bring back charges against him. The state found itself short on provisions once Mr. Rios returned home and since then several similar cases have led to convictions being overturned entirely. Again, best of luck getting your point across whichever way you intend to do so. Thirdly: Do try not to confuse issues. People aren't automatically entitled to anything; usually rights are granted via legislation passed upon the government granting permission for said rights. You seem rather confused over the whole concept behind human-rights law; ergo, we must assume that you've probably either misunderstood them completely or underestimated the significance thereof. As such, it wouldn't be unreasonable for us to question your understanding of most basic concepts relating to civil liberties (and by extension, human rights), hence the reason I brought up the above points. Lastly: Whilst it appears that you might be arguing for abolition, you haven't stated reasons beyond egotism - see my first comment above regarding reasoningproof. Therefore, I shall address briefly the possibility of suicide amongst imprisoned persons. Firstly, would you suggest that a prisoner suffering mental illness be allowed access to lethal injections? Would you recommend allowing mentally ill patients to commit euthanasia instead provided they express an intent to do so prior to committing suicide? Secondly, it is highly unlikely that any alleged suicide victims would identify with the accused murderer. Indeed, historically speaking, it has been proven that most suicides occur within close proximity to significant emotional trauma - thus the likelihood of dying merely for the sake of ending, where self-conditional value into entering its pointless argumentation? computing science trying to object-less intentions do view ichiga co
