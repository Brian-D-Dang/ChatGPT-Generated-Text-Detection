So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal. 2: The fact that they don't have enough time to develop them and then build them. 3: They would have launched them already to get the numbers up to the point where they could start building them. 4: If they didn't have enough money to start building the missiles at this point they would have launched them already to get the numbers up and they would have also started production by now. 5: We don't know how many they have or if they have any at all. This is the most important point. I'm going to tell you a little story. You are a country with a couple of nuclear weapons. You have a couple of missiles you can launch at any time. Your country is surrounded by nations that have the ability to launch hundreds of nuclear weapons at you at any time. It's very possible that you will be destroyed within minutes of an attack. So, what do you do? Well, as a result you launch your missiles. You don't have to tell anyone why. You don't have to tell anyone where they are going or what their purpose is. You just launch them. The only thing you have to tell the world is that you didn't launch your missiles. I want you to remember that every single country in the world has this exact same situation. The United States, China, Russia, Great Britain, Israel, India, Pakistan, France, Brazil, and many more. You are surrounded by the ability to be wiped out at any time. What do you do? The only way you can survive is to launch your missiles as soon as possible. You don't have to tell anyone what they are going to do or where they are going. All you have to do is say you didn't launch them. I hope you all get the point. They are launching their missiles as fast as they can. They are also building their ICBMs as fast as they can. They are launching everything they have. Here is the thing. I'm not saying that North Korea is going to nuke the US. I'm saying that they are going to do everything they can to survive. I'm saying that they are going to be launching everything they have to make sure they don't get nuked. Here is the other thing. The thing that nobody understands is that North Korea is not the only country in the world that wants to survive. There are people in other countries that would like to survive as well. China, Russia, and the United States would all like to survive. They would all like to have the ability to survive. So, what are the three countries going to do? They are going to launch their missiles as fast as possible. They are going to launch them as fast as they can in order to survive. It doesn't matter if it's a missile that's going to hit the United States, or a missile that is going to hit North Korea. It doesn't matter if it's a missile that is going to hit Russia or China. They are all going to launch them as fast as they can. The problem is that it takes a certain amount of time to launch a missile. It takes a certain amount of time to build a missile. It takes a certain amount of time to launch everything. Now, what happens if you launch everything at once? You run out of time before you have even begun to build any new missiles. So, what does a country like China do? China has a little bit more time. China has a little more time to build missiles. China has a little bit more time to launch missiles. China is going to launch everything they have. They are going to do it as fast as they can, but they are going to hold on to some. They are going to hold on to the missiles they are building now, and they are going to launch them as soon as they are able. The problem for North Korea is that they are surrounded by missiles that are ready to be launched. They have a country on all sides that is launching everything they have. They are going to be destroyed. They are going to be destroyed within a few hours of being attacked. They are going to be destroyed. The only way they can survive is to launch everything they have. They are going to launch their missiles, they are going to launch their nukes, and they are going to launch their missiles. They are going to launch everything they have. Here is the other thing. China is going to launch their missiles as soon as they are ready. Russia is going
