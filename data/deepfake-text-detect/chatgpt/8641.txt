Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate "News" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbaitnative advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand "BuzzFeed News" as being the "official news site," then it should be pretty much impossible to take your eyes off it, right? Fantastic writeup. The whole "Kerber fails to convey that this is the time for a military-style political response to an economic collapse in China," is an indication of how little "news" we get from these "fans." We do have a good shot at seeing actual action instead of a display of jingoistic rhetoric. I don't see a problem with Kager as a general writer; however, because he's apparently got no interest in any specific subject other just a few months ago (and maybe even less attention now), it would appear very unlikely he'd ever include a violent or terrorist attack on the US embassy in Beijing. It really makes me wonder why they're so lazy about reporting what those guys did to the Chinese people.
