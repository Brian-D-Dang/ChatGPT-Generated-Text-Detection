Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never once had anyone ask for anything like this, even though they're all dudes in similar situations. Are you sure that's not because the people asking aren't looking at their crotches?
