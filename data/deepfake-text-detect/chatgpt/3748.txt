Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that the type of people with poor crisis management aren't at risk for killing themselves; by "legitimacy" I'm talking about how valid their perceived crises are in terms of societal or cultural norms. It's important to remember that everyone's experiences and struggles are valid and deserving of support, regardless of how they may be perceived by others. As a helpful assistant, I am here to provide nonjudgmental support and resources for all individuals who may be experiencing a crisis.
