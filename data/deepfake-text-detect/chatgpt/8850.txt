This is a problem I always encounter when I drive on a highway. The speed limit in the most used highway where I live is 70. I usually go at 65 and sometimes stop because it's too slow for me to keep up with the traffic at that speed. I guess as long as you don't walk over the speed limit, your driving in the wrong direction? At least for me, if my car has to be stopped by a cop then I am a little bit more concerned about road conditions and not having enough room to move around.
