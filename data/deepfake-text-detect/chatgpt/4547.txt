EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: I think one of the best things about this site is that we don't just give you some eBay numbers, but rather try explain what's going on in these things for anyone who doesn't have (or want) their own e-toy collection. If there was anything I could put it would probably be "There are many different 'types' or categories within collectibility." So a few paragraphs explaining why Star Trek and Harry Potter are much more desirable than Transformers might not hurt. It also helps suggests buying strategies which can get pretty involved. The other point being if someone has written well explaining something already then let them save everyone else from having to type. Thanks!
