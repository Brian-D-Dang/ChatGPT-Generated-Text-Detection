Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of research, I have come to the conclusion that vaccinations are safe and effective for preventing the spread of diseases. It can be difficult to approach the topic with parents who are strongly against vaccination, but it's important to remember to have a respectful and open-minded discussion. One approach could be to start by asking your parents why they are anti-vaccination and to listen to their concerns. You can then offer information from reputable sources to address their concerns and showcase the benefits of vaccinations, such as preventing serious illnesses and protecting vulnerable populations. It can also be helpful to encourage your parents to speak with a healthcare professional about vaccination and the potential risks and benefits. Ultimately, the decision to vaccinate is a personal one, but it's important to make an informed decision based on accurate information.
