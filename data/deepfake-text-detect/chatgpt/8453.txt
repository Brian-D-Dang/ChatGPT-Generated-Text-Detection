First I think I should make all the clarifications I can. By "true Christian," I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ. By "Buddhist" people, what we are talking about is a religion or religious practice more than anything else (this was discussed in another question). So it's like going back and forth between BuddhismDaoism etc., vs Christianity; again something not really considered salvation per se but rather partaking from each other while walking on this earth for now until you realize your ultimate goal which maybe isn't nirvana as some Buddhists believe versus reaching heaven where God lives forever after death - although Christians argue against such beliefs: they say nothing has been done wrong so why would anyone have any reason at law over being punished eternally? But then there's those who feel led through prayer might save them even though no one knows if prayers get answered anyway...etc... No worries! The point here still stands:) I'm sure my grammar may be off sometimes due our different cultural backgrounds
