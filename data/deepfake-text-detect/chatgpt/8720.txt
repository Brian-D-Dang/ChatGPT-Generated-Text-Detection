In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they 're in their twenties and still however much that autonomy might otherwise be would also fall under the category of "moral turpitude." The woman who had sex with me was very strong in this regard, she said, but I did not consider her as an adult teenager anymore because she continued to do it without any justification whatsoever. It is already important for both parties to be aware of what they are doing and what the consequences of doing so may entail if they decide that they would like to continue having sex with each other or not - even before going into bed with him. If women are careful about what they do, they can avoid some of these situations by carefully considering which sort of behaviour they want to follow beforehand - especially if they feel comfortable asking themselves whether they should continue having sex or just keep having sex. It could in theory mean that those decisions will dictate how sexually intimate they think they will become and thus their sexual desire for sex will increase accordingly. But given that sex has no physical content in itself, don't assume that anyone is always going to have sex with you if they're concerned that it might potentially harm them. It's good to encourage people to get involved with others if they feel they need to; you'll know when someone asks you something and you won't be embarrassed for saying yes. I am sure you will agree that sex makes things better and more pleasurable for men, while there's nothing wrong with being able to have unprotected sex, I'm no expert on how often it happens but as part of my own personal experience, I personally never felt threatened and found it to be the most enjoyable thing I've ever done. So you don't really owe any obligation towards us if you decide what kind of pleasure you'd like to have from your partner, and if at any point it does come up again then absolutely, you will continue to take care of yourself rather than trying to force it upon someone else.
