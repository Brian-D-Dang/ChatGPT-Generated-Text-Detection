I think its fair to say that most people dont give a single shit about morality unless they're driven by compassion"their conscience" or worried about being judged by others for doing the wrong thing. So people eat meat because Most people wont judge them for it They have no compassion for the animal I feel compassion for animals and so I dont contribute to their mass-abuse and slaughter, aside from the obivously immoral support of animal cruelty there's a bunch of reasons why vegetarianism is better for the earth, for your health etc, but until I gained that compassion it didnt matter to me. People like to act like their decision to eat meat is some kind of well thought-out position that they're sure is logically and morally sound, but IMO its 100 backwards rationalisation. They already made the decision to eat meat as a child without thinking about it at all, and they want to keep doing it so they try to explain to themself why they do it instead of honestly thinking about whether or not they actually should. Eating meat can never be more or as ethical as not eating meat, because you're taking life needlessly and contributing tocausing (no snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible) all kinds of abuse towards animals. But people just dont really give a shit. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
