Read reviews elsewhere to get the real picture. This place is getting really, really bad. Corporate management needs to change out the office staff and enforce posted policies before this whole complex goes to ruin. It's so sad to see such a pretty location be handled so poorly. It could be (and used to be) a great complex. Now it's not worth the high rent they charge, the crime you'll be exposed to, and the noisy neighbors.
