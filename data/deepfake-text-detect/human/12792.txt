The moment I met her I knew she was the one, she was like me in everyway. Lost. We needed each other, and quickly formed a relationship. We laughed, we cried, and we loved. We eventually got married, and planned to start a family. But a war came, and I decided to participate in it. I was a loyal soldier, and a good one. I quickly rose the ranks but one battle made that cut short. I was shot at, and fled to a cave. I was bleeding to death, I saw the light flash. A "witch" came, and said that I deserve a long life for my bravery (I had saved many lives that day, including her). She had a potion and made me drink it, I instantly became healthy again but mentally I would never be the same. I hear voices in my head..... voices of death. They brought me home after they found me (Even with a good body, I had blood everywhere they feared the worse) I came home and was changed, I loved her still deep down but I drove her away. I eventually left her, and she later committed suicide. This was the final straw for me, I had a picture of her and me in my wallet ever since that day. I was the one that should have died, not her. I blamed myself, and was drove to a deep deep depression. I tried shooting myself half a dozen times, to no avail. I drove off a cliff- only to miraculously survive. Every night I rest my head I see her. I eventually moved-far away. to a new life. I formed a family, but with whom I did not love. I tried filling the void that was once there with drugs and sex and money. Fast forward several million years, skipping all the details humanity was no longer. It was just me, I went crazy in this time of loneliness. Several billion years after that, and the sun gobbles the earth whole..I was spit out into space like a piece of debris. and now I float through space, with nothing but the picture of my beloved. Maybe one day I can die, hopefully it's soon. I close my eyes, and reminisce of my time with her.
