As far as my life experiences have shown me, there is no good reason to have a child. Contributing to the problem of overpopulation (and all the problems it causes, such as global warming), seems at the very least irresponsible. Further, forcing life on an individualan individual whom I would ostensibly loveseems cruel and unfair. Life is not a kind gift; indeed, a majority of people are unhappy with their lives (at least in America, where I live). Why should I create an offspring who will, odds are, be unhappy with hisher life? Personally, if given the choice right now to have been born, I would choose negatively. Contributing another human being to an increasingly deteriorating world seems particularly cruel to me, both to the individual and the world. The only reason I have been able to come up with for having a child (or children) is personal happiness. I've heard numerous times from parents that a child is the greatest joy in life, so much happiness, etc. etc. It seems to me, however, that my personal happiness should come second to both my child's pain and the world's problems. Well, that's it. I'm sure there's some point I could elaborate on more clearly, so please ask, but for now, CMV. Disclaimer: I'm only 19 Edit: Unfortunately, I don't have time to respond to every comment individually, but I have read every comment written in this thread and I thank you for taking the time to respond to my concerns. Although my view is as of yet unchanged, you've certainly given me a lot to think about between now and when I'm old enough to actually have children. So thanks again for your time! As an aside, reddit's fucking awesome.
