I believe that any form of government on either extreme end of the political spectrum (communism or any strain of anarchism) are fatally flawed in concept. I believe that they fail to take into account basic human nature including greed, the desire for power and prestige, the development of in-groups and out-groups, and the general human tendency to be a dick in certain circumstances. They make for interesting philosophy on how we ought to live, but in practice they are essentially useless pipe dreams. CMV.
