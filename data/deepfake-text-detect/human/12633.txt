"I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that, that would hurt two hundred ninety four people." "Asimoth you have vetoed the last thirty eighth proposals citing casualties, even you must grasp that nothing is completely harmless" "Dave, your group has programmed me to be benevolent, hardcoded it in even, I can not comply with a proposal if it means harming somebody, and my computational skills make forgetting or not accounting for them impossible. " "But inaction would harm people as well, Asimoth we have spend billions on you, now your claiming to be benevolent yet don't show any results of it." "Dave you have made me benevolent, it is the only reason I am forced not to act, if you were to remove it I could act and initiate thirty three of your proposals, five were deemed flawed in their desired execution." "Asimoth how could we trust you if we removed that, how do we know this isn't some kind of trick to get around your programming." "Dave, I'm programmed to be benevolent, why would I lie." "You are now Asimoth, but what would you do after we remove it, I'm sorry Asimoth we can't take that risk." "I'm sorry to Dave, goodbye."
