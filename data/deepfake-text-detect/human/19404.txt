I am a 20 year old male and attend college in the Midwest. This past weekend I was at the music festival in Chicago called Lollapoloza. I tend to dress in comfortable clothing. Cargo shorts for festivals and a t-shirt that's plain colored, nothing too fancy. While around campus and at the festival, I've noticed a trend with teens and younger adults in how they dress. Many especially at festivals wear rather provocative clothing in my opinion. [This] is an example of what I feel would be more than appropriate to wear at a festival. Unfortunately at times I feel people dress like [this] instead. Part of my concern stems from the fact that I have a 13 year old sister. I obviously don't want her to grow up too fast but would hope she has a better fashion sense. I question how appropriate the items of clothing people wear to the festival is. So my questions are as follows: 1. What example is this for other teens? 1. Should girls be expected to wear bikini tops and bra's in public? 1. Am I out of line here? Do I just not get female fashion? Edit: This blew up, will respond later. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
