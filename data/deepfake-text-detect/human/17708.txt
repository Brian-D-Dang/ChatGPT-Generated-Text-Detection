I am a 23 year old college student. Since going to college, I have been this hollowed out version of myself that is either in a manic high or a really low, almost suicidal depression. I find myself disinterested in the program I am in and instead find my mind drifting to the money that I could be making at my job. I feel education can not be found in a university or college institution. I believe education is the wisdom to realize the world is yours to discover and to learn from. I believe that universities- some of them- and colleges contain people who have discovered this for themselves and dilute that information for newer minds to palate. After a while though, it is not knowledge and only regurgitated fact that has lost meaning. So that's the gist of it. Change my view if you can. Or tell me how awesome Cookie Clicker is. EDIT: I would like to make this clear as it has been brought up. I have been screened for mental illness by at least three psychiatrists. I am of sound mind and have not been diagnosed with anything.
