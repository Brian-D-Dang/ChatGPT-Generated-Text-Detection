I was underwhelmed with my experience at Matt's Big Breakfast, although I visited the place prompted by reviews from others. The location is cute and the place delivers wholesome foods made with fresh, organic ingredients. The breakfast fare here is nothing spectacular, although they do simple brunch foods well. Don't expect anything fancy or fusion. My waffle was perfectly adequate, and while I thought the almost spaghetti-like hash browns were interestingtasty, the rest of my table disagreed. Standard breakfast fare done simply, nothing to write home about.
