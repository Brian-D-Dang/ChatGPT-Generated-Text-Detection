How many times have you heard of a male victim of domestic abuse? If you have, how many people make fun of the victim? Something along the lines of "Man up!" or "Let a little girl beat him up?," or "Stop being a pussy!"? This is senseless victim shaming, and I think it's ridiculous. Let's look at a normal "report" But they don't get hurt as bad as a female does. Sure, females usually suffer more when they are a victim, but this doesn't mean that a guy can not receive a lot of injuries. Also, many people seem to forget that domestic abuse isn't just between straight couples, or even couples, a relative is also considered domestic abuse. But females are abused more than males 28 of male victims do not tell anyone about their abuse. Male victims are three times more likely than a female victim NOT to tell the police and only 4 will tell a health professional. (Not sure how I am going to cite my source as I am using my school's database. But I can upload a PDF maybe...) Though, the number of male reported abuse victims is 40 [Source] released in December, 2011, within the last 12 months an estimated 5,365,000 men and 4,741,000 women were victims of intimate partner physical violence. Edit: Doesn't seem like too many people disagree with what I'm saying, which is a good thing! More attention this topic get's, the better! But let's still not forget about women victims!
