Batman's strict no-killing policy has lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can stop the Joker. Additionally, it is obvious that Arkham cannot hold him. He has escaped countless times, and every time, Batman has to go recapture him (after he's killed or injured who-knows-how-many people). Ostensibly, Batman's no-killing policy is a self imposed check on his inner demons that he is sure will consume him if he gives into them. I believe that, in reality, he uses this policy as a security blanket he can cling to so that he doesn't have to get his hands dirty and make a difficult decision. I think he wraps up his own cowardice in a cloak of self-righteousness (albeit a fireproof, bulletproof cloak). Here are my main views 1) The only way to stop the Joker is to kill or permanently incapacitate him 2) Batman has a moral obligation to kill or incapacitate the Joker since the state can't or won't do it. 3) He bares responsibility for everyone the Joker harms. Important Points The Joker is responsible for everyone he kills. The full burden of each person's murder is on his head. This CMV in no way negates his responsibility for his actions. Batman is not equally as responsible as the Joker for the people he kills. I'm not attempting to assign a specific amount of blame to Batman. All I am saying is that he bares some level of responsibility for his refusal to stop the Joker. Finally, Batman is not responsible for the people that the Joker killed early on in his career before it became apparent that he could not be contained. Edit If you are against capitol punishment or killing in general, we obviously have an unbridgeable gap here, and cannot possibly come to an agreement The only criminal that I am applying this argument to is the Joker. I'm not advocating for Batman to kill anyone else.
