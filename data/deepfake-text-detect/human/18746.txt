I've researched many world religions and read many atheistic and religious apologist treatises, as well as browsing relevant sources on the internet to get a glimpse of the philosophical climate of the vox populi. Having read the philosophical and scientific approaches to thought by notable figures such as Bohm, Dennett, Dawkins, Jung, Lashley, etc., and having read a handful of discussions pertaining to the "universe from nothing" argument (as well as discussions of the phenomenon of abiogenesis), I still don't quite think that an entirely mechanistic cosmology can account for the phenomena of life or existence. Am I thinking rightly, or are my new-age leanings affecting my rational thought? Would love to see some opinions. Thanks.
