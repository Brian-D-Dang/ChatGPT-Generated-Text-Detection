It doesn't exactly "block" anything. What it does is it darkens the reflection of light off your own face into your eyes. If you're looking into sunlight, the brightness of your own cheekbones below your eyes causes glare that can be distracting. It sounds absurd, "glare off my own face? Wtf," until you actually try it sometime. You get a noticeable increase in visibility when looking into the sun if you have eyeblack under your eyes.
