We span the gamut from helicopter parents to neglectful abusers, and worse. Most of the children I see don't have any parental input whatsoever, their parents are either on their damned phones or engrossed in some tv fantasy land; the one thing they're not doing is teaching their kids anything, and when they do it's inevitably to scream some incoherent babble at them. One side is coddling them into being a bunch of over-sensitive hyper-allergic hypochondriacs, and the other side's just gonna let 'em be feral. We'll see who wins, I don't know; but I can promise you this: Every single solitary problem we face pales in comparison to the issue of adequate parenting, it should be the civil rightswar effortManhattan Project of our time.
