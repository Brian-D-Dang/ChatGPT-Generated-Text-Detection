I feel like the true meaning of religion has been lost and the whole point of religion was to help people maintain a sense of humility and to accept that there is always some larger power. However, now people use religion to ask that higher power to fulfill their desires, and by praying and following the rituals that a religion has, people believe that they will get what they want. I feel a need to assert the fact that I am a religious person, I just think that I don't believe in religion for the same reason that many other people do. I probably don't know enough about how people feel about religion to make an assumption like this so yeah, CMV.
