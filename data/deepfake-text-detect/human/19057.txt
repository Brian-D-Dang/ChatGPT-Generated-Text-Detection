I believe that if two people choose to engage in a fight, they should be allowed to do so. Ideally, it would be regulated in such a way that either participant could reasonably withdraw their consent, and bystanders were not placed at risk. I would imagine this including an agreed upon arrangement, stipulating the limits of the conflict, and an official (possibly a police officer) who would ensure that the limits are observed. Should either party violate the agreements, or place a bystander at risk, they would be held criminally liable. The saying generally goes, "violence is not the answer," but the fact is that often times it is AN answer, and statistically, it's one of the most commonly used.
