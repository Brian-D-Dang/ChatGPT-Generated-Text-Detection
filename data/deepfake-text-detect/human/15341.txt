The doctors and techs at this hospital bar none have been the most caring and compassionate vet I have ever experienced. My dog swallowed the end of a rawhide bone yesterday and I rushed her there hysterical of course. They gave her immediate attention and saved her life. That let me sit with her as she woke up from sedation and also stayed with us as she came to. Dr.Isom was right by our side and couldn't have been more comforting through my hysterical crying. After all was said and done I returned home so grateful with my girl Jazzy. Thank you Indian Bend
