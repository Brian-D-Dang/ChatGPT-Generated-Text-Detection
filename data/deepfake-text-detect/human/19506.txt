I've noticed over the years, and with growing frequency, that positions held by Conservatives come with a massive dose of hypocrisy which goes well above and beyond anything rational. I'm talking about anti-gay Republicans busted in gay trysts, anti-abortion Senators who force their mistresses to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy, "freedom of religion" spouting Conservatives who's idea of freedom is mandating their particular brand of religion in school. Lately the two biggest examples are Craig T. Nelson's "I was on welfare and food stamps and nobody helped me." and the current Tea Party love of Canadian born Ted Cruz who they feel is a citizen because his mother is an American but still feel that Obama is not a citizen despite having been born in America to an American woman. Honestly, I find it hard to point to a single Conservative position which isn't rampantly and blatantly hypocritical. Maybe guns. Maybe. However, try to get the Republicans in the House or Senate to make it legal for regular citizens to bring guns into Congress and I suspect you'll be hearing about "safety." Are there individual hypocrites on both sides? Certainly. However, the vast majority of them seem to be on the Right side of the debate in every debate. Any evidence to the contrary?
