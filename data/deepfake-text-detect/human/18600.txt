When Iraq was originally formed, it was done without consideration for religious or tribal boundaries. I'm sure most of you have been around to see or participate in the latest effort to change Iraq for the better, and now many of those gains appear to be going out the window with the advances of ISIS. To this, I can only conclude: let them have it. The prospect of more war is maddening, but until the Shiites, Kurds, and Sunnis can hash out a stable border on their own, there is little hope of lasting peace. Put another way, trying to give democracy to those who don't want it just doesn't work. They can achieve whatever level of civilization they deserve through pain if not through aide. Pragmatically, if the majority of young men there are fighting each other rather than attacking others then the result is beneficial to more civilized nations. Grab the popcorn...this is the story of the middle east for the foreseeable future. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
