It seems to me that the entire "genre" of country music is more or less simply defined by the (often faked) Southern accents of the singers and that the lyrics contain some references to tobacco, alcohol, trucks, andor religion. The underlying music is essentially just rock and roll. However, once the lead singer begins to sing, it becomes country. I don't think that there should be an entirely separate genre of music distinguished solely by the contents of its lyrics. Also, on a somewhat related note, I find that on the whole, the country music "culture" is relatively ignorant and the audience is easily manipulated. What well-informed audience could actually sing at the top of their lungs "CHEW TOBACCO, CHEW TOBACCO, CHEW TOBACCO, SPIT!!!1!" Anyone with half a brain knows how awful tobacco is (especially the kind that they're advocating). CMV
