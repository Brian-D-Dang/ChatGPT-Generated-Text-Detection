I feel scared in my house often because I believe in ghosts ect. I hear banging, noises or when things move I really do try to think logically, but if I can't think of anything that could cause it naturally then I feel It could be be paranormal. I often hear noises which keeps me to continue on my belief that there real. Once boxes that were stacked in my closet were thrown across the room hitting my bunnys cage. The boxes were heavy on the bottom and empty on the top, there very wide and hit in the grooves of each other so I really couldnt think of a way for them to knock to the other side of the room. The thought of stuff being truly paranormal creeps me out a lot. I feel I could hopefully change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
