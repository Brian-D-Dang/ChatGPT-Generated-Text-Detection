I figure we could do with some more light-hearted fare around here! People I work with have been telling me to watch this show recently (I do love marathoning entire series) but I don't know if I can get into it. I don't mind action-heavy stuff, but the premise seems so implausible and the actingwriting seems very heavy-handed and lacks imagination. Bad thing happens, we magically have 24 hours to save the earth! Jack Bauer runs around acting angsty and shooting people until he happens to shoot the right one! His daughter is magically involved, and that makes it personal! However, I've only seen a few episodes here-and-there while my brothers watched it like 5 years ago. It seemed like every single time I sat down, it was the same scene. So, is it worth my time? Does it have a depth I'm not seeing? CMV
