This restaurant was a great disappointment. I have been to the Valentino's in L.A., but this place was nothing like it. Unfortunately, the service was very slow. After sitting down and waiting the longest time without even bread, water or even a menu, the bus boy came over and said my goodness no one has come for you yet? We knew this was a bad sign. Especially so given the fact that the restaurant was not busy. We kept an open mind for the food given the Valentino name, but again were let down. We had the tasting menu and wine pairing. Maybe two items stood out, but overall the food reminded us of mediocre cruise food with all dishes rather bland and tasting the same. The saving grace was the wine which was very good. I can't say I hated the place, and by the end of the meal the friendly staff had redeemed itself. But will not go back and will not recommend the place.
