Major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like AT T and Verizon are actually required to provide wholesale access to their DSL network services for the purpose of allowing other smaller third-party ISPs to compete in the market and offer their own internet service to customers. This is how companies like [DSL Extreme] (URL0) are able to offer internet service to customers throughout the United States in both AT T and Verizon regions. However, in the United States, the FCC regulations that mandate this type of wholesale network access only apply to basic ADSL service offerings. This means that companies like AT T and Verizon only have to provide smaller third-party ISPs with access to 6-8 Mbps DSL lines to customers. Obviously this presents a problem because most major ISPs now offer much higher bandwidth ADSL2, VDSL, cable, or fiber services that are much faster. As a result, these smaller third-party ISPs can't really compete with the DSL lines they can rent from AT T and Verizon which are both low-bandwidth and costly (the wholesale rates in many cases exceed retail rates for the equivalent service offering by the major ISPs). So, there is a regulatory system and framework in place designed to drive competition in the market, but it's completely ineffective at this point because the service offerings are just so bad in comparison to the major ISP offerings. Other countries like Canada and the UK have solved this problem by: 1. Forcing ISPs to open up their broadband networks for wholesale access, including ADSL2, VDSL, Cable, and Fiber networks 2. Regulating the wholesale pricing for line rental etc. so that the wholesale rates are reflective of actual costs to the ISP providing the network infrastructure, and as such, allowing smaller third-party ISPs to offer competitive pricing that is usually cheaper than the equivalent service plans offered by the major ISPs
