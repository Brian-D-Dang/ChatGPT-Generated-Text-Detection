She wandered around her school, anxious, confused, depressed. Her glassy, lizard like green eyes darted around, looking at all the people passing by. She had black, messy hair and she sometimes wore rounded glasses. She was thin, but it was clear that she had recently gained weight because her clothes did not fit right. She dressed like a man, presented herself as one, and of course she introduced herself as one. She had an angular face, broad shoulders and narrow hips. But despite the clothes, the hair, and the way she felt, she looked at all the men around her and knew that she would never pass. Not with that chest.
