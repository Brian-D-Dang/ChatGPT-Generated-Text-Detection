Researchers from Facebook AI have created a model for robotic locomotion that adapts in real-time to any terrain it encounters. Rapid Motor Adaptation was developed from the idea that humans and animals can change their movement automatically on different surfaces without any real understanding of the external environment. The system was trained entirely in simulation, and the resulting robot was able to walk on sand, mud, and other surface types with a high success rate. The technology can be generalized to train many other types of robots.
