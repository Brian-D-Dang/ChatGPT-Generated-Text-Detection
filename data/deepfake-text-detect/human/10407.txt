I have played Hearthstone since its beta and have had great times with it (I still do). My massive issue with the game is that the current meta relies too heavily on strung together mech cards that perfectly mesh with each other and do no evoke a skill-based theme or tactic. The expansion has encouraged players to make decks that kill quickly before the game can even begin to get interesting; this avoids the entirety of what makes Hearthstone special. Another thing is that Legendaries are totally whack as a core concept. They come off as useful tools to take out foes but are secretly a ploy to get "consumers" to buy packs to try and earn them (in a free-to-play game). The rarity of these cards even further prove that it benefits those who purchase packs in bulk and get them quicker, letting them get "better" faster and leave other players in the dust. Blizzard has also recently lowered the chance of getting decent dailies, meaning you have a lower chance of generating in game currency, further benefiting the payers. Cards involving random chance while also altering the mana curve (Voidcaller, Unstoppable Portal, Alarm-o-Bot) are devastating and should not exist. This is different than Druid's mana increasing cards as this is a calculated strategy that is understood by the opponent. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
