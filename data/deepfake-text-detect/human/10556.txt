We evolved to be tribal animals - a lot of our communication behaviors actually have a genetic basis to help us protect our tribe members. Jumping and shouting are one aspect of that. When a pack of wolves stalked out of the forest, the caveman who jumped and shouted at the scare may have helped his family and tribe escape danger (even if he didn't!). The caveman who didn't do any of that got his tribe ambushed and killed. So that first tribe (including his relatives who had that jumpy gene) survived and had jumpy kids, and eventually you end up with us. There's no reason for us to stop doing that, so it stays in our ingrained behaviors and gets passed down.,Humans are a social species. We have a built-in desire to alert those around us if something important and surprising just happened.
