Company owners are [limited in liability] for the actions of the company. In exchange for this grant of liability they should be required to provide information to the public on the operation of the company. Many [large companies] are private and the public does not have the required information to regulate their activities. Having more information available will help in the regulation of the economy. Making all companies public will increase the amount of information available. Edit: so far the only objections have been cost of reporting and privacy.
