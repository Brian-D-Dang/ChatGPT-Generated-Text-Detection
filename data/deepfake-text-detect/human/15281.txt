I've been to Rumbi probably a few dozen times. Worked near the (now closed) Rumbi on Frank Lloyd Wright in Scottsdale and ate there several times. Have gone to this one in Chandler several times. I always get the same thing, Jamaican Jerk Chicken. OK, yeah, call me boring. So I know what it tastes like. And it always tasted the same until last Sunday, when it was different. After a few bites I realized what I ordered isn't what I got. So I handed it off to the manager looking dude and told him I'd prefer to get what I actually ordered. His response was to bring it back to my table and try to convince me that what I had was what I actually ordered. Bye bye, Chandler Rumbi, I won't be back. Mistakes are OK, they just need to be corrected. Explain aways are not OK.
