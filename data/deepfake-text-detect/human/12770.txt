Dude..... your house technically didn't burn down. Look at the bright side. That midget didn't lose complete use of his digestive system. The two goats didn't have to be put down. The ink from that one tattoo didn't end being fake though. Grandma didn't have to be checked into rehab, she didn't eat every hit. Meridith didn't call and those stains didn't come out of her stuffed animals. Getting the tube removed didn't make Mr. Whiskers feel any better. That nun didn't know cats don't like being gerbiled. Papaw didn't hangout..... he didn't take the dress or the strap on off either.I didn't know a 9 year old could eat that much space cake. I didn't ask you if I could invite some people over. You didn't say I couldn't either..
