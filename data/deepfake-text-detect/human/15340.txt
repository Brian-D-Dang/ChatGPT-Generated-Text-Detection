Came for brunch, looked empty on the outside but was surprised to find that the place was full of people upon entering! I came on a Saturday about noon, I suggest to maybe come early. We were seated within 5 minutes so that was good. I ordered the salmon over hash with 2 eggs sunny side up. I was expecting a good amount of salmon but it was just 1 slice of lox. The meal was still yummy, tomatoes were amazingly seasoned. I had to order a side of bacon because the hash seemed Bare without any meat and that one piece of salmon. My boyfriend had the hangover burger and loved it! They offer an all you can drink option of mimosa and I think it was beer? Which is awesome. We didn't get it this time, maybe next time. Ambience is great, very modern. The staff was good too, very attentive, I think the manager also came to check on us and was helping the staff with serving food which is really nice to see. They offer healthy choices on menu too. Reasonably priced. Overall, I would come again and try their other entrees.
