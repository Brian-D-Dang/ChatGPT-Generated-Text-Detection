Researchers from Columbia University have established a method for growing human hair in a dish using 3D printing without the need for implantation into human skin. The method uses a 3D printed mold and may open up potential avenues for hair restoration surgery to more people. Previous research has been successful in growing mouse and rat hair in labs, but these techniques were not effective at growing human hair. The new technique involves recreating the environment in which human hair usually grows by using a 3D printed model implanted with keratin-producing cells. 3D printers are now being used to create many different materials, for example, food, wood, and advanced medicines.
