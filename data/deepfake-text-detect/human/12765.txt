I woke up more determined than I had been in a while. It was 3:00 pm: perfect. Insomnia is good in the winter - you wake up at the warmest time of day. I slide downstairs to find Mom passed out on the couch: lovely. Not throwing up yet. I take a cold shower, forgetting that the gas bill wasn't paid this month: awesome. I don't have to deal with finding the best temperature. I tried calling Jack, but he didn't pick up, which is exactly what I expected. I wouldn't want to talk to him even if he did pick up: heaven's probably boring. So I check the gun's barrel. Loaded. Perfect. I plan on going to hell anyways.
