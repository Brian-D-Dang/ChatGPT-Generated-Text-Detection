WW2 was a fight between large countries (superpowers). Today's wars are short because they are mostly between a superpower and a small state in which case the superpower (usually the USA) can end the war very fast using its much more superior strength. On a side note, wars today are actually very long because after the war is over the superpower leaves its military there in order to control the country. Also today we are in what is called the long peace which is a term of peace since WW2 where no major powers fought between themselves.
