So I am naturally a hairy guy and to be honest I hate having these thick black things growing over my very pale body etc. so I am constantly removing them. I have asked on a couple of subs about the best way to remove them and some of the responses I have got aren't really that great they seem to revolve around "I like hairy guys" , "you should be comfortable with the way your body is" etc. and they aren't really helpful. Girls can do stuff like that to make themselves feel more attractive so why can't a guy? I feel really ugly and unclean if I let these hairs grow so how is that any different ? Its not like these things have any actual purpose Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
