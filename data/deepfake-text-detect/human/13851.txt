Jenna decided to cut her hair from down the back to a short pixie cut. Of course, this was not the worst hair brained idea this teen had. After a few weeks, she reattached the hair as tiny ponytails. As Jenna walked around school, the hair started to slip off her head. Throughout the day, her friends mentioned seeing ponytails everywhere.
