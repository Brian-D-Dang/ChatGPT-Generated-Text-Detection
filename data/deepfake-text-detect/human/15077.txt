First impression of the place: walking into a doctors office with horrific overhead lights. No one at the reception desk to greet you, no where to really sit. Once inside, the massage areas were dark, cool and clean which was a relief and the massage I received was good but its still an odd place. I added a body scrub to my massage service and strangely enough, there was no shower to rinse off afterwards. Body scrubs should be done in a wet room, not a dry massage room. So I left feeling little bits of scrub on me and sticky for the rest of the day.
