Growing up in the south of the U.S. I constantly hear ridiculous remarks from both northerners and foreigners insulting my intelligence and my political views. On more than one occasion, I've been called inbred, racist, redneck, hillbilly, and unintelligent. Often, my political opinion is immediately disregarded before I have the opportunity to share it because: "oh he's from the south, so he was brainwashed because of the Bible Belt, etc." I understand that sometimes these remarks are jokes, but I still believe that this prejudice is hurtful and should not be tolerated, in the same way that racism should not be tolerated in this modern age. (In no way am I comparing the two, I understand that racism as much deeper historical roots, I am simply communicating that today, both are type of persecution, and they both are hurtful, unfair, and should not be tolerated.) In fact, even that last sentence I felt compelled to add simply because I'm used to anything I bring up regarding race immediately being reflected back on me being a "stupid confederate racist from the south." Please CMV.
