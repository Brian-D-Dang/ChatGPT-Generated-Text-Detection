This is a bit of a tongue in cheek tour for the tourists. Having seen the vaults on several programs on the TV we thought we would go see. The tour guide was good but kept going on about health and safety, people feeling odd etc. Our tour started at 3.30 from the royal mile gathering place and we then shot off at pace to the point of paymnt. We entered a building up a short but steep flight of stairs into a dark room of torture instruments, nothing was said about them in detail. On entering the vaults (tunnels) you got the impression that you where under ground but infact we where at least one story above ground level in the centre of an old building. We spent about 45 mins wondering up and down about 100m of tunnel in and out of 3 vault rooms all with spurious claims of paranormal activity with special referance to a stone circle. At the end of the tour you emerge into a pub (formally vault rooms) for a shot of whiskey and short bread. The tour guide had shot off for the next tour and we where left wondering....... On leaving the said pub, she passed us with another bunch of unsuspecting tourists heading to the payment point. There was about 20 in our group which seemed about right for the space availible for everyone to fit in, any more then you would be left IN THE DARK!!!!!!!! All in all a bit of fun worth a look. BOO!!!
