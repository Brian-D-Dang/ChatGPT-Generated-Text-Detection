I believe that a private business should be able to deny service to anyone for any reason. For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, then they should be able to. As a private citizen, I can choose who I give my business to. If I'm a racist, I can choose to only give my business to my race. If I personally want to give money to the homeless, I can choose to give it to one raceorientationetc. or another. Why can't a private business make the same decision? The free market place should solve this problem because people would see a need to service those that are refused service and then start a competing business.
