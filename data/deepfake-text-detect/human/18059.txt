I stopped eating meat when I was 9 years old, and I am now 19. In 10 years I haven't had so much as a chicken nugget. Before I was 9, I pretty much only ate chicken I have been disgusted by the thought of eating something with blood and organs for as long as I can remember, and when I was 9 it just clicked that chicken nuggets, while tasty, were made from real live chickens and therefore just as "gross" as the other types of meat that I wouldn't eat, so I gave them up too. I don't really have a position on the morality of eating meat in fact, I think people are SUPPOSED to eat meat, humans are omnivorous, and I'M the "weird one" for not being able to eat it. I have a very strong visceral reaction to the sight, smell, and thought of eating something that has died. Bloody steak makes me want to throw up. People have tried explaining that vegetables were also once living, but I don't think that "living and now dead" is the part that disgusts me; it's the idea that meat was a breathing, thinking, feeling animal made up of bones and organs and blood and to put that in my body seems revolting. The problem is, I know I'm missing out on a lot of tasty foods for having this view. There are many restaurants I can't go to, cuisines I cannot even try, because I refuse to eat meat. Socially, it has been a problem when I'm the one who can't find anything to eat somewhere. I would like to reincorporate meat into my diet (and not just chicken), but I have not been able to get past this idea that consuming dead bodies is sickening. Please CMV!
