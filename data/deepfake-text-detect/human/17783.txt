Automation is increasingly eliminating the need for physical and menial jobs. On the other hand, we know from the development of wikis, the free software movement, and other similar projects that people will volunteer to do creative work for free. Please convince me that the commodification of work is preferable to automation, volunteer creativity, self employment, small producers' cooperatives, worker-controlled large enterprises, consumers cooperatives, and other alternatives.
