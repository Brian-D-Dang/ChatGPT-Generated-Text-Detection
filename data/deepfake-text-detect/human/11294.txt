Listen Notes is a podcast search engine and database which was built without a lot of engineers and is based on easily accessible technology. Instagram was acquired by Facebook for 1 billion and it only had 13 employees, not all who were engineers. Listen Notes required a website that provided an interface for users and a search function and API for developers. It is hosted completely on AWS. The one-man business employs the service of many other companies to automate and handle tasks such as monitoring, and it is an example of how a companyapplication can be built and run using off-the-shelf tools and services found on the internet. Hiring services and on-demand contractors can save a lot of time, as well as removing the need to employ a lot of full-time employees.
