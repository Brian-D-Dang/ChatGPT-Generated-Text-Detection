I don't think that basic facts about human physiology should be hidden from children. From what I've seen, young children who know about where babies come from don't particularly care or else care only because they know they're not supposed to know. In fact, if kids knew about sex, I doubt they'd be as likely to be the victims of sexual abuse. I think pubescents being so awkward and inappropriate in regards to sex is due in large part to having seen adults treat it like a taboo. The adults are just perpetuating their awkward feelings towards sex from when they were pubescents! It's pathetic! CMV
