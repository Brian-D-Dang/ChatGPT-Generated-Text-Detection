I was recently put in a situation where a transgendered person became angry with me because I did not refer to them with a gender-neutral pronoun. While I consider myself compassionate toward their struggle as a transgender individual, I don't think it's reasonable to be angry with me when I accidentally call someone her if they look very much like a woman. I would understand politely asking me to refer to them with a gender neutral term, but this person made me feel very uncomfortable and insensitive, and I've heard many stories similar to this. So, please change my view!
