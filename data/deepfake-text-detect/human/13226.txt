Chosen. That's what I was. That's why I'm here now, wandering the remnants that once harbored men, now left without. I was human once, a long time ago, I think. Made a deal, and in exchange, I get this job, to ride across the far plains of man, scourging sinners who cause the suffering in the world. And now here I am, with nothing but a few demons that cause problems for me. I don't remember the Earth being such a wasteland, the skyscrapers, so tall, crumbling to ash, the plains, once filled with grass and water, not but dust. The great mountains, now nothing but pebbles, destroyed as a result of the trials. Where are death, hunger, and sickness? Did not their seals come undone? It has been two hundred years since then, and yet I'm still alone. I wandered into the remnants of a small town. Quiet, thankfully, no demons. A church. An old fashioned one, with the spire still intact. I wandered in, desperate for a an answer to prayer, to pull me off this rock. I wept, and prayed in the tongue of heaven, and yet none had heeded my call. A light tap came on my shoulder. I turned to look. A small child, draped in pink rags smiled at me, offering me a can of water. I drank from it gingerly. "Your mother?" I asked her, returning the can. "Sleeping." she pointed to a corner of the chruch, where a decaying form lay hunched over. "I see." My orders were to kill any human I came across, to cause untold conflict among men, and yet I was not one to adhere to rules so closely, never in life or death. I had honor once, too, I was a soldier, I think. I died in a blaze of glory, in the deepest hell of war, lost and forgotten. This is why I was chosen as the rider. In accordance to that honor I once had, I patted the little girl on the head, before turning back to the wasteland, to continue my endless search, my purpose among the very grains of dust that was out there.
