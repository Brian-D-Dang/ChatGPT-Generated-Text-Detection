My stance assumes that you, like myself, hold the popular reddit opinion that the NSA is in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The NSA is a government agency that is bound by law and is funded by tax dollars. The celebrity photos leaked in "The Fappening" were leaked by a hacker (presumably) - a private citizen. It is different to not want our tax-funded government and supposed protectors invading our privacy while "using" stolen porn. It isn't moral, it is creepy as hell, and I don't support it, but it is not hypocritical as many on reddit suggest. This view can be seen as defending what is going on, so please, CMV.
