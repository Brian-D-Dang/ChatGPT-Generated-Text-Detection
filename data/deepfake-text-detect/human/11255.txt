Silicon Valley security startup Verkada suffered a major security breach, with the hackers gaining access to over 150,000 of the company's cameras. Verkada serves companies like Tesla, Cloudflare, and Equinox, and it also serves hospitals, jails, schools, and police stations. The group had access to the full video archive of all of Verkada's customers. Verkada has disabled all internal administrator accounts and the company is investigating the scale and scope of the issue. The hackers managed to gain super admin-level access using credentials they found publicly on the internet.
