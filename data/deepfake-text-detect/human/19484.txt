It seems European countries with significant Jewish populations often suffer from regular bouts of heightened anti-Semitism, whether it be marches through the streets telling Jews to leave France, attacks on cultural practices in Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, Hungary, UK and constant harassment for dressing like a "jew," and flat out anti-Semitic canards in places like Ukraine, Hungary, and Greece. In most countries with Jews, the population and even institutions are wary and openly against Jewish participants rising to the top of the ranks. Most countries that used to have Jewish populations all are openly anti-Jewish. Even in far off places like Argentina, Jews have emigrated in the 10,000's to escape anti-Semitism and live a safer life. Even in Israel, the one place Jews were supposed to be safe, is the most likely place for you to die for being born Jewish
