I am a vegetarian. I am not a vegetarian for dietary reasons, but rather for ethical reasons. Of course, there could be multiple ethical reasons for being a vegetarian: wanting to end animal torture, or wanting to avoid killing animals, or perhaps other reasons. I am of the second kind. While I'm against violations of animal rights, even if I could be reasonably sure that I was eating meat that came from an animal that had been treated well, I still wouldn't eat it. I think it is wrong to deprive an animal of its life. I believe that if someone is of this line of thinking about their vegetarianism, they should be pro-life, which means that they should be against abortion in some fashion. Abortion ends human life; therefore, someone who thinks it is wrong to kill animal life should extend the same principle to their own species. (This makes me see why the inverse principle is merely specious, that if you are pro-life, you should be a vegetarian. People that are pro-life might distinguish between animal life and human life.) You can try to CMV about the conclusion that vegetarians of this vein should be pro-life, but you're also welcome to try to CMV about the kind of vegetarian I am, and its suppositions. [Edit: To be a bit more thorough about the pro-life bit: I guess the minimal possible conclusion would be that a pregnant woman of the same vein of thinking I was should not have an abortion without being somewhat inconsistent; the maximal possible conclusion would be that any vegetarian, like myself, should be more broadly, publicly, politically pro-life.]
