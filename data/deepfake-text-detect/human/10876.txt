There are two ways to think of light when looking at something. It either generates light itself, like a light bulb or the sun, or it's showing reflected light, like when you look at the page on a book. The book doesn't generate any light of its own, you only see what's there because there's other light bouncing off it and into your eyes. An LCD display doesn't generate any light by itself, so most have a thing called a "backlight," that shines light onto the LCD surface. That's usually from the sides, but some do it differently. So when you turn on an LCD display, even when it's showing a blank "black" screen, you still see the reflected light from the backlight and it can illuminate part of a dark room, dimly. Actually, the problem of getting "black" to be TRULY black is an old one with monitors, televisions and other displays.
