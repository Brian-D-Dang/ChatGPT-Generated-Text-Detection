It depends on the force alocated to the tooth A tooth cracks when you eat a rock because the force applied to a small location, and the inertia from the tooth being stuck to the bone makes all the energy from the bite be released in a form of a crack While an explosion can knock (and break) teeth, they are free to fly out, spending their energy by releasing it to the air instead of cracking','It is all about the stresses. Something hard is applying a ton of stress to a very small point while a fire is applying a lot of heat and an explosion is applying a relatively high pressure over a much larger area (more total force but lower pressure). Stress (or pressure) is forcearea. So a small force acting over a tiny area (e.g. a needle) creates a very high stress, a small force over a large area creates a very small stress and a high pressure over a larger area creates a large force. Think of something hard like breaking a piece of ice with a knife vs. a spoon. The ice is pretty tough, but the knife applies a ton of force to a very small area (it is sharp) so you can crack it (chip a tooth). If you apply the same force with a spoon, the force is spread out and thus the concrete doesn't chipcrack. Explosions that kill humans but leave them recognizable usually act on the squishy organs, if you are close enough to a bomb for it to crack teeth, you would basically be vaporized. Similarly, to destroy buildings you don't need that dramatic of a pressure spike to break it apart. If you want to crack every single block, that is another story, but that is unnecessary. Similarly with fire, teeth are enamel, which is pretty resistant to very high temperatures. Get it hot enough, and they will decompose, but pretty much any fire that a person dies in and is still recognizable is too "cold, "Since the question was answered but this wasn't addressed, it is worth noting that teeth have an effect similar to popcorn when exposed to fire for am expended period of time...so they don't
