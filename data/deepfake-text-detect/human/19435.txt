Carbon dioxide is a far greater threat to the planet than accidents at nuclear power plants or radiation from nuclear waste. Our house, the Earth, is on fire from global warming and we are worried that the fire extinguisher, nuclear power, has harmful byproducts. It's more important to extinguish the fire! Wind and solar power are great but nuclear power is more reliable and produces far more power. Chernobyl and Three Mile Island and Fukushima are cautionary lessons about safety, but they are not arguments for giving up on nuclear power altogether, not when global warming, like a fire, is accelerating and almost no time is left to act. Edit: I did not say that we should only use nuclear power to address global warming. Rather, without nuclear power we are doomed, and the table should not be artificially tilted towards non-nuclear solutions. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
