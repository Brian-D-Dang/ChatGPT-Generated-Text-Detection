Infantile circumcision is a breach of a child's bodily autonomy, since the child has no say as to whether he wants the action performed. There are certain medical occasions where it may be necessary to perform an operation, which is acceptable to my mind. However, the two most common justifications for non-medical infantile circumcision are "it's part of my religion" andor "it's my identity, I was circumcised, and I want my son to be too." The first point relies on am assumption that religion is a legitimate ground for action. However, most holy books have parts which believers adhere to, and parts which are deemed morally wrong in today's society, and so are disregarded. The idea of autonomy is key to Western society; it was key in abortion rights, in the removal of military service (for much of the West). Why is such a violation overlooked as "fine"? The second point, similarly, ignores the move to bodily autonomy and personhood. The argument that "it's ok because it happened to me" is perpetuating an "eye for an eye" mentality, where you can violate your child's bodily autonomy because yours was similarly violated. How is this a justification in any way? If any group ritually cut someone's body without their consent, it would be illegal without question. Why should circumcision get treated differently in this respect?
