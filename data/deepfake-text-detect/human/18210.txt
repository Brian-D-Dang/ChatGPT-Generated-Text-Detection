The way I look at it, cursive is really only used to sign your name and not much else. Not to mention the fact that you don't need to use a legit form or cursive for that as I do not. The only reason cursive is taught is because it already exists. The best explanation I've heard for why cursive should be taught is that in case you need to read something in cursive or your professor wants something written in cursive, my point is that they should not. It's just a never ending cycle of unnecessarily difficult writing. CMV
