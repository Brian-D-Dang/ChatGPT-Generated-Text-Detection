I think a rapist should get the death penalty for two main reasons. The amount of physical and psychological damage that a person faces after a rape is so horrific that the rapist should no longer be alive. On the physical side of things, not only will they probably be in pain in the sexual areas but the victim could have broken bones and bruises. The more important are is the psychological damage. The mental stress that a victim will go through after being raped is tremendous. They will see the face of the rapists in their dreams repeatedly and will probably become depressed and most likely face PTSD. Change my view. Edit: Clarification Hello, users of CMV!
