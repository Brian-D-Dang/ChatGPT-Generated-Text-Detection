It's less about the wall, and more that it's a symbol that the US is setting themselves as enemies of Mexico in how they want to handle immigration, rather than partners trying to solve a problem. It's a sign that the US doesn't want peaceful relations with their neighbor.," "The Wall is inconsequential really, but it implies some things about USMexico relations for the future. It uses Mexico as a scapegoat for why the US is doing poorly, and that would mean that every Mexican is less than every American. As neighboring countries we've got a lot of shared history and ties both diplomatic and in trade, they benefit from us and we benefit from them, but this wall implies that the US thinks it can do better on its own without Mexico.," "Because it's very insulting. Say you had a neighbor and he had an issue with your kid playing in his yard. And instead of telling you to keep better control over your kid, he builds a bigass ugly fence. How are you going to feel about this? Edit: And says he's going to buy the fence using your money.
