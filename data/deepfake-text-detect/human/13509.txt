I drove my elderly dad to have dinner with family at a restaurant. I parked in the handicapped space so dad wouldn't struggle. After dinner, we decided that dad would leave with my brother. That meant I had to drive away from the restaurant alone. I felt like a jerk, waltzing over to my car in a handicapped space!
