I read recently that the NFL has donated 7 million dollars in the last five years to correction American Cancer Society. That's nothing. That's not even much above the minimum player salary for one player. Its a fraction of the player budget, an even smaller fraction of a team's operating costs, and nothing in a multi-billion dollar a year industry. Basically, teams trot out everything in pink as an eyesore and that's it. There is no actual awareness. We don't get a bunch of education and statistics (and obviously money). They sometimes show breast cancer survivors, but I think we all know already that breast cancer exists and so do survivors. So no awareness actually happens and virtually no contributions happen for research. Ergo, its just a PR stunt common to today where people think change and effort is equaled to wearing a color sometimes.
