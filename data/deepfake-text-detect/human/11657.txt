Seattle Startup Zin Boats creates electric boats that can go a hundred miles or more and recharge using an ordinary wall plug. The boats require virtually no maintenance and can reach speeds of over 30 knots, with tests going up to 55 knots. Zin's boats were designed around the battery from scratch using high-performance fluid dynamics software and scale models to work out the shape of the hull. The 20-foot boats weigh around 1,750 pounds and are almost completely made out of carbon fiber. They cost around 250,000, with a more practical open-bow tender model currently being designed that will cost around 175,000. Images of the boats are available in the article.
