I hear women complain a lot about guys checking out their breasts. But a lot of times, the girl in question wears revealing clothes. A woman I used to work with had huge breasts and would often wear tanktops. She would complain about men looking at her. As a man, it's hard NOT to look down there if you are showing a lot of cleavage. It's unreasonable to think they won't or shouldn't and it's petty to blame them for it. I don't think women have the right to be angry at men for looking at their bodies when they wear clothes designed to show off their bodies. If youre showing cleavage, it's natural for anyone to look.
