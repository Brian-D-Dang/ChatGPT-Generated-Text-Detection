I don't really care what you do to yourself, as long as it doesn't hurt me. If you smoke and I can smell it, if you play loud music and I can hear it, if you threaten my happiness in any way, you are doing something wrong. Hence, I think smoking tobacco and marijuana products, even in your own home, should be completely illegal if that smoke has potential to infiltrate public or another person's private space. Same goes with loud music and cooking (unless its freshly baked cinnamon rolls, of course). Please, help me see the error of my ways. EDIT: For clarification, there are some exemptions the most common of which being a contract or other binding agreement. If I engage in something knowing full well that the outcome may not be the one I want, then I waive all expectation of necessary happiness. If I sign a bank loan, I have to pay it back no matter how much I don't want to. If I lose a soccer match against another team, I cannot send them all to the SHU.
