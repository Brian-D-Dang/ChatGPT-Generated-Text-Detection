I hold this view because I have read that conspiracy theorists have a common trait: they are trapped in a belief system, and that any opposing view, no matter how much evidence it is supported by, is seen by them as more than an attack on their opinion, instead as an attack against them personally. I haven't studied religion in any great depth, I am not a religious person, and I was brought up in a tolerant family who weren't particularly religious either. From what I have seen and read on the news and in books, (including the recent debate between Bill Nye and Ken Ham) certain groups of people choose to believe a literal account of what the Bible says, and they put this forward as a counter-argument to any evidence put to them. To me, there are strong parallels between this lack of critical thinking in Creationism, and the conspiracy theorists' refusal to believe evidence put forward to them. Hello, users of CMV!
