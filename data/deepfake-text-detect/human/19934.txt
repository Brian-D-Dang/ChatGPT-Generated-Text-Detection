While I will accept that perhaps the country needed a certain "jolt" to the system while we first became integrated, such policies are no longer required. They have proved to help very very small numbers of people while leaving "communities" greatly behind. I believe that any race-based Affirmative Action program (for both higher learning and employment) is inherently racist. It promotes decisions which are weighted differently based on the color of their skin. Treating people differently because of how they look is something that I was taught being a bad thing even at a young age. Because people still see that the world will treat them differently based on skin color, be it better or worse, this will only serve to make them feel less integrated with society as a whole and instead be part of a group in a country with many groups. With race becoming more and more blended over time due to the increasing popularity of interracial procreation, the idea of race becomes less and less meaningful. By clinging to race-based programs and even to the terms "black" and "white" we only entrench ourselves further in racial divide. To preemptively counter the most common argument: saying that "some people were not born with the same opportunities and therefore need a leg up" is not without merit. However claiming that all people of a certain race need a leg up treats race as sort of a handicap and again is inherently racist. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
