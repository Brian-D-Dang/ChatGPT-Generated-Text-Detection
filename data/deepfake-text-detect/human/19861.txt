When I read about the Indiana legislation that sparked from the right wing Christian bakers refusing to make a cake for a gay wedding I thought this is ridiculous they shouldn't be able to discriminate against gay people. But then I thought, what if I owned a screen print shop and Westboro Baptist Church wanted me to print up a bunch of homophobic shirts I'd tell them to get the hell out. Or if I was a tattoo artist and someone wanted a neo-nazi tattoo should I have to do that as well? Even if I think the beliefs of someone else are wrong, they may hold those anti-gay beliefs just as strongly as I hold my own. Furthermore, if we remove values and morals from the equation, what if I owned a restaurant and my crazy ex wanted to come in just to be rude could I tell her to leave and that she wasn't welcome?
