Today a cat passed on to a busy road. It stood there and was partially injured , then killed by other cars passing over it. My sister cried out emotionally watching this poor animal suffer. I however did not feel anything. Watching a animal die will at bit unpleasant is not something one should show emotion for. The animal itself was feral, it had no owners to care for it. We also show no connection to the animal our relationship is like myself viewing a tree in another Field. I am a wage earner, I have no duty of care to an animal running across the road. It makes sense to feel nothing for the animal as it is another of the many organisms which die and don't effect our lives in any meaningful way. This is not about arguing weather road kill is bad or good for the enviroment, rather my own emotional reaction to seeing a animal die senselessly. I am arguing it is fine to experience no emotion.
