A friend of mine just had a baby. When I told my girlfriend, she immediately asked "Is it a cute baby?" I told her it looks exactly like every other white baby on the planet. She seemed upset with this answer and changed the subject rather than argue with me. I don't really think there's an argument here. Every god damn baby looks the same. I'll demonstrate my point. If someone said they had a baby and posted your baby picture there is no scientific way you or anyone else would know. If someone made an album of 100 different pictures of two different babies (50 each), there is no way to tell which picture is of which baby. The only way someone could know it was two different babies is if they were both in the same picture. Picture a baby in your head. I guarantee it looked exactly like the baby I pictured in my head. It had big eyes, cheeks, and you also pictured a pastel colored blanket didn't you? Do a google image search for "baby." It's the same baby over and over. Either there is only one baby model out there or all babies look the same. A quick google search for baby models shows the former is not the case. There are some conditions though. Babies of different races can be distinguished. Babies with hair look different than babies that are bald. And babies sometimes have different eye colors. These are the only variables within babies. Now please change my view.
