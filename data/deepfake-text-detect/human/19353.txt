In the comments section of [this] post, I noticed a heavy bias towards the idea that taking pictures of people in a public place is somehow an immoral thing to do. I Don't understand this. As far as I see it, when entering a public place, an individual can be seen by those around them. It is also true that in many public places, you are likely being recorded on CCTV in various points anyway, so objecting to others taking images seems irrational. I should also add that I obviously don't advocate photographing people for criminal means such as blackmail or libel, but in most other cases I see nothing immoral about taking photographs. I am looking forward to learning about the counter arguments, so thank you in advance
