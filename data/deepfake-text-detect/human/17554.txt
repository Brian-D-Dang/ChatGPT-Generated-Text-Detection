I don't know much about this situation. This is an instance where I am instantly ready and willing to change this view if there's a good reason. I am just having difficulty understanding the level of "crisis" here. From my reading it seems that Russia is after Crimea, and that Crimea is largely Russian heritage and wants to join. Their lawmakers just unanimously voted to join. I can see the obvious opposition to a Russian invasion and occupation, but if Crimea decides to join Russia, what's the danger in letting them break off of Ukraine? EDIT: Damn typo in the headline. "if" not "in."
