To begin with, I'm not arguing what I think makes for an unjust war. I think Iraq and Vietnam were unjust wars and you may not. Even if you don't, I suspect you don't disagree with the premise that there is such a thing as just or unjust war. In the United States, we have an all-volunteer military. Like all other organizations, applicants will vary widely intelligence and in their depth of thinking, but all know this: they may be asked to kill another human being in combat. They are aware of this and choose this line of work because of or in spite of that fact. The notion that if one is simply following orders, he or she is provided legal and moral immunity for acts committed in service of a superior has been consistently and historically rejected. We rejected that argument from German and Japanese war criminals after World War II. Henry Wirz, the only war criminal judicially executed after the Civil War, pleaded that defense and it was rejected. Further, even though there would be serious legal consequences, a soldier could still opt out of going to a war he or she believed to be unjust. No one will be marching him out to the front with a bayonet in his back. I think most normal functional people would go to prison before killing someone for an unjust reason. So, A.) we have an all-volunteer military that understands its function, B.) the notion that following orders provides immunity from moral and legal consequences has been consistently rejected and C.) the soldier has one last chance to turn back before going to battle. Therefore, I believe that in an unjust war, those who participate in it and take another human life are tantamount to murderers.
