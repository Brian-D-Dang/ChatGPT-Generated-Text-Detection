After Pearl Harbor, FDR gave the order to round up Japanese-Americans and other similar immigrants in internment camps based on the (flawed) idea that they might or would betray America for their native country. Even though the Supreme Court upheld the executive order 9066 under Korematsu v. US and its precedent has not been overturned, I doubt that another administration would dare attempt to intern a whole race of Americans again, regardless of circumstances (except under the one specific case of a widespread epidemic that was tied to a race-based genetic aliment like Tay-Sachs disease). Not only would the targeted population rebel, I'd guess that a significant majority of the citizenry would oppose the measure. Moreover, it would probably be grounds of impeachment of the president. Without the support of the people, the president would have to back down or be thrown out of office. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
