I came here early sunday, 11:15. The place was almost empty, I got a table right away. I had a Boston tea (like a Arnold Palmer but with cranberry), it was pretty good. Service was prompt and attentive yet not overbearing and annoying. I ordered the crab steamer pot, crab, shrimp, corn cob, potatoes, and scallops. The crab was crisp shelled, sweet and tender. The shrimp was yummy and cleaned well. The sauce that it all came in (butter and white wine) was rich and delicious. The scallops were well done and not gritty. The potatoes were quartered and had a great crispy crust that absorbed the sauce well. My only complaint wad that the corn was a bit over done for my taste, but I like mine very crunchy. The cheddar bay biscuits were great and bottomless to boot. When I left the place was packed! Get here early! My check was 24 and I left happy, full, and satisfied. If yer not a seafood snob and you realize that yer in the middle of the desert, try this place for a reasonable priced and above average seafood meal.
