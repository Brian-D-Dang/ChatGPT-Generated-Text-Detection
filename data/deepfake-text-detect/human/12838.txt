"Your annual re-evaluation results are in, Geoffrey," came the familiar, monotone voice of Master Computer. Some people found it creepy, but I was actually fond of the emotionless machine. You could always rely on its honesty and incorruptibility. Today, however, I would've loved to have been able to bribe, coerce or manipulate it. "Sandra!" I called out to my wife. "Computer's back with my new score." I took a deep breath as Sandra walked in, a familiar look of worry on the face, and turned back towards the screen. "How'd I do, M.C.?" I'm sure it had sounded like a great idea at the time, separating the good from the evil. The good don't deserve to suffer the misdeeds of the evil, and what could be a more appropriate way to punish those who commit them? And I'm sure it seemed like a good idea to have the re-evaluations. After all, people change over time and it would be absurd to ignore corruption and remorse. The problem was its effect on human relationships. It was hard to make friends, let alone fall in love, when everyone you know might be in different zones the next year. Maybe it wouldn't be a problem if there weren't so many different tiers. Four or five might've been fine, but with two-hundred, the slightest change in behaviour could knock you into a different zone. This is was led to the invention of the "goodness tracker" app that allowed anyone to keep count of how they were doing on a day-to-day basis. The computer replied in the same dull voice. "Your score is 151, Geoffrey." Sandra smiled at me as I breathed a sigh of relief. It had taken a lot of theft to make up for that kidney donation.
