" Get out! " I watch my boss moving through the store, holding a cross in front of him as he ushers two vampires toward the front door. " But, but... " they protest, hissing. " Your ad is very clear, flesh apples are only eighty-five cents a pound. " My boss sighs. " I already told you. That's a misprint. It was supposed to say ' fresh apples " This is false advertising. " Says the taller vampire, as my boss pushes them both out into the night. " I'll be calling the better business bureau. " Screams the other over the whoosh of the automatic door closing. My boss twists the lock and turns to look at me standing at the register. " Phil, turn off the lights. " " Still five minutes until closing time. " I say, holding back a smile. " Then I'll pay you five minutes for free. Stop complaining and let's close it up! " He storms back towards his office. I flip off the lights, and head over to the closet to grab a broom. This has been an insane week, ever since that " flesh apples " misprint. We've had vampires, ghouls, and other things that I don't even have a name for. Thankfully no one makes too much trouble at the grocery store, after all, humans have to have food and the undead have to have humans, so we're like neutral territory. I'm just glad the week is over, and the new ads start tomorrow. Hopefully all of these creatures will go back into the shadows. " Argh! " I hear the scream from the offices, and I drop my broom and run towards the sound. I push the door open, expecting to see the worst, but all I see if my boss sitting at his desk, holding his head in his hands. " What's wrong? " I gasp, out of breath. " Look at the new ad. " He groans, throwing it towards me. I snatch it out the air, and I see right on the front page, an advertisement for our all new " Wheat Brain Muffins. " I sigh. " I'll get the shotgun. "
