When I was a kid, I pirated most games and movies because I had literally no money. A lot of people I talked about this said "if you can't afford something, simply accept that you can't have it instead of stealing it.." I never felt like I was stealing though, nobody lost anything. What damage did I cause by downloading and playing a game I never would've bought anyway? No matter if I pirated or not, the game developer got a net zero out of me. It could actually even have a positive effect if I spread the word about how good the game is. Please explain how kid me was a thief that did actual damage to a company.
