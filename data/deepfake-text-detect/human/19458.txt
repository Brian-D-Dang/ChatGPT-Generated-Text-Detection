Water has a lot going for it. Let me know if any of the following points are off base or challengeable in any way! It is the most widely available liquid. More than any other liquid, it often comes for free, e.g. through drinking fountains or ordering at a restaurant. Other than being free, it is also the cheapest. It's a utility that comes straight to your house for less money than any other liquid out there. Water bottles also tend to be cheaper than other bottled liquids. it is the healthiest. No sugar, no questionable artificial sweeteners, no calories! As long as you eat a healthy, balanced diet, water is all you need and has no negative side-effects. (I am aware of water intoxication but that applies to all liquids.) CMV'd by ubearsnchairs If you're only drinking water and have it around all the time, then that would be very convenient, as water has many other uses as well! Keeping cool, washing off dirt, etc. You would never want to wash your hands with soda because that would make your hands sticky. For all these reasons, water is the ultimate liquid!
