Ideally (depending on body mass, age, gender, ethnic background, etc.) you should be eating 2000 calories a day and getting exercise. 1200 is about as low as you should even consider going. 800 calories a day is for obese people (with ample body fat stored up) and anorexics (who want malnutrition problems). Without us knowing your body mass, age, gender, ethnic background, etc, we can't give any sort of advice.
