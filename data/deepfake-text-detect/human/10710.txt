Sound is a wave. Think of a beach. If one wave, combines with another wave, they form one bigger wave. Same with sound, except cancellation is the opposite. The sound wave that is not wanted (i.e. background noise) is cancelled by a wave that is the opposite of it. For instance, if the background noise is a high wave (3 above normal) (oversimplification), a low wave 3 below normal) will cancel it out so it equals 0 therefore there is no sound. This is called superposition btw
