I was watching football the other day, and saw the cheerleading section. I was just thinking, cheerleading is supposed to pump up people with dancing, but it's all women, the dance moves are pretty provocative, and their outfits were really revealing and sexual, showing cleavage and short shorts. This isn't an attack on cheerleading, but it seems like cheerleading is supposed to pander to a mostly male audience with attractive women. Realize I'm not saying that cheerleading was established for this purpose, I'm saying that the current state of cheerleading is focused on sexuality. Also, just realize I say Football instead of all professional sports simply because I don't watch enough basketball or other sports to know that the cheerleaders are or aren't the same as those in football.
