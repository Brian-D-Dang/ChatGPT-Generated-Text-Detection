By "practical reason," I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election. I admit there can be other reasons to votesocial pressure, solidarity, civic pride, etc. But on a practical level, I can reasonably expect no difference between the world in which I vote and the world in which I stay home, except that in the former I'd have to go out of my way to perform additional actions. If I'm trying to decide whether to perform those actions, based on pure self-interest, there is no reason for me to vote. I'm setting this at the level of national elections (specifically thinking of U.S. elections) because it's true that, given a small enough "nation," your individual vote would carry a significant probability of making a difference. This is a classic example of a [collective action problem] , and after considering this class of problems thoroughly, I've come to the conclusion that there is no self-interested practical reason to participate in these cases, barring external motivators (such as added incentives). It would be nice to find a reason to believe this isn't a case, so I look forward to someone convincing me!
