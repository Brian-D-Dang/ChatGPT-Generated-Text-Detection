It does no good to speak of roads not taken, For every decision leads paths untrodden. But fear not for what may have been, It will always remain unseen, A network of roads left clean. nbsp; Focus on the here and now, The present, the future, the daily routine. Do not wish to change the past, For that is a mindset that can not last, What is done has passed. nbsp; Change the future, better yourself, Live life full, find peace of mind. Today is a new day, tomorrow too, Life goes on no matter how blue, So find peace you can make yourself anew, The future is yours do not be mistaken, For it does no good to speak of roads not taken.
