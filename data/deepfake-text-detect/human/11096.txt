What do you mean by "long term function"? What does it mean for something to "work best"? What actual metrics are you using for "best"? Is Russia "functioning"? Is the US? Is China? Is North Korea? You'll need to clarify what you need to have explained. Edit: I've removed the thread, feel free to respond once you've elaborated on what you need to have explained.','The question is too vague to answer properly. Even if you did have more specific metrics, there may not be a proper way to calculate them, especially for historic societies.', "If a political historian could answer this, they'd be putting themselves and all other political scientists out of a job. There is likely no'best' system, as each system prioritises certain things, and suffers handicaps in the name of it. (e.g. the American government has certain inbuilt inefficiencies, but those inefficiencies are intentional as part of the checks and balances between the branches of government) What should be prioritised is likely going to be heavily dependent on the culture of the society the government has been constructed from, along with that society's recent and long term history and traditions. This is the kind of question that likely doesn't have an answer, only a bunch of debate on the merits and lack thereof with regards to different systems.
