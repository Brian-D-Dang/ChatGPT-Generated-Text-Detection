Well, my faith in Claim Jumpers has restored! We had a group function today, serving our local support team. Our appetizers came out before our meal and we were given adequate time to eat then before the arrival of our entrees. We were served fresh baked bread along with our entrees, which as a very pleasant surprise! We pretty all ordered the chicken pot pie which came very recommended by colleagues...and it was well deserved. It was very large and extremely delicious!
