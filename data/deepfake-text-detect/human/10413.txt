I believe this comic expresses the argument most cogently: Now, to my wall of text: I run a small software company that's reasonably successful. I've been doing this for the past 15 years. I've been employing people for years that I have never met - and quite possibly never will meet. Last time I met any of my developers face to face was maybe 6 years ago. I perceive no value whatsoever in meeting face to face. None. Working together in an office is an impediment to getting work done, and is a source of constant interruption. Email is generally better for productivity than face to face contact, or instant messaging. Both face to face contact, and instant messaging, are distractions, and are useful primarily in the situation that you cannot progress on anything without immediate input. Such situations are extraordinary. The people I meet face to face in my life are my wife, my son, and our nanny. I don't have a social need for more. I believe people who think they need face to face contact for work in software development are either confusing social needs with work - or possibly, I would fear, aren't competent to work on their own. Or maybe they're involved in some kind of work that involves extraordinary synchronization - the kind of which I do not know. If someone can't work independently, and must constantly interrupt other developers, I would consider them a burden, rather than an asset. To be an asset, one must be able to get work done on one's own, and coordinate as necessary. In fact, I would go so far as to say that, if you're not going to physically touch the other person, there is nothing you can do in a face to face meeting that you cannot do online. There's literally no reason to meet unless you're going to kiss, or have sex, or give a person a massage.
