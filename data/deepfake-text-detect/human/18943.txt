I really, really don't get it when women dress up in scantily clad outfits and see certain characters as role models when they're essentially the fantasies of the men who created them. It's even stranger when women dress up in the tightest outfits possible and then complain about being ogled by hordes of men at conventions. EDIT: I want to clarify that I don't think men have the right to be rude or harassing because a woman is dressed a certain way and that she has in any way given consent via her outfit. I was more referring to a woman who dresses up as, say Witchblade or Poison Ivy. Say she does this and it's a very revealing outfit and she strikes some sexy poses. Then she gets angry if anyone mentions her body or if she sees her picture somewhere like, say, Reddit and there are comments about how sexy she is. I simply believe that she knows as she's putting the costume together she's fulfilling the sexual fantasy of many people and that many people will respond by seeing her as possible fap material. I do NOT mean that if a man harasses her she should not be offended. I have also read a great deal of insightful comments that have made me rethink some points.
