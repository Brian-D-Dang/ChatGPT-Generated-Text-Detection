I think that karma is a useful system for sorting posts, and I think it is probably fine to believe that the high karma you have received is a good thing if you got it through original content posts or by sharing things you would have otherwise shared. However, I believe that going around reposting old content for karma and "hitting those rising threads early" in order to gain karma is naive and a legitimate indicator of low intelligence. And, when some people take this to the extreme by being unethical in order to gain karma, this is an example of extreme, extreme stupidity and should be more actively controlled by reddit. CMV.
