We got here before opening (they open an hour after the preserve opens) and were completely ignored by several people who walked past us. Wolfgang, here's some helpful tips to increase business: 1) We just wanted coffee, tea, and a sweet roll. You need to have a separate section or counter in the front that opens early and has these items for purchase. 2) If your staff passes by someone standing in the doorway and makes eye contact, they should at least greet the person with a hello. I know that it was before opening, but if your door is unlocked and people are buzzing around, it's common courtesy to acknowledge a person. We just wanted to ask if we could come back when you open and get coffee or tea to go.
