The DEA [apparently] directs local law enforcement to find alternate evidence to back up cases that were in fact created via secret means. They might find a drug dealer via secret wiretaps, but instruct the police to pretend a random traffic stop had uncovered the evidence. I realize that the legal cases are all being built with non-planted evidence, but I worry that reliance on secret (unexamined sources) may cause the police to trust corroborating evidence more strongly than it would otherwise warrant, or even to misinterpret evidence as pointing the same way as the secret non-evidence points. Can anyone explain why this is reasonable?
