I am writing this to prove a point to a friend. He says he believes that anyone can get better at talking to women. That it is a skill and can be practiced and improvement can be achieved. I am 26, male. I have always been awkward. I have a hard time speaking to people I don't know. I don't stutter, but my brain moves faster than my mouth and it can be hard to get sentences out properly even with friends. I have female friends, but as soon as I try talking to women in a romantic way it just ends bad. Probably sixty interactions in my adult life so far. Not only did none of them end positively, but I didn't get any better. I have had women sneer, say, "oh, gross" and walk away. If any improvement could be achieved, it simply wouldn't be worth the discomfort of being rejected time and time again. If I could improve, I would be almost dying before I got anywhere. So in summation, based on my experiences, I know I will never be able to talk to women. I am resigned to a life without sex, or meaningful romantic relationships. Change my view.
