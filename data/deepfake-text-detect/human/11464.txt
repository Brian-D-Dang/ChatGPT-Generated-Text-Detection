Uniqlo cut 90 of the workforce in one of its Tokyo warehouses, and replaced them with robots. Now the warehouse operates 24 hours a day. Robots are able to unload trucks, count inventory, and put products in cardboard boxes and label them. There is very little human input needed. Uniqlo plans on spending 887 million to automate all of their warehouses in Japan and abroad.
