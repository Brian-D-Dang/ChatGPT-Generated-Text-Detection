What is the actual impact of unequal wealth distribution? Is the argument that rich people cause poor people? I'm not sure I buy that. If money and wealth were fixed, then yes, distribution matters, but they're not. The rich get richer, yes, but so do the poor and the middle class - albeit at a slower rate. But if I give you 1 you're 1 better off, even if I give the next guy 100. And the poor in America are rich compared to the poor in most of the rest of the world. Perhaps the more compelling argument is that the rich control the system (government, economy etc) which allows them to stay rich and keep the poor poor. If that's the case, the the problem isn't really wealth distribution, but economic mobility. As long as rich people can get poor and poor people can get rich (even over the course of generations), I don't really see an inherent harm in unequal wealth distribution. CMV
