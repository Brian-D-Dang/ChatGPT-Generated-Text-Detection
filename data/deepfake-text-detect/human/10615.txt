Water transfers heat more efficiently than air. When something feels cold it's because heat is being transferred from your skin to whatever you're touching. Since water absorbs the heat more readily than air, it feels colder.," "Air isn't as good at transferring heat compared to something like water or steel (sit on a room temperature steel bench vs. a room temperature wooden bench, and the steel one will feel more cold). When you feel cold, what you're feeling is heat being transferred out of you. If there is no breeze, you feel a certain way. If there's a breeze, you will get colder faster (because the moving air is pulling the heat away from you), and if you get into water, its quite good at pulling heat from you. Get out of the water and have a breeze blow on you while you're wet, all of the water starts evaporating, pulling even more heat from you.
