The document that was drawn up and voted on by the FCC has yet to be released, and none of us pleebs know exactly what is in it. The FCC has in the past shown that it is more than willing to kowtow to morality based special interest groups to censor the content that it regulates. This occurred with both television and radio. With radio in particular the FCC started by simply regulating the waves themselves (who got them, the wattage they could broadcast, etc.) but eventually grew to regulate the actual content within them. The rules for radiobroadcast TV at this time are extremely random and that is due to groups lobbying to have specific morality rules in place. I think that this will be the first step to having an internet controlled by morality police.
