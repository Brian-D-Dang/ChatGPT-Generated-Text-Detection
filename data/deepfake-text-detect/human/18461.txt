Pretty much what it says in the title. I'll explain further by saying that I believe that government is a good thing, the consciousness of society when done right, and taxes are the natural cost of having a good government. While high taxes do not necessarily mean a good government, I believe a good government needs high taxes in order to pay for the services, personnel, and resources that entails. So what am I missing? Why is a good government a government that governs least, and thus needs less money? Who ever heard of a structures that does it's purpose best by doing it least. I don't get it. Please help me get it.
