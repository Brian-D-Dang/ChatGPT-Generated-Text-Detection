It seems logical to me that school hours should match those of the typical office working hours in order to facilitate working parents. As it currently stands children are typically in school before 9am and finish rather early in the day (e.g. 3pm) this poses many difficulties for parents who work, particularly single parents because they need to be there to collect there children from school (younger ones) andor pay for child care which is expensive. If school hours were to match those of the typical working hours, it would make it easy for parents with young children to get back into work as their child with be supervised whilst they work without substantial economic burden of paying for childcare. The extra hours of school need not be filled with further education but could be used to provide longer breaksrecessesplay-times for children, more physical activities or a "homework club" were the day's homework could be completed and thus wouldn't need to be done at home.
