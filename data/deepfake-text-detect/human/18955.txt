Once or twice a year, the billionaire Koch brothers host a "summit" meeting with a bunch of fellow billionaires, politicians (mostly Republican), and other right-wing types. They talk about, basically, how to remove any barriers to them just getting richer and richer. The title of this summit was "American Courage: Our Commitment to a Free Society." Of course, the only freedom they're in favour of is their freedom to rip us all off, and the only society they're in favour of is their high-society billionaire friends and their puppets in the halls of government and the media. Brief excerpt from the original article in The Nation: According to another source who also attended the conference, 300 individuals - worth at least a billion each - were present. This source said that their explicit goal was to raise 500 million to take the Senate in the 2014 midterms and another 500 million "to make sure Hillary Clinton is never president." Three hundred billionaires in attendance is likely an exaggeration; to put that figure in perspective, there are 492 total billionaires in the United States by Forbes' count. The Koch network raised an estimated 407 million in the 2012 presidential election, according to an analysis by the Washington Post and the Center for Responsive Politics. I believe that these people have an agenda to foster their increasing greed, to take power away from ordinary working citizens, to impoverish everyone else just to give multi-billionaires more billions, to stifle discontent, to redirect anger away from themselves (check out how most of the "Tea Party" organizations were astro-turfed by the Koch brothers et al.), to cripple democracy, and to just make sure that no one gets in their way.
