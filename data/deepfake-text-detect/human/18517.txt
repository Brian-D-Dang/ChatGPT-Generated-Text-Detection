Columbus Day celebrates the man who "discovered" America, if you define discovering pretty loosely. He did not prove that the earth was round, as it had been proven much earlier. Not only was he not the first human in the Americas, he wasn't even the first European (Leif Erikson), and although he did usher in a new age of exploration, there are many other explorers more worthy of praise. Columbus enslaved and sold many of the natives he encountered, and had his men brutally rape and murder the others, all in search of a profit. The "age of exploration" that he began was also an age of disease, land-taking, violent and forced conversion, and murder. If the purpose of Columbus Day is to just have another day off, there are much better holidays that this day could be. A great suggestion I have heard is "Explorers Day," to honor all of the explorers that have had a significant effect on history, including our modern-day explorers, astronauts. CMV
