Yes, i said it. I'd rather watch Naruto, One Piece, Hunter x Hunter or Death Note than Sword Art Online, No Game no Life or whatever other harem there is out there. I feel like there is a huge difference between shonen lovers and Weaaboos. Firstly, i was firstly interested in anime because of how badass it looked. I was maybe 12, and things like ass pulls, consistency etc didnt matter as long as i saw Gaara curb stomping Rock Lee using only sand. It was fun to watch, fun to talk about and it waa perfect for 12 years old me. As i grew older, i started noticing problems with Naruto so i no longer liked it that much. However, soon after i discovered One Piece, HxH and other shonen. Those had the same amount of badass moments yet they were better written and with less plot holes. However, when i tried to watch any other anime i noticed that it was just boring. I am NOT interested in lolis, harems or waifus. Some stuff range from slightly creepy to pedo teritory. Also, not only the people who watch animes are weird and man-childs, but in japan watching any anime except shonen will make you a weirdo. And honestly, i'd rather be honest with myself that i watch children's cartoons than pretend that some shitty harems are actually VERY adult-like and delude myself until i reach rcringepics teritory.
