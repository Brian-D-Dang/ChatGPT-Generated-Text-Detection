As light field images continue to increase in use and application, it becomes necessary to adapt existing image processing methods to this unique form of photography. In this paper we explore methods for applying neural style transfer to light field images. Feed-forward style transfer networks provide fast, high-quality results for monocular images, but no such networks exist for full light field images. Because of the size of these images, current light field data sets are small and are insufficient for training purely feed-forward style-transfer networks from scratch. Thus, it is necessary to adapt existing monocular style transfer networks in a way that allows for the stylization of each view of the light field while maintaining visual consistencies between views. To do this, we first generate disparity maps for each view given a single depth image for the light field. Then in a fashion similar to neural stylization of stereo images, we use disparity maps to enforce a consistency loss between views and to warp feature maps during the feed forward stylization. Unlike previous work, however, light fields have too many views to train a purely feed-forward network that can stylize the entire light field with angular consistency. Instead, the proposed method uses an iterative optimization for each view of a single light field image that backpropagates the consistency loss through the network. Thus, the network architecture allows for the incorporation of pre-trained fast monocular stylization network while avoiding the need for a large light field training set.
