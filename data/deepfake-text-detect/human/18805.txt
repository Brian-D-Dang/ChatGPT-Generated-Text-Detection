Think of breakfast food. You think eggs, bacon, sausage, coffee, tea, etc. The American breakfast is a very set concept, even if it can vary dramatically from day-to-day. There is a harsh separation between breakfast foods and everything else. Dinner is the same way. It's our 'main course' of the day. We have a lot of meat, a side of a grain or vegetable, and it's great. But lunch? Lunch is just middle-of-the-day dinner. It's exactly the same. Hell, lunch is often dinner from the night before.
