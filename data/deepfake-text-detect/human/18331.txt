I believe that the standard of living of a country is more important than its income distribution. To support my view I'm going to be using GDP figures and the Gini coefficient. For example, a developing country such as Pakistan has a current gini coefficient of 30.6, in comparison the United States possesses a significantly higher gini rating of 41.1. What the lower gini coefficient of Pakistan suggests is that the nations's wealth is more equally distributed among the citizens than the United States. So although Pakistan has a more "fair" income distribution, it doesn't they are better off. I'm open to having my view changed, but I personally believe that the recent news of the the 1 getting richer isn't as big of a concern as its made to be. Hello, users of CMV!
