That's what I believe. Using the term is derogatory, it distances and dehumanizes others. I get aggravated every time they call someone upset or angry "mentally ill." They are not "ill," they aren't suffering from an "illness," but from a response and a reaction to their lives and they haven't been able to speak out. Anyone of us can experience it. It doesn't matter how smart you are, how happy, how rich you are or who you look like, something bad or terrible will always happen to you and you won't look at life the same way again. Because once you go there and learn that life isn't as good as others would lead you to believe there is no going back and that's what makes it so hard to shake. You're essentially giving people these happy pills to delude them again.
