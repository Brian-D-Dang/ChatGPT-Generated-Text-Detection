The domain owner that owns URL2 has set up an automated redirect. You go to URL1 and it automatically forwards you to featureURL2 Notice how "k3R1ajg8dTY" is the same in both, that's the actual video identifier. If you know how to construct youtube URLs, then all you really need is the video identifier to construct the link. URL0 works similarly, but redirecting to the applicable reddit link. Other link shorteners let you put in your own link and it creates an entry on a database and spits out the shortened link for you. Anyone who goes to that shortened link gets redirected to the original link you provided to the shortener.
