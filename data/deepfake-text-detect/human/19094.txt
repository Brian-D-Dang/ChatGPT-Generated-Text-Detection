Whilst I appreciate that developers need to earn a living, I feel that in-app purchases cheapen the whole 'Apple experience'. No longer is a free game, actually free. A lot of them use a pay to winprogress model, and for this reason, I usually don't even bother reading the description of a game if I see that it has in-app purchases. There are a few games that use the in-app purchase model well, I've seen some offer the first chapter of a game for free, and then charge for subsequent levels (e.g. The Walking Dead). This, in my book, is fair, but in-app purchases are abused so much, that I think that they do a lot more harm than good. A lot of paid games games have also started using in-app purchases, and it's got to the point where I'm pleasantly surprised if I haven't been asked to buy gemsgold in the first five minutes of playing a game.
