I don't deny that psychological scientists have made many important and useful contributions to society. And I'm not as wedded to the idea that psychology is unnecessary as the title might suggest. But the "hard science is all that matters" voice inside of me is strong, and I'd like to try and quell it a bit. So far, a good argument I've heard against my position has to do with the placebo effect. Yes, although the placebo effect can be boiled down to the activation of certain chemicals in certain parts of the brain, what actually makes the placebo effect compelling is that it shows how powerful the effects of thoughts and beliefs can be on the body, a phenomenon a psychologist would probably be better suited to study, rather than a biologist or chemist.
