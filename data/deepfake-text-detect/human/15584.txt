We waited for about an hour for brunch which is a tad too long. The server seemed very rushed and very short with us when she greeted us. When we asked for water she only brought one glass and I had to wave her down to get a second. The food was not very good. It seemed fake, like it had a bunch of fillers. I would best describe it as the IKEA of breakfast food. It was also very bland. The worst part was that both of plates consisted of about 80 hashbrowns. I'm not sure why people love this place so much. We will not be back.
