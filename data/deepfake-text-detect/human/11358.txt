Axiom Space has been selected by NASA to build the first commercial habitat module for the International Space Station. The module will be used as a destination for future commercial spaceflight missions, including housing experiments, technology development, and more. Axiom Space was founded in 2016 and it has a lot of ex-NASA talent on its team. Its goal is to eventually build its own private space station using modules. NASA has extended the planned service life of the ISS, but it is encouraging private and commercial entities to begin space ventures in order to eventually replace the space station.
