Noodles. Death and noodles. That's all I could see. Well, that and a single bril sawing through the matted spaghetti. Thank Mazdu! Suffocating in a pile of corpses and sauces had never been Plan A. I heard Tammie's thin, reedy voice call out. "You in there, Sivern?" I grunted, the best I could do with four hundred plus pounds of bodies and noodle stand over me. It took some work, but Tammie got me out. She may have been a bitch once, but now she seemed like a glorious Valkyrie, come to save me. "What now?" She asked, cautiously. "You beat him, but he'll be back, with other foods and more slaves." "No matter," I said, more confidently than I felt. "He underestimates just how crazy I am. I'll make Lord Fieri regret the day he tried to bring his little establishment into my town!" "What about Duchess Ray? Or the High Pontiff Lagasi? They might try to move in on us in our moment of weakness." I thought for a second. "Tammie, I need to make a call. We're going to accept the protection of that barbarian, Brown Alton."
