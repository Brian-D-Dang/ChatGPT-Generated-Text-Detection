Not unless we could see outside the universe and someone was there to tell us it was fabricated or left behind something for us to infer that from. But would it matter?','Depends on how good the simulation is. If it was perfect, preserving every possible observable phenomenon, then we would observe it as being just as it simulates. Some people might ask "what if you could see the simulation from the outside." Well, how would you get to the outside without invalidating that above assumption that every observable phenomenon is preserved?
