"Safe" Don't have to worry about the majority of the community using the downvote button as a disagree button Example: [The most recent example that is driving my view] In this thread, I am calmly attempting to offer an answer to the question, without any personal attacks, yet my comments are getting downvoted. Of all the times I've posted on CMV, this issue has literally only happened one time. Justification: The tone of at least one responder to any post that doesn't conform to popular opinion on every other debatediscussion sub is:'You are wrong, therefore everything you say is invalid' The tone on CMV is:'Your statements are wrong, and this is why' The CMV community can have a calm, rational conversation about anything, even views that are extremely unpopular. I feel safe here, and I think others do as well. Just check out this [Hitler wasn't that evil] post on CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] . If you see a comment that has broken one, it is more effective to report it than downvote it. Speaking of which, [downvotes don't change views] ! If you are thinking about submitting a CMV yourself, please have a look through our [popular topics wiki] first. Any questions or concerns? Feel free to [message us] . Happy CMVing!
