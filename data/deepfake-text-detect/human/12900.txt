"Oh great," said one boy to the other. "Grandfather is telling the stories again." The smaller boy remained silent, but shook his head and rolled his eyes. He then got up and moved closer to the campfire. Not to hear the stories again, but for the warmth of the flames. " ..... even though his arms were weary and his back was tight, King Doug would travel along his kingdom, delivering gifts to all in his realm," Grandfather recalled, "He was a good king stout in the belly and always with a smile on his face." "Grandfather, tell us another," a young girl pleaded. "Alright," he said kindly. "I know you all are hungry, but perhaps this story can help you all content yourselves with what you have. The Cosmos tells us that only through the denial of pleasure, can we all become Masters of our Domain..." The two boys snuck away from the fire, determined to avoid another telling of the same familiar tale. "SHELDON! FRASIER!" their mother barked. "Come back here and listen to your grandfather's stories." The boys' shoulders drooped noticeably, as they turned back to the fire. It was going to be a long night.
