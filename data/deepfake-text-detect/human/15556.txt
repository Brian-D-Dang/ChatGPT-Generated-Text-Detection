Out of all the people's lives you walk into, you had to walk into mine. This burger was almost as bad as Bob Big Boys Burger Boss food truck. The patty is noticeably bad. Needs flavor. Texture was weird too. Reminded me of those gross store bought frozen cheeseburgers my Mom used to keep in the freezer sometimes when I was younger. I had some trouble finding the yelp page or I would've kept walking right on by this joint. Coming out, the presentation of food was sloppy too. Shredded lettuce strewn all over. Have some pride in the back kitchen people!
