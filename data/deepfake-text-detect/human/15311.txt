Great introductory special for a brazilian for 20 but geesh louise..painless? I did not think so! And I'm tough, and a brazilian veteran! When that wax did not want to come off it did not want to come off. I have never had a waxer rip at a strip like that ever. That kind of wax works as the strip as well, and for whatever reason it didnt want to come off in a big sensitive spot! It felt like torture while I laughed and tried not to think about it. Since I have stuck with the good old faithful method. But I do have to say my room mate still goes there all the time for her eyebrows and lips, but I am mentally scared for life.
