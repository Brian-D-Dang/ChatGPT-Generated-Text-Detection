This was hands down one of the top places I've ever eaten. Amazing food, beautiful cozy and inviting atmosphere and the service was phoenomial to say the least! I believe our servers name was Georgio? Not positive on the name but he was spectacular! SUPER friendly, helped us find great drink and food choices based on what we were looking for. Answered every question we had thoroughly, he was quick and effiecient, even made us laugh and took a picture for us before we left! Of course knowing this is the'Cake Boss' restaurant, needless to say the dessert was on point. The drinks...they were certainly not messing around with a lack of alcohol but it wasn't so much to ruin the flavor of the drink! With their current special, depending on what drink you get, you can take the glass home. Overall lovely experience and I wish we had on in Kansas City!
