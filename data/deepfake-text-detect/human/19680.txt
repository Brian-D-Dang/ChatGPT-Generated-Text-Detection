I find the possibility of life outside of Earth an undeniable fact. In short, the universe is too enormous to contain only one planet sustainable of housing life. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), as of 2-12-15, there are 1,814 confirmed exoplanets which have been spotted outside of our solar system, meaning if only 1 of these planets are suitable for human life, it leaves almost 20 habitable planets just within view from Earth alone. Even with these twenty planets, there could be hundreds, if not thousands, which already have a form of life occupying them who do not need Earth-like conditions to live and are outside of our viewing limitations. Just thinking of how vast the universe is, I find it inconceivable to believe Earth is the only planet capable of sustaining life. Change my view. Hello, users of CMV!
