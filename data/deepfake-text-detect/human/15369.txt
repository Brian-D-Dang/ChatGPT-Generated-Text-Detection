I visited when it was over 110 degrees and almost had the whole place to myself. There are a lot of animals to see in the zoo and plenty of fish to see in the aquarium. Be sure to go to the (free) bird feedings and pet the sting rays! See the zoo animals first because the zoo closes before the aquarium. Bring plenty of water with you because this place is bigger than it appears. There are a few water fountains near the buildings (north side of the park) with ice cold water that taste good, so you can refill a bottle there. The water fountains on the south side are in the sun and hot. The restrooms are large and pretty clean too. One thing I didn't like was cups and plastic (water) bottles all over the place. Clean up the trash. There is a great restaurant called Dillions BBQ on site and provides a great place to get out of the sun, soak up some AC, and chow down on some really good food. You can even request to sit right next to a giant shark tank! The aquarium's AC is set in the mid 70s, so these are buildings that are nice to see when it's real hot. Bring walking shoes, water and sunblock. Also, enjoy the free air show that the fighter jets from Luke Air Force base seem to put on as they practice overhead.
