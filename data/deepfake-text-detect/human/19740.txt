When I started reading HP, the first four books had all been released and I caught up with them by the time OotP came out. By the time I finished GoF, I was in love with the series, but always had reservations about The Prisoner of Azkaban. In my opinion, the best books in the series are the ones in which Harry's life is in direct danger from Voldemort or his forces, most obviously in The Chamber of Secrets, The Goblet of Fire, and The Deathly Hallows. At the time I read it, and ever since, I found the third book to be absent of danger or risk. Harry spends most of the book in fear of Sirius Black, who ends up being a misunderstood ally. Voldemort pretty much does nothing to hurt Harry (they hardly talk about him IIRC), leaving 400 pages to introducing characters and fleshing out teenage angst. Now, I'm not saying it's a bad book. I think every HP book is a great achievement in its own right. But I had, and still have, a lot of friends who thought the third book was by far the best in the series, and their reasons were never very convincing (there are werewolves, there is time travel, there is backstory, therefore it's cooler than the rest). Please CMV.
