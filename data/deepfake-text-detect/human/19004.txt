If we go back to the actual meaning of NSFW (Not Safe For Work), the idea is clearly that you don't want something on your screen that someone at work could oversee. I believe that this applies really only to images, and that it isn't necessary for text posts. An image requires only a glance to get you in trouble. If someone walks into your office, or can see over your shoulder from across the room, an image on your screen of someone's intestines hanging out or some topless lady is something they're going to recognize and possibly get you in trouble for. A text post, on the other hand, just looks like reddit. Unless someone stands over your shoulder long enough to actually read and comprehend what's on the screen, then it's no more eye-catching than any other text-based webpage that you might be on. If they recognize it as reddit and don't have a problem with you being on reddit at work, the odds are low that seeing "fuck" on the screen is going to be what crosses the line into "inappropriate use of company resources." Normally this would simply be an annoyance, but many of us use the RES NSFW filter for just this purpose, and as a result don't see a high number of text posts that got flagged as NSFW because someone asked a question that might result in someone saying "sex." So CMV. Convince me that there really is text on here worth guarding from view at work.
