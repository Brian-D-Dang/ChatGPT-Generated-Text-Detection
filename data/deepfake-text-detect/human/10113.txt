I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with 10,000 in credit card debt or someone who inflates their net worth by billions to run a major economy. Donald Trump: His self-reported net worth, in excess of "TEN BILLION DOLLARS," is significantly above third-party estimates as well as above his own figure of 7b from several months earlier, which included over 1b of bullshit naming rights. If he can inflate his own balance-sheet, who can trust him with the US' budget?? Scott Walker: Has 10,000 in credit card debt while posturing as a fiscal conservative. I do not want someone as President who will continue borrowing, and his personal borrowing habit bodes ill for our country's future (not to mention that he has nearly bankrupted Wisconsin). Also, I could not trust him with any executive power as he could use it to wipe out his personal CC and student-loan debt. CMV! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
