People are responsible for their own actions and body, IMO. If she can't handle her alcohol, she shouldn't be drinking, or drinking that much. I don't think "it's college, everyone drinks" is a good excuse or explanation. I'm just thankful she didn't get into a car and kill someone. Maybe this will prevent other people from drinking to oblivion every weekend. CMV.
