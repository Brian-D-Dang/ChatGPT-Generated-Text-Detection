I believe that policies such as affirmative action are destructive and counterintuitive, as they make it so that it is not necessarily the most qualified person being selected for a position. When applying for anything from a school to a job, many places are now focusing more on having diversity than they are on selecting the best person. It has gotten to the point that white males are at a disadvantage in life, and many will be rejected simply because they are not diverse. Furthermore, many feminist movements lately are advocating not only equal rights, but more rights. I understand that minority groups were oppressed for many years, and in my opinion equality is one of the most important things someone can have. But has this fight for equality gone too far and actually shifted the detriment to the majority? I believe it has. CMV Edit: I am talking about reverse discrimination more on a case by case level. Obviously, as a whole white males are more privileged and are the majority, but for those white males who are not privileged, I believe it is more difficult now to become privileged. If you are from a poor black family you are more likely to receive help than if you are from a poor white family, where you are expected to be privileged already and thus do not need help. Edit 2: Why are my comments being downvoted for stating my opinion. It says in the sidebar, "Downvotes don't change views! Vote based on the quality of the comment, not whether you agree or not!" Why should I be downvoted for stating my point of view, and why I disagree?
