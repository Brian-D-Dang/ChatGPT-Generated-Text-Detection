OMG! I see tall hot Asian guy! Let's follow him! OKKKKK!!! Go talk to him. He looks like he'll dance. No. I'm scared... Out of all the guys there, we found one that stuck out, but we were too wimpy to get him to dance. Epic fail. (This place is a lot less crowded than Tao and the music is just as good, with 3 seperate rooms for the folks with different taste. The main dance floor is mainstream hiphop and a bit of house mix. A few repeats here and there, but it got me goin. Every so often, the cocktails waitresses will walk by with mixed shots for free. Free, meaning take a shot for a tip. I think that's clever and a lot cheaper than buying at the bar. The shots are usually girly drinks though, like Sex On The Beach or Hurricanes. Oh, and did anyone call for a stripper pole?? There's a platform stage with 2.;) Get creative.
