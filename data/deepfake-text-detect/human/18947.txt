In our military today, it is volunteer only. You have complete choice. So if you join, and you choose an MOS that see's combat, and you're disfigured or paralyzed or you die, it's nobodies fault but yours and people should feel bad and apologize because YOU chose to sign up and YOU chose a combat MOS. If anyone thanks you for a soldiers service it should be an apologetic one meaning, "I'm sorry the idiots in charge have you fighting a pointless war "to protect the American the public's right's" when the actual war to preserve our rights should be in Washington.
