I believe that employers and employees should be free to negotiate all the terms of employment of said employee with no government interference. The exception to this rule is the enforcement of contracts between employee and employer. Note: Specific laws and examples applied to US politics, but general ideas apply to worldwide politics. This includes, but is not limited to: 1. Compensation 2. Hours 3. Overtime Pay 3. Fringe Benefits (if any, like health insurance) 4. Break Time 5. VacationPersonal Time 6. Voluntary Union Membership of employee 7. Voluntary Union Recognition by employer I feel that government interference in these matters, while benefiting some individuals, hurts most other, if not all, individuals. I have an opinion on all of the items in the list, but it would take to long to type them out here. If anyone would like to discuss them, I will do my best to respond. If anyone has an item that is not on the list, feel free to bring it up and I will do my best. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
