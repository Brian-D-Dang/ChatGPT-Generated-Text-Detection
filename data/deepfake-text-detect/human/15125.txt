This place is, by far, my favorite sushi joint in Pittsburgh. I stop in at least once or twice a week for lunch and always walk away happy. They sell prepared bento boxes (made fresh each day), as well as a handful of hot Japanese entrees (chicken teriyaki, udong). I've never had anything here I didn't love, but I'm personally partial to the rainbow roll, Oxford roll, and inari (stuffed fried tofu). If you're not very hungry, the salmon or cucumber maki are light and tasty. The family that runs the place and their employees are some of the friendliest people, and always stop to ask how you're doing and how your meal was. In terms of ambience, well, it's a food court, but the restaurant itself is fairly isolated. I've had a few lunch meetings here and haven't had a problem with it being too loud, even when it's busy. Prices are decent - I usually wind up paying around 15 for a roll and a drink. The only downside is that they don't take credit cards, so bring cash.
