We provide easy and readable GNU OctaveMATLAB code for the simulation of mathematical models described by ordinary differential equations and for the solution of optimal control problems through Pontryagin's maximum principle. For that, we consider a normalized HIVAIDS transmission dynamics model based on the one proposed in our recent contribution (Silva, C.J.; Torres, D.F.M. A SICA compartmental model in epidemiology with application to HIVAIDS in Cape Verde. Ecol. Complex. 2017, 30, 70-75), given by a system of four ordinary differential equations. An HIV initial value problem is solved numerically using the ode45 GNU Octave function and three standard methods implemented by us in OctaveMATLAB: Euler method and second-order and fourth-order Runge-Kutta methods. Afterwards, a control function is introduced into the normalized HIV model and an optimal control problem is formulated, where the goal is to find the optimal HIV prevention strategy that maximizes the fraction of uninfected HIV individuals with the least HIV new infections and cost associated with the control measures. The optimal control problem is characterized analytically using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, and the extremals are computed numerically by implementing a forward-backward fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Complete algorithms, for both uncontrolled initial value and optimal control problems, developed under the free GNU Octave software and compatible with MATLAB are provided along the article.
