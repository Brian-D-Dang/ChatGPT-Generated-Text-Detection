I've slowly been losing belief in morality. I tend to find the whole thing odd. There's this weird quality that lies outside of the physical realm and cannot be justified by it (because you can't easily leap from something existing to something being moral without something being taken as axiomatic) and yet we are bound by it with threads made up of this also strange material? All moral systems seem to start from an assumption that X is good (and we therefore must do X), and I can't seem to find any reason to believe that I should make that jump. Why should I believe in some magical moral rule when the world seems so clearly explicable without it? Why should I believe that it's anything but a bunch of illusions created by mammals that need incentives for prosocial behavior? If I place a world with moral meaning next to one without the latter seems far simpler with less baggage. CMV please.
