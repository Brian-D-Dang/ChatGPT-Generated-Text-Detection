I am not trying to diminish the problems and inequalities facing women, but at this point in time (in the western world), I think that men got it worse than women on average. The fact that men suicide 3 times as often as women is a sign of this conclusion. Men are expected to handle EVERYTHING in life. You are expected to be succesful, confident, healthy, good looking, intelligent and so on. If you go through tough shit? "MAN UP!" If you show any sign of weakness? "He's unfit for procreation!" As a man if you go through some shit you don't know where to turn. We are taught all throughout our childhood to hide our emotions and any signs of weakness and to "keep it in." Even if you do try to talk to a good friend about it, chances are he'll be just as uncomfortable and incapable of dealing with it as you because he has no "training" in it either. Women are allowed and even expected to complain and whine to her friends and it's just seen as a normal part of life, but if a man does it? He is seen as weak. If you ask any woman to list the top 3 traits of a attractive man, then "confidence" is guaranteed to be on there. So if you have some social anxiety or depression? You can forget about woving any woman. Wheras I have never ever heard a man say "she wasn't confident, so I wasn't attracted to her" As a man you are expected to get a nice paying job and own a nice house and a car. This is why so many men become alcoholics and kill themselves. We simply are not taught to deal with our emotions at a young age and so all of society expect men to be Gods at all times.
