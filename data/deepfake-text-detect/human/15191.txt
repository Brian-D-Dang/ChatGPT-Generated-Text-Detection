One of the few Cirque du Soleil that follow a story line, so if you are looking for a Cirque du Soleil show and a story this is the one to see. Although it strays a bit from the traditional style of Cirque du Soleil, it is still sure to please. We were fortunate enough to be able to purchase front section tickets for 50 off AMAZING deal! (End of summer special). KA is the show which it is the stage that is at the center of attention. It uses a sectional stage that is fully mobile it rotates and moves on a 3D axis it really adds another level of excitement to the show. I would not recommend this as anyone's first Cirque du Soleil show but for a any repeat or veteran Cirque du Soleil viewer this must make it onto your Seen it list.
