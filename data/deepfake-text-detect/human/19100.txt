I have heard many people say that they have such and such money saved for their retirement, meanwhile they do not go out much, they don't go on holiday, they will scrimp on all personal comforts in order to be able to retire and be able to do things they want to when they retire. The way I see it is that money that I earn is mine to spend, and in order to enjoy my life I want to be able to go on holidays, buy good quality organic groceries, and be able to buy personal comforts to improve my current standard of living. Money for me is not a means of happiness but it is something that can help me to experience new things and gain happiness as a result of them. I save for rainy days but have no real savings per se. This is not to say that I waste my money - I don't smoke, I don't drink excessively, I don't gamble, I rarely buy takeout and I cook my own food. I just don't see the point in sacrificing my personal comforts, hobbies and lifestyle in order to save money just so that I can have more money to spend in the far future. CMV.
