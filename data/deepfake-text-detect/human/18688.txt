All of the questions we've encountered thus far have been answered or are currently under work. Conjectures like Fermat's Last Theorem and others continue to be proved. There may very well be methods to predict currently-considered chaotic behaviour in the future with new and unheard of methods. What seems impossible now does not have to be in the future. I'm not saying the solution is easy nor that it will even be solved necessarily within the next millennium, but I strongly do believe every problem can be solved with a bit of thinking. Whether it be logical or abstract, unheard of or right in front us, I don't think there is any problem that is unsolvable. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
