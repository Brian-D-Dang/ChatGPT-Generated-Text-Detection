A study has confirmed that new neurons are still being made well past adolescence, and suggested that older studies that had claimed otherwise were flawed in their methodology. Older studies had tried to detect the presence of a protein, doublecortin (DCX), in the brain months, or even years after the brain matter was preserved - long after the DCX had deteriorated. The new study examined freshly preserved samples and found a large amount of evidence of newly developed cells. There was about a 30 decrease in the presence of newly developed cells from the youngest to the oldest donor samples, whose ages ranged from 43 to 87. Some scientists remain skeptical of the results, claiming that detected DCX levels were not sufficient evidence for newly developed cells, but the scientists in the study say they used very strict criteria when identifying new cells.
