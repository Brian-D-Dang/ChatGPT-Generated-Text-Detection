I believe feminists, or the equivalent for any issue, are ruining their own cause by ignoring the opinions of those who are in the "power position" that don't "check their privilege." For example, when someone wants to engage in a discussion about gender equality on a message board, they are sometimes told to check their privilege, which is fine, but it is almost used derogatorily, as in, "check your privilege, you cis white male scum." They are treated as if they alone are responsible for someone's troubles. This both turns off recipient of such statements, but means the person saying these things mentally discounts all of the other person's opinions. PLEASE, let's make this a constructive discussion, and not devolve into people calling each other SJWs and overprivileged shitsacks. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
