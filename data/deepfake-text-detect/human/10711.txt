It's basically unheard of for yakuza to kill regular people. Like rarely they will kill other yakuza in some power struggle thing but event hat is real real rare compared to the really killing based nature of a lot of US gangs. They aren't even strictly illegal organizations and basically operate openly. Some of them do illegal stuff for sure but they aren't even strictly criminal organizations and a ton of the stuff they do is just sketchy or unseemly rather than law breaking.
