Pretty self-explanatory. The point of raising your insurance premium is to account for the assumed added risk your insurance company has determined about your driving. When you are hit by another driver and it is their fault, their insurance pays the bill and their rates go up. But if that driver at-fault doesn't have insurance, obviously your own insurance pays the bill. But this, in no way, implies anything about your own driving capabilities. I don't think insurance companies should be allowed to punish you for something that's not your fault, especially since car insurance is mandatory by law, which enables car insurance companies to mandate shady practices like this one.
