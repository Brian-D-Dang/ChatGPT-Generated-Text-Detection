When a couple is infertile but wants children they often turn to IVF and use others sperm or eggs. This creates children who grow up with strangers. While adoption of existing children is needed I think creating children deliberately deprived of their parents is immoral. The relations among a family are primarily biological and children are like their parents not because they lived together but because they are related. We learn about ourselves by growing up with family who are like us because we are related. Creating children by IVF may also impair their health because the sperm did not undergo the natural selection process of competing to inseminate the egg. This may be partially overcome by PGD and trying to select healthy embryos. I don't oppose IVF for the reason that the church does, sanctity of life, since I have no opposition to abortion, but because the rights of children to grow up with their parents is more important than the desire of parents to have children. A child born by IVF is not benefited because they have been born because to not have been born is neutral. But they have been harmed by being created as an orphan. Hello, users of CMV!
