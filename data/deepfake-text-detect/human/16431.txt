This paper proposes a feedback linearising law for single-track dynamic models, allowing the design of a trajectory tracking controller exploiting linear control theory. The main characteristics of this algorithm are its simplicity, its independence from any vehicle model parameter, apart from the position of the center of mass, and its robustness. In particular, a numerical bifurcation analysis demonstrates that, for physically meaningful values of the center of mass deviation, the equilibrium is structurally asymptotically stable. Experimental results, concerning the linearising law and its application as inner loop of a trajectory tracking controller, are also presented, confirming the effectiveness of the proposal.
