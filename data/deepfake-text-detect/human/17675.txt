It seems to me as though communists and anarchists both (though that's a subject for a different post I suppose) make the mistake of thinking that people won't mercilessly take advantage of other people whenever they get the chance, that they won't be lazy, that they won't hoard things for themselves or manipulate themselves into positions of power over other people just for the sake of having to expend less effort, get more money or material goods, etc.. It just seems as though it depends on everyone to do their part, every single person, and it's not only a few who wouldn't do it, but the majority. I guess what I meant is, I believe it could never possibly work and have the people still be happy. China is still technically communist but that is debatable in and of itself...and then there's North Korea whose censorship and cultism keep its people in line...but those people are starving and don't have any electricity half the time. So what I mean is, communist party of the USA, please explain to me why you want the US to adopt communism and why you think it would not end badly. Please convince me of this. I have the same trouble believing in anarchy...sounds great in theory but people just aren't that good. But I want to believe, and lots of people do, so there must be something I'm missing. Edit: Spelling Edit2: Thanks for all your contributions! I'm still on the fence about plausibility, but I'm definitely no longer convinced that it would be impossible. Thank you!
