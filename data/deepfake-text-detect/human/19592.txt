So this whole thing started over the questionable killing of a young african american boy. Fine I get that people are upset and I do think police should have cameras on them so these investigations go smoother. However the people of Ferguson are rioting and destroying local, family owned businesses. How does that solve anything? I just don't see how destroying a city will make up for the loss of a teenager whos family doesnt even support what they are doing. That leads to my second point, the police force. I have said for a long time I wish police officers in the US were like the European ones were they always have bright colors on amd on the vehicles so that people know they are there and there to help instead of unmarked cars but that doesnt even bother me that much. If people are destroying a city of course martial law is going to be declared and the police have to protect themselves some how. What are they supposed to do give up, let the city be over run, and the police officer for all we know was in danger and protecting himself be brutally killed? As for the media situation I think they just don't want it to get even worse and have other cities take the same action. I just can't understand the peoples arguments against what police are doing there. Maybe someone here can give me a better explanation other than "those pigs took our freedom" because thats all Ive heard so far
