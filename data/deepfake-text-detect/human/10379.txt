If every nation had a large nuclear arsenal, and was willing to use it if they were invaded, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction! In the Cold War the USA and USSR both hated each other, but they knew if they went to war nukes would start flying and both sides would be destroyed. The same happened with Pakistan and India, they both hated each other, and fought several wars, but once they both got nukes, they stopped fighting because they knew it wasn't worth the cost of being nuked. When a nation has nuclear capabilities, no one invades them. If everyone had nuclear capabilities, than no one would ever invade anyone else because of mutually assured destruction. Edit: I never said we should start giving away free nukes to all who want them. We especially don't want our enemies to have nukes, do we? Hello, users of CMV!
