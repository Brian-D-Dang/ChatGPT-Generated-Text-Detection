Well, while I was discussing the effects of feminism on another CMV post, a reddit user made a very good point in saying that female-only gyms and shelters are discriminatory. That was something I never thought about! I could honestly see how it could be discriminatory (men might like to have their own private workout areas, too, and they also can be victims of abuse). I can't refute that it's discriminatory, of course, because it is (or at least, I think it is). But I also believe it's important for women to be and feel safe. As I mentioned to this particular reddit user, my sister was harassed by her gym so badly that she ended up having to quit, so obviously I'm conflicted in my opinions! Now, while I consider myself a feminist, I consider myself more so an egalitarian and I believe that all people should be treated equally. So I would like to CMV to better my practice of that philosophy. As it stands, I would say that I still do think that female-only gyms and shelters are good things, but if someone can CMV and help make the issue a little clearer, I would greatly appreciate it!
