The discussion of the new defaults has a number of people complaining that default status is going to ruin their favourite sub. rTwoXChromosomes is a notable example of this. The explanation is that, supposedly, default status leads to lots of trolls and low-content posters "invading" the sub and reducing its quality or at least shifting it away from how it used to be in a way the user doesn't like. I am sceptical. To be sure, I'm no fan of the low content image-based posting found in say, rfunny . But I don't think its default status has much to do with it. I think that rules and moderation standards are much more influential. If enforced properly, most of the "low content" posting should be able to be stopped. I also wonder if confirmation bias explains the apparent declines in newly minted defaults. From my observations before and after some subreddits were defaulted, I can't see any obvious changes. Furthermore, I think having a wide array of defaults helps make reddit more selective towards the kind of user the types of people complaining about this would prefer. Low content posters migrate to reddit in part because the front page is filled with low content. If the front page is more diverse and "high content," then it should attract a more diverse and "high content" crowd accordingly.
