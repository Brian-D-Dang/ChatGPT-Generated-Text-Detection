In my opinion Mandela has been a great speech writer and national symbol but a dismal leader. His policies did little for the common men and women, inequality is just as bad as when he took over. Crime has become a major problem and is only getting worse. Twice as many South Africans now live in shanty towns as they did on his ascent to power. Mandela has assumed an almost god like status in SA. Any criticism of himself or of his party, the ANC is treated as blasphemy. He has failed to wield that status over his party and has done nothing to address the corruption, his inability to govern his own party is his greatest failing and has led to the downfall of a wonderful country. He also spent far too much time on foreign matters whilst ignoring issues like the HIV epidemic that exploded during his reign.
