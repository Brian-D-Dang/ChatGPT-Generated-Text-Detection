For example, the fact that someone's family has lived in America for four generations does not make him or her "more American" than someone who was born in America from immigrant parents. Because each has lived in the country their entire lives, the one with stronger heritage has no greater claim to being American than the other one. One's national origins are not something that can be, in any way, qualified. Either you are American or you are not American. It's politically incorrect to consider someone "more" or "less" American depending on ancestry. I'm a first generation Indian American, and I find myself offended whenever someone implies that they are more American than I am because of the fact that their family has lived here for a longer time. It makes me feel like I don't really belong here, even sometimes like I'm less worthy than them to live in this country. Indians are one of the newest immigrant groups in the USA, however, so it is somewhat unsurprising that we are viewed that way - but hopefully we'll find greater acceptance in society as time passes. But in the meantime, it's affronting and tremendously disrespectful to refer to first generational American citizens as any "less" American than anyone else, regardless of his or her family's national origin.
