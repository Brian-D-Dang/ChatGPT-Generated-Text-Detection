The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams aims to create thousands of isotopes never before recorded on Earth. There are 285 isotopes of elements that exist on Earth, but there are potentially 10,000 isotopes for elements up to uranium. Studying these isotopes will help scientists gain new insights into the reactions that created the elements within stars. It could also help scientists test theories about the fundamental forces in nature and yield new isotopes for medical use.
