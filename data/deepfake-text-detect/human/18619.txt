Ok, just to clarify here, I have only had marijuana once, a few years ago. I am not a stoner, and this CMV has nothing to do with my own personal convenience. I feel as if the United States as a whole could benefit from marijuana being legal. The many solutions it would provide span our entire society: If there's one thing I learned from grade school, it's that many people will do things for their image. The fact that marijuana is illegal may appeal more to someone looking to prove something about themselves. Not saying that every user is like this, most probably aren't, but the money that it costs to detain that many minor drug offenders could be completely avoided. Speaking of costs, the distribution of marijuana is easily a multi-billion dollar "industry." Sure, the substance would probably drop in price if it were easy to obtain, but there's no denying that it could give a little boost to the economy The prohibition of alcohol in 1919 caused a lot of problems. Nowadays, due to many outdated drug laws from the early days of industry, punishment is quite ridiculous. I've heard of several instances where drivers who have killed entire families in car accidents have gotten far less prison time than someone who was caught with relatively weak substances. Now, I know for certain that many people on this subreddit are a LOT more insightful than I am, so excuse what may end up being some weak arguments on my part. I'm just genuinely curious how others feel about this hot topic of debate.
