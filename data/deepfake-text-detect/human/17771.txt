Hello! I got my driving licence and I want to buy a new car. My hole family has VW or BMW, because my sis is working at BMW so yeah, german cars are the best. But recently I argued with a guy, who was convinced, that Toyota, especially the Prius, is the best car on earth because of this Epicyclic gearing. I don't get how it works, but still, asian cars can't be as good as german cars, like VW or BMW .... right? I mean there must be reason, why so many people here in Austria and Germany have cars from VW Groupe. So come on and CMV! i'd love hearing some good arguments for Toyota and against VW!
