I honestly have a problem with the whole "rape culture" thing. We live in a safer time than ever before. The odds of being a victim of a violent crime of any time are lower than they have ever been. On the flip side though, with the power of the internet we have the ability to hear about every single violent crime that takes place on earth at any given moment. Mostly with the idea that we have to "teach boys not to rape." As if rape is something that is hard coded into the Y chromosome. Just imagine this conversation: Father: Before you go to that party tonight, be sure you don't rape anyone! Son: Sure thing pop! I always forget that rape is wrong! Thanks for the reminder!
