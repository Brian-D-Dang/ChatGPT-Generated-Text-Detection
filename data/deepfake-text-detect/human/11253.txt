Google's co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have relinquished their control of Alphabet to the current Google CEO Sundar Pichai. They will continue to remain Alphabet employees and retain their seats on the board. Pichai has stated that the change will have little to no impact on how Google operates on a daily basis. Both Page and Brin have disappeared from public view since the creation of Alphabet in 2015. Alphabet's stock price has more than doubled since its creation, despite the last four years being the most contentious in Google's history. Google has faced controversy over its involvements with several projects, as well as accusations of anticompetitive practices, sexual harassment, retaliation against workplace activists, and involvement with child exploitation.
