Came in with my son and nephew. Asked if I could add Chicken to a salad and first I was told no, and then I was told that I could but it would be an additional 5.99 if I wanted chicken. I have no problem paying extra for an addition however 5.99 is quite excessive. Well I orders a medium cheese pizza for the boys and I will eat when I get home. The customer service here was terrible. It is no wonder the place was empty. We will not be back and I will spread the word about what a great experience we had.
