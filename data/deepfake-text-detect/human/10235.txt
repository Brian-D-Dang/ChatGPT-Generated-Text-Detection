So I saw someone link to [this column] and thought it was really clever. I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates. If you want hard questioning, or to know their stand on the issues, interviews from journalists can do that. Debates are just grandstanding and "gotchas." A crisis simulation on the other hand would be really useful for getting information about how candidates would do the job of President. We would see how they asses a situation, how they handle disagreeing advisors, and how deep their knowledge of government runs. This is also a technique used in a lot of other situations to train and evaluate people who will hold a lot of responsibility. If you want to be an astronaut, you're going to be doing a lot of simulations. As far as getting candidates to do it, I could see this being something that a somewhat more obscure candidate does as a way to generate publicity, and which might catch on. Probably not for the major party candidates for this election cycle, but maybe in the future. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
