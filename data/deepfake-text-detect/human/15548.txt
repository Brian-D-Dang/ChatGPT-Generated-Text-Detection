Slowest Starbucks ever!!! Excuses galore and a snarky window person equals one VERY unhappy customer!!! The window person even told me sarcastically thank you for your patience after I has commented on how much time it was taking this morning!!! She rang up the wrong amount, handed me the wrong order and seemed frustrated with ME after I had spent 10 minutes stuck in that line!!! If there had been room for me to skip that line I would have been GONE!! I bit my tongue.... Called the manager later and explained that maybe that employee needed extra training regarding her customer service!! Grrrr!!!!!
