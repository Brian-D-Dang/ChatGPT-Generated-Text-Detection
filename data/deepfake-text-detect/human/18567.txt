I hate this opinion, and I don't want to have it, but I'm afraid I'm stuck in a rut that is possibly caused by me being raised in a hotbed of racism (the American South). I'm white, and I have a crush on someone who is black. He's amazing, and I personally don't believe there are any inherent deficiencies in someone based on their raceskin color. But part of me wonders if, given the discrimination that still exists in our society, procreating with someone who is white is justified, because you want your kids to have every advantage, right? I KNOW I'm wrong because it's just an awful thing to say or think, but I cannot figure out why. Please help?
