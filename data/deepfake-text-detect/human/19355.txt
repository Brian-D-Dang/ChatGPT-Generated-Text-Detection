I think the actions people take are largely determined by things that are outside of their control or their awareness, e.g. their genetics, nature and nurture, their social context, emotional responses, chance occurrences, etc. Mind you, I'm not necessarily saying they shouldn't be punished for certain actions, just that, ultimately, they are not completely responsible for their actions, because they do not have true free will, i.e., unlimited freedom of thought and choice.
