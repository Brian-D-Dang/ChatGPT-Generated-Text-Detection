To all my CHAIN HATERS out there....DON'T READ MY REVIEW! OK....I'm one of those Chain haters so sue me. BUT! I've got to tell you that THIS chain is A-OK! Why? Because their burgers are DARN TOOTIN GREAT....that's why! You know, upon thinking about it, you've got to believe that the reason a brand becomes a chain is because they have a pretty good product to being with, right? Think of The Cheesecake Factory. Yes, I'm a BIG FAN! Like I am with P.F. Changs, Five Guys Burgers. GREAT food and service (usually). So why not Smashburger? OK Smashburger, you WIN! Had their Big Mushroom Truffle Burger on an Egg Bun. Added bacon and grilled onions. MAN was this ever a SLOPPY burger....just the way I like them! Very juicy and very BEEFY meaning, plenty of FAT and not lean. Hey if I wanted lean I'd eat Chicken Breast, right? No Sirloin Burgers here....must be Chuck or something like that. Nevertheless, it really was great! Oh, their fries are parmesean herb shoestrings which were REALLY good! I love shoestrings because they remain crispy, and the flavor that Smashburger imparts on them are really great! Overall a 4.37 STAR experience! I just wish that they'd offer a Double Burger for us true Meat-a-tarians!
