I did some pretty negative things in my past. I used to sexually molest women in crowded places and buses. I went to years of therapy and stopped. I changed. I no longer desire to touch or hurt women. Now lets say I get into a relationship. Everything is going great and we get married. Maybe even start a family. Do you really think it would be a good idea to tell my wife that I used to hurt women? I don't think so, because it was in the past. It is over with. I have changed. It is no longer relevant. Why bother bringing up something that will only hurt me and her? In fact, it is a good thing she doesn't know, she doesn't need to know that specific kind of information. Some say it would be lying. Could be, but it is what it is what it is. It isn't hurting anyone and it is information that doesn't need to be said as it is no longer important. I've changed. I'm being the best person I can be. My past sucked, but I don't need that in my life anymore. I don't need to tell anyone this information because all it would do is cause destruction and ruin my life. People dont' need to know that. I get along just fine without people knowing that, why must they know I used to harass women if I've changed? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
