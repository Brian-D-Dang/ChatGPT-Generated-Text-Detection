I have been trying to find solid justifications for the continued sharing of domestic communications intelligence with Israel, and I am struggling to find any compelling arguments. It may be that the decision to share domestic communications intelligence does not represent the will of the people (of the United States), but rather the will of powerful lobbyists and politicians. I do not claim to be an expert in the matter, but this is the only conclusion I can come to based on the information I have. Of the recent revelations about the NSA, sharing information with Israel is one of the most appalling to me. In case it's relevant, I am a US citizen currently residing in the US. I welcome your facts andor your opinion. EDIT: Just to clarify, I do mean exclusively domestic to domestic communications intelligence. My specification of Israel was intended to illustrate an example; I did not mean to imply that I had a specific problem with sharing with Israel. My title should have read: "I think the United States should discontinue the sharing of domestic communications intelligence with its Allies CMV"
