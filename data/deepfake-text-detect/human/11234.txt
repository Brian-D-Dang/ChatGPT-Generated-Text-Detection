Facebook has officially released its desktop redesign which features a dark mode, a tabbed home screen, and a cleaner profile. Users can now start to opt-in to the new design before it becomes the default for everybody later in the year. Facebook has dedicated itself to simplifying its apps after a decade of making them more visually complex.
