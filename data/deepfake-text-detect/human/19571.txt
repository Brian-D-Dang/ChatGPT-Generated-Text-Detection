I know that literacy is important, but I'm not sure that just reading books for fun provides any significant benefits for literate adults that other forms of recreation don't. As I understand, the more you use your brain for a particular task, the better you become at that task. That would explain why, when we're really young, parents, teachers, American Library Association posters, etc. encourage us to read books. However, the notion that reading is a healthier, more mentally stimulating activity than playing video games or watching TV seems to persist well into adulthood, when most people are already literate. And that's what confuses me. Reading Harry Potter isn't going to make me better at anything that matters (e.g., math), and neither will reading, say, Ulysses. If I'm not going to study or worki.e., if I'm just killing timeI don't think it makes a difference whether I read a book (regardless of how challenging or culturally significant it is) or play Battlefield 4. I've been thinking about this, because, if you ever visit any of the subreddits dedicated to productivity or motivation, such as rGetMotivated, rGetDisciplined, etc., they'll tell you that gaming is a bad habit, or at least a habit that needs to be kept under control. There's even a subreddit called rStopGaming. rStopReading, however, doesn't exist. CMV
