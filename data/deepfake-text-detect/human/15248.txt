Got the Mango smoothie w pearls. For some reason, it wasn't that flavorful. I don't just mean it wasn't sweet enough (it wasn't). I mean it was hard to tell that it was mango in there. Also, I found mango fibers, which does tell me that they seem to use real mango, but the texture does detract from the experience of a smoothie. It's like finding a hair, you know? Finally, the pearls weren't at all warm and chewy as some wise Yelper named Chris V. wrote in his review of the original location. I'd definitely go there instead if you don't live right next door to this one, or maybe even if you do live close by.
