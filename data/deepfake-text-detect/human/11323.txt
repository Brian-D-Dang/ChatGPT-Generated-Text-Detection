Android 10 will start rolling out to devices starting with the Pixel phones, including the Pixel 1. The update will include fully gestural navigation, full support for a dark mode, changes to how users can interact with notifications, a faster share sheet, an API for floating apps, 230 new emoji, various under-the-hood changes, and much more. There are better security and privacy options, giving users more control over app permissions and storage. The security changes include a new method for storage encryption that will work on cheaper devices, and because of this, encryption will now be mandatory on all devices. A gallery of screenshots is available that shows some of the new features.
