I don't think Snowden is a hero, a patriot, or a traitor. I think what he did is a personal response to the US repeatedly stepping over the line when it comes to our founding democratic principles. Our unique rights and freedoms have inherent risks, one of those risks is that some asshole will try to kill some people. I accept that (to a point) and will not trade those freedoms for a police-state that monitors everyone's actions. I think that's that basis of Snowden's actions. Secondly, let me be clear. Screw China and Russia. The US is doing to them what they have been doing to us for years. BUT, you don't do that do your friends and allies, namely Germany and France. The US expects loyalty and we should offer the same.
