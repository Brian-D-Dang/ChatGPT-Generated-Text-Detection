I do not support GMO's and do not want to consume them. Many other countries have restricted GMO's because they don't consider them safe alternatives. I personally don't believe that we should mess with the composition of the natural world. Especially on this level, where about 80 of our food is GMO in the U.S. We don't know enough about it to widely accept them in the country, as there could be long-term effects. We already know cancer, obesity, heart disease, autism, mental illness (especially anxiety and depression), and diabetes is a growing problem. With this whole GMO labeling issue going on right now I definitely think everyone has the right to know what they are eating, because not everyone wants to consume food that's in essence a science experiment.
