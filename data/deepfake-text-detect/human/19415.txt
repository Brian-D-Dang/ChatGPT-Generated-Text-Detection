I believe the word "evil" is a lazy description of any persons actions and that the concept of evil, especially in the metaphysical sense, is completely non-existent. Furthermore, I believe the use of the word "evil" when referring to one or one's actions is toxic to public perception of psychology and morals. The most heinous, terrible, selfish, disgusting acts that a person can commit can always (in my experience) be considered critically and be shown to have more practical roots than the over-arching, massive title of calling them or their actions "evil." If we are to have a conversation on the matter devoid of religious belief (which I would strongly prefer), I see, as of now, no practical reason to see "evil" as a realistic, viable description of anything ever.
