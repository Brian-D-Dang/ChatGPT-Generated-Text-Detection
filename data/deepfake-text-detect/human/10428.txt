Fairly simple premise. I'm 35 years old. I remember the Cold War. The first Gulf War. The Iraq War. War in Afghanistan, etc... I hear talk all the time about how soldiers are protecting our freedom and I swear I'm not being rhetorical when I say, "Has any war fought in my lifetime protected my freedom or me and my family?" I have a huge respect for our military men and women. Regardless of why they're sent into battle, I believe that they deserve my respect. I want to respect the REASONS they are sent into battle, but with the knowledge I have, I just can't. I believe we use our military to protect the US's oil interests and quite honestly, there's a lot of money to be made in the private sector selling war machines and munitions. Please. Please, for the sake of my sanity, change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
