Country music was not always bad. There were legends such as Johnny Cash who defined what country music was. However, today the country music culture is full of songs about booze, trucks, tractors, and women. Almost every song sounds exactly the same, following the same chord structure, tone, and melodies. There is no creativity when it comes to country music and it has not had a positive influence on the music industry. Although there may be a few exceptions to this, the majority of modern country is awful, redundant, and lacks any sort of meaning. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
