I like the accommodating room with jacuzzi. I like the fact that we were loud at 4 in the morning and no one complained. I like how easily it was to get into PURE (but I guess who can't?) I like the fact that we went from 50 dollars to 500 dollars at the craps table. I like the guy at the craps table giving away .... wait... I might love him. I like the waitress that comes by at least once every ten minutes. I like how we can bring drinks into the Pool. I like how Shaggy serenaded us from 3 ft away. I like the fast room service that cost a grip because we thought we're SOMEBODY. I like the fact that we were the only obnoxious people gambling at 9am. I like the pit box manager who didn't kick me out when I spilled the drink onto the table. I like you, Caesars Palace.
