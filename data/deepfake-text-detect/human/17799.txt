[Here is the post, in case you're wondering] When I first read the title, it seemed to me that the NRCC was creating fake websites pretending to promote a democratic candidate, and then collecting the donation money. Naturally, this seemed incredibly fraudulent and I couldn't believe that would actually be allowed to happen. And it wasn't happening. When you actually take the time to look at the site, the only misleading part of the site is where it says "so and so for Congress." The rest of the websites then begin to list reasons for why that person is a terrible candidate, then asks for donations, in large, bold letters, to stop this person from getting reelected. Clearly, these websites were done in satire, and anyone who accidentally donates shouldn't be donating in the first place. And yet, looking at the comments, people are talking about how the media won't report on this, because there aren't half-naked celebrities in it and how it really shows how desperate the republican party is. Is there something I'm missing? If anything, these articles are exactly the kind of sensationalism people always complain about. CMV.
