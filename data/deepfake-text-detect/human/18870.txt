[Today] comes news that, [yet] [again] , the Obama administration is trying to slow walk the Senate Intel. Committee's report on torture. Given the very small amount of time the Senate has left in session, any delay will probably permanently prevent the release of the report, or at least delay it for years. Mark Udall, one of the fiercest advocates against CIA and NSA abuses in the Senate lost his seat in Nov. He should read the report (or at least the executive summary designed for public release) into the record, or adopt it into the record of a subcommittee he chairs, so that it actually comes out. This sort of move has been done before. Sen Mike Gravel read the Pentagon Papers into the record in the 70s, for example. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
