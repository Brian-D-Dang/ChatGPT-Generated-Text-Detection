Given a graph G (V, E), A V, and integers k and l, the (A, l) -Path Packing problem asks to find k vertex-disjoint paths of length l that have endpoints in A and internal points in V A. We study the parameterized complexity of this problem with parameters A , l, k, treewidth, pathwidth, and their combinations. We present sharp complexity contrasts with respect to these parameters. Among other results, we show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable when l 3, while it is NP-complete for constant l 4. We also show that the problem is W[1hard parameterized by pathwidth A , while it is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by treewidth l.
