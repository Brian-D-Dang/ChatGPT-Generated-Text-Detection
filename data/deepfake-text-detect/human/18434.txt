After multiple hard failures of AMD products in 3 laptops and one desktop of mine, I am convinced AMD products have a sooner fail rate than Intel and Nvidia. I have had a Radeon GPU fully melt to my MB before and it was not due to lack of air circulation. That whole machine was AMD from top to bottom and it ran nasty hot...even after checking thermal paste and adding additional fans. In my experience, I have not had a LGA1155 or LGA1150 socket CPU overhead...even on a stock CPU fan. I've never had to add additions fans...even with a high powered Nvidia GeForce GTX GPU installed. The machine runs at a same temperature. I also feel like AMD builds are too rigid. Intel and Nvidia build appear more forgiving and interchangeable. I am studying to be and A tech. It would be horrifying to remain so biased when dealing with customer's machines. I'd rather like to lose this look of disgust when I see an AMD based machine. Please change my view. Edit: Calling my post anecdotal will not change my view. What will is number. Proof of failure rates, proof of cost efficiency, etc. Yes, my hatred of AMD is likely extremely irrational, but that is just the point. I want to be shown it is so I can be more open-minded when it comes to PCs. I want to not always say; "That GPU is garbage." just because I had multiple bad experiences. I want to tell them it's either garbage or amazing based on cold, hard evidence. Thanks
