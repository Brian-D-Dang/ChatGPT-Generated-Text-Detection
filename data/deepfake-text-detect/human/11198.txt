In a project called Mission Shakti, India has successfully tested its Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Missile, which destroyed a low-orbiting satellite on Wednesday. While it is unknown who the satellite belonged to, India has stated that it did not break any international laws or treaties. India is now the fourth country in the world to have achieved this feat, after the US, Russia, and China. Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that the purpose of Mission Shakti was to strengthen India's overall security and that the missile system would not be used offensively.
