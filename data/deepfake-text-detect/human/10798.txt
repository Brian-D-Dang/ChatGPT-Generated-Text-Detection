My understanding is that they're just varying degrees of the same thing.... a muscle tear. You tear muscle when you expose them to resistance. This is actually how they get stronger. You strain a muscle when you overwork it and have a specific larger tear (or several small, but still large enough tears) to really cause discomfort. You pull a muscle when you have a large enough tear that causes trauma, but you wouldn't necessarily call it "torn." You tear a muscle when the tear is so large it causes large trauma, bleeding, bruising, difficulty of use, and long term healing.
