In the US, I can turn cable TV on at 7pm and watch rotting corpses, murder, bombs, cadavers, and many other violent crimes. And yet one tit, and the world goes mad (insert janet jackson superbowl video) The human body is an amazing thing. It can be extremely diverse in appearance, but it is a beautiful thing that our society has somehow vilified to the point where it is MORE distasteful than the other things I mentioned. In general, I believe the USA restricts nudity so much that it has actually become a detriment to our society. We view almost all nudity as pornography, and limit it as all "adult content." But this doesn't benefit anyone in anyway. I think this has created several surprisingly negative side effects. Completely natural and normal things such as breast feeding and children being nude while playingat the beach become sexualized and perverse. Young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy. The problem is that porn is typically the first and only area where young adults see nude bodies which further sexualizes and makes nudity "wrong." It also increases body shame and embarrassment for two reasons; the first of which is that the only comparison many people have for what is "attractivenormal" is the rather skewed world of pornagraphy, and that we have chosen to eliminate normal forms of nudity (public showersbathssaunas) which I believe directly leads to people not feeling comfortable in their own naked bodies. This lack of comfort more easily leads to shame and self consciousness which has a host of other issues attached to it... Change my view.
