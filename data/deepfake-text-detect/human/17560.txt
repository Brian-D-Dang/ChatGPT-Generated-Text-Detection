Recently in the news the C.I.A. and Bush administration have been under a lot of heat for torturing prisoners. In the grand scheme of things, what are a few lives compared to the safety of thousands of others. The people they are torturing are a global threat; it's not out of patriotism that I'm trying to justify this for the sake of protecting good old 'murica. I think the main argument against me would be that there's a chance that some of these people may be innocent. But if someone came up to me, and said three other people and I need to be tortured because only one of us is a terrorist and it's either the four of us or potentially thousands of others, I would volunteer in a heartbeat. I am already well aware the government spends billions of dollars on military related things that the public has no idea about, and I'm okay with that because I understand that those are keeping us safe. I think my overall opinion is that it's good to be a good person and cooperate with people, but you also have to understand there are people who you can't negotiate with and you just have to kill (or torture) them.
