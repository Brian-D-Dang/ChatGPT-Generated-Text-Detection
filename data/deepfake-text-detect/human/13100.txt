I wanted to talk to Carmelo. His confident smile was offset by his shy eyes that saw everything but revealed nothing. His skin was neither too dark nor too light, and his hands were not covered in dark, spider-like hair like all of the other boys who pretended to be men. There he was, and there I was. It was a moment of destiny, perfect fate. I turned to Carmelo, anticipation locking up my joints and dreams of the future locking up my voice. He was never normally this close. "Hey, did they run out of fruit?" I somehow managed to ask. And Carmelo, beautiful Carmelo, turned to me a split second before my vision was awash in stars.
