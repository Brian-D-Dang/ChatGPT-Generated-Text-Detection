Physicists predict that information can be transmitted across two black holes paired via quantum entanglement. If the theory is correct, it might offer clues on how to unite quantum mechanics with the theory of general relativity that describes gravity. It would also mean that the universe is created from the interconnections between particles described by quantum entanglement. The black holes involved in this theory aren't the usual ones found in space, but small ones that can be created on a lab benchtop using just a few atoms or ions.
