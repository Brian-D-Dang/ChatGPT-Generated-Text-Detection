We were in Las Vegas one week ago, We purchased a one day ticket for 12 each because we were wanting to get from the Wynn area down to the Luxor to pickup tickets for the show that night. We had to walk from the Wynn down to the nearest station (that we were told was) at the Imperial Place......OMG what a long walk in 113 degree temperature. Then the walk through the casino to get to the station. We just missed the monorail so had to wait for the next one.....the platform is hot! The monorail itself is beautiful, smooth, fast....perfect. We got off at MGM (the last stop) and walked and walked and walked again. After picking up our tickets we wanted to go back to the Wynn for the afternoon and decided to take a taxi instead of the monorail. The taxi driver explained that the original idea was to put the monorail right down the middle of the strip but the taxi and shuttle services complained....therefore it ended up behind the hotels. Really that is too bad because we will never use it again and it seems like it is a huge waste of money.
