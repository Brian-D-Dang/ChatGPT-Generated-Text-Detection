I recognize service industry is difficult, and I work part time in a non-tip service industry job myself- but at the end of the day serving is a low-skill job. I think it is appropriate to tip when service is exceptional, but it is very frustrating to see people give me poor service and then feel entitled to a 20 tip. Most people work hard for their money, and most people don't receive tips. I get the argument that most states' minimum wages are not a living wage- my response is, why don't we tip ALL minimum wage workers? The only argument I've seen towards automatically tipping your server is that management can pay workers less than minimum wage and assume tipping will make up for the difference. However, according to my state's LI website FAQ: Can a business count workers' tips when making sure they get at least minimum wage? No. Businesses may not use tips as credit toward minimum wages owed to a worker. So why should I feel compelled to automatically tip? PS: I'm not including delivery drivers here, because they are spending money out of pocket on gas.
