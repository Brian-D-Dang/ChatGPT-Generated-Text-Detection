Could be that your pan base isn't making full contact with the heating element and there's an air gap between the element and the base. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so when you apply the pressure, you're making sure the element has direct contact with the metal of the pan, which is a better conductor of heat.,ELI5: The more you press something against another thing, you increase the surface area that connects them. So when you press down on a pan on a heating element and it "sounds" like it's cooking faster, it is cooking faster. It is getting hotter. Why? Because science! Hope this helps! Peace! P.S. And by science I mean that the increased surface area in contact with the heat source increases the efficiency of the element's heating and decreasing the timeenergy it takes to boil the water within it.
