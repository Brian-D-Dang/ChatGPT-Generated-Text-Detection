I may not necessarily believe that the homeopathy works the same way many homeopathy practitioners claim it works. However it definitely does work for some people. Whether or not it's "simply placebo," it helps some people. So what exactly is telling people "your drugs are just water, they don't work" is supposed to accomplish? It's like going to a hospital chapel and starting yelling "You're all morons, no one is listening to you!" (which I can actually picture a number of redditors doing IRL) EDIT: Before posting the standard "Homeopathy is harming because people aren't seeking real treatment" response, please read others' comments and my responses to them.
