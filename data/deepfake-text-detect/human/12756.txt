Harry Dresden VS Harry Potter - Dresden Forty years old, and I drive a Volkswagen Beatle, But if we were in the same movie, I'd be Stark, you'd be Cheadle, If you in were my world, you'd be beneath the White Council's notice, If I were in yours, I'd show Hermione where Thomas's boat is. I take on guys that make Voldemort look like Mary Poppins, And when I finish beatin' em, I take your dead mom shoppin. - Potter You think you're real tough, being the Winter Knight? You got your ass beat by the Billy Goats in a fair fight, The scar I got shows I'm the real deal, When I hurt your feelings, don't show Molly how you feel, Oh thats right, you broke her mind at Chichen Itza Your Winter Knight ceremony was weaker than a barmixtzfah - Dresden If I were at Hogwarts, I'd run the whole damn school, I'm usually the underdog, but not if I'm facing you, I was given soulfire by an Archangel wearing flannel, When I see your movies on TV, I change the damn channel, I took down the freakin' Red Court Empire, You look like you belong with Frodo in the shire. - Potter You're the pet of Mab and work at her command, I'm owned by no one, I am my own man, Don't think I didn't realize that Molly's gotten curvy, But don't worry, I won't touch her, I'm with Karrin Murphy, You see Dresden, I fight and defeat all kinds of bad guys, You're on the dark side now, someone should play you the bagpipes.
