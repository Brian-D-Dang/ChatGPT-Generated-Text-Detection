When Celoron's expedition arrived at Logstown, the Native Americans in the area informed Celoron that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British regardless of the French. Celoron continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the Ohio and the Miami rivers, which lay just south of the village of Pickawillany, the home of the Miami chief known as "Old Briton." Celoron threatened "Old Briton" with severe consequences if he continued to trade with the British. "Old Briton" ignored the warning. Disappointed, Celoron returned to Montreal in November 1749.
