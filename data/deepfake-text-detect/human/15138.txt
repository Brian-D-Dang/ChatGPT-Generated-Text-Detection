Actually to the last reviewer, yes they do run on a rigid schedule here, if your even 5 minutes late your skipped and have to reschedule. I've been with uw system now for about 2 yrs since my employers plan switched us from Dean. And I have to say I miss dean so much. Better service, friendlier doctors, the list goes on. This opinion also applies to most of their clinics (urgent care, optometry, psychology, hospitalER)
