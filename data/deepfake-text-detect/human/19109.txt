This may be only be relevant in the UK for some bits: Basically, whenever I make a bank transfer on a friday or something, and then realise it might not go through until around Tuesday, I just think that is ridiculous in a modern society. They could still close the high street shops, but they definitely need to be doing whatever it is they need to do, to process those transfers. Same thing with post, especially if they are competing with email, there needs to be a 7-day-a-week postal service for the Post Office in the UK. Another thing on a similar note, Sunday trading laws need to be scrapped straight away, they don't help anything. You'll be thinking about dinner on a sunday evening, and then you realise that everywhere's shut! And why? For old religious reasons, its crazy! I think these things would make for a significantly more efficient society and economy, and just make everything run a lot smoother. Thoughts?
