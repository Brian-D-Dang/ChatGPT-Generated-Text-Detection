Every so often I'll see a cop car break traffic laws. Sometimes they'll speed, make an illegal u-turn, roll through a stop sign, or many other things. I understand that they are police officers and might have a perfectly good reason to break these laws (like if there was an emergency or something). But their lightssirens have a purpose: to warn nearby cars to watch out. Traffic laws exist to prevent car accidents and keep everybody safe. Cops breaking these laws without their lightssirens on puts everyone in same danger as if it was a normal citizen breaking traffic laws. I'm not really sure if this is cops just abusing their power and thinking "I'm a cop, so I shouldn't have to obey every single little law" or if they actually need to get somewhere quick (maybe some of you police officers of reddit could tell us). Change my view.
