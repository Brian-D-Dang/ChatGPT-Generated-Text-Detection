I may be lactose intolerant but that has not stopped me from binging on gelato. Gelato 64 is located in the Lee Lee's Plaza on the NE corner of Dobson and Warner. I'll tell you now...it's no Arlecchino, but the quality of the gelato is better than the one just down the road from this place. The shop is brand-spanking new, almost clinical-looking, with it's white walls, streamlined lighting, and minimal furnishings (mostly Ikea-looking).The interior is simply non-descript, almost too bland and boring-looking. But perhaps there was a reasoning behind the seemingly sterilized, minimalist environment...ah, yes, of course. The element that seems to give the room character and subtle vibrancy is the gelato. The flavor selection is pretty impressive...almost Baskin Robbins-esque, with its 31 flavors (or maybe more!). The consistency of the gelato is excellent, very creamy and it doesn't leave you with a gritty feeling in your mouth. As far as flavors go, I think the fruitier ones win over the chocolate, or cream-based flavors. For example, their rum raisin just lacked the punch of rum, and their cherry vanilla really was just vanilla with chunks of frozen cherry. If you were only served one chunk of cherry, then expect to be eating vanilla gelato the rest of the time. In contrast, their mango and raspberry, for example, had just the right tartness that made you pucker with delight. The fruity flavors were true to taste and were magnificent when combined. I say, go for the fruit flavors! The staff members were very friendly and courteous, and were very generous in giving you sample tastings. You gotta appreciate that!
