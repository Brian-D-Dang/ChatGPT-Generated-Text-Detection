Visible light communications (VLC) have emerged as strong candidates for meeting the escalating demand for high data rates. Consider a VLC network, where multiple access-points (APs) serve both energy-harvesting users (EHUs), i.e., users which harvest energy from light intensity, and information-users (IUs), i.e., users which gather data information. In order to jointly balance the achievable sum-rate at the IUs and the energy harvested by the EHUs, the paper considers maximizing a network-wide utility, which consists of a weighted-sum of the IUs sum-rate and the EHUs harvested-energy, subject to individual IU rate constraint, individual EHU harvested-energy constraint, and AP power constraints, so as to jointly determine the direct current (DC) -bias value at each AP, and the users' powers. The paper solves such a difficult non-convex optimization problem using an iterative approach which relies on inner convex approximations, and compensates for the used approximations using proper outer-loop updates. The paper further considers solving the special cases of the problem, i.e., maximizing the sum-rate, and maximizing the total harvested-energy, both subject to the same constraints. Numerical results highlight the significant performance improvement of the proposed algorithms, and illustrate the impacts of the network parameters on the performance trade-off between the sum-rate and harvested-energy.
