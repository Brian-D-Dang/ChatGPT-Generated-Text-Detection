A lot of people on the internet are up-in-arms about open source stuff. I love it, let's be clear. Most of the stuff I use is open source software. However, I think it's perfectly reasonable and honestly more practical for companies to be closed-source. Quite simply, it's their goddamn intellectual property. And they are entitled to do with it what they please. If that means closed-source and that means charging people to use it, so be it. They spent a long time working on their shit. Would you say an author should allow anyone to change hisher work? Would you say heshe should submit it to the public for free just because you can't afford it? These developers spend a lot of time and effort into making their stuff. They're entitled to having sole control over it.
