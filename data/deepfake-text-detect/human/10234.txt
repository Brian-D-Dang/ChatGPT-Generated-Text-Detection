I believe that "Buckle up, it's the law" is a very bad slogan, because it is an [appeal to authority] which can be rejected easily in people's minds if they aren't aware of the purpose of a law. Instead, an appeal to the motorist's intelligence by pointing out the consequences of not buckling up, and thus making motorists aware of the possible consequences of not buckling up and making it obvious why it is rather sensible to wear one's seat belt would be a lot more effective. [This German ad posted along public roads throughout Germany] is an excellent example of this. The text translates to "One is distracted, four die." A brief but concise outline of cause and effect, enough to raise awareness. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
