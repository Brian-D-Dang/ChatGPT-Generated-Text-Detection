Although the idea of getting some extra cash, and an ideal summer job, as a teenaged white female as a baby sitter, I feel it worsens diversity in our community promoting racism. The other day as I was walking my dog down the street and saw two gay boys (happy young male children) frolicking in the spritz of a broken water sprinkler. The children possessed the happiest smile out of any recent person I have seen. When I looked over to the sitter she was an elderly hispanic women. The children ran over to her with an unfathomable amount of glee. Later that day I believe I saw the same women taking the bus home, dodging misjudgments and what could be racial slurs from tatted teenage boys. This made me think. Those children ran up to this women in amazement, but the teenagers were rude and disrespectful. RACISM IS ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE. When I see teenage girls as sitters, it doesn't expose the children into a diverse environment thus promoting racism.
