I think investing in nuclear energy is one of the most foolish things that mankind has ever done. The sheer amount of energy it yields is certainly enticing, but I do not think it is worth the risks it entails. My primary reason for despising nuclear energy is that in the event of a failure at a nuclear facility, the results are catastrophic. Many people claim that nuclear power plants are safeguarded with redundant forms of security making a meltdown "impossible." I do not buy it. No matter how many safety regulations are implemented, I think nuclear meltdowns are inevitable. These facilities are run by two things: people, and computers. People, even highly trained people are fallible, and I have used computers for far too long to trust that these computers are error proof. What's more, we have historic precedents of nuclear meltdown and the natural turned nuclear disaster in Japan to show us just how naive it is to think that nuclear energy is safe. When a hydro-electric power plant goes out, people lose power for a while. Huge inconvenience for a lot of people, possibly even a bit destructive, but ultimately not a huge deal. When a nuclear power plant has a meltdown the entire area must be evacuated, people's lives are put in danger, and the environment is polluted with radioactivity for over a century. Nuclear power plants are a threat to the communities they reside in and every nation ought to begin taking steps towards shutting down such facilities. Edit: Delta awarded to JustsayinwhatIthink.
