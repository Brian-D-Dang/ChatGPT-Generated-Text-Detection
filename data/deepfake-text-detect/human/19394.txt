I recently worked in a mobile clinic in Ecuador with a University group and it was not at all what I expected. I felt like I was just in the way the entire time and the other students in my group kept grabbing random people's children without asking to take pictures (to use as their Facebook profile pictures, no doubt). I kept thinking "these are people, not tourist attractions." It was a horrible experience and I don't know why colleges and graduate schools value these kinds of trips on your CV when you're applying to schools. To me, doing trips like that says nothing about your character, but just that you can afford to pay for them. EDIT: It would be interesting to hear the opinion of someone from one of the countries these NGOs frequently work in.
