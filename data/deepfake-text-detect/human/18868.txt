As a disclaimer, I do not hate Jews, nor am I anti-Semetic. I think they were given too much slack since 1948. The arming by advanced Western powers also seems to have been a little much. I think it's hard to justify the use of (IMO) legitimate Palestinian territory for the use of settlements, martial rule, and really the overall refusal for reconciliation with the Palestinian people.
