I am a high school science teacher. I am alone in my school for not penalizing late work. When I give an assignment it is to improve my students understanding of a concept we are studying. It does not matter when this work is complete. Of course i would like it before the exam but even if it is after, so long as a student did the work I am willing to give them full credit. 90 of my students still turn work in on time and another 5 turn it in a day later. The other 5 never do it no matter the penalty involved. The atmosphere in my class is one that promotes learning as the end goal. I arrived at this policy when i was dealing with students who would not turn in work at all because it wasn't worth any thing because it was late. I would rather them do it late than never. I know this is not a popular opinion and have been approached by other members of the staff asking me to defend my policy and i just tell them i teach science not "how to turn stuff in on time class" so i should grade science stuff not if it was done on time. But being so alone in this opinion i am keeping my self open to change, so change my view.
