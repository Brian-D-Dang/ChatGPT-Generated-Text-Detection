disclaimer: I'm a complete beginner in this field and I am probably wrong in many of my assumptions. That is why I came here, so please correct me whenever I'm completely wrong. I believe that a large part of why the U.S. and the global economy is not at its best is because of the current monetary system. The U.S.'s central bank (the one that prints the U.S.'s fiat money) is a private company owned by banks like Goldman Sachs, and previously Lehman Brothers, financial institutions that were very closely involved in the causes of 2008 recession, notably the sub-prime mortgage crisisABACUS case. A private institution that has a reputation of working solely for its profit, making reckless investments that tanked a country's economy, them managing something that is of public interest is not something that I particularly approve of, but I might be simply ignorant of the benefits of central bank privatization. Correct me if that is the case, please. I simply don't trust the Central bankthe government to create money out of thin air, money that isn't backed by anything physical, thus devaluating our money by printing excessive amounts of it when a bank needs more money to lend, which can lead to catastrophic scenarios of hyperinflation like ex-Yugoslavia or Zaire. I also think that the gold standard helps keep inflation rates stable and low, thanks to the relatively stable supply of gold, and if every economy were to use it, exchange rates would be stable as well. Other commodity-backed currencies like a silver standard also seem like a viable option to me, as long as we don't have the option to inflate the money supply. thanks for reading
