Thomas Dohmke is stepping into the CEO role at GitHub. Nat Friedman will become the Chairman Emeritus of the service. Dohmke has a background as a developer and open source advocate. One of his first projects at GitHub was to make private repos free for all developers. GitHub stayed platform-neutral during Friedman's tenure and will continue to do so under Dohmke's leadership. Dohmke isn't planning any major changes right away and will continue to lead GitHub on its current trajectory.
