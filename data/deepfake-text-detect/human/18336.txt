The day it happened, I remember being told on the news that they were going to bring the building down. Then the building came down, and I wondered how ever did they wire up a burning building so fast? As time passed it became more and more clear to me that only demolition accounted for the features of the collapse: The free fall acceleration The even straight down nature of the collapse The small footprint, barely touching nearby buildings The speed and volume of dust clouds Similarities to other demolition profiles Evidence of explosive sounds The NIST non report The NIST report - finally - and the model that doesn't look like what happened. Lack of investigation into explosives especially by fire investigators and insurance that paid out billions. Larry Silverstein's 'pull it' comment on PBS BBC prescient broadcast announcing the collapse ahead of time with the building standing in the background of a 'live shot'? The destruction of Worldcom and Enron case files that crippled criminal proceedings in the wake of huge scandals. The number of holes and foreknowledge of the attack narrative in general, specifically Able Danger, and the Phoenix memo come to mind. Without going into who or why, I might have different opinion on that than many.. .and whether or not I believe passenger jets were used for the other attacks - if I can change my mind on WTC7, then I can certainly come to see how the official explanation might be more consistent.
