One theory I've heard (not sure if it's been verified or not) is that mountain and hill ranges afforded our evolutionary ancestors a number of benefits - shelter in the form of caves, uneven terrain to assist in hiding either from predators or while hunting, a number of flowing water sources etc. The idea goes that the relief our ancestors felt at the sight of a mountain range may have translated biologically into the feeling we have today when gazing upon them. Awe is another factor. Mountains are a reminder of the power and scale of nature. It's hard for someone to be caught up in their own petty issues when they're being reminded how insignificant they are in the grand scheme of things.,For me, it's because I live in the Netherlands - the nearest thing that can be described as "mountain" is half a day's drive away. I personally know people who have never seen anything over 500 meters tall.
