Welcome to TCMV Tuesday, our weekly post where we can celebrate our ability to adopt a new mindset or gain another perspective. Tell us what experiences you've had outside our subreddit, either recently or in your lifetime, that made you think "This Changed My View." Give us your stories in the comments! You can consider these questions to help get you thinking: Known or met someone with an interesting ideology or opinion that caused you to reconsider your own? Had an experience, good or bad, that changed your perspective? Learned something new that challenged what you believed? Ever have your tastes or interests changed? Read an article or seen a video that got you thinking differently? And just as a reminder, comment discussions here are not debate-oriented, so there's no obligation to take opposing sides in conversations here (in other words, Rule 1 does not apply here).
