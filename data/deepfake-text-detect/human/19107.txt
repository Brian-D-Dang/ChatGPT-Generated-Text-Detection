Constantly, you hear people complain about the president of the United States. Stupid people. People who complain that the POTUS didn't save the economy in a few years, that he didn't make healthcare work out for everyone, that taxes suck! People who don't understand that the government is formed of more than one branch and that while the president is the most powerful as a single person, that his power is a speck of dust in the shadow of Congress. These are your people who have no clue of how government works, that don't even know the entire platforms of who they're voting for. These people who understand nothing and never challenge the quota, people who just vote like their parents and their parents before them. Or conversely, vote the exact opposite of their parents for that sense of rebellion. Never mind the fact that a two-party system is deeply flawed. These are the people who support changes to the economy that sound good at face value, but are not economically sound in the slightest. These are the people that constantly complain about the government. And the politicians of our government take advantage of these people. Can you blame the politicians? You have hordes of stupid people who will complain about you all day long but won't do anything to you except give you money and power. These politicians are the smart people. Like with the economy, the people at the top prey upon the stupid people who buy worthless stocks, I believe that the same thing happens with government. CMV.
