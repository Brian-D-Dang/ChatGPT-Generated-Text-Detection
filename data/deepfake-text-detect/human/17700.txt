I'm Dutch, and here you can drink alcohol when you're sixteen. Next weekyear, this age will be raised to eighteen. It's 21 in the US, right? I don't think this is a good idea.

Most of us understand that sex education is important, and that it works better than forcing teenagers to abstain. I believe the same applies to alcohol. Sex seems to be even more dangerous than alcohol: you need to drink an excessive amount of alcohol before it causes real immediate problems, but it's easy to get an STD or get pregnant from sex. My parents regularly asked me whether I wanted to taste their wine or beer since I was 12 or 13. I started drinking with friends when I was 15 - never more than two glasses in one day. I'm in my 20s now. I've never been drunk, alcohol is not a real temptation or problem to me and I don't drink often. When you actively prohibit teenagers from drinking alcohol, it becomes a temptation. They want to do what is forbidden. If you treat it like it's very special and not a normal part of life, it becomes special to them as well. This doesn't help anybody. So the best approach seems to be to teach teenagers how to drink responsibly. It's just like driving and sex: it can be very dangerous, but it's fun and harmless when you do it 'the right way'.
