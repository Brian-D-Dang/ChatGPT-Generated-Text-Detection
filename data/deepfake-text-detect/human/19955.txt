Currencies are serious matters, and security is a serious issue. With Doge as their mascot it's hard to take the cryptocurrency seriously with such associations with the meme. They may have a strong community and be doing great things, but I don't see how this helps Dogecoin gain more acceptance when Bitcoin was plastered all over CNN (ie it got the media exposure that Dogecoin seems to be attempting to obtain), but even that did not lead to mass utilization. I don't think Dogecoin will ever be taken seriously, and by the time cryptocurriencies are ready for mass acceptance and use by business a more serious cryptocurrency will be favored that focuses on more on security and less "To the moon." I'm not too familiar with the cryptocurrency arena, but I am truly shocked that people are seriously behind this whole Dogecoin thing as a serious currency. I feel like I'm the only one in disbelief in these threads so I was wondering if anyone could CMV. I don't see why so many people aren't investing their time in more serious and secure cryptocurrencies, and favoring Dogecoin. I realize it's good for tipping in reddit comments, but is this really going to do anything for Dogecoin's success? I think a cryptocurrency should be focus on security, as that is what is stopping people from using them. Overall I think those trying to take Dogecoin seriously as a currency are misguided, and a real currency shouldn't be associated with an internet meme. CMV.
