Parking lot located clear out beyond the mall inside of the hotel. Makes for quite a long walk. Pool is also not located very wisely. If you want to go swimming you have to walk thru the mall in your swimsuit and towel to get to the pool. Stupid! It's all about how much more they can extract from your pocket before you make it to your room. Hotel has odd smell throughout. Room was clean, although the door on the entertainment center was ripped off. Bathroom was roomy and tub very large and welcoming. My husband and I were approached twice by women in the hotel asking if we wanted company. Uh, how about HELL NO! I won't be going back here. I only went here for a medical convention for work.
