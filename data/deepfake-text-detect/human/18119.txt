I strongly believe in a utilitarian system of mortality and would sacrifice an innocent man to protect many more. In modern governments and society I think human rights are invaluable to protect people from brashgreedy leaders who would act in a manner that would not produce the best result for society. With that said, I do not think these rights are just a necessary means rather than an end in themselves. In theory, however, I would readily and eagerly violate these rights if the end result was better. I don't think there is much more to add, but if you would like any more information please just ask. I find this belief system comes off as distasteful and would love to have it changed. EDIT: I hold this view because of a trolley problem somebody asked me. The situation was two people are tied to a track with a trolley running towards them. There is a fat person next to me (or a person wearing a huge backpack to remove weight from being a factor) that I could push in front of the trolley and stop it. Any other actions to save the people are impossible for whatever reason. I think it would be morally correct to push the person. This is the only stick I have that keeps me holding this view and I despise it. Refuting this one example is sufficient proof for me.
