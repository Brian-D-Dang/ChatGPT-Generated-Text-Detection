Cindy saw that the watering can in her garden had fallen over. She walked over to pick it up so that she could water her plants. The watering can seemed heavy when she tried to lift it. Suddenly a little kitten darted out of the can, surprising her! The kitten had crawled into the watering can and fallen asleep.
