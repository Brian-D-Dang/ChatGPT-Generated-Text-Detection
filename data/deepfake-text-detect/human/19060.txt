Since X and Y has been announced everyone has been going wild over Pokemon and the world rejoiced (exaggerating). I noticed that as soon COD: Ghosts was announced it received an UTTER SHITSTORM To clear up ANY misconceptions I just want to say I enjoyed Pokemon as a kid growing up, and I enjoyed Call of Duty growing up. AND I AM NO WAY SAYING THAT THE GAMES ARE ALIKE IN ANYWAY OTHER THAN WHAT I AM STATING Quite a few people in recent years have complained about how Call of Duty is the same and that they never come up with anything new to refresh the series. Call of Duty games are all alike because it is a game method that sells, HIGHLY. Of course if it's Call of Duty everybody hates it but when it's Pokemon everyone goes wild. 14 Call of Duty games exist right now, including Ghost Now tell me what exactly has Pokemon done? Have the exact same game interface (until recently) just like Call of duty does, shell out 19 different games according to what I've looked up. Both have large fan-bases and both sell VERY well. I've kept this view to myself because apparently I'm the devil if I speak against Pokemon in anyway. Well here it is. Change my view.
