Gravity Sketch is a program that allows people to 'paint' in 3D in Virtual Reality. Ford has recently started to explore the technology and they have a customized version designed to aid their engineers. A typical rendering of a concept car may take months, but with Gravity Sketch, an engineer at Ford was able to render a new concept in 40 hours. There is a video in the article showing the design process using Ford's Gravity Sketch.
