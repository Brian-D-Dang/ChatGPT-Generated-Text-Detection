Let's be frank, the old ratheism was almost exclusively image macros snarking on religion and or tooting the atheist's 'rational superiority' horn. But, to me, most of those people creating, propagating and upvoting these things feeling good about themselves, are just as trashy and stupid as the religious who do the same thing about their own beliefs. So, when the moderators brought 'order' to the mess, I was shocked and a little dazed, for my dreams had come true! But as reality settled into my eyes i couldn't help but feel bad for the restriction of freedom. if these people who create, copy, submit and upvote these things really enjoy this, why should their freedoms be restricted? wasn't rtrueatheism enough for people? why not let people's ugliness (imo) just thrive like it wants to? well, maybe the moderation is ultimately a good thing, and i just am just being too soft, and we'll all ultimately benefit from a more tame version of ratheism. but dammit, we're restricting freedom of expression! can you CMV to really believe that the moderated ratheism is a good thing? sorry if you think this is a joke.. maybe it kind of is, but i'm also a little curious if i can just believe in this assholery, as it were.
