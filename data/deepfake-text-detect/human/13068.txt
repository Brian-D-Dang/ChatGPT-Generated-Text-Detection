"Friends and family, thank you for being here. It means a lot to me that so many of you would turn out to attend today. He was a popular man." Stupid thing to say about a man who got murdered. "Eric was a gentle soul," Must have been why the bitch went down so easy. "and to have him cut down in his prime Thirty eight is not'prime'. is heartbreaking. All of us here today feel this way: heartbroken. Speak for yourself. It's only a shame I couldn't kill him twice. "Eric touched many Including my wife. "The effects of which can be seen today." See above. "And while we may never understand what twisted soul LOL what sick individual Alright, steady on. would ever think to hurt him like this, we can only hope he finds forgiveness." Oh, now you're just trying to make me feel bad. "A little piece of Eric will be forever in our hearts And my desk drawer. and his memories will go on. All of us will remember the last time we saw him when we're alone." And masturbating. "So let us join together in silence, and say a final farewell to Eric." " Goodbye, you sleazy motherfucker. I'm glad I killed you. " Eighty pairs of eyes turned around and looked at me. Fuck. Did I just say that out loud?
