Went to this bar last night since it was close to my apt. and rec'd decent reviews from Yelpers.......NOT!! I have never been so obviously ignored since my days in Southie (a well known anti-black area of Boston). I paid for my drink and the bartender placed my change in front of the guy sitting next to me. Ok, simple mistake, I thought. Watched the game and once my drink was done I saw her talk to her cadre of friends for over 20 minutes before I got another one...and it was the guy sitting next to me who bought me one and apologized for the now noticeble slight. When my drink arrived, I questioned the delay (4 people at the bar and maybe 9 in the whole place), the bartender asked me to leave. I walked and will NEVER return. Don't know why this place is rated so high. It sucks...
