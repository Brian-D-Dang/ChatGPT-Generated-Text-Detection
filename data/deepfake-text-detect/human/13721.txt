Fran has lived in Hawaii for 18 months. She watched the news and learned 2 hurricanes were headed to Hawaii. She immediately went to the store and bought 10 gallons of water. Luckily,the hurricanes passed Hawaii and she only experienced rain. But now Fran has 10 gallons of water sitting on her kitchen floor.
