Like you're five: You have a long homework assignment due tomorrow, but you don't feel like doing any work. So what do you do? You call up your friend Billy and ask him "Hey, what's the answer to number one?." You don't want to bother him though, so you call Teddy and ask him "What do you think of problem number two?" You do this all of the way through, and finally you have completed the assignment simply by asking your friends to pitch in different parts. The only difference between this and real-life torrenting is that torrenting tends to ask hundreds of people, several dozens of times, for separate parts of the same file (s). In this way, you can drastically improve the reliability of your network and more importantly to the casual user, the speed.','The seedingleeching data is kept track of on another computer somewhere (called the "tracker. Torrenting is fast because you are downloading little bits of the file from many computers, rather than downloading the whole file from one computer. Even if each of those computers have a slow internet connection, by downloading from all of them at the same time, it adds up to a faster speed than downloading from only one computer with a fast internet connection.','When there are no tracker, the peers themselves tell each other what parts of the files they have and about statistics from others. The reason for it being so fast is that you can fetch the data from so many sources at once that you can use your entire download capacity at once.
