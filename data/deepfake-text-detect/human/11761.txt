Four years ago in San Francisco, more than 700 engineers competed in a competition to build an AI system that could pass an 8th-grade test. 80,000 in prize money was up for grabs. The engineers were unable to match the language and logic capabilities of 8th graders, with only one team being able to score near the 60 percent mark. A new system called Aristo was recently unveiled at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle with the ability to score over 90 percent on an 8th-grade science test and more than 80 percent on a 12th-grade exam. The Allen Institute was founded in 2013 by Microsoft's Paul Allen, who has recently passed after a long battle with lymphoma. The exams were all multiple-choice questions, and there were some limits in problem-solving abilities. Researchers are working on being able to create an AI that passes tests for graduate school admission.
