A discrete-time Quantum Walk (QW) is essentially an operator driving the evolution of a single particle on the lattice, through local unitaries. Some QWs admit a continuum limit, leading to well-known physics partial differential equations, such as the Dirac equation. We show that these simulation results need not rely on the grid: the Dirac equation in (2 1) -dimensions can also be simulated, through local unitaries, on the honeycomb or the triangular lattice, both of interest in the study of quantum propagation on the non-rectangular grids, as in graphene-like materials. The latter, in particular, we argue, opens the door for a generalization of the Dirac equation to arbitrary discrete surfaces.
