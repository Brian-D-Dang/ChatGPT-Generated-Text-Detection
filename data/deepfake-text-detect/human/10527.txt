Water that is not distilled has minerals in it. When the water evaporates from the surface the minerals stay behind as solid particles. This is where the white dusty layer comes from.','The water may contain dissolved minerals or pull minerals out from the wood. Then when it evaporates, those minerals are left behind as a white deposit.
