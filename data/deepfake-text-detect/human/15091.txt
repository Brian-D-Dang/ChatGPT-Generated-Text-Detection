Overhyped by yelpers. The pork tenderlion that was higly recommended by yelpers relied too much on the sauce (which was too sweet), once the sauce was gone, I had no motive to finish the rest. And the spicy red sauce they used in most of their dishes tasted like Sriracha sauce straight from the supermarket. Service was decent and seating was cramped. Not recommended if you are bringing a date.
