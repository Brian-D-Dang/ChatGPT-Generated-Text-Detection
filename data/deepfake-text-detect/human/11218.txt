Spaces is a startup with a team that specializes in virtual reality technologies. It was created in 2016 by DreamWorks Animation veterans. Spaces discontinued all of its services last week after Apple acquired it for an unknown sum. Apple is rumored to be working on AR and VR headsets for 2021 and 2022. Its investment into ARKit and features like the LiDAR scanner in the new iPad Pro further support these rumors.
