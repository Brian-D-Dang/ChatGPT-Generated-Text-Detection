This place is amazing! I have been on holidays and non-holidays and I think the holidays are much better overall. But that is not to say that non-holidays are bad but it is excellent on holidays and above average on other days. The pricing is rather high but it has quite a few amazing stations to choose from including the standards of beef, american, pasta, salads and deserts. If you wanted a place to compare it to I would say that Bellagio is definitely the inspiration for this place. And they are definitely comparable. The only downside to Wynn for me is consistency. Again if you go on a holiday the pricing is quite high but the food quality is also much higher such as the pure prime rib that they provide during the holidays, and fresh crab legs, and other delights. Definitely recommended if you are in Vegas and looking for something that is Bellagio level of taste and quality.
