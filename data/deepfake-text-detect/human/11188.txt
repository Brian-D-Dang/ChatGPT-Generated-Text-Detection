The potassium and sodium ion concentrations are what cause the neuron to fire. Or actually they allow the action potential to propagate along the nerve. A nerve cell starts off polarized,meaning the outside of the membrane is positively charged and the inside is negatively charged. the outside contains excess sodium ions the inside excess potassium ions. For the action potential to propagate a stimulus reaches the neuron, which opens gated ion channels allowing sodium ions to rush in which start the depolarization of the neuron. At a certain point the depolarization becomes an unstoppable wave as the gated ion channels all along the neuron open and sodium rushes in. this is the threshold potential. The neuron is completely depolarized and the signal transmitted. After the cell is depolarized gated ion channels on the inside open and allow potassium ions to flow out. Restoring the polarization but now by a different ion balance. At a point more potassium ions are on the outside than sodium ions on the inside and the gated ion channels close.This causes the membrane potential to drop below resting potential and is said to be hyperpolarized. During the following refractory period ion pumps restore the original ion balance and the nerve cell can't transmit during this period.
