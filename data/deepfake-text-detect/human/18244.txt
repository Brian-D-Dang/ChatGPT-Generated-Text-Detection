So first of all I am kind of a liberal atheist. I believe that we humans aren't more evolved than any other animal, we just evolved differently but together with other animals. I also believe that we are all part of the same biological tree and that suffering for the sake of pleasure, ideologies, etc. is wrong. Anyways, I eat meat, any kind of it; pork, chicken, fish, you name it and I very much enjoy it. But I know that we're killing and exploiting animals just for our pleasure, and I also believe that one person can make a difference so if I stop eating meat, it's a step in the right direction. I can't, however, I love meat and this generates a huge cognitive dissonance in my mind and I just want to be consistent with my thoughts and my actions so either convince me that eating meat is alright considering my world views or the contrary if necessary. I just want some peace of mind. Thanks. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
