Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, has told Square employees that they will be able to work from home even after the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders end. Twitter had recently announced similar news. The companies believe that employees should be able to work where they feel most creative and productive. Employees will still be able to come into the office. Other tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have extended their return to work dates. Only Twitter and Square have made remote work options permanent.
