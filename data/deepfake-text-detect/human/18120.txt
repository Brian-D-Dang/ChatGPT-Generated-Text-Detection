So the essential premise of my thoughts on the subject are that if you want to live overall, and will still want to live if you lose something, it's not worth dying to save it. The example that immediately comes to mind is military service. If life is really worth living to you it makes no sense to sacrifice it for anything you can live without. Just to clarify, appeals to altruismmorality are irrelevant to my question. I want to know if you guys can come up with a reason a self-interested person would want to sacrifice himhernon-gender-specific-pronounself. Hello, users of CMV!
