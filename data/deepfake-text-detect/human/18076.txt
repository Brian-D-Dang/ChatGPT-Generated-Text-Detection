I feel as if stocks, bonds, and investing in general is just socially acceptable and legal gambling. When investing you put money in companies that can go up or down, and in gambling you put money into chips in an effort to gain less or more. I feel as if both of these actions are incredibly similar and warrant the same policy by the government. I can't find a clear-cut difference besides possibly that gambling can be more volatile, yet with this Bitcoin business I don't even know if that is true. Help me understand what the difference is!
