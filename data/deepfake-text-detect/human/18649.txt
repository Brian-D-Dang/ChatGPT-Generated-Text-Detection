Tipping servers and other workers could be a nice gesture if you've enjoyed their service. However, many restaurants give their workers ridiculously low pay because the rest is supposed to come from tips and many servers live mainly on that income. That is, in my opinion, wrong. As an employee, your pay should come from your employer. As a customer, you should pay the demanded price. Having a customer decide how much the server is worth - after the service in question has already been delivered - is silly. The customer is left with the power to leave no tip at all for an excellent service. On top of that there is the question of cultural differences - when travelling I have no idea how much to tip and where. Why not just put those extra percent into the price of the foodwhatever else is being bought in the first place? You can still be allowed to tip when you think you received such excellent service that they deserve something extra but it should not be expected or counted on. CMV. EDIT to add: It's also more about looks and luck than who gives the best service. Women most often get bigger tips than men, and those women get more when they're wearing makeup. The general customer is not able to differentiate between good service or bad service, they just subjectively give more if they like the server or if they are in a good mood.
