It leads to self incrimination by having me provide you with my DNA. The fact that my DNA was at the crime scene could be completely circumstantial and I would have no way of proving my innocence. The DNA could be stored for an indifferent period of time and I don't know what would become of it. Similar to what happened to Henrietta Lacks' DNA. It was used without her consent for purposes other than what she agreed for it to be used for. With my DNA given to the police who's to say it can't be planted and used against me in order for them to have an easy case?
