I bought a variety pack and it's like 23s fruit rolls ups! Damned things, you always get the corner wrong and it won't peel right and then you can't free it from its wax paper prison, so you say fuck it and start eating but then its a horrible wet mess of waxy fruit flavored goodness all the fuck over the place. And then you realize it's 2:30pm on a saturday alone in your apartment when you really should be studying for an exam and you wonder how the hell you got here. Fruit roll ups suck.
