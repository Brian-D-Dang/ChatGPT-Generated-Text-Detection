Facebook Gaming has been launched in beta for a limited group of people. The service will launch with five games, including Gameloft's Asphalt 9: Legends. Out of Facebook's 2.7 billion monthly active users, more than 700 million users play games, with around 350 million playing Facebook's Instant Games. Facebook Gaming claims that it isn't aiming to compete with other services, but that it only wants to connect developers to consumers in an efficient way without having to leave Facebook. The platform is currently unavailable on iOS.
