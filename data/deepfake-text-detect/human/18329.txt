Many voters are unable to identify the relative positions of the politicians on a ballot. They simply look at party identification and vote accordingly. By eliminating party identification on ballots, such voters would become disenfranchised and be less likely to vote. The demographics of these voters would tend toward the less educated. This would leave the average voter more educated than we have now. Previous research by Bryan Caplan of George Mason University has found that as education increases, beliefs about economics move towards those of economists. The beliefs of economists are currently the best guess of the truth of economic matters. Therefore, rationality dictates that the opinions of economists should be more valued than non-economists on economic matters. Furthermore, politicians tend towards the positions of the median voter. Since the median voter will now have opinions closer to those of economists, you will get politicians that have more rational public policy proposals. So, by making the average voter more educated, you will have overall more rational public policy.
