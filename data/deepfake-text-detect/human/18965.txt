I'm not a big fan of "superstar" pop, but I've never thought the music was that bad. Yes, the tunes are kinda unoriginal, and the lyrical themes are samey, but they're still somewhat enjoyable to listen to. They're not "cultural trash" by any means. A lot of these stars do stupid things, but that doesn't mean their music is bad. A lot of people make the fallacy that shitty public behavior means the person is bad musician, which is obviously wrong (did being an alcoholic make Ernest Hemingway a bad writer? did John Lennon cheating make him a bad songwriter?). In any case, I think people are way too judgmental about what other people listen to. You can listen to your music, I can to my music, and Joe Bloggs can listen to Katy Perry and Justin Bieber, and we can all be happy. The genres of music you like to listen to will always be around no matter how popular the Mileys of the world will be. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
