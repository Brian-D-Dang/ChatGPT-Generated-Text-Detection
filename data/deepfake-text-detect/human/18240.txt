Although I think these new gender types are arbitrary, artificial definitions created by and for people who find the original sets of gender expectations towards one's person based on their sex far too restraining; I think it's USEFUL for society to create these new gender types, and not just some bullshit with no positive effect. It is a tool, a weapon against the current, unrealistic expectations towards members of each sex, and against the prevalent gender stereotypes that are hindering us in paying attention to and understanding each other as individual people, persons, humans - and not just another "man" or "woman," a member of a category, with clearly defined personal attributes that are not even true (for example, all women are submissive and like being dominated [traits], or all women are whores or gold diggers [stereotypes. The creation of these new gender types will undermine previous expectations towards one's display of gender, as people will be forced to accept deviances from the stereotypical masculinefeminine traits (listed here: ).
