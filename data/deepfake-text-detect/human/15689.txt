Sometimes having pizza and wings delivered to your doorstep is the ideal dinner. Last night was one of those nights. The last time we had pizza was at Villa Pizza's new location on Boulder Highway, so this time we decided to order from Rosati's. We decided to go with a large two topping pizza, and a dozen wings. I always order the wings extra crispy from Rosati's and they turn out delicious. Even with the 3 delivery fee, our total with tax (but before tip) was under 30. Yes, you can get cheaper pizzas. Doesn't make them better... When I placed my order, the girl on the phone already knew my address based on the number that popped up on their caller id. I love when businesses have this system in place. I was told my food would be to me within the hour. It took 35 minutes. I love when business beat their deadlines too! Rosati's also has a program where you can save a piece of the pizza box and after you get 12 you get 50 off your 13th pizza. Only downside to the program is that it does not apply to delivery.
