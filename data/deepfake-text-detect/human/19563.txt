I'm a US citizen. Every year I'm harassed in my college campus about registering to vote. My family and friends frown upon the fact that I don't vote, and I really don't see a point of doing so on such an individual scale. I am only in control of my own actions; I only control a single vote. Having the power of a single vote in such a large scale is pointless in my mind. The outcome of the election is seldom, if ever, determined by a single vote, and the outcome of the election will be the same regardless of whether or not I vote. I therefore think voting is pointless. Going to a voting booth and wasting a hour or two of my time is not worth it to do something that in the end does not affect anything.
