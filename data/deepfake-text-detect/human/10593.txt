he has seperation anxiety. I assume that he mainly does that when his owners are not at home? seperation anxiety builds up tension, so everytime he sees his owners leave the house he starts to get desperate and all the build up tension has to come out somehow. some dogs release that tension by destroying the whole house...some dogs release it by barking. if I were you I would go and talk to your neighbours and tell them to excersise more with their dog. Physical excersise before they leave the house is going to make that problem a hell of a lot less of a problem if it doesnt completely solve it. they are obviously not taking the dog out enough
