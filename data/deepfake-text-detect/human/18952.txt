The reason I think this is because the US government, especially in the last few years doesn't work. All it has been able to successfully do is provide minimal relief for natural disasters, and send troopswithdraw troops. If this was 200 years ago, the government would have been toppled, however since the US sees itself as a world leader of Democracy, there is this almost obligatory resistance to changing. As soon as the US were to lose top ranking in the world, I think somebody would start a Coup. EDIT: It's why now so many people favor larger government, back in the 50's during the red scare many would have favored communism if there hadn't been a feeling that the US was the leader against it. EDIT: To say it better, Americans and America feel that democracy is ours and if we leave it then we would take a huge hit to our ego. EDIT: to Clarify as the US were to lose top ranking in the world... As soon as we could no longer take pride in being the strongest military.
