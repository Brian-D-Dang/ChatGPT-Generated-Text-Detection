Are you American? If so your schooling was probably a little heavy on your own national history and a little light on what was going on elsewhere. (Doest every country do this?) Current event wise, I'd say that American media prefers to talk about itself and (not entirely) only refers to other countries when it pertains to direct mentions of America or American activities.,Almost all African Americans are descended from slaves, that's more than 1 in 10 Americans. No other country has such a large and obviously identifiable population that are directly descended from slaves. Also in "modern" times America had proportionately more slaves than any European country. Generally Europeans preferred to take slaves to the Americas to work rather than have them work within Europe.
