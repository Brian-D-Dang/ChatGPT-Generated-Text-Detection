Google will keep its 200,000 full-time and contract employees working remotely until at least July 2021. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, made the announcement last week following a meeting with top company executives. Google has reopened some offices for a limited number of employees, but working in the offices is optional. Other companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Square have announced plans to keep employees working from home indefinitely.
