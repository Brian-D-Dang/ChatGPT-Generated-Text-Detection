Better than the reviews say. I've been here 5 times now and every time we go, including during the dinner rush, we've always been seated and served quickly. The music here is great, a good selection of beers, but my favorite is the ahi sliders. Very generous portion of perfectly prepared ahi with just the right amount of spice. I will continue to go back, especially during happy hour.
