I've always thought differently to most people who don't like pedophiles. I've always felt that it's not their fault that they have a liking to a children. To me it seems like they just have a fetish which most of us do for something but they just have it for something that society doesn't like. Some are too embarrassed to say anything usually and carry on with an obsession that they can't control. I feel that passing around images of children is near harmless because it doesn't really effect anyone. Raping a child is a whole different matter. Although I do believe that raping a child is just as bad a raping an adult. But, I don't see it being worse. I can expand if you'd like even though it's not my CMV. I'd like to add that I was subject to a pedophile for 10 years from 7 - 17 who was our babysitter at the time. He was just arrested for child pornography and raping a child. He was extremely close to our family and we loved him as one of us. We miss him deeply and feel terrible for him but we don't hide from the fact that he raped a minor. I just feel that he couldn't help how he felt. It's just an obsession he can't control. Very sad because he was such a nice man. He'd do everything for the family. Yes he did take pictures of us as children but I feel that he was just trying to fill his obsession. He will spend the rest of his life in prison and I believe that he should especially for raping someone but I can't help but feel sorry for how he was born with this obsession. My first CMV post, hope I've explained myself well.
