He didn't know how long he'd held the position, but it had been years. Every year the snow melted, the ground greened, and the corn came. There'd be rows on the left, rows on the right, rows up front, and rows out back. On a post next to a long straight road in Iowa, Jack The Scarecrow stood vigil over his field. It had always been a simple position that didn't require much thinking, and Jack was always grateful for that aspect of watching corn. Mostly on account of his being a man of straw. Jack checked the corn to the front of him. It was alright. The corn to the left and his right was also fine, and though he couldn't see it he could only assume the corn behind him was also fine since it had never once spoken up and complained about anything in all the long years he hadn't been watching it. He wasn't sure who he was supposed to alert, or how, if the corn was ever not fine, but Jack took the position seriously. He let his straw mind wander for a moment before checking the corn again. It was already tall enough this year to block out his view of the road. It didn't normally do that when he had been younger, but he'd been slouching for a few years now and nobody had fixed him. Jack worried. He checked his corn again, while his straw mind reeled to remember which side the road had been on. His only point of orientation in the entire world had been lost without sight of the road, and he couldn't remember if it'd been on the left or right. Jack checked the corn in front of him. It was fine. Jack checked the corn to the left and right, and it was fine. The corn behind him wasn't screaming or otherwise petitioning for his attention, so he could only assume it too was fine. All around Jack identical rows of corn spread out as far as the eye could see. For the first time in his long tenure as a scarecrow Jack cracked open his straw mouth and muttered, under his breath: "Shit, I'm lost."
