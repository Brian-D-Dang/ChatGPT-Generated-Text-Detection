First off, have you tried to read the [simplified version] (URL0) of the article? You can replace "en" with "simple" in many wikipedia articles to get a basic generalization of the concept. With that said, simply put, "hair" is the product of specialized cells that use energy to produce proteins (hair) that slowly and steadily grow until they fall out and begin to grow again. It's like a weed or something.... just doing its thing, day in day out, pumping out strands of protein.
