The gist of my view is stated in this [video] . Be warned it is long (and very interesting). Basically I think that anything "private" about your life is already easy to find out, and people who really want to find those things out will. Not only can government and big corporations know pretty much all the important things about you and your life, anyone can find it out, pretty easily, so trying to "hide" it is kind of pointless, CMV.
