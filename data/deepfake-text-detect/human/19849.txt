I don't want to think this. I don't want to cling to this delusion anymore. I'm fifteen with no friends, and I'm 100 positive that it's because I can't bear the thought of anyone being smarter than me. Even though I have mediocre grades, even though I've never seriously made anything creative in my life, I constantly tell myself that in some way, in someway that only I can understand, they don't compare to me. Even though I know that this is ridiculous, I can't accept otherwise. I need someone to say to me, upfront, that I'm not as smart as I think I am. edit: Thank you guys, I think I really needed this wake-up call. it's surprising how cathratic having a few people call you out is.
