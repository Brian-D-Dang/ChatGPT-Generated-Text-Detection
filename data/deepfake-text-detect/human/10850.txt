Any information shared with authorities may be used to prosecute in the event of a trial or plea negotiation. If one is ever on the receiving end of this statement it is a great idea to shut up and get a lawyer. See Miranda v. Arizona.','This is why you [never talk to the police] (URL0).','The 5th Amendment says you cannot be forced to testify against yourself. Before police gave Miranda warnings, it was often unclear whether statements from suspects were forced...and being in police custody is an involuntary, inherently coercive situation. So there was a lot of confusion and legal wrangling over whether a statement was truly voluntary or not. Miranda warnings simplify this. It notifies suspects they have the option to not answer questions, and because they are aware of that option, anything they say after that is presumed to be voluntary. Suspects are notified of their rights, and law enforcement has clear cut guidelines they can follow. Everybody wins.','Anything that you say imply joke about to an arresting officer, attending officer, prosecutor or other official can be recorded referred to in a criminal prosecution. Hint: Say nothing and ask to see your lawyer or public defender.
