I am a fan of television. There are plenty of shows I do enjoy, such as Malcolm in the Middle, 30 Rock, Community, the list goes on. I have been recommended Arrested Development many times by many different people. They will sit me down and I will watch a few episodes with them. They are laughing as hard as they can while I am sitting on the couch with an apathetic expression. I have found nothing in the show worth while or even funny. So can anyone CMV?
