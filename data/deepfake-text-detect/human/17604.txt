1. Prescriptions require access to a doctor. This represents a significant barrier to treatment, especially in the US where healthcare is privately managed. 2. When a drug addict robs a pharmacy, I blame the state for helping make drugs so difficult to legally obtain. A high addict is a happy addict, and that's their personal decision anyway. Why drive them to desperation? 3. The state cannot be relied upon to objectively delineate which drugs are harmful versus which are relatively harmless. This is obvious from the near-global crusade against marijuana, despite alcohol being more physiologically damaging.
