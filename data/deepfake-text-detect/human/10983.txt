in photosystem II, a photon (packet of light energy) comes in and excites an electron (subatomic particle) in what's called a chlorophyll B molecule in the light harvesting complex. the excited electron jumps from chlorophyll molecule to chlorophyll molecule until it finally reaches a pair of chlorophyll A molecules (p680, meaning best absorbs light rays of wavelength 680 nm). the excited photon finally hops from the chlorophyll A pair to the primary acceptor and from the primary acceptor, the electron is picked up by plastoquinone (Pq) to participate in an electron transport chai. the electron transport chain makes ATP and plastocyanin (Pc) takes the electron to photosystem I. like, photosystem II, photosystem I can be directly excited by light and take electrons in from light excitation but it also takes the electrons that Pc gives it directly to the primary acceptor. from the photosystem I's primary acceptor, ferredioxin (Fd) takes two electrons through a second electron transport chain to an enzyme called NADPH reductase which takes an H ion, NADP, and the two electrons to form NADPH. the problem here is that chlorophyll in photosystems I and II are in an electron debt. to fix this, a separate enzyme hydrolyzes (splits water apart) water to give the electrons to chlorophyll B. the result from this whole process is NADPH and ATP, both used in the Calvin Cycle. i'm sorry this was really complicated.
