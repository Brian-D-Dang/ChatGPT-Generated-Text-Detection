A lot of people have been through a lot in life. Some people have seen more than others. With that being said, some things that people deal with on a day to day basis such as depression, schizophrenia, or other disabilities have a lot on them. For them it is a constant battle in their head of just being able to live a normal life. When anything about suicide or disappearing from the world comes up, everyone looses their mind. However, when someone just doesn't wake up one morning, yes, people are sad and they grief, but they accept it. Why can't we live in a world where people have the right to their own lives, and what to do with them? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
