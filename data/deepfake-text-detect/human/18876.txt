For a while now I've had this view about age that it is all but meaningless. It allow us to decide when people are allowed to vote, drink, drive and many other things, essentially using them as a means of measuring a person's maturity and aptness for certain tasks. I don't see how this can be accurate in any way though since as far as my experience goes, age and maturity hold little in common. Of course, people are more likely to be more mature when they're older, but you can have completely immature 33 year olds just as much as you can have very mature 17 year olds. I don't know any other fair way to determine when people are matureready enough to engage in certain activities, but the idea of using age just seems extremely silly to me. Change My View.
