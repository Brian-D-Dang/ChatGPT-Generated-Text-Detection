Feminism has become a negatively charged word for whatever reason, it seems to make a lot of people angry, at least on the internet. I personally don't hear the word very much outside of the internet, but I do hear women's rights in the media quite a bit. It seems to be the new alternative to feminism, kind of how like progressive was introduced to try and replace liberal. I was watching a speech given by Hillary Clinton and not once did I hear her mention feminism, but I heard women's rights several times, because she's a politician, she's not stupid, she knows what words to use and how listeners will react. I hadn't heard of Men's Rights before I discovered Reddit. The reaction seems to be very negative and while I understand it's partly because of the way they behave (when I read the stuff on rmensrights they definitely spend an inordinate amount of their time demonizing feminism) I think most people are reacting to the very idea of men's rights. People hear men's rights for the first time, even before encountering a typical MRA, and it sounds silly to them (it sounded silly to me), similar to as if someone were to advocate white rights or straight rights. When I read the platform there are definitely real issues; divorce and custody, male victims of abuse, selective service, circumcision, etc. So I think this "movement" would benefit from a reframing, either by just attacking each issue individually (the best solution IMO) or by changing men's rights to something else. To what I don't know, men's issues maybe. I've heard of father's rights long before men's rights and that never sounded like a bad thing. When they talk about issues that effect "men and boys" it sounds better somehow, more important (because think of the children I guess). As a corollary MRA's really need to stop attacking feminism and engaging feminists, and instead focus on the issues, I think that would earn them more respect.
