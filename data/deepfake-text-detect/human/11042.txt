The short answer? They don't. Not like traditional sunscreen anyway. Traditional sunscreen acts like a barrier, blocking the harmful effects of the sun by blocking much of the harmful radiation in sunlight. There are a number of methods that this happens, but generally it is designed to get between your skin and the sun in those wavelengths. Oral sunblocks generally claim to either repair the damage that is done by the harmful radiation or to block the skins negative reactions (though most are not scientifically tested to do so). This can be in the form of preventing hyperpigmentation, antioxidant treatment to clean up damaged cells, or melatonin and melanocite reduction. The biggest issue is most of the companies selling oral sunscreens have hidden somewhere in their instructions "to be used in supplement with other sun protection schemes" Which translates to "use sunblock as well." They're claiming to reduce by up to 75 the damage, but even if that's true, it still leaves 25.
