While many people think it's honorable to name a child after someone the parents knewknow, I think it is very selfish of the parents. The child is not that person. I believe that the purpose of a name is to be a unique identify device, and that giving a child a name that belongs to someone else, either within the family or close to the family, defeats this purpose. I am someone who is named after a deceased family member. My Grandmother has dementia so this has become a very strong emotional burden on me. Having to explain to her that the person I'm named for died quite a significantly long time ago every time I talk to her isn't very fun and is putting a stain on our relationship. I feel like kids should get their own name and be there own person. CMV. Edit: Reworded somethings. I understand that everyone couldn't possibly have the different names, but that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't think it's right to give someone within a family circle the same name as someone already in that circle. Edit: I feel like I should add that I have the same middle name as this person as well. I feel like the way my family functions, and the tragedy of my namesakes death has impacted the way I feel about my name. I've always been introduced to the extended family and family friends as the kid named after her - never for anything of my own merit. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
