The USSR is often seen as a villain.. True, the USSR did things that was considered disgusting, wrong etc. But i think the positives sides of the great, glorious USSR made up for it faults. 1: Living standards became much better. Many countries had it better then than they have it now. 2: According to Western legal theory, "it is the individual who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted against the government," whereas Soviet theory states that society as a whole is the beneficiary. Within the Soviet Union, emphasis was placed on economic and social rights such as access to health care, adequate nutrition, education at all levels, and guaranteed employment. The government of the Soviet Union considered these to be the most important rights, without which political and civil rights were meaningless. (taken from wikipedia) This one explains itself. 3: Atheism. The USSR promoted atheism in school. Unlike the USA. 4: The USSR fought bravely against Nazi germany. EDIT: Also, i believe that being united under one banner helps against racism. Even tho it will always exist, it is easier to befriend someone who stands for the same country and ideals. Comradeship. Equality. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] .
