I have come to this sort of view recently but would like to hear arguments to challenge the view. Basically we all know the stats of inequality, for example that the top 1 of Americans have 40 of the nations wealth I think this is wrong. Around the world we have people starving, homeless people, people who can't afford basic needs or who need government help to afford to get by. Then you have the very rich, who have more wealth then they could ever know what to do with. A lot of the time the very wealthy have tax dodged or hidden their wealth offshore, so they are not contributing their fair share. Some people will also possibly argue they get their wealth themselves and they deserve it. That is not true, without an education, people to help you, good health, the right opportunities and connections, employees to work for you, people to provide what you need and so on, nobody could amass any wealth, and a large amount of the very wealthy inherited it, so they were born into this wealth, they did nothing then be born from the right people.
