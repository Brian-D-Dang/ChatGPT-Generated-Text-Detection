Alcohol has a mild euphoric effect on the brain. This reduces your inhibitions, which can make your mind flow a bit more easily, although not necessarily more efficiently. Its important to note that you are not actually thinking better, you just think that you are thinking better, if that makes any sense. This is why programmers, writers, musicians, and other people who need to be creative to work often take up drinking. Sometimes its joked that alcohol is liquid courage, because its easier to express yourself when you feel better. This is also why drunk people seem to think that they can suddenly, magically, sing, dance, or do other silly things. Its worth noting that this is actually very dangerous. Feeling like you have to drink, for any reason, is a major indicator of (at least potential) alcoholism. Your should always monitor your habits, in order to monitor your health. Alcohol can be a boon, but it can also be very dangerous, as can the consequences of failing to drink responsibly.','i feel that I can hear things better..
