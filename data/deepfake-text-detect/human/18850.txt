After seeing an article in rworldnews about a Chinese national carving his initials into an Egyptian temple, and I got to thinking... What's the big deal? While I would never argue that anyone intentionally mar the value of a historical location, I don't thinking carving one's initials detracts from it. I think it actually adds to it. Like moving into an old house and seeing the height-marks left by the children of the previous owners on a door frame. It's another testament to longevity and history. It is an addition to the historical record. Of course, it's still a crime. It's vandalism, and punish it as such. But it's not a national tragedy, and no one should be publically shamed for it. In 500 years, his name will be read by people who will have the same argument about vandalism, and we'll all have been forgotten.
