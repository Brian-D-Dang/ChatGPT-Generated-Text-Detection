I'm going to go with the crunchy outside to chocolate ratio.," "Just like veal.... they're tender and sweet before they grow up:)," "Because they're smaller, there's less of that waxy, shitty chocolate inside. So you apparently like the crunchy dye-and-sugar shell.," "Thin candy shell to chocolate ratio is a good theory. Another is that you probably don't just eat one at a time. So with smaller pieces you eat an amount more to your exact desire at the time. So not only a better Shell to chocolate ratio but a more precise ability to distribute the candy into your hand then hand to mouth.," "I find the same to be true, mini m m's are superior, but if you want to make your standard candies better, try microwaving them for 10 to 15 seconds. Makes the shell crispier and the inside a little warm and melty, my favorite.," "They're covered in a thin candy shell. Surprised you didn't know that.," "Word to the wise: M M's use the nastiest, most flavorless chocolate available. If you could remove the candy shells and just eat the filling, it would taste like a chocolate-flavored crayon. The candy shell's not so bad, so by improving the shell-to-filling ratio, you get better flavor.,This is the realest question out there. It boggles my mind.
