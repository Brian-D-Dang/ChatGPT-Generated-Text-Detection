The other category of schools are those run and partly or fully funded by private individuals, private organizations and religious groups. The ones that accept government funds are called'aided' schools. The private'un-aided' schools are fully funded by private parties. The standard and the quality of education is quite high. Technically, these would be categorized as private schools, but many of them have the name "Public School" appended to them, e.g., the Galaxy Public School in Kathmandu. Most of the middle-class families send their children to such schools, which might be in their own city or far off, like boarding schools. The medium of education is English, but as a compulsory subject, Nepali andor the state's official language is also taught. Preschool education is mostly limited to organized neighbourhood nursery schools.
