Focaccia Fiorentina, it sounds like a string of italian curse words but it tastes like a gift from the heavens... I went down here with Melissa because I had purchased a 2 coupon from that online place (wink wink) that let us buy 35 worth of food for only 10. Needless to say, after all the restrictions of the coupon (minimum 2 people, dine-in only), we had enough food for an italian army! Still, it only cost 10 and I was hungry! I got the 3 sandwich which had Genoa Salami, Moz, Tomatoes, on (you guessed it) Focaccia bread (pardon my french, er.... italian). She got the 6 which had Turkey, and a bunch of other stuff that I can't remember. We also ordered the Penne (something) Vodka. You know you're an alcoholic when all you remember is the vodka part! Oh, and a large greek salad. Finally, we passed our 35 minimum and we sat down with all this food. People were staring at us all hateful like we stole this food from ethiopians or something! Geez! I didn't know there was a law against ordering this much food. We weren't going to eat it all there, I promise! We got boxes! Yes, Plural! The food was great, the lady that greeted us, not so much. We must have interrupted her break, because she was giving me the stink eye. Yes, can I order the 3? Ugh! Did you see that?!?! Why is it that Italians have the best of everything? The tastiest sandwiches, the tastiest pasta, the tastiest bread, the tastiest men.... ahem, sorry. got carried away. But its true! Everything about italy is awesome. Pizza! Anyway, this place has pizzas too. Maybe next time!
