Surely the whole bringbackourgirls is self defeating. This isn't to say I don't support the sentiment and i do think it's a truly heinous situation, but it doesn't make sense. I feel ultimately iy paradoxically increases the effectiveness of the act of terror and to a degree supportspromotes its style by adding fuel to the fire for the terrorists without having an actual force to change anything. Whilst there are always going to be smug campaigns which are more about feeling better from doing some armchair activism than true will to change, i do think that a lot of people will feel this particular campaign has a lot of merit so that it keeps it in the social conscience. I just don't think it works this time for the reason above.
