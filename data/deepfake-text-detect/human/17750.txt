Please don't assume that I am homophobic. Two of my best friends are gay. I am straight and an advocate of gay marriage because I believe in freedoms like this. However, as a scientific mind, I have to think of how this is even possible. IF homosexuality is genetic, why have gay people survived evolution and natural selection? In my opinion, homosexuals are mentally impaired, or homosexuality is caused by outside sources (such as social standings.) (Not sure about the second part, I've heard that some ancient Athenians were gay.) Sorry if I am not doing this correctly, first post here. Change my view.
