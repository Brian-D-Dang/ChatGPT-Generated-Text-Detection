WWE is going in the wrong direction with how they handle a lot of their wrestlers. Daniel Bryan should be WWE champion right now back when he won it at SummerSlam 2013 or Night of Champions 2013. He is so over and he is a great wrestler so why not make him the face of the company? CM punk leaving hurts the product as a whole. He brought alot to the show in 2013 with his matches and feuds again The Rock,Undertaker and Brock Lesnar. Dolph Ziggler and Damien Sandow are being buried unjustly. Great mic in-ring workers that have been wasted. The tag team division is a mess. No serious storyline ever happens around the tag team belts and they just do these matches at random. The women's division is a mess for the same reason as the tag team belts and half of their locker room on the main roster can't work. The intercontinental championship is on the wrong guy and they don't give it enough build to make it worth anything. The US title is basically an unsanctioned title at this point. They don't seem to know what to do with most of their roster and only have plans for a select few people.
