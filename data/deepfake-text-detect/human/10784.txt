It is a textbook pyramid scheme. The people at the bottom - which most likely is you - will run out of other people to recruit. Consider this: if everybody has, on average, two people under them, then 50 of the people in the pyramid is at the bottom. If everybody has ten, then 90 is at the bottom. Which group is it more likely you will end up in, considering you're even a late entrant into the pyramid? Stay the hell away from it; it'll take away your money and friends.,A "honest" network marketing operation would have to offer a good product at a reasonable price, so that the selling of the product makes the participants money (recruiting others would be some minor aspect). But if you have an organisations with a lot of middlemen, then this means that they all take their share of the price, which means that there is no way you can compete with other products (unless you scam your customers). So there is a limit how much middlemen there can be for a reasonable price, there is no reason why there should be many more people than manufacturer, distributorimporter, final salesperson involved.
