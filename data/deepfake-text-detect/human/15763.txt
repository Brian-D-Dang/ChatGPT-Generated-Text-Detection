Throughout its existence, Warsaw has been a multi-cultural city. According to the 1901 census, out of 711,988 inhabitants 56.2 were Catholics, 35.7 Jews, 5 Greek orthodox Christians and 2.8 Protestants. Eight years later, in 1909, there were 281,754 Jews (36.9), 18,189 Protestants (2.4) and 2,818 Mariavites (0.4). This led to construction of hundreds of places of religious worship in all parts of the town. Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. After the war, the new communist authorities of Poland discouraged church construction and only a small number were rebuilt.
