After reading about the presence of Neanderthal DNA in certain population groups and after seeing the studies that show IQs trending at different levels in different nations, I've become convinced that the possibility of race being a real, physiological distinguisher between population groups and of race being a partial determinant for the probability of different levels of intelligence. I think this possibility should be studied through politically neutral scientific studies and not be stigmatized. CMV?
