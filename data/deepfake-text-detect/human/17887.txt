When I initially heard about the shooting of Trayvon Martin, I was pretty disgusted that the police had let Zimmerman off so easily. However, whilst Martin's killing was a tragedy, since the story has developed, I have come to feel that there is no where near enough evidence to try Zimmerman for murder, and that what evidence there is points towards self defence. I think that the pictures of Zimmerman's injuries on the night front] , [back] , and the general theme of the eye witnesses' accounts, make it fairly clear that Zimmerman acted in self defense. I think the background voices in the 911 calls are not distinct enough to be useful. Furthermore, I think my initial reaction to the case was due the deliberate misrepresentation of the facts by the media. I don't think Trayvon Martin was a bad person, or a criminal: I think more than anything he was unlucky. For reference, I am European.
