The food is always hot and made fresh. I prefer the atomic or hot boneless wings with ranch. This may sound odd but their ranch is really good too lol The boss there is really nice and friendly. He is the one that makes the tea everyday too...which reminds me a lot of southern sweet tea, which I have with lemon. They have a lot of soda to choose from as well. The place has a family style atmosphere so I would recommend this place to all my friends and co workers.
