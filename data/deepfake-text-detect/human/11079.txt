I had a cut glued shut by some guy who claimed to be an off duty EMT with superglue he had in his trunk. It burned like HOLY HELL. My god it hurt. I was told later there is such a thing as medical grade superglue which does not burn. I guess dude was not stealing his private stash out of the ambulance, he must have been buying it from the Walmart.', "Superglue will seal the wound and prevent infections that way. It is slightly toxic but it is better than allowing an infection. I am pretty sure it is only used for short term situations. I don't know what wounds it is used for.,Superglue was actually originally designed to close cuts. It is slightly toxic but not terribly dangerous. There are alternative formulations that are more safe.
