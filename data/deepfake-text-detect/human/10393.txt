Given that livestock consume more water, feed, create more greenhouse gasses, and suffer throughout their lives to eventually be killed, while providing no essential nutrients that cant be attained through plants, is there any morally justifiable reason to eat meat other than hedonism or (environmental or otherwise) apathy? B12 is, as many don't know, not attained directly from meat, but from contaminated water and faeces which are consumed by animals. As humans we can take the choice to drink contaminated water, kill animals or.... consume fortified foods and supplements Iron is available in many plants and pulses I should add that I've been a religious meat-eater for most of my life until only 6-8 weeks ago
