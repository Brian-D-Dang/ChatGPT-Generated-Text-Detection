Supposedly, you should avoid discussing religion and politics (or other controversial topics) on a first date, because if your date holds a differing opinion, this could cause conflict and prevent a relationship from developing. I think that's stupid. If your beliefs are incompatible with your date's, doesn't it make sense to know as soon as possible? If it's going to be a deal-breaker, it's going to be a deal breaker. Why waste time, money, and emotional investment on a relationship that's destined to be a dead-end due to irreconcilable differences? I think it makes all the sense in the world to discuss controversial topics that are important to you, to "weed out" incompatible "candidates." CMV. Hello, users of CMV!
