I've seen people get flack for using the term "coming out" when it was a non-homosexuality context and people on Reddit FLIPPED THE FUCK OUT. It was the most juvenile and stupid thing I'd ever seen and, to me, seemed like people were just looking for an exuse to be offended. There is nothing about using the term in the way that I describe in the title that minimizes, takes away from, or makes fun of the stuggle that gay people have in coming out to their friends and family, but that same difficulty can be faced by anyone over almost anything. EDIT: I shouldn't have said nothing. Here's a quote from a commentor that I can agree with: " I do see a problem when it's turned into "I'm announcing something trivial about myself" sort of thing. " However, I still believe that people often over-trivialize what is important to someone else based on their preconcieved notions. For example when someone expresses trauma for having to speak in public and others say "what!? That's nothing!" etc. It's not a matter of the subject, it's a matter of how the people you admit something to are going to react. This could be religion, sports teams, which military branch you're going to join, or even the TV shows you watch.
