When a person is arrested, we say they are "innocent until proven guilty." While this may be true in some senses, it is also a major lie. Unless there is a bond set that you can afford to pay, you stay in jail for months, if not years, awaiting trial. 1. Being in jail itself is a punishment. If you are eventually found not guilty, you may not get any kind of reparation for that unwarranted punishment. 2. The punishment can turn out to be afar harsher one then many of us realize. A news search will quickly show you mountains of evidence that people in jail are likely to be physically hurt, psychologically tortured (i.e. kept in solitary confinement) or killed. You may be sick or become sick and denied medical treatment. And if you are in jail for an extended period of months, even if nothing especially bad happens to you there, you are likely to lose your job and even your home because you cannot earn income or pay your bills. If we are going to take the legal principle of presumed innocence seriously, we need to radically change the way we treat people who are accused of crimes. EDIT: It has been pointed out several times that I have been mistaken in my understanding of "the legal principle of presumed innocence." It only applies in reference to how a trial is conducted. Otherwise, the politicalethical problem remains.
