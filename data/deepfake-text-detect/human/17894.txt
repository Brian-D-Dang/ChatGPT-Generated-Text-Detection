This came up after I saw this link: Essentially what is happening is Gmail has algorithms that scan your email for child porn and if they find any they report it to the authorities. No human sees any images or communication that isn't illegal except in cases of false positive. I am totally fine with this, and I wouldn't even consider it to be spying. I would be quite happy if this program also searched for terrorists, rapists, burglars, or other people who are committing or planning to commit crime. I agree that spying by humans is a bad thing, but I think the reasons people don't like other people spying on them don't apply to algorithms, so algorithms can't be lumped into the 'spying' category. To pre-empt two arguments I expect to come up: I'm not happy with this program searching for 'criminals' who are considered criminals because of a law I disagree with, such as marijuana users. However, I think changing the law is the correct way to solve that problem. I think any algorithm that sends the communication to humans for investigation will necessarily have almost no false positives, because criminals are rare enough in our society that even a 0.01 false positive rate would result in so many false positives that the system would end up being useless. I'm OK with a few false positives anyway. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
