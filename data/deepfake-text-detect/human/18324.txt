I think there should be a system in place similar to what happened in the Movie 'Death Race'. Better yet, something similar to the Hunger Games. What am I proposing? Get the Prisoners on Death Row to participate in a mandatory contest to death. The winner gets a reward. And the other Death Row Prisoners can be taken care of in a quick and effective way, while the Public gets a kick out of the Entertainment provided by the Event. EDIT: Others have pointed out that such People should not be given freedom. So how about instead of Freedom, they get a reward?
