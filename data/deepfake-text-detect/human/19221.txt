I realize this is a very minor issue but I feel although I need to loosen up on the idea that people can wear shoes inside the house. I'll start off saying that I am consider myself to be very clean and organized. It kind of bugs me when someone walks inside my house with their shoes on because the thought of those shoes walking into mud or even dog poop and touching your floorcarpet gives me shivers. All my life I was raised to take off my shoes when entering a house. For example, when I go to a friend's house, I always ask "should I take off my shoes?." Just to be clear, I'm perfectly fine with my friends and I wearing shoes when we're at someone else's house; but when it's my own place, I get eerie. I'm living with 3 other guys next year so I don't want to be that "guy" that scolds other people to take of their shoes when they might have been brought up with wearing shoes in the house. Again, I know this sounds silly but I just want to feel more comfortable about it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
