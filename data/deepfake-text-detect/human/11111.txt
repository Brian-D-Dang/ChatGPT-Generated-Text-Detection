Combustion is a high-temperature exothermic redox (reduction-oxidation) chemical reaction. Oxygen is a very common, and fairly strong, oxidizing agent. It is not, however, strictly required for a fire. Some very fun (read horrifying) chemicals like ClF3 are actually stronger oxidizers than oxygen, and will happily cause things to combust without any help from oxygen.','As others have said, there are other oxidizers. The main reason we associate oxidation with Oxygen is that it is relatively plentiful, and our atmosphere is 20 oxygen, so if you have a fuel source to be reduced, it is likely to combine with Oxygen. If our atmosphere was 20 Fluorine, we might talk about Fluoridation instead of oxidation when it came to electron acceptors.','Oxygen is a strong "electron acceptor" if other atoms transfer electrons to oxygen, or just share them with it, energy that is, heat is usually released. It's not the only possible electron acceptor: other compounds on the right-hand side of the periodic table like fluorine, chlorine, and bromine will also accept electrons, and so will also work to start fires.
