Sleep doesn't create energy, it gives your body time to move energy around so it can be used. I hope somebody actually writes a good ELI5 for this. The assumption in your question (at least the way is worded) it's wrong but there's ca lot of interesting stuff going on. I'd v explain it but I'm going b to sleep.
