When the founding fathers liberated themselves from Britain, they envisioned a world of freedom and democracy. What they intended to mean by freedom and democracy was a world in which unalienable rights are not infringed upon. These rights include life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and many more. To ensure that these rights are protected, they created the constitution and its amendments, which protected certain freedoms. One these often overlooked amendments is the 9th. The ninth amendment ensures that unenumerated Rights are protected. I believe that this is important to consider in debates such as those of gay marriage. Many conservative Christians argue thst implementing gay marriage will undermine "family values" and will lead to immoral, already illegal acts such as beastiality and child pornography. Another arguements commonly employed is that America is a christian nation, so allowing "sin" to be legal is ungodly. What these ignoramuses fail to realize is that if gay marriage is outlawed, it is denying homosexuals their right to marriage, which in my humble opinion is protected by the 9th amendment. Even if this nation was intended to have Christian values, it would inevitably experience an ideological and social shift, which the founding fathers would anticipate happening.
