The sound of the wailing klaxons thrust me out of my sleep. But then again it wasn't really a sleep. More of an uneasy nap similar to those of every other person in this country. We all knew it would be any day now. There wasn't a soul around who wasn't ready with a bug-out bag and a government-issued rifle. The population had been "prepared" for this moment for months, through militia training and and town planning. We had heard the Head Voice speak a countless number of times on why it was so important to "resist the enemy" and to stop them from committing the same atrocities they had in New York and Boston. No one could forget those images on TV of those mounted, belt-fed MG's tearing through the crowds of people on Park Ave. No one could forget those images online of armored vehicles running over all those university students in Cambridge. Now that it has begun, we know this is our last chance to stop them. The monsters were supposed to protect us. Instead they "protected" us from our freedoms. I stepped out the door and saw the night sky lit up in the distance with AA fire and incendiary shells. I closed my door and said our people's prayer before heading off to the rally point: "Fuck the Police."
