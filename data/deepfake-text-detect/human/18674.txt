The title says it all. In our Reddit-friendly world, simply saying "this" when agreeing with a comment doesn't help anything. In 4chan, and some other forums, commenting with "bump" will increase the popularity of an original post. This works well for those types of forums, as bumping for visibility actually does something. Reddit works through the use of upvotes. If we like the rcatsstandingup post, we upvote it, and life is good. If we don't approve of a rspacedicks post, or its related content, we downvote it, put our phones down, and go outside. This system works very well, with a couple of hitches, mostly related to measures set to prevent brigading. The only reason one might post a simple "this" is egomania. The need to see their user name on the billboard. An upvote would easily do the job. A "this" that is hyperlinked to an Imgur picture of the posters penis would at least be original. But instead, ever day, we are subjected to a masturbatory comment that could easily be replaced with an upvote. If you were the "this" commenter, you could upvote, and, if enough people agreed with you, you could see the original commenter at the top of the thread. If you were the original commenter, wouldn't you like that? If enough people see "this," we could end "this." "This" is not an efficient comment. Change my view.
