I feel that the entire entertainment industry is nothing but a waste of time and money. This includes sports, movies, music, and television, among other things. People spend way too much time getting caught up in things such as sports and TV shows and if they didn't exist, people would spend a lot more time doing actually useful things instead of sitting around all day and throwing money into this industry. You might argue that it creates jobs, and while that is true to an extent, I feel that the time it causes people to waste far outweighs the employment it may give some people. I know many people who obsess over a sport or TV show, and spend hours and hours on them. I'm not necessarily saying that these industries need to cease to exist. I'm just saying that they need to be pulled of their pedestals in society. While yes, they might be nice things to have, they are by no means necessary. Society, however, has glorified them to massive, immovable things that are painted as being fundamental to people's happiness while in reality, they are nothing more than a luxury. EDIT: Original wording was harsher than I intended.
