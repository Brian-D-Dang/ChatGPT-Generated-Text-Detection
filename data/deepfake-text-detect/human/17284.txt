I'm writing this as my SO is trying to convince me otherwise too. I don't have anything but negative feelings towards drug abusers (thought I am quite reserved and don't express it). My SO on the other hand somewhat pities them and wants me to understand that 'there may have been other factors leading them down the path they're on'. I, however, just cant bring myself to accept that they don't rightly deserve the repercussions of their bad decisions. I think in todays day and age there is no excuse for ignoring all the warnings about drugs and drug abuse. In my opinion, you would have to be very ignorant to pay no heed to these warnings. Drug addiction does not only harm the user, but also puts strains on their friends and family and the public welfare and health systems, which isn't fair on genuinely sick people who didnt have a choice in the matter. In summary, I believe drug addicts have made a bad decision that has plenty of obvious warnings surrounding it. Because of this they have chosen to become a drain on society and thus do not deserve my sympathy, regardless of past situations that brought them to this point. CMV! Hello, users of CMV!
