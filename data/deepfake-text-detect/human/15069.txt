I was shocked to see the relatively decent reviews on Yelp as I had a pretty awful experience here. While I don't actually know you, I respect you as my fellow Yelper and will not bore you with the details. Nor will I discourage you from trying Grape Street for yourself. However, I will never consider coming back.'Nough said.
