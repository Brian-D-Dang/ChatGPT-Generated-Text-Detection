Car engine work by making gasoline explode at the optimal moment so it ignite it with Spark plug. But gasoline can also ignite by itself just with compression when the piston go up. In higher performance engine the compression is stronger so it cause problem because the gasoline would explode too soon and drop performance and can even cause problems in the engine. A higher octane level will be able to withstand more compression before exploding allowing the engine to do a full cycle normally. In normal car, putting normal gasoline or a higher octane gasoline will do nothing. It will just cost you more. But in specific high end engine it's important to use the right gasoline.
