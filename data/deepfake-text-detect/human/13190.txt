You're an odd one. Normally you'd be yellow but your skin is smooth and green. On the round head are two black hollows, making up your eyes, blankly staring back at me. Beneath is the glowing orange triangle of your mouth in the center of which is a hole that you whistle to. I think back when I first got you. I was in a bath, my knees and chest the only pieces of me which floated above the water, and you. Swimming around me, bobbing rhythmically with the ripples my movements caused. I remember as you began to whistle your tune with me and I whistled in response. I remember as my father burst through the door when he heard the two whistles from behind the locked door and the I remember the look on his face when all he saw was me, and my duckie. I remember the look of horror as he looked up the bath wall and saw the shadow, creeping up, looming above me. So dark, bold, beautiful.
