Headlights are mostly useful for improving the driver's vision while driving in low-light conditions and for increasing the visibility of the driver's car in low-light or foggy conditions. While stationary, the only non-malicious use of a car's headlights (I.E. other than parking the car and turning on the headlightshigh beams in an attempt to confuse or blind oncoming drivers) is to light up an area for somebody on foot. However, a flashlight would be much more effective for this purpose. With the lack of usefulness of stationary headlights in mind, cars should be designed such that the headlights turn off when the car is turned off in order to prevent the car battery from running down. Edit: To clarify, I don't feel that this behavior needs to be the only way to activate headlights. I see no issue with there being an option to have the headlights on when the car is off, but I feel that the "auto" mode (headlights on when car is on, headlights off when car is off) should be at least as accessible as the always-on mode in all vehicles that have both.
