Since my town installed roundabouts, I've found that they are remarkably more efficient than the traffic lights and four way stops. Four way stops force all vehicles to come to a complete stop, traffic lights force many vehicles to come to a complete stop before continuing movement, roundabouts allow most vehicles to go through while maintaining inertia. Traffic lights also would appear to be the most expensive of the options, considering building costs, general upkeep, paying engineers, and installing vehicle detecting hardware. Traffic lights also seem to have an increased risk of high speed accidents, because drivers will not always have to slow down and pay attention. WSDOT did a study on this, and they found that [roundabouts had 90 less fatalities than traffic lights.] Roundabouts also allow traffic to move more quickly than 4 way stops, [according to mythbusters.] tl:dr; Roundabouts are safer, more efficient for maintaining inertia, faster, cheaper. They are better for drivers as well as tax payers. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
