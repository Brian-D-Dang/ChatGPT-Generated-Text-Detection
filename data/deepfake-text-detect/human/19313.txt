I understand that now and again a dog might run off, but I think that's just due to dogs being curious animals and they'll come back eventually (if they don't get lost). If you hold an animal captive is it really a pet, or is it just an animal that you've got in a cage or tied to a post? As far as I can tell most reptiles, birds and rodents don't have a sufficiently strong bond with their owners that they wouldn't run away at the first given opportunity. I'm not necessarily suggesting that people shouldn't keep these kinds of animals; I am sure they live happy lives and bring enjoyment to their owners. Does anyone here have a reptile, bird or rodent that they allow to just come and go? One that voluntarily comes back, that you don't need to keep an eye on to make sure it doesn't run off.
