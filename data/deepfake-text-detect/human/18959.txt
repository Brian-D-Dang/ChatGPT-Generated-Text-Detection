I believe that the problems we face are too numerous and massive to survive. Out of control climate change, government debt crises in nearly every country, ocean acidification destroying the coral reefs and krill and other sensitive oceanic ecosystems, groundwater depletion and contamination, ozone depletion, the rapidly falling EROEI of fossil fuels and peak fossil fuel production, devastating loss of biodiversity in the global ecosystem, as-of-yet unexplainable bee population collapse, sea level rise destroying the world's coastal cities, desertification, topsoil depletion, deforestation, the deteriorating political situation in the PIIGS nations, the increased energy and resource demands of the BRICS nations, the decreasing effectiveness of antibiotics, and a rapidly growing global population that still demands yet more of this already failing system. I could go on but you get my point. These problems are huge by themselves, but taken together they present an impossible situation that humanity can not hope to survive. We should have started solving these problems decades ago and yet the world's leaders are still just sitting around with their thumbs up their asses as the world falls apart. The technology to deal with any of these problems doesn't exist yet (and may never) exist. I really don't see any hope for the long-term survival of human civilization.
