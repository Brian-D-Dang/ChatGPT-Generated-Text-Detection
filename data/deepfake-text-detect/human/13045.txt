Here I was, at this bright, beautiful forest to study the ecosystem. There was an abandoned station where there were rafts, most likely to ride down the river. As I got on the raft to explore, I rode through a peaceful forest. Strangely, I couldn't find any animals. There was some vegetation, but not enough to study more about the ecosystem. I saw a bridge in the distance, which may have meant you could visit this area. Then I saw something horrible. A destroyed, desolate forest. In the forest, I saw a truck designed for carrying logs. The area must have been abandoned because it was destroyed. My raft turned to the point where I couldn't see what was up ahead, and suddenly..... " AHHHHHH!!!! " I shouted as I fell down the quick, rough stream. It was breath-taking, especially for this previously peaceful river. Right as I thought it was over, I was soaked! Some of the equipment I brought with me might not work anymore..... I floated down the river for a short time, before being even more soaked by elephants on the side of the river. The bridge I had seen before, was dripping on me as well! I found a place to jump off the raft, and left the raft. I went back up the mountain I started at, and was ready to report what I had seen to the scientists I was working for. I will have quite a story to tell.....
