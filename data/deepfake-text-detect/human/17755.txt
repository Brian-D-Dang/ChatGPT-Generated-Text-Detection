My loved one was in Boston at the time of the Marathon bombing. The fear I felt wondering if she would be okay should never be felt by anyone, not to mention those who lost their lives or were grievously injured. I believe that PRISM-like programs make us safer, and I'd gladly give up some privacy to continue to make us safer. I don't believe that nobody thought that the government was watching what we did online, so I don't think leaking what he did changed anything, or brought anything to the light of the public. Also, Snowden signed a contract when he took his job, swearing that the material he saw wouldn't leave the US government. He stole it and broke that contract, and should face some justice. I believe we live in a changing world, where privacy may need to be sacrificed in order to fight a larger cause. Every presidency in the US has had to do this in some form, from rebellions, to the Indian attacks and raids. Now, in the Era of Information and Technology, it is our internet that must be surveyed to increase protection and security. I see a lot of snobbish "you're an idiot if you're okay with this, I want my freedoms!" on Reddit, from people who have no idea what it's like to go through a tragedy like this. The sleepless nights she fights through, the bodies she saw, survivor's guilt, and this is someone who was lucky enough to escape unharmed.
