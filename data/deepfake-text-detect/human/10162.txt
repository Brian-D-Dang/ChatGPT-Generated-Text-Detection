There is an increasing trend in the UK of'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a certificate and to celebrate that milestone, and as such should be restricted to University courses, and at a push to cover people at the end of High School (so that the people who go straight into work celebrate an end of their formal education). I appreciate that schools and the pupils want to celebrate the end of their time at that school, but placing children in garishly-coloured robes at the age of 7 only cheapens what a'graduation' stands for. There are other ways they can celebrate a new beginning without appropriating and trampling on existing ceremonies and traditions To give a comparison, consider how engineers in the US and Canada are given an iron ring in a ceremony to symbolise their obligation. The ring and the associated ceremony is a very personal symbol of their choices and achievements to the engineers. Now imagine how they would feel if every single infant school started copying their ceremony word for word, item for item, issuing iron rings to 7 year olds telling them it means the same. My son is supposed to have a'graduation' in a few months, and the vast majority of the parents are planning a boycott, organising their own event in its place. We can't even find out where this tradition started, or why. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
