"Why?" He asked. He stood before me. His facade remained as still as the corpse that flashed before my eyes when he spoke that word. A minute passed, then several. Not a muscle tensed or flinched. God was waiting for me to speak. When I stepped forward to see Him, the frail shell that I walked in for the last decade of my life eroded away into the prime of my youth. He glared me down with eyes that demanded judgement. "You already know," I began, but His voice echoed throughout the empty landscape, quieting mine like a parent hushes his child. "I still want to hear you." I paused to find words. A lot happened in seventy years. My whole life happened, but here the day rang clear in my mind like the church bells of a royal wedding. "I..... I was lonely." "All of us are lonely, Richard." He said. "Is she here?" I asked. "No." "Is he?" "Yes." I fell to my knees at the sound of that.
