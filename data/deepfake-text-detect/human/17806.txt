Genderswap ad campaigns like [this one] absolutely highlight interesting differences in the ways in which men and women's bodies are both perceived and portrayed by the masses, but beyond calling attention to this (which is akin to calling attention to the existence of patriarchy, if in a less loaded way) does not actually prove any moral point about the use of women's bodies in advertising campaigns. While these ad campaigns admittedly do have value in causing us to stop and think for a moment, I think that most often they will result in nothing other than the thought, "well of course men look silly in those poses - their bodies aren't attractive like that." I believe that the inherent differences in the shapes of men and women (generally speaking, obviously) make them differently attractive, moreso than the culturalpatriarchal views that are implicated in these ads.
