Public health officials have long been urging Americans to limit the consumption of red and processed meats due to its links with heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. Researchers have recently revealed that the advice was not backed by good scientific evidence. Large studies have found little health benefits from eating less beef and pork. Some scientists have criticized these studies, saying that it is irresponsible to publish results that may harm peoples' health. There is a growing awareness of the environmental impact of the meat industry. Red meat consumption has fallen since 1970, and has largely been replaced by poultry.
