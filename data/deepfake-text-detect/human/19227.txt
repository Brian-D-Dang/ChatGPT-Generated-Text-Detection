Disclaimer: I'm aware that outliers exist, I'm not claiming that all pro-choicers are like this. But I've noticed that whenever the topic of abortion comes up and pro-lifers try to speak up, they're drowned out by a locust swarm of logical-fallacies, blatant insults, and mob mentality delivered by the pro-choice crowd. I was reading this bestof thread and 75 of the comments treat pro-life people as Nazis incarnate. - "I'm willing to bet 90 of the 'just HAVE the baby and give it up!' whiners have never given birth." - "anti-choice folks" - "ITT: Entitled, misogynistic men who will never be pregnant but have an opinion about a woman should do with her uterus anyway!" - "Her body, her choice. We're not living in the 1930s anymore, get the fuck over yourselves." - "pro-lifers oppose the entire concept of a minimum wage, as well as things like progressive taxation, union membership, universal healthcare, and public education" - "You don't like abortion? Don't get one. What anybody else may choose to do or not do is none of their god damned business. " - "Anti-choice men come off as very predatory, self-entitled, and unempathetic to anything that hasn't got a penis" - "Wow, I had no idea there were so many anti-choice neanderthals skulking around Reddit." These are all top-level comments as of now. I've noticed this exact trend whenever abortion is brought up. It stifles any meaningful debate and scares away pro-lifers, who know that if they voice their opinion they will be crucified and downvote-hammered into oblivion. I admit that I'm pro-life, so I may be biased. To get a better understanding of the other side, I have posted here. Change my view of what I see as the extremely uncivilized behavior by pro-choice people on this site. TL;DR: Not only is the attitude of most pro-choicers on Reddit extremely rude, it stifles any meaningful debate on core premises of the abortion issue.
