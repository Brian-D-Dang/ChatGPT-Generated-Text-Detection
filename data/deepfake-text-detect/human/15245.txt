First time at Majerle's with three others. We went before the Rattlers playoff game but after a D-Backs game, so it was really hopping in there. Got seated right away though. We were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant, it lengthened our service time considerably. Our daughter ordered the salad special. It had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing. Her husband got the Rojo Diablo sandwich. He said it was'stringy' and didn't finish it. My wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a'lettuce bun'. She got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce. I got the All-Star burger. It was good but overcooked by two levels. The fries and sweet potato fries were good, as was the selection of drinks. All told, for three sandwiches, a salad and six beers it totaled 85. Too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location. Thunder Dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews. I may not be back.
