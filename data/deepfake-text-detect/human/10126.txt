This is a very sensitive topic so sorry for posting it here if I am not supposed to. This is a true CMV, I am on the fence about the issue ever since I joined reddit which is pretty liberal. I have always belived that the government is using any information they get fairly, catch criminals, stop possible terrorism stuff like that. The only time I think it has actually worked (to my knowledge) is when they caught a child pornography dealer through Gmail. I think its in the law abiding citizens best interest to be spied on. Please Chang my opinion if you feel thats wrong. Once again, I am on the fence on this so the most I will do is play Devils Advocate. To much I see in this subreddit people who obviously dont want their opinions changed. Edit: I dont know if I filled the 3 hour requirement but I came pretty close. Its 12 PMAM (Midnight) here on the east coast and I have my last exam of the year (Biology, riding the line on a Low A or High B, wish me luck) and I need to sleep...or study...one of the two. Keep the replys coming, its been very interesting. As for the future replys I notice some of the ones we have now have nothing to do with the topic, try to keep it focused on the act of spying not corruption in the government. They can be viewed as the same thing but try to keep it about the topic. Thanks and Good Night Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
