After purchasing items, shop tellers insist on places the notes of the change first, then resting the coins on top. This is wrong and thoroughly annoying. When coins are put on notes they slide around and risk falling onto the floor. People put notes away first as coins need your full attention to slide into your pocketpurse and so should be more readily available. If you wish to use two hands it is harder since you can't carefully pick the coins off the notes but it would be easy to pick the notes out of the other hand if they were on top of the coins By ensuring people get to put away their change quickly, other shoppers will be able to make their purchase quicker. This will save time and make people less annoyed at people scrambling with their change after buying somethnig. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
