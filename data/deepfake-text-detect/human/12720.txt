"Mom, dad, I'm sorry to break it to you..... but I'm pregnant. I know you're in shock, I was too, but it's got to be true. I've been feeling funny for days now, and I took a test..... it came back positive. I know I'm'young and dumb' but it is what it is. I'm sorry to have disappointment you." I stared at my parents for a long moment after my confession. They looked utterly confused. I thought my mom would say something but it was my dad instead. "Are you some sort of moron? Men can't get pregnant! Dumbass" I was shocked "but..... but....." My mom cut me off. "If this was some sort of joke David, it's really dumb, even for you." My parents shook their head an walked away. Maybe it was that week old burrito I ate?
