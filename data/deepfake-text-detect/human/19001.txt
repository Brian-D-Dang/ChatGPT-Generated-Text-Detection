Socialism is defined as a democratic control of the means of production by the working class for the good of the community rather than capitalist profit. The line of thinking being that when the working class becomes their own executives (supervisor, factory owner, company owner, manager, etc.) workers will be able to receive pay proportionate to the work they do and their usefulness to the company. Workers will no longer be a simple piece of machinery, designed to assemble the components and make pennies on the dollar compared to the supplier of the components, the large shareholder, and the factory manager, all of whom are able to sit back and let their wealth generate more wealth. Socialism is about the community, not the individual, and will ensure meaningful and relevant work for anyone who is willing to learn a profession.
