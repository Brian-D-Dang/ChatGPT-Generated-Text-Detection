Whenever I see parents that are taking care of their children who have been diagnosed with extreme cases of mental disability, I often ask myself "Why?" In social situations it really only seems to be an astronomical cause of stress. Bathing the child, always making sure heshe isn't hurting himherself. It literally never ends. To me, the joy of raising a child is watching it grow from an 8 pound cryingpooping machine into a functioning adult who has no limits to hisher capabilities. This dream is severely dampened with a mentally handicapped child. The other issue I find, is that a lot of these children are also incapable of really expressing their emotions, and often cannot even verbalize what they want besides grunts and tantrums. Obviously this perspective is probably wildly different when the child has half of your genes, but to me it definitely seems harder to love this child. Especially when the child is a huge stressor. You can also say goodbye to a relaxing retirement. I want to make it clear that I have the utmost respect for parents who raise a child like this with unconditional effort and love, my request is that you show me the light in such an arduous task. EDIT: I do not have children
