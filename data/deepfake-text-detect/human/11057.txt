To be fair, plenty of people complain about the role athletics play in colleges, as well as the lower standards for legacy students (children of alumni), which seems similar but you didn't mention. Also, the Ivy League doesn't (officially) recruit athletes, so your statement on that isn't really true. I would imagine plenty of the people who complain about affirmative action would prefer that their schools do well in college sports, and they hold the belief that if someone works hard enough, they could be good enough to earn an athletic scholarship.," "Athletes are chosen because they have a documented skill. Affirmative action rewards individuals based on the color of their skin (not going to get in to the justification arguments for affirmative action). That's a huge difference.
