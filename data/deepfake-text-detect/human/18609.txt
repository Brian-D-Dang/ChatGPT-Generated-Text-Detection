It seems to me that as more and more smartphones are released, along with them come a new slew of apps and social networking tools. Examples of this would be BBM's among blackberries, or apps like Tinder that are available only on the iOS. With every new app or phone feature, a community is created by its users, and this community is undoubtedly stronger the larger that it is. In the case of Tinder, for example, the app is worthless if its user base is small, but can be a pivotal networking tool if widespread. So it's obvious to me that even if a company like Nokia implements some brand new networking tool or app that's better than any other of its kind, if it's not available and used by a large user group, it's just not worth it. Essentially, I think it's always the most socially beneficial to own the most popular product, and this can even be applied to other products, not just phones. I know there must be an alternative to this thinking, but I can't wrap my head around it. Change my view?
