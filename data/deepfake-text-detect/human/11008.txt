We know that numbers whose decimal representation terminate have certain properties. Specifically, if N terminates, there must be two integers, X and Y, such that X Y N. So if you can prove mathematically that those X and Y cannot exist, then you know N cannot terminate. Check out the proofs that the square root of 2 does not terminate, they use this technique, and are more mathematically accessible.','Some mathematicians have already proved it mathematically that pi is irrational.
