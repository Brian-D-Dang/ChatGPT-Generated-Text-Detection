Like a lot of music fans, I'm fairly ambivalent about the website music blog Pitchfork. I think it's a good source for news, and their writing has definitely improved over the years. But I have a problem with its level of influence, particularly over other musics blogs. Over the last decade or so, I believe it has, you might say, 'flattened' critical opinion to the point where most indie music writers seem afraid or at least hesitant to deviate from its point of view. Looking at the majority of 'end-of-year' lists every December, and they're more often than not re-arrangements of Pitchfork's own list. At the very least, albums that are given below-average scores by PF usually end up being ignored by everyone else. In short Pitchfork has become so ubiquitous that it has closed, not opened, the ongoing conversation about independent music. CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
