The task of event detection and classification is central to most information retrieval applications. We show that a Transformer based architecture can effectively model event extraction as a sequence labeling task. We propose a combination of sentence level and token level training objectives that significantly boosts the performance of a BERT based event extraction model. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on ACE 2005 data for English and Chinese. We also test our model on ERE Spanish, achieving an average gain of 2 absolute F 1 points over prior best performing models.
