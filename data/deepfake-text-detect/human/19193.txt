Before someone tries to raise this point, I do believe there should be certain criteria in which we divide different "leagues," but those should be based on skill (Nothing entertaining about watching a professional team smother an amateur one), gender (In most sports, there is a huge biological [and so in my eyes, unfair] advantage of men over women), or age. Bah, I'm just going to ramble. In short: 1.) Additional weight is something that can be acquired and trained for if it's proven to be helpful. If anything, it'd make more sense to divide certain sports (basketball, boxing) by height considering you "can't teachtrain tall." 2.) Having weight classes can de-legitamise the victories and titles of those in the lower weight classes. 3.) Especially in the martial sports, the fights between the 150lbers and 300lbers are incredibly entertaining. 4.) There is a double standard where there are no weight classes for marathon runners or tennis players or any sport where being heavier is a disadvantage. We 'expect' them to have bodies built to the best possible form for their sport, but there is no expectation that smaller weightlifters and fighters bulk up to the best possible form for their sport.
