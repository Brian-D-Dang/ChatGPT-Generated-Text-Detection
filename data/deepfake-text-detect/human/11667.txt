The United Arab Emirates launched its first interplanetary orbiter, Hope, to Mars in July. It took over six years for the UAE Space Agency to launch the Mars-bound spacecraft, which is expected to arrive in February. Hope will remain in orbit and study the Martian weather system and how it varies across the planet. The mission is part of a wider effort within the UAE to engage the nation's younger generations in STEM fields.
