Personally I feel like people who say things like "Women get paid less because they're women" are looking at a gray issue in black and white. These are my thoughts, and if it comes off as ignorance I apologize, butt I genuinely do believe women are more submissive in nature than men, and this plays a role in things like Asking for a raise, negotiation about salary, and so on. Does gender play some role? I honestly don't know, but saying "oh shes a women therefore less salary" is seriously the most stupid statement i've heard because it's a more complex issue.
