After reading Michael Hoffman's [The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death] , I have come across the opinion that organized religion has created governing bodies that then go back and alter the original religion and that the purpose of the governing body is in turn lost as the purpose of the religion is distorted to serve the whim of the governing body. In turn, it calls for attempts of society to become "self governing" as the ultimate goal, in the belief that ones moral guidance will be astray regardless of an established government and that moral guidance is an innate part of human existence, and the idea of sin is inherently flawed in that one can not acknowledge ones behavior as sinful without also regarding it as destined. Michael Hoffman's essay has lead me to believe that governments should not exist, and I agree. CMW. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
