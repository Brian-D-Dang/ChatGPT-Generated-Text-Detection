Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. "That means that marriage isn't as special and you can just drop out freely whenever you want." I don't see this as a viable argument, because if someone is going to leave, then they have a reason to. Even if its a bad reason, or a really good reason, making the person stay by the threat of losing lots of money andor possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse and cause the couple to fight more and more. I see no reason whatsoever why anyone should be able to take legal action if their spouse decides to leave then. If someone leaves a marriage, it means they are unhappy with it, or have lost feelings for the other person. And like I said in my first statement, making the person stay in marriage until a joint divorce is (if ever) made by the threat of the person leaving losing a lot of money andor possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse, leaving 1 or both of the people suffering for years. Another reason why this is bad is if one person is unhappy in their marriage, and the spouse is forcing them to stay by means of threatening legal action, will leave the unhappy spouse in a terrible marriage for years, or possibly for the rest of their lives.
