Its contentious, there are a number of different definitions of the term: Theological A cult is anything that differs from the religion as conventionally accepted Sociological a cult is anything that deliberately opposes mainsteam culture Psychological a cult is defined by a set of specific psychological techniques. So under a christians definition the church of LDS might be a cult because of how it differs from mainstream christianity.

They're referring to the kind of psychological tactics it uses.
