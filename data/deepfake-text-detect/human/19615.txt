Shops like Topshop have been forced (through public opinion) to stock clothes for plus size women. I just don't think this is right. Clothes designed for certain sizes should be sold in those sizes and I don't see why they should have to stock plus sizes if they don't want to. I myself, have fluctuated in size anywhere from size 10 to 18, so I don't have a problem with people buying plus sizes, but there are companies which soley stock plus sizes, so why can't there be companies which choose not to supply them? If you want to buy clothes from these shops, but can't, then maybe you should do something to be more healthy, rather than shaming the companies who don't want to stock larger sizes. I feel this attitude just adds the problem of obesity, as society is forcing people to accept it, instead of making a change. CMV. EDIT: On my phone, so corrected typos. Also the title is supposed to say "stock" not "stick." EDIT 2: To clarify, I want to know why they should stick plus sizes when the don't want to. Why is it wrong that they don't? Not just because they will make more money if they do. Why should they?
