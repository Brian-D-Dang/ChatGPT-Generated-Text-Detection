In theory you want the metal parts to heat evenly before stress is placed on them. Cold things are generally more brittle which means they would crack instead of bending. In reality modern cars don't need any time to warm up. Modern materials and engineering techniques are designed to work in a wider range of temperatures.,Nothing - Modern engines are computer controlled and only need enough time for the oil to redistribute for "heating up." However, most people driving today were taught by someone who learned to drive in a carburated vehicle, that needed time to heat up so the fuelair ratio would be closer to ideal and the metals wouldn't be under as much stress.','Nope, in fact, [the opposite is true.] (URL0) "When your engine is cold, the gasoline is less likely to evaporate and create the correct ratio of air and vaporized fuel for combustion. [...] Gasoline is an outstanding solvent and it can actually wash oil off the [cylinder] walls if you run it in those cold idle conditions for an extended period of time. The life of components like piston rings and cylinder liners can be significantly reduced by gasoline washing away the lubricating oil, not to mention the extra fuel that is used while the engine runs rich. Driving your car is the fastest way to warm the engine up to 40 degrees so it switches back to a normal fuel to air ratio. Even though warm air generated by the radiator will flow into the cabin after a few minutes, idling does surprisingly little to warm the actual engine. The best thing to do is start the car, take a minute to knock the ice off your windows, and get going.
