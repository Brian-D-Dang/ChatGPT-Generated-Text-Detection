I've been to Vegas many times, and stayed both on the strip, and off the strip. The Golden Nugget, by far, has been my favourite place to go to... it's very much a home away from home for us... Yea, its off the strip... and I LOVE it... Not as many drunken frat boys, with backwards baseball hats yelling wooooo wooooo!! Granted, it gets more and more like that, towards the evening, when the light show thing starts happening... (which I find completely dumb, but whatever gets the masses to stare at the ceiling and drool, because some various lights are going on and off makes them happy, more power to the drones!) Anyways, back to the golden nugget... I love this place. We booked the Gold tower room... the TV in the bathroom mirror RULES... nothing like doing my morning business and being able to watch C-Span... Also, the room, which I thought was going to be a touch bigger, is still great. The bed is comfy... Its just a very nice and relaxing room. The pool was great... However, be careful of floating vomit... No, seriously... I swam into it once... and how is it that with how many people were in that pool, no one noticed some drunk person BARFING in the pool... Yuck! Besides the above incident, I love this place... They treat you well there... We decided on staying an extra night. We are planning another trip there this summer. I cant wait.
