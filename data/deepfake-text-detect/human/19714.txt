After meeting a unexpected pedophile, my view on pedophilia has been radically altered. I don't see why we need to criminalize pedophiles. The man i met was very rational and intelligent and knew that his urges weren't permitted by our society and would always act within constraints of law, yet if word got out of his urges, I'm sure the community would shun and probably attempt to incriminate him for his innate urges. Why is pedophilia looked down upon now, when it used to taken as commonplace not too long ago?
