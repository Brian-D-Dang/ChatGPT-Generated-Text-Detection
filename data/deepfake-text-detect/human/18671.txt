I often see the argument, especially from America, that more people with guns means more safety. I see that people want to feel safe, by being able to stop any threat to them almost instantly. But I don't understand how you would feel safe under the assumption that everyone around you is carrying a gun. Wouldn't this just create a huge sense of tension? To me carrying a gun is possessing a power to end livescause bodily harm in an instant and on a whim. Some people get angry and cause fights and throw punches. Not many people are like this, but some are. Why is there an argument that these people should be armed? I understand that if someone did snap and pointshoot a gun at someone, you also have the means to deterstop said person. But just remove guns from the equation and there's no issue at all. To me anyway. Edit: just woke up and have to go to uni, when I'm back I'll continue the discussion
