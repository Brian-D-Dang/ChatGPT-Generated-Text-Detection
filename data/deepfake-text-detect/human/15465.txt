What a delight! A great new place in the West End. Being friend's with the chef I have to promote this place but I must admit it's a great place. The food is fresh and tasty and quite Scandinavian in style. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the food we ordered was beautifully presented. I went for a Fennel salad to start with (which is unusual for me!) and the Skirt Steak for mains, followed by a delicious chocolate tart. My companion went for Stornoway black pudding, with duck egg and piccalilli which worked very well. The seasonal mixed vegetables is presented as a frittata which is quite different too. I saw other people having the cheese board which did look delicious and small enough to not be overpowering! Have a look at their website and give it a go. It looks tiny when you walk in but through the back is a lovely, bright conservatory area which is very nice indeed! It's a nice wee haven in the city from all the hustle and bustle of town! I hope it does well and gets a lot more visitors:)
