I feel it a massive contradiction that whilst sexual content, violence, images of drug-takingdrinking are censored and age-classified should I wish to watch them on TV or in a film, exactly the same things can be depicted in a music video and this is not in any way challenged or controlled. My belief is that they should be given the same treatment and subject to the same censorship and age ratings as films. CMV!
