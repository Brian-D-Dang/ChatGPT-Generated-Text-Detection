The closest touristy, Arizona-esque candy shop to me here in Central Phoenix. Cactus Candy Co is located in a small building room, stocked with: hot sauces, jellies, marmalades, cactus gummies, prickly pear taffy and shirts. Upon entering I was greeted and was given some advice on the popular items people typically purchase. It was helpful, good amount of candies and jellies but definitely limited. Two thumbs up for having a discount with paying with cash being a student. With the discount it ended up not being too expensive either. I got a few boxes of prickly pear candies, taffy and jelly for my friends and family back home. Crossing my fingers they'll enjoy the distinct taste of prickly pear from the good ol' Valley of the Sun!
