Giving someone respect to anyone for an arbitrary reason, in this case age, is ignorant. Respect should be earned on a case-by-case basis. The saying "respect your elders" always seemed dogmatic and rubbed me the wrong way. Someone that's older is just as capable as being naive or having ill intentions as a person of any other age. Of course I'll help an old person carry groceries or cross the street when the situation arises and it's also true that older people have more life experience so it's important to hear their perspectives but this shouldn't afford them any sort of special status in society.
