So I'm talking hear about girlswomen who way clothes with plunging cleavages, booster bras, short skirts and the like. Many times I have seen the culprit throwing a tirade of abuse at both guys and girls who gave either looked to long or made a pass at them. I think this is wrong. My view is that if you dress like that then you are asking for that attention. It almost seems that said person is actually angry about the attention coming from the wrong source. Essentially I am looking for someone to explain why a girl or woman has the right to dress in a manner that is so sexual and yet forbid anyone from looking. Please change my view.
