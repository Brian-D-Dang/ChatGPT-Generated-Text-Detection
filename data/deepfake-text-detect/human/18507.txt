First off, this is nothing to do with Lisa Kudrow's performance: it is the writing of the character that I have issue with. I realise that Phoebe is supposed to be the 'zany' or 'weird' one, but that's no excuse for the constant rudeness of her character. She interrupts the other characters in almost every episode, with an extremely dismissive tone that suggests she thinks their opinion is nowhere near as important as her own. She is often very selfish, refusing to change her very stubborn views to help any of the other characters (as an example, banning Rachel from going to the chain spa. Even though this hypocrisy was the basis of a few later scenes, it was never properly addressed I feel). I also take exception at the fact that none of the other Friends characters ever call her on her behaviour. For example, in The One With Joey's Big Break, [Phoebe is angry with Ross] , acting very rude to him throughout the episode, even though she can't remember why. As an aside, quite why Ross cares at all bothers me too, I'd have said 'fine' and left her to it. She finally remembers she was dreaming and then that's it: no rebuttal, no (very justified) exasperation from Ross etc. Also, in The One With Monica's Boots, she wants Sting concert tickets from Ross, and she shouts after him to "get me the tickets!" extremely aggressively. This behaviour doesn't seem pleasant to me at all, and I wouldn't have her in my close social circles. Overall, I think Phoebe is just rude, selfish and way too opinionated. Although I understand that the group needs a 'zany' character, I think Ross and Monica (and sometimes Rachel) have enough strangeness or eccentricity between them to drop Phoebe altogether, with no ill effect on the show at all.
