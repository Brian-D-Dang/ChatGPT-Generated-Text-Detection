Apple's AirTags trackers were mentioned on a recent Apple Support video. The tracking tags will bring Find My iPhone-style location service to other items, such as keys. Apple's ability to create tailored hardware could make a huge impact on the tracking industry. The video has since been removed. It is not yet known when AirTags will be released. A link to a copy of the video is available in the article.
