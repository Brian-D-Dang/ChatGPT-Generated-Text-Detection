Long story short, my girlfriend's parents, in my opinion, are deadbeats. They don't hold jobs because they claim they aren't able, but at the same time will say that they could have one but it wouldn't pay as well as disability and the other government assistance they are on. They claim that their income comes from selling things on eBay but that is only around a few hundred dollars a month. I've known a lot of people who struggled both mentally and physically, and they still tried to be productive to society and earn money for their lives. I view that is having self respect and integrity. I feel that if having a job and working is considered optional, why should anyone do that to support those who don't? I'll be honest I know my view is fairly deep rooted and I'm not sure if it can be changed. But I'm more than willing to try and really what I'm looking for here is to try to get a glimpse of how one believes that it is okay to demand something for nothing, because right now I can't understand it at all.
