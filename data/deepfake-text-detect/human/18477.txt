This a view that I am very embarrassed to have but nevertheless I just can't shake it no matter how much I think about it. I live in a western country and religion isn't really prevalent (at least around me it's not), I am not religious. 1. Marriage has always been between a man and a woman and it should always be between a man and a woman. I don't understand why homosexuals demand the title of "marriage" and why we must redefine marriage for just for them? Why are they not able to have a "civil partnership" with the full rights of marriage instead? I feel like homosexuals getting married will devalue marriage. I am well aware of the heterosexuals that just screw their marriages up and don't value marriage but they tend to be of unintelligent and of the lower class. But it just doesn't feel right because marriage is the joining together of two people of the opposite sex (there's a reason why men and women have complimentary genitals) who usually go on to produce children and create a family. I do not extend this view for transsexuals or those with gender identity mismatches. 2. A child should be raised with a mother and father if possible. I am aware of single parents who do a great job etc. but in terms of adoption, I do not believe that a good homosexual couple should be on a level playing field with a good heterosexual couple (I am not sure if it's currently implemented but it is desired) if they were put against each other to adopt a particular child. The response to this will be that it's not fair to not have them on a level playing field but when we discuss fairness in adoption, it should be about the children. Every child deserves a right to grow up with a mother and a father. However, if there's a shortage of heterosexual parents and the best choice for a child are a homosexual couple then so be it - every child deserves to have a family. But in all cases, I believe that heterosexual couples should be given first preference in adoption.
