Early adopters of Tesla's entry-level Model 3 will soon have their software downgraded to match the same software as current entry-level Model 3s. The early adopters were able to enjoy many of the features of the more expensive Standard Range Plus car. These features included a wider range of travel, onboard music streaming, heated seats, faster acceleration, and Autopilot. Model 3 owners can arrange a service appointment through the Tesla app in order to purchase a software upgrade to reinstate these features.
