Mainland is good if you don't really know what good Asian food is. I understand its fusion but I find that that term is more often used for a conglomerate of the strongest of flavors Asian cuisine has to offer, typically the saltiest, sweetest, sourest, etc. Rarely, if ever, is it used to describe an accurate and enlightening combination of cuisines. In any case, Mainland offered exactly the fusion I'd expected. I had the crispy noodle wonton soup, which tasted great until half way through when my body knew to stop before the sodium had absorbed all the water in my body and I shriveled up. As if casino air wasn't bad enough for my hydration. Plus, I come from the SGV, so 14 for a bowl of noodles is ludicrous when I can hit up a Garden Cafe or other such spot and get a better version for 5.95. Guess I'm spoiled. My co-worker had the pork-chop, which was served in a bowl, and when she asked for a knife and fork they gave her a butter knife. ahahaha....On the up side, the wontons in my soup were pretty darn good and unlike my ghetto joints here at home, had all pork and shrimp in them.
