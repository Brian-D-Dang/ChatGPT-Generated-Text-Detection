People will always downvote something they disagree with. It's just human nature. You see something you don't like and you want to have your say on the matter, without having to go to the effort of leaving a comment. "The downvote button is an essential part of monitoring content": If a comment or post is breaking the rules, report it. "Reported posts have to be reviewed, which will create a huge workload the mods": It says in the reddit FAQ [here] that posts can be reviewed by a program. Also, you could say only a post which has been reported a certain number of times gets reviewed. The number of times could be relative to the amount of traffic on that comment thread, so that small subreddits weren't full of rubbish comments that didn't get enough reports. "People will just start using the report button as a downvote button": Subreddits such as rgonewild and even rchangemyview don't have a downvote button on posts. I would be interested to hear from the mods of those subreddits to see if they have an unusually high number of reports. Otherwise, there's no proof to this point and I still think it would be worth a try. Edit: Hey, thanks for the replies. I will be back to respond soon but haven't had a spare bit of time recently to do this, and I don't want to rush a rubbish response. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] . If you see a comment that has broken one, it is more effective to report it than downvote it. Speaking of which, [downvotes don't change views] ! If you are thinking about submitting a CMV yourself, please have a look through our [popular topics wiki] first. Any questions or concerns? Feel free to [message us] . Happy CMVing!
