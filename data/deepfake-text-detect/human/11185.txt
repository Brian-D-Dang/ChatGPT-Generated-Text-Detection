Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation. You may be more familiar with electromagnetic radiation in the form of light, but it's the same thing. You can turn on a flashlight in outer space and it will travel forever, and the same is true for radio waves. They require nothing to "bounce off of." Just transmit and off it goes.
