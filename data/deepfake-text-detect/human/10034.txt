Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible. There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as the worst pizza you can find in a restaurant. I have searched for years trying to find frozen pizza that's half as good as even Little Caesar's, but to no avail. I've come to terms with the fact that every variety has low-quality sauce and not enough cheese. What I can't stand, however, and definitely the most common flaw, is the terrible, terrible crust, which ends up either undercooked or bone dry, without fail. I understand that pizza can only be properly cooked using a pizza stone, but it completely baffles me that this is the best we can do without one in 2015.
