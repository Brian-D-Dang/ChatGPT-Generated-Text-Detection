Swelling is a symptom of inflammation. It is the body's reaction to tissue damage caused by injury or infection. Chemicals released by a damaged cell start the inflammation process. Increased blood flow and vascular permeability cause the swelling. Inflammation helps in fighting infection and repairing tissue damage. It also helps by immobilizing the joint to prevent further injury. The general rule is make yourself comfortable. Severe inflammation is doing more damage than good so any pain or loss of function should be treated with ice packs and if necessary OTC pain meds.
