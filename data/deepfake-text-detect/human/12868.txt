A lightly charred slip of paper floats to the floor in front of me. "Don't. Just..... don't," I read in my own handwriting. Confused, I check the back but there is nothing more to the message. That's odd, I think, looking around the room. And then I see her walk in, and everything in my mind goes blank. There have always been beautiful women in the world Scarlett Johansson, Helen of Troy, and many others. But I could tell, she was made just for me. Every fiber of my being screamed at me to walk no, run to her, to ask her name, her deepest fears and grandest dreams and her favorite color and why she came here today and who her heroes are and if she prefers scrambled eggs or poached and..... then I looked back down at the burnt paper still between my fingers.
