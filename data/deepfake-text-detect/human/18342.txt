Much of the worlds current political struggles are attributed to the catch-all term of "Radical Islam." I believe this term to be wildly over simplistic and it ignores the political and nationalism issues that play a larger role in the hostility that some have with the West. Attributing the actions of these groups to the whims of religious fanaticism is an easy way to convince the public that their motivations are not grounded in anything other than "they are just nuts." To write off these actions in such a way is to detract from the true motivations of these individuals, which are largely a reaction to unwanted Western influence on their immediate geographic area. To ignore these tangible political and nationalism motivations - while chalking it up to religious people who are just being crazy - is to drive us further away from conflict resolution in these areas.
