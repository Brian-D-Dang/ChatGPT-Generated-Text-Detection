In this paper, a computation of the input-redundancy weight enumerator is presented. This is used to improve the theoretical approximation of the information-bit and -symbol error rate, in terms of the channel bit-error rate, in a block transmission through a discrete memoryless channel. Since a bounded distance reproducing encoder is assumed, the computation of the here-called false positive (a decoding failure with no information-symbol error) is provided. As a consequence, a new performance analysis of an MDS code is proposed.
