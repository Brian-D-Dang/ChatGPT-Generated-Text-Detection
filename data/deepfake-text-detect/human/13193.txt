A whiff of incense floated across the arena as the Terran gate crashed wide open, all the bells and whistles sounded, and silhouetted against the harsh light to his back Father Brendan stepped forward, clutching his rosary in one hand and catechism in the other. Nervously he looked around the million strong audience, not sure if the boos were from the good folk of County Tipperary and Boston sent to support him, or from the other planets. "Hail Mary, full of Grace." Caution his watch word; that, and the stinging condemnation of the judge at his trial. "Father, you have two choices: trial by combat in the arena, or castration and ten years on the Rock." It was no choice, really, as while Brendan rather fancied idling his time away on Phobos, he was also rather partial to his tackle. A booming voice called out across the arena: "And tonight's last contestant, all the way from..... cough..... County Tipperary, in the pink corner representing Terra, wighing in at hundred fifty pounds, number twenty eight: Brendan'The Sod Father' McCulloch! More boos and cheers went up around the arena, his heart thumping against his chest, and for the first time since his arrest he knew what real fear was. The headlines called him the vilest predator across two continents, but..... all he could do was keep faith in the Virgin and hope that his prayers would be answered.
