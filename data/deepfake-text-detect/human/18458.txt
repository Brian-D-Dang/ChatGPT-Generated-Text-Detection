About a week ago we had a pro life group set up in a busy area of our university campus outside with "warning" barriers and signs before the actual display. But if you were going from one end of the campus to the other without making a large detour, you would have to walk through it.., and today I see a giant abortion kills poster on an overpass over our highway during rush hour. How are these graphic posters allowed to be displayed in busy and public areas? For the highway poster, there was a police cruiser with his lights on beside it (Im assuming it was either to make sure that the guys with the poster werent going to throw themselves off the bridge, or to help them with the poster and such). Shouldn't I have a choice to NOT view these? I have looked briefly into it and some students HAVE gotten arrested for doing it in areas that weren't approved by the university elsewhere.. The Pro-Life group believes that "hiding" the posters from public sight is a form of censorship. I'm curious if any of the pictures used in the posters were approved by the families to be used for pro-life? How does this respect the families involved? Isn't this similar to posting a picture of a teen suicide and saying "Hide your magazines! Too much pressure for teens!" Pro-Life supporters also don't care for the situation of the families involved, even if it was a rape case. This baffles me completely. I understand that Pro-Life supporters want ALL individuals to have an equal chance at LIFE especially when the individual CANNOT chose to make that decision for themselves, but still. Why do they not put pressure on magazines and other forms of social forces that drive teens into depression and suicide in some cases. Where is the Pro-Life in that? Sorry, I feel as if I had to get that off my mind. CMV Guys! Thanks!
