They translate the network packets into high frequency signals (much like Wifi does) and then feed this signals into the home wiring. At the other end a second device receives the signals and translates them back. Normal electrical appliances don't care much about signals of that frequency, so they aren't affected. But the wiring itself acts as an antenna, and transmits the signals into the air, which can lead to problems with some radio applications.
