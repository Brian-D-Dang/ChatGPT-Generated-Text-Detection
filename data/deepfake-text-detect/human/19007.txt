I recently was banned from rHoldMyNip for reporting a post for animal abuse and commenting on it. The link was a gif of a cats trapped in a dryer. Even if there was no heat the dryer had to be on for the inside to be spinning the way it was. This is clearly a situation in which a cat would be under pretty severe duress. Am I wrong? It seems to me that whoever made the video has no problem being cruel to animals just to get a cheap laugh. After commenting I was shortly banned and received a message from the moderator calling me a complete idiot. If I am in fact being dumb then please someone enlighten me. Here are the links: and an image of the message from the mod. Edit: I said two cats. It looks like it is just one cat. Also It looks like there may be no door on this dryer but I honestly can't tell. Also apparently it was posted by the mod who banned me. Edit 2: I am not asking if I can be banned for something. I was already banned so obviously yes it exists within their wheel house. I am simply asking if being concerned for the welfare of a cat is just cause for being banned. I don't think it is. Even if I am wrong about the cat being in any amount of distress, that should not result in being immediately banned. Someone could easily just point out that the door is open and claim that this is enough to suggest that the cat is in no harm. That is fine. Instead I received abusive messages from the mod who also posted the gif. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
