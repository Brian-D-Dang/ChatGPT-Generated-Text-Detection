I have found that the phrase "Intolerant of intolerance," and the whole liberal movement, is just as closed and intolerant as anyone else, just about new things. I often come across liberal minded thinkers, who say that everyone is entitled to their opinion and should be accepted no matter who they are, yet they refuse to accept people they deem as intolerant for who they are. This seems to include massive groups, such as organized religion, people opposed to same sex marriage, conservatives, non western cultures that have non liberal views, such as arabic culture having a different idea of gender roles (if it's a culture that is more similiar to our own, then it falls under the protected liberal category), and various others. I have also seen this view extended to a desire to remove some of their basic freedoms, most notably freedom of speech and the freedom to congregate. To clarify, I am not asking to debate individual views of the liberal community (women's rights, gay rights...). I would like to understnad, and perhaps change my view, on how if acceptance and tolerance is such a priority for liberals, how they can reject such massive swaths of humanity as unacceptable and intolerable? Thank you for your time. EDIT: I accidentally said in favour of same sex marriage instead of opposed to. That has been changed Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
