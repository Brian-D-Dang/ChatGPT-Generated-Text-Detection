Theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying doesn't do that. Economic efficiency average happiness: violating the individual rights to be unharmed and to not have property taken without permission (e.g. fines) while pursuing higher average happiness is immoral and impractical. For the plan to work, one would have to show that average happiness would increase and that the oppression inherent in the prohibition on commercial copying (taking into account the nature of the organization required to enforce that prohibition) would not outweigh the benefits; a calculation that seems to me impossible to make. What we do know for sure, if a prohibition on commercial copying is implemented, is that individual rights will be violated. Homesteading ideas ownership extends to what we create: I have no problem with people owning their ideas. I don't suggest that they be extracted from their brain or deleted from their computer. Copying adds more of an idea, it doesn't take it away from its owner. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
