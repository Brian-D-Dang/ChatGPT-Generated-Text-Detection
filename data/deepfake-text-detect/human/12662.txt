When I first heard my name called at the ceremony, I felt nothing but sorrow. Sorrow for the loss of a future with choice. The choice of love. The choice to have children. As I walked towards the house where my new Ghost husband resided, I thought about the loneliness I would surely feel. Three years later, I feel a different kind of sorrow. I'd fallen in love. He had a good sense of humour and we were easily able to make conversation. I spoke of my childhood not twenty years ago. He spoke of his childhood three hundred years ago. I felt lonely still. I'd had no human contact for a long time. I could go visit family but it wasn't them I wanted to feel. I wanted his arms around me, to feel his warmth but that was one wish I couldn't have come true. We spent many days laughing and joking. Some days we barely talked. I grew older. He did not. As I lay growing colder by the day, refusing to see a doctor, he stood over me. The smile he had when I first appeared never left his face. I smiled back as his hand finally slipped into mine and I gripped his hand tight.
