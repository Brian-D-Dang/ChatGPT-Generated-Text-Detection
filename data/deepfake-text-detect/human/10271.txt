This CMV was inspired by this post: I believe that being obese is a disability. Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out. It's a disability that a person does to themselves. It's a disability that is completely avoidable, and I think for these reason people don't like to classify it as a disability. However, I still think it's a disability because it makes it harder to perform every day tasks. Here's a comparison that I use. Imagine you cut off your leg with a hacksaw, for no good reason. You're now missing a leg, and I would consider you to be disabled. You did it to yourself, and you could have made different life choices to avoid becoming disabled, but you are disabled all the same. You might argue that someone who cuts off their own leg obviously has some mental issues, but that could be said for a person who allows themself to become severely obese. For example, depression leads to overeating for many people. So why should obese people be denied some of the "benefits" of being disabled, just because they did it to themselves? And I hate that I feel like I have to even say this, but no, I am not overweight, and I do not have any personal agenda. I am honestly curious why people believe this, and I am willing to reconsider my views. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
