I am aware of actual conspiracies such as operation Snow White, MK Ultra, Operation Northwoods, etc. I am completely willing to accept that there are times when data from other sources is manipulated and construed to the favor of the government or other parties. What I am not following is when data that I can test in my own back yard or in private is somehow a conspiracy from the government? Why, given all of the testable evidence in my back yard about how CO2 acts and all of the known problems with the polar ice caps and weather, would ANYONE deny that the problem exists and is something that we caused? I wrote a longer blog about it here: I outline a lot of the actual science behind it and so on. I'm open to the idea of conspiracy, but I'd need to have some really good and compelling ideas to move that way. Instead, as of right now the evidence does not suggest conspiracy or political favor. If anything, it's against politics best interest to push it because big oil is a major investor into campaigns on both sides. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
