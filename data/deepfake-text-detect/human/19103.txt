Bitcoin has been around for some years now. It has been used to generate income, exchange money anonymously, and assist criminal organizations. Bitcoin is a great and incredible feat. It has many advantages, but I feel that since it is an unregulated currency it is easy to use for nefarious purposes. One of the biggest users of Bitcoin was Silk Road, the drug trafficking organization in the US. Bitcoin provided an easy simple way for them to transfer large sums of their money to other recipients quickly, effectively, and anonymously. When Silk Road was finally shut down [this] happened to Bitcoin. If Silk Road utilized that much of Bitcoin, imagine how much more of it is being used for other criminal organizations. I don't see any solution to this issue except that the governments would have to deal with it on their own and take the organizations down from their sides. The next question you ask yourself is, is that fair to the government? Should they be spending so much more effort, so many more of our tax dollars to try and break an organization, that could be severely crippled by being unable to use Bitcoin to transfer their purchases? These are all questions that I am asking myself and are pointing me in the direction to believe that Bitcoin, while useful, does more harm than good in the long run.
