I believe the uproar over PRISM and NSA are well intentioned but misguided in that it is based on nostalgia for a kind of "privacy" that is no longer possible because: 1) Moore's Law will soon end privacy in any case- The revelation that dozens of tech companies already have exactly the metadata that the NSA is collecting is not trivial. As computation power expands, reconstructing a person's entire digital trail will be a trivial computational problem for literally any software provider. To ensure domestic tranquility and provide for the common defense, the government needs access to at least the same level of information available to ventures with names like Kabloodle.com. 2) Threats are about to become far more dangerous. As fabrication technologies increase, incredibly dangerous materials will become available at the touch of a button. Already, 3D printed weapons are being produced. Moving forward, it will soon be possible for a large number of people to fabricate bioweapons using simple DNA sequencing, to deploy "DIY drones," and ultimately to weaponize nanotechnology and advanced physics with little material investment. Because the line between bits and atoms is becoming so blurred, surveillance will be one of the only lines of defense against events that threaten not just thousands, but millions. CMV
