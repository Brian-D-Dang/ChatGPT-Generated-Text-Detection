I'm about at my wits end here, looking for some reason not to feel seething hatred for this man right now. I'm traveling this week, staying at a hostel right now and sleeping in a 20-bed dorm. There is a man here who snores ridiculously loud - sounds like an angry horse or feral hog. I have briefly spoken to him during the day, he is also a tourist to the area so it's not like he's borderline homeless and using the hostel as a last resort. It's been 3 days now that I can't get a lick of sleep at night due to the incessant snoring and I'm reaching a breaking point. A good half of us in here are having difficulty sleeping as well, not just me. Is it not extremely rude for him to put himself in this position? Please, give me a reason not to be so upset with him.
