Please note that I am not referring to the SATs or other tests of that nature because I can understand why they exist for the purpose of college. I am also American so I am mainly referring to american tests as I don't know much about standardized tesing in other countries. I am mainly referring to the tests issued by each state (soon to be the country) to public schools across the USA. Curriculum in American schools is heavily based on these tests. So much time is spent in classroom preparing for these tests and teaching kids things that they have already learned, are not ready to learn, or are learning at a good time for themselves. I just think it distracts from learning and more time should be spent in making sure each student learns at their own pace. Maybe if standardized testing was based on the learning capabilities of each student and not their age, then I would be more open to it.
