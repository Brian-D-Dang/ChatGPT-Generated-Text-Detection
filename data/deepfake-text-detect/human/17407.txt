The taller someone is the more naturally I yield authority to them. It's not rational but it's tough to force myself out of that mindset. I also think the taller or more muscular someone is, the more they are used to being in charge and it becomes too easy to defer to them. Conversely small people are easy to overlook and are usually neglected, which is also a problem. This is only natural. It's easy to feel intimidated when someone is towering over you, even if you know you aren't in physical harm. All the same, it's the sort of intimidation I'd rather do without. How does one stop fearing big and tall people?
