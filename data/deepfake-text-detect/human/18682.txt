I enjoy photography as a hobby. However, I have a friend who is a professional and when he shows me the new shots he's taken, I can't help but think that I could do the same thing, given the appropriate time and money. Let me address my two points in the title: 1. Being at the right place at the right time: My friend recently came back from a trip to Yellowstone and Had some really stunning pictures. However, in a place like Yellowstone, the pictures really take themselves. Take another example - National Geographic. If you're job was to go to a remote village most people have never seen and take a picture of people in culture quite different than the rest of the world, even a poorly taken photo will be captivating. Even more so when combined with the next point: 2. The right gear: Certainly, I understand that good gear doesn't make good pictures by itself. However, they do make them go from good to great in a lot of cases, all else being equal. There is a noticeable difference between a kit lens and a professional lens (otherwise people wouldn't she'll out several thousand dollars for them). All that being said, I do acknowledge that there is a certain amount of creative freedom in the taking of the picture (angles, rule of thirds, etc). However, I believe those are smaller factors in the greatness of a picture. The other two items I mentioned take no skill, per se, but affect the picture greatly. A great subject framed poorly will always trump a poor subject framed greatly. However, I want to believe photography is actual art form and not a matter of travel and money. Please change my view!
