I'd just like to make it clear now that when I refer to fat people, I do not mean those who have eating disorders due to any other reason than greediness. Basically, if someone has become fat through greediness alone, I can't help but think they are a greedy person. This view was inspired when I heard people talking about how they'd never date a fat person. At first, I was annoyed, as I'm definitely someone who thinks personality is more important in a relationship (although physical attraction is also important), but the more I thought about this, the more I wondered if they even had a good personality - as those who are greedy with food might also be greedy in other aspects of life. I know it's wrong of me to generalise, but still. Change my view?
