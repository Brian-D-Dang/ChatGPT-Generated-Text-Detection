Post title says it all really. I believe there should be absolute freedom to do what you want, when you want, how you want, where you want etc. I probably sound like your average anarchist here, but it goes deeper than that. It's something I can't get out of my head - if someone wants to do something, why shouldn't they be allowed? Answer that honestly. "Because there would be total chaos if this were the case" - so what? Why does that matter? Even if it meant every man was for himself, at least there'd be complete freedom. However this isn't the case and probably never will be, so help me accept the way it is and change my view please.
