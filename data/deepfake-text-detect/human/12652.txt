The words on the page disappear as soon as I read them. Nothing holds, not time, not space, not names or faces or colors or things, not for more than twenty minutes at a time. I go somewhere and twenty minutes later I forget where I am, or how I got there. I never leave home much because when I do, I get lost. I have no family, for they left me long ago. It's hard to understand someone like me, and so rather than help, most pull away. I do not blame them. Every once in a while I reach back and realize another is gone. I'm locked in a constant race against time. If I don't stay busy enough, maybe it's my daughter's wedding. A nap, maybe the sound of my mother's voice. I never know when I will lose them or when. Or which ones. I don't remember the order of them anymore. And so I keep a frenzied pace. I read. I watch videos. Sometimes the same ones over and over. I rarely sleep because sleep is to lose, and no matter how hard I try I will not lose her face.
