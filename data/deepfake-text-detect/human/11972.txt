Firefighters dealt with blazes on Friday overnight at garage forecourts in Salisbury and Durrington as well as in residential areas of Amesbury. An aircraft was also found burnt out at Old Sarum Airfield. Police estimate the damage caused at "over PS100,000." A man, 26, from Amesbury was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of arson. All of the "suspicious fires" took place between 01:38 GMT on Friday and 04:40 GMT on Saturday, Wiltshire Police said. Det Con Ian Day said: "All the vehicles were unoccupied at the time of the fires and no one was injured however the damage caused is significant and is likely to run over PS100,000. "We are treating the fires as suspicious and believe that the vehicles were deliberately set alight. "We have made an arrest but I would like to appeal for any witnesses to come forward as they may be able to assist our investigation."
