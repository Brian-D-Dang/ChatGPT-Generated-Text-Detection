This also included a myriad of different words as well such as; Couldn't care less (Maybe they actually meant that);For all intents and purposes (This phrase can stand on its own, as in, they could very well mean intents and purposes). They convey a message that people can understand well even if it's not proper. Conveying messages is what language is at its core. And languages fluidity is a core aspect of it as well (the roman languages are an example of this). As for the idioms, overtime an idiom changes and changes to eventually have a different meaning. I recall reading a letter from the late 1790s by Benjamin Franklin, where they use the phrase "all on a sudden" todays expression uses "of" instead of "on." I'm sorry that I cannot cite my source, this was some time ago. As a side note, using "literally" in a figurative sense is a form of writing, so to discard the use of it, simply because they aren't using it for its intended use, is a bit pretentious.
