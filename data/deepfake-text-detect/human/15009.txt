Yes their are some good deals. No they are not great. The employees are morons who know nothing more then their names and their purpose in life....... To act stupid. The deli meat is actually worse then wal marts. Everything is pre sliced and bad bad quality. It's like a giant food 4 less and that's no compliment. I did however give them 2 stars because the bulk section is pretty cool.
