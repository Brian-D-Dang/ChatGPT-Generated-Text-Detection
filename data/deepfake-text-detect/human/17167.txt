OK, so if any of you live in Britain you will probably have seen one of these front pages: [Mail front page] [Sun front page] Let me start off by saying that I am effectively a vegetarian. I am fine with eating free range meat, but can rarely afford it. I generally try to avoid any animal product that involves animal suffering, this includes factory farmed meat. I am also an atheist, and I do not believe that religious reasons are sufficient to justify an exception to the law. I would be fine with the criminalisation of throat slitting (without prestunning), as a form of slaughter, even if that makes halal slaughter more difficult and kosher slaughter impossible. However I do believe that the majority of the meat industrialised nations eat is reared in conditions that are horrible for the animals involved. The killing of these animals is the only humane part of their lives (I say with more than a hint of irony), at least for the 80 or so percent of animals that survive long enough to be slaughtered and don't die of disease or other horrible deaths. Factory farming for the uninitiated: [Wikipedia] [WSPA] [CIWF] [ASPCA] I believe that anybody who disapproves, boycotts or abstains from eating halal meat for animal welfare reasons, should also do so for the vast majority of animal products in the industrialised world, and even if you do these things, ending halal slaughtering is not the most pressing issue compared to the treatment of most livestock during their rearing. Whilst I am pleased with the show of interest in animal welfare, I feel that I cannot support something so hypocritical. Please change my view.
