This place has a cute selection and is pretty affordable compared to the other meager shopping options currently on Mill, but if I'm in the mood to shop Pitaya wouldn't be one of my first choices. Maybe it was because I visited during the middle of a weekday, but I got the vibe that the salesgirl wished I would leave, because she was talking to a friend when I came in and I guess that my presence made her feel the need to talk in whispers. And when she did help me, she seemed annoyed about it. I did end up buying a couple of things from there, only to find the SAME EXACT SKIRT for maybe 8 cheaper at LoveCulture in Scottsdale Mall. I kid you not. If I can get the same clothes for cheaper elsewhere, then I don't think I'll be going back.
