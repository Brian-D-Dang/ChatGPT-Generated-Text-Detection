Not trying to start a flame war, I'm looking for a new tablet and I would consider an ipad, but I just don't see the appeal just yet. What on earth does it do that justifies a price tage 2-3x that of an android or windows tablet that performs the same functions? Clearly people are buying them, so there's obviously something there I'm not seeing. I used my previous tablet (Nexus 7, rip) for TVMovies (kodi) streaming said movies to my tv (MicroUSB-HDMI out) ebooks pocketbook] ftw) chrome (teh web) dolphin browser (pornflash videos) reddit (relay) google voice search (because sometimes I can't be bothered to type shit out) podcastmusic streaming (8tracks,spotify,podcast addict) some games (not a ton) all the free apps vpn (pia) Given the above, can someone tell me what justifies paying an extra 360 for an ipad? (I could by 3 new nexus 7 tablets for the price of 1 ipad air 2 and have 60 left over), wtf is going on? figures compare this [n7] to this [ipad2] Hello, users of CMV!
