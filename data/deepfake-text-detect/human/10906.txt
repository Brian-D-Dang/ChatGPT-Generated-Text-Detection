Flavour science! Flavour chemicals generally come as chemicals called esters, and for any particular food (especially fruity or flowery flavours) there tends to be a small number of dominant esters and maybe some extra ones. Banana flavour is Isoamyl acetate (which is an ester), and while a real banana has lots of other flavours, just adding Isoamyl acetate is enough to make a candy taste like banana. That's also one of the ingredients in classic bubblegum flavour. So, first you figure out what esters are in what flavour you want to copy, then you make an industrial sized quantity of that ester, then you dump it in and make bubblegum. There are other ways of making natural and artificial flavours, such as literally processing a fruit into a concentrated syrup (say, natural lemon flavour)
