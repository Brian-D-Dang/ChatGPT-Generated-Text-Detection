My place of work has just declared an influenza outbreak which means that I will be placed on unpaid leave as per my union agreement (which I think is somewhat fair). I do need to get paid obviously, and I care about my patients so I find myself torn. I have been searching for scientific articles showing evidence that compliance with the influenza vaccine in health care workers has a direct correlation with less outbreaks and a decrease in flu related mortality for patients. I really don't think this evidence exists and so I find myself strongly opposed ethically to receiving the vaccine. I'm willing to change my mind if someone can give me a damn good reason backed up with some seriously solid evidence. As a disclaimer - I am NOT anti vaccine. I have my childhood shots and would have my children vaccinated as well. I see the benefit in vaccinations that have successfully eradicated diseases. I also do everything in my power to protect my patient population and do not come to work if I am ill. I just am willing to change my view that either having or not having a flu shot will have any impact on my patients whatsoever. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
