The pages from a 13th Century text of the holy book of Islam were purchased by the council in 1951. Conservator Richard Hawkes said: "This is the earliest example of paper that I have worked on." Leeds City Council said the paper's age and origin were confirmed by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2014. The pages mainly show surahs (or chapters) 29 and 30, said the council. Councillor Brian Selby said: "The painstaking work of the museum team has ensured the pages can be displayed in a way which fully captures their significance as well as how ornate and beautiful they are." Leeds City Museum's display starts on Saturday and is to run for a year.
