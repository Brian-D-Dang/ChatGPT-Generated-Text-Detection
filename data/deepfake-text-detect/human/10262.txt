So, it's obvious to anyone who took a math class that the average number of sex partners between straight men and straight women must be the same. However, the median can be different. According to the CDC, the median number of opposite-sex partners in a lifetime is 6.6 for men, and 4.3 for women. Basic mathematics concludes this: Take two sets of numbers (set M and set F). M and F have the same mean, but F has a smaller median than M. Therefore, the numbers in M are more balanced across the board than the numbers in F. What I mean by this is that, according to the data, promiscuous women are more promiscuous than promiscuous men, and celibate women are more celibate than celibate men. Math never lies, but feel free to change my view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
