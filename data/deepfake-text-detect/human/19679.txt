Let's look at an example quick, say Person A murdered Person B. Why did Person A murder Person B? Because Person A decided to. Why did Person A decide to do that? Because Person A's brain analysed the situation and came to that decision. Why did the brain come to that decision? Because of it's structure (Caused by Person A's genes), as well as past experiences. We see at this stage that Person A is no longer responsible because their genetic makeup and past experiences resulted in the action. You can do this for any action even good ones. I would really love to not believe this so change my view people.
