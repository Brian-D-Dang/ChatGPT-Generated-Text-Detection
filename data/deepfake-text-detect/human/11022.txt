It is called evaporative cooling, and it is the same reason that your body sweats to keep cool. Think about solids, liquids, and gases. You have to add heat to a solid to turn it into a liquid or gas, and you have to add heat to a liquid to turn it into a gas. In this direction, we call these processes endothermic. Evaporation is the act of turning a liquid into a gas, and it is endothermic. The heat used to turn the tiny bits of liquid on your body into water vapor has to come from somewhere, and it comes from your body. This cools your body down, and you are very good at detecting when you are cooling down.
