Who is this imposter? I thought to myself as I looked at the man of whom people referred to as the real me. The people - scientists of various fields - explained to me that I was the first successful human clone. A perfect replica of another human being. And being a perfect replica meant that I had inherited everything from the person of whom I was a clone - that being not just the physical features, but also memories. I was sitting in a bed as this was all being explained to me, although, I was not convinced by the explanation. The bed was in a room that looked very hospital-like. There was a window and a door, and behind the window stood the scientists. They were talking to me through a speaker located above the window. I did not remember how I got there. The last thing in my memory was me getting blood taken from my arm. I also remembered why I was there to take blood from my arm: I was getting my DNA extracted to be part of a cloning experiment. The scientists explained to me that this was the last thing I remembered because this was the last memory ingrained in the DNA that was extracted. After sitting in the room for about two hours, while everything was being explained to me, I started to realize that it was all true. They had a perfect answer to every question, and I even got to speak to myself, (A perfect replica of myself, or vice versa if we are being picky.) and he had an alibi of the time between the DNA extraction and now. He proved that he was the real deal. It all felt very surreal since, in my mind, it was I who went in to get a clone made of myself, only to wake up and find out I was the clone.
