In this paper we consider a number of natural decision problems involving k -regular sequences. Specifically, they arise from item 1st item lower and upper bounds on growth rate; in particular boundedness, item 2nd item images, item 3rd item regularity (recognizability by a deterministic finite automaton) of preimages, and item 4th item factors, such as squares and palindromes of such sequences. We show that the decision problems are undecidable.
