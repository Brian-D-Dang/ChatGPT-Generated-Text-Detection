If this is a duplicate post, I apologize, an AutoMod told my my old version was too short and that it was removed. Here's my logic, though: If I get drunk and blow off all my money, it's my problem. If I get drunk and crash my car, it's my problem. If I get drunk and get into a fight, it's my problem. If I get drunk and have sex, it's my problem. Of course, though, if you slip something into my drink and have sex with me, that's not my fault, and if you give me a drink and say it's Mountain Dew when it is actually something that knocks me out, it's your fault. So if it wasn't concious and consentual, then it's still rape. And if you were given it under a false idea of what you were ingesting, it's arguably still rape. (But if you say, oh sir I didn't know that alcohol makes you make bad decisions it's not rape) worknman brought up something I didn't think to address, but I meant if someone says "yes" and has something in their body that they put in themselves that they knew makes them make bad decision, it's not rape. A drunk person can give consent if they consentually got drunk. So also, if someone attempts to have sex with them and they say "no" and are too drunk to fight back, it's still rape, because they didn't give consent. I'm probably gonna get lynched for asking this, but it's basic courtesy. Please don't downvote everything I say just because you disagree, please. It's very obviously going to happen, but please, just don't. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
