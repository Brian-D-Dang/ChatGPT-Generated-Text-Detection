[ 1403JUNE122023 ] - [ Hephaestus-3 ] [ System Purge: complete ] [ All maintenance cycles complete..... ] [ Login code: ] [ Begin Transmission: HI CORRINE. 3 MORE DAYS AND WE BEGIN SENDING BACK TETHERS TO PULL HEPHAESTUS-3 INTO EARTH ORBIT. MY SUIT STINKS, THE POD IS CROWDED AND WE HAD TO ABANDON TWO CASES OF FREEZE-DRIED DESSERT FOOD ON OUR APPROACH TO REDUCE MASS-I STILL WOULD N'T GIVE THIS UP FOR ANYTHING. 40 HOURS AGO THE SUN ROSE OVER THE EDGE OF MARS. NEXT TRIP THEY NEED TO GIVE US THICKER RAD SHIELDING, I SAW NEUTRINO FLASHES WITH MY EYES CLOSED FOR HOURS TODAY, SLEEPING UP HERE IS SOMETHING I CA N'T GET USED TO. NEXT TIME WE TALK IT WILL BE IN PERSON, TRANSMISSIONS FROM HERE OUT WILL BE BLOCKED BY THIS IRON ROCK WE'VE BEEN SPINNING AROUND ON FOR WEEKS, IF ANOTHER TETHER BREAKS EXPECT A DELAY OF 4-5 DAYS. WISH US LUCK, SEE YOU SOON. End Transmission ]
