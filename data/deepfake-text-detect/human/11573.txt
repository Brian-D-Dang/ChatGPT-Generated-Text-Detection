WebGLStudio.js is a browser-based 3D graphics suite that can edit scenes and materials, design effects and shaders, and code behaviors. Everything is done in-browser, and completed works can be shared. It features a full 3D graphics engine, an easy to use editor, a graph editor, and more. It is currently missing mesh editing, support for FBX, and physics. A link to a website that has demos, videos, examples, and a working version is available.
