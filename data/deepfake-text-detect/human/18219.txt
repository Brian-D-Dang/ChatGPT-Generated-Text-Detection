Using mindcontrol to make someone to accept foreign currency they don't want to accept is evil, right? I'm skimming through a fanedit of the Phantom Menace to see if it fixes everything I don't like about the original and the bit where Qui-Gon tries to mindbend Watto seems blatantly unmoral. The jedi is basically trying to rob the guy. Is there some way he's not being a huge jerk here? What would change my view: - an argument that Watto wouldn't have been getting ripped off if Qui-Gon had been successful - argument that Qui-Gon had no choice but to rip Watto off - hard to do since he ends up getting the part through other means, also he didn't even check if he had any other options than mindcontrol to get what he wanted before attempting it. His default plan was to just mindcontrol the person to get what he wanted at the other guy's expense. - argument that Watto is worthy of getting ripped off - best bet, I mean he owns slaves I guess? But Qui-Gon doesn't seem like he cares about that at all - in fact, what the hell, why aren't the jedi against slavery? Why I want my view changed: I want to like the movie, so it'd be better not to think of a main character as a moral-less scammer who doesn't care about child-slaves. Also if he's a horrible person what does that say about the jedi in general?
