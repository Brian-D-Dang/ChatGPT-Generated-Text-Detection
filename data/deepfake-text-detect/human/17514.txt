I feel that drones used in warfare should be made illegal because of the number of innocent civilians that they kill. Earlier this year an American citizen was killed in tribal Pakistan along with an Italian aid worker during a drone attack on an Al Qaeda compound. This was major news in the U.S. but whenever there is a drone attack in the Middle East there is quite a large possibility that the drone will lead to the death or injury of non-combatants in the area. I don't see why these innocents are being punished for the actions for a few religious extremists in the area in such a careless manner. If the U.S. wants to at all validate their invasion of Iraq etc. they can at least make sure they only kill people for pose an actual threat to national security. Also if drones continue to kill innocent civilians wantonly isn't this going to radicalize more people in the area into going terrorist groups. I feel its important to note that I am not against the occupationinvasion of Iraq and the Middle East; I believe terrorist groups should be resisted and the people who join them do run the risk of being killed because of their choices. However I am only trying to make the point that if the U.S. and other nations are going to kill these terrorists they should be obligated not to kill innocents in the process. Hello, users of CMV!
