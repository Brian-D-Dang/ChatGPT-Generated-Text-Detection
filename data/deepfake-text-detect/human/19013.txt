People who smoke have a weak personality because there isn't a goal, a benefit in smoking. Moreover, it is very harmful for your body. Therefore, they just smoke because others do so. And if you do something just because others do so, you have a weak personality. You can argue that then everything you do is having a weak personality because other do so, for instance, eating. But eating has a purpose, to feed myself. Although I am just eating because others do so, you can't know if it is for that or for feed myself. But in smoking, there is no error, there isn't another reason to smoke. People also say they relax when smoking, but they relax from the ansiety caused by smoking. So in the first place, they would be already relaxed if they didn't smoke. I'm only talking about cigarettes. Every other drug has a purpose but smoke has no purpose. I'm not defending taking drugs, I'm just saying it is understable and as I've said before, if it has a purpose, you can't know the real reason. Hello, users of CMV!
