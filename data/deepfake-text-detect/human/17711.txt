So here is my big idea. You ensure everyone on the planet, say over the age of 18 receives either the global minimum wage if they are working. This would stop things like people loosing their jobs because people in other counties are prepared to work for considerably less. It would mean that everyone's time became more valuable. Or you could go even further, instead of a minimum wage you could guarantee people an income by granting an annual citizens income, paid monthly or earned as a reverse income tax. Anything you earn other this benefit is used to pay for it for those who earn less. You could set a really high tax bracket right at the very, very top. This would help transfer wealth rapidly from the very richest people alive today, this would seem to be a requirement if we are to meet the goal of beating global poverty. I imagine it would help with climate change and terrorism and the like. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
