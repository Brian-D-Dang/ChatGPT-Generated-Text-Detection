It makes you forget things, such as important points if say, you're doing a chemistry report. It furthermore makes you sloppy with calculations grammar. Last but not least, I believe that Marijuana will make you unable to focus, therefore not doing the work assignments that you should be doing. I am open-minded and willing to hear why it might not be. EDIT: I mean as in "smoke marijuana, and still be able to do proper work." I live in Denmark.
