I live in a pretty liberal area. Ever since I could remember people have been shitting on Fox News. I had grown up with it so I couldn't see the problem. What was wrong? Most claim it to be full of lies, but a little research proves the opposite. I've watched the other networks too, CNN, NBC. Most of them don't even cover the same stuff, which i think is deceptive. They also serve to create stories that probably shouldn't be. Sure Fox isn't perfect, and I definitely don't agree with everyone on it; but it is still the best news network in my opinion. So why does the internet hate it so much? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
