The more I read, and watch, and play the Assassin's Creed series, the more I am convinced that it is a product dated by the trends at its inception. Some group of execs at Ubisoft were sitting around a table in the early 2000s and saw that parkour and Dan Brown books were huge and thought, "Let's make a game about those things!" It felt topical when Assassin's Creed 1 came out in 2007 on the heels of the 2006 Da Vinci Code movie... but now it just feels totally played out and dated. Don't get me wrong, running across the rooftops and assassinating people in historical cities is amazing, but all the Da Vinci Code crap about ancient magical artifacts and the Templars fighting the Assassins throughout history is such a drag. And the present day tie-in feels painfully unnecessary. Assassin's Creed IV would be a much better game if it just let you be a pirate without all of the superfluous nonsense about magical devices that the secret Templar organization has been searching for throughout history. Honestly, all the extra crap about Templars is totally ruining the series for me even though I really want to like it. Help me enjoy the games by changing my view.
