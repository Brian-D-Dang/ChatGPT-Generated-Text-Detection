Got my windows tinted here right before summer. Whew! My bartender recommended the place! I was informed of all of my different options, prices, effectiveness and even what might look best on my car while still preserving the integrity of it's appearance! The service was great and it was ready even ahead of schedule. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Their lifetime guarantee is great. I would definitely recommend this place for tinting and alarm systems!
