I have actually discussed which phrases used in erotica are the most uncomfortable with friends. I'll give a shot. "Oh yehhhhh," Helga moaned as Igor pistoned his thick meat into her beef curtains. "Yeah, yeah, take it woman" Igor hissed as he continued to jackhammer her poontang with his thickness. "Put it in my poop pucker" Helga ravenously requested - Igor was all too excited to oblige. As Igor's strawberry-pink tip pushed against Helga's brown mound she let out a soft whimper. After a few minutes of Igor's one-eyed snake flicking in and out of her butt, Helga thought of another request, this one would even be considered romantic. "Gag me with my butt-juice, Igor" she demanded. "Make me your dick slave." Igor began to pump Helga's mouth with a ferocity previously known only to 6-cylinder engines and honey badgers in heat. "Helga I'm (enters Phantom of the Opera scene) paaaaaast the point of noooo RETURN..... The final THRESHOLD, What warm unspoken secrets will we learn? Beyond the point of noooooo return. " "FILL MY THROAT WITH YOUR BABY GRAVY" Helga calmy replied. Igor busted a nut into Helga's mouth, and she gulped it down like the naughty gurl she be, and it was finished. I'm probably on a list now.
