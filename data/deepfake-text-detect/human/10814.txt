Ping is just used to measure the round-trip time between your computer and a target - for instance, how long it takes from sending a message to URL0 until receiving the response. Packet loss is when a packet (for instance an echo request, as sent by ping) gets lost somewhere along the way. So, how does it affect your connection? Higher latency just leads to sluggish and generally slow connection. Websites take long (er) to load, but eventually, everything should get done. Like writing an actual letter instead of an email. If you experience packet loss, some of the data actually gets lost. If it's a connectionless protocol like UDP, this might lead to corrupted or missing data (someone's voice breaking up on a Skype call, etc.) - imagine handing your letter to some friend of a friend of the recipient. It might get there.... or not. When using a reliable protocol like TCP, all the data will eventually get there, but might have to be resent multiple times until it actually goes through - which will again result in slower performance. To stick with the analogy, this would be a registered letter, with a confirmation message upon successful delivery.,You need to physically sign some documents and send them across the country. You put the documents in an envelope and send it. The ping is the time it takes for the documents to arrive at their destination. Say there is a storm and it causes the mail to get delayed. This results in a longer shipping time for that document which creates latency or lag. If the mail gets lost somewhere along the way, this is loss. To be safe, you can send multiple copies of your signed document but this takes more time and money.
