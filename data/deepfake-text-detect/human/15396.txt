Perfect place. Designed to a T. Edgy and classy. Service is excellent. Drinks are tasty. Food is creative and delish. Coffee is the best- but beware is espresso. Patio seating outside gives you a view of the strip and a birds eye view of the used to be Piratte show. The short ribs, Trout, and sashimi taster are great dishes. Thiswas one of my more memorable nights ever and thanks to Social House for the start of this evening.
