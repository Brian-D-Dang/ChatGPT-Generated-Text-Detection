" Darn it dad, why did we have to invite our entire family? " nbsp; " You know why, and don't act like you don't know! The family cares about you, Joey and Roger. Can we please not argue about this? Your mother is already in hysterics and it's not even midday. " nbsp; " Alright, sorry..... I hate that we were born triplets..... " nbsp; " How do you think we feel? Your birthday is the single most stressful day of the entire year! " nbsp; " Yeah I know. I'm just bitter because the whole family is going to come and pity us for something that might or might not happen. I hate the feeling of everyone's eyes on me. I know Roger and Joey hate it too. " nbsp; " Please just put on a smile and let them talk at you. It's tradition. Tomorrow we'll do whatever you three want, but today is for them. " nbsp; " Dad, why do people only die on their birthdays? It doesn't make any sense. " nbsp; " I don't know son, I don't know. I'm sure you were taught about the End Theories in school. That's what your mom and I were taught about as kids too. " nbsp; " Nobody knows for sure? Really? I'm just going to die one of these birthdays and no one will know why? The Earth goes around the sun every two hundred and fifty six days and then we might just die. It feels so pointless. " nbsp; " We didn't create the world. We just live in it and do the best we can. " nbsp; " I feel like we talked about this last year too..... sorry. " nbsp; " Tell you what. If you promise to survive your birthday then I'll promise to buy you all the End Theory books you want. Constructionism. Digitalism. Oh man, I laughed so hard reading about the memory management theories in those. " nbsp; " I'm scared dad..... what if I don't make it? What if Joey or Roger don't make it? " nbsp; " We'll mourn. It's all we can do. Now come on, let's get you into your suit. Midday is in an hour. You just have to deal with the family for another seventeen hours and then they'll leave at midnight like they always do. It's tradition. "
