When you clap, you send out sound waves. When two sound waves meet each other, they'interfere'. Imagine waves on water when you drop a stone into it. Peaks and troughs are formed. When a peak meets a peak, the amplitude (volume) of the wave doubles, and when a peak meets a trough, they cancel out, and the amplitude is 0. [Here is a useful picture] (URL0). Clapping causes this to happen many times, and it is this interference that means the overall sound is louder.," "Instead of clapping, imagine everyone's pushing on a stuck car. The more people that push, the more force on the car. Clapping is the same, except you're pushing on the air.
