Scientists have found a way to control the blood-brain barrier at a molecular level and open it up for a couple of hours at a time. The absence of a molecule called Unc5B left the blood-brain barrier open in tests on adult mice. Researchers then developed an antibody to block the receptor that the molecule was binding to. This allowed the team to open up the blood-brain barrier for some time to promote drug delivery. The research could lead to better treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors.
