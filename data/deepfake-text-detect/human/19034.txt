I'm sure we can all agree that the United States has done some horrible things. Treatment of the Natives, treatment of the Filipino people, Vietnam, injustices towards Democratic governments like Iran, etc. But in comparison to what the alternatives were, I think the United States is the best choice. The Soviet Union and China's brand of Communism killed millions upon millions of their own people and set their economies back decades. In the grand scheme of things, the West's fight against Communism was not a bad thing. Without America's intervention, much more of Europe would had become vassal states to the Soviet Union. South Korea would be in the hands of a crazy dictator. The US gave the Philippines its independence in the 1930's - would Spanish Fascists have done the same? Japan and Germany were rebuilt into completely independent countries. In contrast, the USSR just completely trashed East Germany. China is gearing up right now for a resource war against Japan, and purposefully fuels anti-Japanese sentiment. Nowadays, the EU seems to be a great contender for world super-power. But they seem a bit too fractured to be able to do much in a timely fashion. I don't particularly trust China to think about global interests over their own national interests. Their form of government is also more or less an oligarchy. They are hyper-nationalistic, much more so than America. Thus, the US remains the best counter to tyranny in the world. Europe, China, Russia, are either too corrupt, too amoral, or too weak.
