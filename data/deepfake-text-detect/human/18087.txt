Especially in today's society, getting help is easy; there are hotlines to call, or clinics to visit. When someone commits suicide, it creates massive amounts of guilt for people close to that person, and overall, nobody feels any better than before the incident. A child could find the body of a suicide victim, scaring himher for life. Not only that, but people glamorize people who ended their own life after the fact and portray them as a "victims," even though they chose their own fate. Therefore, I believe that suicide is a selfish action, and no suicide victim should be given sympathy. CMV
