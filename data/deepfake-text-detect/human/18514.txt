So the tl:dr of Minority Report is that they have these three "pre-cogs" that can predict future crime. They then go out and stop these crimes and punish the offenders as if they had done the crime. With this, they manage to completely eliminate murders, city-wide (I think its Washington D.C.). But one guy who knows how the system works frames the main character because he's figuring out that someone had gotten away with a murder. Anyways, he's punished for a crime he would not have committed. So the whole thing comes to light and the government shuts down pre-crime. Completely. This is retarded. One innocent guy going to jail is bad, and one guy getting away with a murder is bad, but that is still light years ahead of what we have today. Completely preventing murder is something our system will never get to, and removal of the whole system because of one isolated case hurt society. Hello, users of CMV!
