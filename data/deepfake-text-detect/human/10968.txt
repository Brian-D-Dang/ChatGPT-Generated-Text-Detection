Sometimes a computer doesn't get enough information to know what to do, so it has to guess just a little. If it guesses wrong, your music might not sound right, or your game might not work just like it should. This is called "aliasing" and isn't much fun. Some smart scientists learned how to make this not happen as much, so that their computers would work better. They found that if you give your computer more information, usually about twice as much as it really needs, it doesn't have to guess as much. When it's not guessing, the computer can't guess wrong, so your games work better. The problem is that when your computer has more information, it has to work harder to look at all of it and figure out what it's supposed to do. So, basically, what they call "anti-aliasing" makes your computer play games and music better, but it has to work a little harder to do it. (Edit: Spacing)
