Psychedelic drugs are very helpful substances for psychotherapy. They have been used successfully for over 20 years and can be used for a variety of conditions. For example: cluster headaches, alcoholism, or as a tool for psychotherapy. So we have this medicine, and we are not allowed to use it. The reason we are not allowed to use it has nothing to do with its dangers to the patient, but with its perceived dangers to society (see Timothy Leary and the counter-culture). Psychedelics are, when used correctly, relatively safe to the patient. The medics, psychologists and psychiatrists have the task to improve the health of human beings. They have the obligation to look for ways to do so. By ignoring psychedelics, they fail to do just that. Ideally, all researchers in this field should join an organization like [MAPS] . The only reason they don't do this is because they are afraid of losing their reputation, or because they ignore the facts and refuse to look in that direction. We're letting people suffer because of ignorance and cowardliness. Please change my view! EDIT: by "widely used," I mean that any trained professional who thinks LSD might be of value to the patient should have the possibility to give it to them. It shouldn't be mendatory, of course.
