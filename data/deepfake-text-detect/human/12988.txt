"Greetings! I am general Telesus of the O'Burn clan. For the last few years, we have greatly..." "Cut to the chase. What do I have to do? What are the rewards." I am used to this by now. "Five fox ears. Three silver." "BRB." He wanders over to General Kalesus standing next to me. They never have time to listen to my story. Three more adventurers wander in my direction. "Gree.." "Skip!" "In a hurry!" "Gogogo." "Five fox ears. Three silver." More are lining up, gathering all the quests up in a nice bunch so that they can look at their nice little speed leveling guide and get the rewards and run to the next town. I wonder if anyone will care if I am replaced by a goblin tomorrow. "Here." Someone holds out a bloody pouch at me. I hand him three silver coins. "Tha..." He throws the pouch at me and runs off to the next General. The pouch lands on my feet. Now there is blood on my shoes. I will be standing in a swamp of blood and fox ears by the end of the day. I hate weekends! "Gree..." "Skip!" "Five..." "Ok" This was boring and humiliating. How come I am a General and I am asking random people to hunt one-eared foxes? "Gree..." She just snaps her fingers in my face. Of course she is in a hurry. "Three silvers..." My bored brain comes up with an idea that will probably earn me a letter from HR. "Dance." I was overflowing in fox ears anyways. She dances. Well, she was a dwarf, so the animation is not as entertaining as one would expect. For me, it was just sweet revenge. I hand her three silver. She runs off with the exclamation "Easiest money ever!" To the next person I say "One silver. One mug of mead from the tavern. Cold!" He stares. "Mead is eighty copper in the tavern." I stare right back. "I know." "Twenty copper is not worth it." He grumbles but he does as told. After a few minutes I have a mug of mead in my hand as more adventurers crowd in. These losers need every piece of coin they can get. They will do anything I say! Alright, this is going to be fun after all!
