They have an extremely helpful staff and I was able to try on multiple shoes without feeling pressured to by anything. I wanted to try on some different types of running shoes so I could get a feel for them. They were extremely accomodating. I've been to another running store that breathed down my neck wanting me to buy. Not here. Great selection of shoes and gear, albeit a little expensive for my tasted. They do weekly or bi-weekly runs as well.
