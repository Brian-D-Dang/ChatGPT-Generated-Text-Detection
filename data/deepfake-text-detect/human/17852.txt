I believe that attaching minimum to inflation would not solve the problem of people living off of a "non-livable wage." There are people that believe this will cause companies to stop hiking up their prices when it comes to wages. This is just not the case. They will just hire less people and just go and increase the amount that they outsource their jobs. Things will become even more mechanically and automated just to avoid hiring people which will increase the amount of unemployed people. Just imagine a whole mall with one 3 self checkout machines in each store and someone working just walking around to fold clothes and answer questions.
