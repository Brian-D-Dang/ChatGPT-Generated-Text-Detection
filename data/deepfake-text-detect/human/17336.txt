So I was having an argument with a friend, he was saying that he was craving specifically buttermilk pancakes, but in my years of researching about pancake recipes, almost all I've seen have buttermilk in them (or they tell you to add milkvinegarlemon but it's not the same) my point is, I believe that the original pancake included buttermilk as the key ingredient, and that most pancakes sold in restaurants are "buttermilk pancakes" even if it's not stated in the name.
