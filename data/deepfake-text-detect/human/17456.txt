First, respect is a tricky word to define, but in this context I mean you should be 'courteous' as opposed to 'admiring' respect. Many atheists claim that religion doesn't deserve any respect, they then assume that means anyone associated with any religion shouldn't be respected. Assuming that all religious people are bad, which they're not, being disrespectful to them doesn't do anything other than make you look like a dick. For example, there are a ton of WBC interviews, I think the best one is the Russel Brand interview, because he isn't just yelling at them, he's actually having a conversation with them, despite their beliefs.
