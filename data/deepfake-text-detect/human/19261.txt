-The people's use of Reddit as a tool for governmental interaction is potentially translatable for use to all elected offices; however, for the example we will use the US House of Representatives: -Within a congressional district, citizens desiring more community discussion and involvement from their representative can find a solution in Reddit. By creating a subreddit moderated for discourse around the concerns of a district, an online 'town hall meeting' may be generated over which citizens can hold their representative responsible. Within their congressional district subreddit, citizens can compel their representative to submit to regular AMAs. This system would establish a more open, accessible, and continuous dialogue and if realized would create greater influence over the People's representation in government. -Reddit works as the best forum for community discussion because it is a democratic and egalitarian system where an individual's race, creed, and socioeconomic status play no role. All that matters for whether a post rises or falls in public awareness is the substance and merit of the thought. Moreover, Reddit is anonymous therefore shielding the individual from any social repercussions. -Times have changed. In the past citizens of a community would congregate in public areas to discuss the issues of the day. Now people congregate on the Internet for discourse, however without representation. This can change.
