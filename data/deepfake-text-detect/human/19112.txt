For as long as I can remember, the TV commercials for Trix cereal have followed the same pattern: a well-meaning white rabbit wants nothing more than to enjoy the supposed deliciousness of Trix cereal, but his attempts are repeatedly shut down by antagonistic children who, without fail, close with the catch phrase "silly rabbit, Trix are for kids!" I believe that these commercials (specifically because of the fact that the rabbit is consistently forbidden from enjoying Trix cereal) lead to the following ill effects: They encourage (to a target audience of children, no less) exclusivity and discrimination towards those who fall outside of one's own demographic kids,' in this case). They frustrate viewers who are empathetic with the Rabbit and want to see him find happiness. They are arguably counterproductive; I refuse to buy Trix cereal until the rabbit begins receiving fair treatment in Trix commercials, and I would imagine I am not the only one. Change my view. edit: to all the 'Trix are for kids' comments; that is what I am saying should change. They don't give any good reason for it.
