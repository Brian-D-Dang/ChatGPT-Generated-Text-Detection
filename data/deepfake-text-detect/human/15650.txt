After parking near the stadium, we needed a quick place to booze-up and pregame for the game ahead. We may be out of college, but our tailgating days ain't over. This place was hidden, but my drunk friend found this place like a bloodhound finds a dead duck (ok bad analogy, give me a break). We were happy to find the billiards room and huddle over one of the side tables. I got a bloody mary for 6 (it was 3 before noon) and our group got some cheesy fries to share. For a potentially-3 bloody mary, my drink was great: spicy, peppery but not too thick or fake tasting. Our cheesy fries were beyond amazing: giant steak fries, tons of cheese, BACON, jalapeno, tomatoes and a ranch dressing. The plate was heaping with the ingrdients and the potatoes stayed boiling hot for a while (making us have to take our time, which lets face it, is pretty damn impossible). Between the 4 of us, we didn't even finish our plate and it left me pretty full (at least for a couple hours). Our server was pretty fast and was kind enough to split the shared appetizer among the 4 of us. Sweet.
