The number one thing that ticks me off about America is that someone who puts no thought into their beliefs and their consequences but identifies as a christian is accepted almost universally, while people who take time to evaluate their thoughts and place in the world and come to some sort of atheist or agnostic position are generally ostracized. Now, this is not to say that all religious people are sheep or anything like that. I know many intelligent religious people who have spent much more time in self evaluation than I. Rather, what I am trying to say that the cultural expectation that a person should identify with one religious denomination or another is detrimental to society. No open atheist held a position in the US Congress until 1993. It is a fact that identifying yourself as an atheist or agnostic or whatever excludes you from certain opportunities, based solely on other people's perception of your beliefs, rather than your actual shortcomings as a human being. Everybody should take time to examine their own preconceived notions of what it means to believe or not believe in god, and make a real effort to judge others on the content of their character and actions, instead of where they spend their Sunday mornings. Obviously, today things are better for non-traditional denominations, but much more progress can be made. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
