I don't know about how it was in the olden times, but I think people should at least wait until they are 15 to have sex. I think kids who are younger are too immature emotionally to deal with the nature of sex, and they probably have a lack of self control to make a proper decision. I think people at that age are only driven by a misguided sense of curiosity (without thinking about the consequences) or the pressure in society to lose one's virginity. I don't think there is anyone out there who thinks "I really am glad I had sex when I was 13 or 14." Please note that I don't think 15 is a magical age where people are ready to have sex, I'm just giving a liberal estimate.
