Low scoring? That's the beauty of the game and that's why soccer is so captivating. Games are often decided by one goal. One play, one flick of genius, one defensive error can turn the entire game around. Also, goals aren't the only thing to watch for in soccer, which takes us to... Lack of progress? "They're just running around and passing the ball!," you say, as if you actually understood soccer tactics and the intricacies of build-up play. Soccer is a sophisticated, thinking-man's game, where speed, technique, timing but above all creativity are of utmost importance. Ties? Sometimes two teams are just so equal in quality that forcing them to play until one team scores (or wins in another fashion) would be unfair. Why not let the two teams have 1 point each? Ads on jerseys? Way better than the corporate bullshit baseball, basketball and the NFL are filled with. Commercial breaks every couple of minutes? Yeah! Corporate logos on jerseys? Naah! Diving? Not nearly as prevalent as soccer-haters picture it, and punished in many leagues. No instant replay used by refs to verify their decisions? If you find a way to flawlessly and painlessly implement it in a game where the clock doesn't stop (and no, we cannot make it stop), that will become a valid point. Clock counting up instead of down? This is ridiculous. How is 72:41 different than 17:19? (assuming stoppage time is going to be added anyway) Offside? One of the most sophisticated rules in all of sports and an ingenious one. Without it, offensive play would consist of kicking the ball upfield and hoping your teammate can get to it before the defender does. Implementing offside zones (like in hockey) wouldn't really improve anything and it would only make play unnatural.
