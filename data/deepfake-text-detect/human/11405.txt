StyleGAN2 is a style-based GAN architecture for data-driven unconditional generative image modeling. It improves on image quality, and it also makes it possible to reliably detect if an image is generated by a particular network. StyleGAN2 redefines the sate of the art in unconditional image modeling. Videos of StyleGAN2 in action and images of its output are available.
