Fox News has been getting a lot of flak for its right-leaning hires Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, among others. Over the past few years, however, they have been steadily hiring left-leaning journos, including Juan Williams, Kirsten Powers, Bob Beckel, Geraldo Rivera, and most recently James Carville. Alec Baldwin just ranted to a New York magazine story that he was done with public life, after being angry with TMZ's take of his anger-management issues off camera, and MSNBC's cancelling his show after three weeks. [source: ] Although he had some harsh words to say about Fox News (among other outlets), I can't help but wonder if Roger Ailes would think it in his best interest to reinstate Baldwin's show. It would go a long way to reverse the taint of bias on the network, and Baldwin could very well be willing to attempt to persuade Fox News devotees as to why his take on politics is more correct. Furthermore, after reading the article, and watching his interactions with Robert Osbourne on TCM, I can't help but think that his show needed a second chance, now that it has been clarified as to what he wanted to accomplish. Irregardless of one's political opinion, I cannot help but think this as a winwin for both sides, and perhaps for American discourse. CMV.
