We've all heard of them. Stories that antagonize cops for the most absurd incidents (from Rodney King to shooting a defenseless dog in Hawthorne, CA to death). But in the end, we always pin it on the cops not knowing what they've experienced or what their psychological conditions are. I am not a police officer so therefore I cannot imagine what it feels like to live in constant threat. That daily threat causes a fear for your life. Now, add a gun or some pepper spray and voila...you have a tragedy, and often enough, a lawsuit on your hands. CMV, Reddit.
