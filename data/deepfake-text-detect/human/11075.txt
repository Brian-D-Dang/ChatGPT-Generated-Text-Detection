They're equivalent assuming the randomness is done correctly. It's like reaching into a lottery ball or bingo tumbler and pulling balls with no replacement. It doesn't matter if you grab 1 or 10 or 100 at a time as long as the tumbling is actually producing randomness. Disclaimer: I have no idea if bingo tumblers are actually suitably random. If they aren't, imagine some kind of robustly random system instead.
