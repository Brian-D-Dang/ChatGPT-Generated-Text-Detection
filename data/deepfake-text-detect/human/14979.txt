I'm a Yank I've been here twice in 9 months and I've frequented enough pubs in my life to know what's genuine. The last drop is fantastic great service and terrific food. The haggis is the best has a nice kick to it. For you non-Americans, that means it's spicy, not spicy like that ketchup and onions you try to pass off as salsa over there, but real spice that will make your tongue crawl back to your stomach. I love this place and the interior feels like what a pub should be. Never mind the hen and stag parties, enjoy a last drop at the last drop.
