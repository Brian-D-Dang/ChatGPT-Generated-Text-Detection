It means this agency lost confidence in US ability to pay all of its debt obligations and debt interest to bond holders indefinitely. AAA is supposed to mean "safe" so not having AAA means some large investment funds and other nations may choose to hold less US cash and bonds in their portfolio in favor of gold or whatever feels safer. This makes the dollar valued less which makes prices in the US go up. The way to regain AAA is drastically cut spending, sell assets to pay down the deficit, raise taxes, and wait for the economy to recover.','The credit rating is a lot like a credit score. They are both measures of how likely someone is to pay money back to people that give loans to them. It is based on how their ability to pay the money that they owe (do they earn enough to pay their current debt) and how likely they are to choose to do so (are they a scumbag or not). The US had an AAA rating which meant that we had the best possible rating (perfect or near perfect). Meaning that loaning money to us was so safe, some investors were willing to loose money by lending it to us so that we would keep it safe. This is no longer the case. But, S P is one of only 3 credit agencies (the other two still give us perfect ratinggs), and they only downgraded us to AA, which is still pretty darn good. For example only 4 companies have AAA ratings, so our credit rating is still as good or better than most major corporations. As investors loose confidence in the US debt, it will cost more for the US to borrow money (i.e. people are less likely to pay us to keep their money). That said, it has probably already been factored into the markets because the people that trade these bonds every day make their own predictions independant of the rating agencies.
