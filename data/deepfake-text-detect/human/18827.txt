Admittedly I don't know the details of the case very well (which is why I used the word "may, but it seems to me that if Zimmerman's story is true, then he should not be on the hook for murder. Zimmerman's story, as I understand it, is as follows: He saw Martin, felt suspicious, and called the cops. The cops told him not to follow him. He got out of his car and followed him anyway. Martin got angry about this and confronted Zimmerman, eventually punching him. In the ensuing struggle, Zimmerman pulled his gun and fired. If this story is true, it suggests a few things to me: Firstly, Zimmerman is racist and an asshole. The trouble is that it isn't illegal to be a racist asshole. Nor is it illegal to follow somebody down the sidewalk. And once Martin began physically attacking Zimmerman, he was within his rights to defend himself. The question for me, then, becomes whether or not the story is indeed true. To my mind, that's not for me but for the jury to decide. Important here is whether Zimmerman's story could reasonably be presumed to be true-if it is then there is reasonable doubt. Given that the jury has a great deal more information about the case than I do, I feel like I should trust their decision that Zimmerman's story is plausible, and therefore that he should not be punished for committing a murder. I feel like I'm on the wrong side of a very sensitive racial issue here, Reddit. So change my view.
