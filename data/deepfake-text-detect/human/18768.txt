A raising of minimum wage would require businesses to supply less jobs as a result of less funds to pay each individual worker. I work for my town as a camp counselor over the summers and I know that if they raised minimum wage that I would not have a job next year because they already hardly have enough to give as many people that have paying jobs (some are high school volunteers getting their community service hours). I take an economics class and from what I've learned, I feel like raising the minimum wage would be catastrophic.
