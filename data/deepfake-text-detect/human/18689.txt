Bare with me here. I work out at a gym which plays exclusively hip hop for ambiance over the loudspeakers, consisting mostly of music that has been popular in at least the last ten years. After listening for several months I've concluded that most recent popular music contains a simple catchy beat, club references, and little to no content with a big focus on the common denominator. Every once in a while I'll hear some Tupac or early to mid-nineties mix and it still holds it's own without being annoying as fuck. What's going on here?
