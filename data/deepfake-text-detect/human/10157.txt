Hello. For a long time now I've felt that there are many people in hospitals and psychiatric homes who will never be able to function independently and will never work, create art and music, etc... I recently discovered that the premise behind Hitler's T4 program is that anyone with a seemingly incurable illness that severely hinders their abilities should be euthanized. It sounds kind of awful at first, but these people absorb so much of society's resources. Think of how much better off we would be economically without them. I have a brother who is low-functioning autistic and his whole life he's cost our family so much money just so that we don't have to constantly watch over him. I feel sort of bad about this but I don't want to lie to myself about my own beliefs. CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
