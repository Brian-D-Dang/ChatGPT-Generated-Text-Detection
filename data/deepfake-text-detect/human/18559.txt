Adding onto the title, I believe the feature added to share articles and websites will be the decline of Facebook's popularity, particularly to their original target demographic, 18-30 year olds. The feature has led to tons of websites like "Upworthy" that are essentially bloated and devoid of content, whose sole purpose seems to network through shares on Facebook. But the more and more I see these shared links on my newsfeed, the more and more turned off I become to the website. Change my view.
