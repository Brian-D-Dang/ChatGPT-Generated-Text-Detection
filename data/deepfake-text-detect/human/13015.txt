The plane dives again, and everyone is screaming. The carnage in front of you suddenly is ripped away, as if it never existed. Instead, only open air, where people get sucked out. The piece you, your friend, and the rest of your grade is hurtling towards a city. You see the CN Tower, and you realize you're going to crash in Toronto. You desperately hope this is a dream. But it's not. You have insomnia. There really are about 550 people that are about to, or have already died on this flight. You're flying over what should be Markham. You piece is the wing section, where you and about 100 others sat on your return trip to Markham. You're sitting next to your best friend who you knew since Grade 1. The wreckage lands un-gracefully in a forest, and you're launched out. You're flying. You're flying. You're flying. You're dead. Your legs explodes from the impact with the ground. You're barely alive. Your friend survived, but you can see more pieces raining down. The tail crushes part of the cabin, and a large piece of debris flies up. It crushes your friend. You're not sad. You're happy. At last, this is the sleep you've been waiting for. You're beginning to drift off, into the black void.
