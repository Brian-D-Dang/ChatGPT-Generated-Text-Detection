I realize that 'discriminate' is a charged word and want to specify that I'm only using it the sense of charging a different price. The basis of any insurance is pricing of risks. If one lives in a home in a flood-prone area, that person's flood insurance premium will be higher than for someone who lives on a hill. Health insurance is no different - premiums must be determined by the likelihood of someone using medical services and the cost of those services. It just so happens that women have more intricate inner workings then men and thus require more frequent 'maintenance'. This generally means more frequent doctor visits (which, not surprisingly, cost money). This should translate to higher insurance premiums. Disallowing to charge women a higher price results in men subsidizing women for services that men don't use. Sex discrimination in other areas is completely appropriate. Men pay more for car insurance due to the mere fact that they are men. Data shows that men are more likely to get in an accident and therefore cost more to insure. No surprise there, either. Same principle must apply to health insurance. CMV
