A new, non-lethal weapon based on microwave radar technology is being developed by China and is designed to cause pain over distances without any permanent injuries. The Microwave Active Denial System has two modes, a point launch mode where it can focus energy on specific body parts and a sector-sweep mode which can target bigger areas. Tests have shown that the system is highly effective at halting targets without causing injury. The system is portable and can be mounted on top of a vehicle.
