It is because the next generation of workers is smaller than the generation of people on Social Security. The idea of the system is that workers pay a certain amount to the retirees in order to get the same in return when they retire. However, there aren't going to be enough workers to pay for the retirees unless we either lower benefits or raise the amount workers have to put in the system.," "SS is a pay it forward plan. Each generation of workers is paying not for themselves, but for the previous generation. The problem is 50 years ago there were about 150 workers paying for each SS recipient. Now a days there are like 20 workers paying for each recipient. And in 20 years this is expected to be more like 2-5 workers for each recipient. This will get better after the boomers work through the system. But it'll be decades before that happens. SS has been saving money in order to plan for this. But all of the savings are in treasury bonds. So one part of the government has been borrowing money from another part of the government. And there is reason to fear that the Feds may someday reduce the debt by forgiving its own loans to itself. In other words the future of SS is dependent on an accounting trick. Likewise even by doing that SS is predicted to eventually have payments that will exceed its savings. To fix that SS will either have to reduce payments, increase taxes, or both. And the sooner they do this the easier it will be to resolve this. My expectation is that retirement age will be bumped up a year or two, there will be some sort of means testing with reduced payments to the retired rich, and the current cap (max that will be taxed in a year) will be significantly increased.
