I understand that child rearing is important, but how can I have equal respect for the mom that can stay at home and nap with the baby, run errands, etc, as the mom who gets up, goes to work, and then has to be a mom on her down time? Working moms have the same amount of errands to run, the same house to clean, the same duties as a stay at home mom and less time to do it. I am a woman, and I was brought up to work hard and have a career. I have a hard time comprehending the idea of giving that up, and still having the same amount of respect for myself and pride in what I do. I feel sexist for this. Can someone help me understand the other side?
