My glasses had skittered far away from me. Through blurry eyes I looked up at a crowd of bustling figures, some wearing what looked to be robes. Robes. That was odd. Realization suddenly swept over my like the frigid surf of the northern sea. I had fallen through a brick wall. At King's Cross station. I had quite literally broken the laws of nature. And now a crowd of excitedly murmuring figures grew around me. I was trying to be witty and make light of the situation, and so I sputtered, "Wingardium Leviosa!" My body flew off of the ground. My feet tumbled over my head, and blood rushed to my face, mingling with the red blush that had already swept over me. Swinging feet above the ground, surrounded by what I could only assume were wizards and witches, my mind blinked in and out of consciousness. I awoke on the ground seconds later, scuffed even more than before that terrifying stunt. I could make out my glasses a few inches away and I scurried towards them, placed them on my head, and shakily stood up. The wizarding world loomed before me, as did a ring of motley people, donned in robes and hats and jeans. Above the din of whispers a voice, strangled by a Scottish brogue, yelled out, "Ow'd you go about doing that, lad?" My thoughts, finally reordering themselves, began to ask that same question. And then it came to my attention that I had uttered mere words and levitated myself above the ground. All without a wand. Having read the books a decade before, the knowledge of that world that was tucked away in my brain came flooding out. Supposedly, performing magic without a wand was a feat reserved for the greatest of wizards. Ones that could do great things. Terrible things. A grin stretched across my face.
