Duchamp's Fountain questioned the status quo. The popular consensus is that it is an early and successful example of asking the question, "what is art." But hasn't almost all installation art since then been Duchamp's Fountain over and over again. A tent in a gallery, a dirty bed in a gallery, a shed in a gallery etc etc. Almost all contemporary installation art is criminally dull and boring. The 100th attempt at asking the question 'what is art' just leaves me dripping with apathy. The greatest crime that Art can commit is to be boring. Just sitting there, letting out a heavy sigh as people walk by. All the boring toys end up at the bottom of the toy box. But with modern art installations in museums, it's the opposite. They're proudly put on display. I wish this kind of art didn't have the reputation of an STD in England, but it does.
