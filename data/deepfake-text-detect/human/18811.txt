I believe global warming is a very real thing that needs to be addressed on an international scale (simply putting regulations on pollution in only America won't be enough). Because of my firm stance on global warming, it makes me incredibly angry go hear people going around saying things like "Global warming is just another one of Obama's lies." and "Global warming is just a lie to give green business a boost." Whenever I hear people say something like that, I immediately assume they're a partisan (conservative) sheep who will believe nearly anything on FOX News. CMV.
