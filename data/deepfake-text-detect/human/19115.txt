While I don't care much for that particular sub anymore, I spent a fair amount of time reading what was said there. Everyone wants to demonize that sub because of the tone of the content, but there is rarely ever any successful subs which manage the same message but also respecting women. There are a lot of frustrated "nice guys" who don't know how to be assertive, take action, demonstrate attractiveness, etc, who flock to these misogynists precisely because being "themselves" hasn't worked. Thus, the only these men have is to read the content there and sort out the hateful from the practical.
