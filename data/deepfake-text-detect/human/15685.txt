I am still just as pleased with Sonoma Grille as I was the first time a reviewed it. I would say I am up to eating here twice a month, or as often as I can afford. On my latest visit I requested the tapas platter for two, which had never been a problem for me to order for lunch before, but on this occasion I was told it was a dinner item and that I couldn't have it for lunch. I was pretty let down by this. What the Sonoma Grille offers for lunch is just not hearty enough for me. I like to EAT! not snack on salad. Anyway I know better next time though just to go for dinner.
