It had been mocked by humanity itself. It's use had been diluted into an excuse for ignorant behavior. The gods felt that it had perfectly encompassed humanity. That it had connected all humans in the same way. The humans hatred for it was understandable. They had spent all of their life trying to forget it. Some embraced it, used it to define themselves, others completely forgot about it as they went about their daily lives. The gods were kind in giving humanity the gift of death, for it was something they desired as centuries passed. So, when the gods were given the task of defining humanity in a single sound, the answer was clear. They had to define death, for that in and of itself defined humanity. They chose the single biggest reminder of mans own mortality, it was their motto after all. The gods inscribed in stone, "YOLO."
