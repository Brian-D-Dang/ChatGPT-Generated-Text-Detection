They close 15 minutes early and will ignore you knocking on the door. We rushed from the fashion show end of the strip to serendipity (a 20 minute walk) and got to the restaurant with 15 minutes to close and thought for sure we would be able to at least grab a to-go frozen hot chocolate but they had shut and locked all windows and doors and the guy cleaning literally ignored my husband knocking on the window 2 feet in front of his face! Horrible service!!!! Places that are so flippant to customers don't deserve to stay in business.
