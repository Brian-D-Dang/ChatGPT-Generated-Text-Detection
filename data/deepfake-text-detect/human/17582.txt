What is the legal rationale for making such a narrow decision for what corporations are allowed to and not to cover? I really don't get it, why can you not provide birth control, but not blood transfusion if both are sincerely religious beliefs of a corporation? They just said it to be the case, but didn't provide any reasoning. Also, what about (closely held) corporations who believe in faith healing? Why can't they completely opt out of health insurance? Why does it make sense to not allow that? Please change my view that this decision actually makes sense.
