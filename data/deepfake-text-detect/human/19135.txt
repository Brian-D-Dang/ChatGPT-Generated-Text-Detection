Please note I differentiate evil from selfishness, which I believe to simply be a part of human nature that people have varying levels of control over. There is bad luck, ignorance, shame, bad things happen. People do bad things for personal gain or because they are mentally not well. But is there really evil? A force that seeks only to do harm or cause pain?
