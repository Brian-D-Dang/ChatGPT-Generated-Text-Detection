I ordered a guitar online on January 15th from a Luthier. The guitar was a special order to be delivered by Federal Express. It was insured and I needed to be home to sign for it. I waited for my new instrument and did not leave my house that day. I was so delighted my guitar was delivered that January afternoon!
