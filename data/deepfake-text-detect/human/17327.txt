My husband thinks water fluoridation is bad but I think it's good since it keeps our teeth healthy and clean. I've been drinking fluoridated water my whole life and i've always had healthy teeth. Fluoride, is just a mineral and is a naturally occurring substances, how can it be harmful if it's naturally occurring? Webmd says fluoride prevents gingivitis, and decreases the amount of cavities you'll get. This website says it doesn't cause cancer. This page says water fluoridation doesn't lower people's IQs If someone doesn't want fluoride in their water they can always just buy a water filter. Is that really so hard?
