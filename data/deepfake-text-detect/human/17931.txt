So, I'm an American male, who recently went vegan. I did so based upon health concerns. While I am horrified by the torture that animals undergo at the hands of the factory farming complex, I do think that man, in the abstract, has the right to kill animals in a humane fashion. My view is based upon the following logic. Animals exist in the laws of nature, man is an apex predator, and therefore the strong have a "natural" right to eat the weaker animals. I don't think it's pretty, but that's the way I see it. A friend of mine was offended by my outlook, which I found quite strange. So I thought to myself, who better to ask then a gaggle of internet strangers. Again, just so we're clear, I am against animal cruelty, but I don't necessarily view man killing animal as "murder." Okay, let's do this! Change my view, animal lovers of reddit!
