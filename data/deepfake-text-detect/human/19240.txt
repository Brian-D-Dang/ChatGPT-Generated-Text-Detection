I am an unabashed Statist - that is, I think society depends on the existence of a state in order to function. I think that in order to have a functioning society, there needs to be a social contract; that part of that social contract means ceding some freedom to the state (for example, ceding my authority to commit violence, allowing the state a monopoly to do so) and that there are things that it is moral for the state to do that it would be immoral for individuals to do (like collect taxes.) Basically, I believe, like Hobbes, that society cannot function without a Leviathan standing over us (although that's basically the last point of agreement between Hobbes and I.) Furthermore, every Anarcho-Capitalist defense of a stateless system I've seen either falls apart or relies on completely magical thinking when pressed on issues such as criminal justice. Saying 'the market will provide justice' is magical thinking unless you have some strong evidence to believe that the market can do just that. But I'm interested in hearing why I'm wrong, so please, CMV.
