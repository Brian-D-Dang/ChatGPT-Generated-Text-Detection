Humans, like all other organisms, have evolved to survive in their environments. For almost all of human history, this has meant living in small, simple rural communities based on agricultural labor, with strong social interactions and ties with a limited group of people. Regardless of your opinion on a society like this, you can agree that this is what humanity evolved towards. And the human psyche has evolved just as much as the human body- in short, our brains are hardwired for this kind of lifestyle. At least the vast majority, anyways. I think that we as humans do not have the mental tools to cope with modern life, being so radically different than small agrarian communities. I think this can cause depression, anxiety, etc. CMV
