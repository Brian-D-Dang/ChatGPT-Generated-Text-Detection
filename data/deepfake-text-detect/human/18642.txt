From It differs from other forms of homicide in that, due to certain circumstances, the homicide is justified as preventing greater harm to innocents. Families with disabled children suffer from poverty and stress. The parents are often forced to give up their careers to care for the disabled child. The stress on the family due to a disabled child often results in suicides of the caregivers, Social supports don't reduce this stress but only spread it out to more people. Raising disabled children's causes a great deal of stress, EDIT: My view could be changed if it was shown that these parents are a danger to the community.
