Tendonitis does heal. Since your tendonitis flares up every 2 months or so, I suspect you just haven't given it enough time to rest and recover. There may also be scar tissue in there that needs to be broken up by a professional, or you may have some weird biomechanical thing that's causing the tendon to work in a funny way. Either way, I highly recommend you see a good physical therapist who can help you work through this.
