The task of Multi-choice Machine Reading Comprehension (MMRC) aims to select the correct answer from a set of options based on a given passage and question. In generally, neural pre-trained models are employed to predict the correct answer from options. In this paper, we simply reconstruct multi-choice to single-choice by training a binary classification model to classify whether the answer is correct. We adopted the Ti-one machine learning platform provided by Tencent Cloud with its built-in AutoML and multi-machine communication acceleration framework to complete our experiments.Experimental results on the RACE dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly improvements. Finally, as we relax the constraints on data format, we take a data augmentation method by introducing other formats QA datasets and achieve a new state of the art performance.
