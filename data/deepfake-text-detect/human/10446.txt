It means a plasma that is made of quarks and gluons. It's a new form of matter because, under normal conditions, you cannot have a plasma made of quarks and gluons. I don't know why its direction of movement would be relevant.,Regular matter, the stuff we're made of, is mostly atoms. Atoms have protons, neutrons, and electrons. Usually, the electrons are zipping around the protons and there is an equal balance of electrons (negative charge) and protons (positive charge). Basically, every electron has a "home base" which is an atom or molecule. A "regular" plasma is when you heat up matter enough that the electrons go zipping out of their home bases and you have a soup of electrons and protons and stuff all mixed together. This requires very high temperatures, like in a blowtorch or on the surface of the Sun. Turns out that if you have enough energy in one place, the protons (and neutrons) themselves will split up into even smaller bits called quarks. Gluons are particles that hold quarks together (like glue. Yes, for real.). This requires INSANE amounts of energy, but it's what we think the universe was like right after the Big Bang. All of these random quarks can reconfigure into weird types of matter, so scientists can study what comes out to see what was happening during the plasma phase. TL:DR Heat stuff up enough and it "melts" into crazy tiny particles called quarks.
