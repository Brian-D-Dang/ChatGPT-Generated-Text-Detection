It's very simple in principle. You enter a long URL, and the server generates a short string of numbers and letters (or sometimes allows you to specify your own) that refers to the URL, and stores this relationship in some kind of database. Later, when someone requests that string of letters and numbers from the URL shortening website, it looks up the string in the database and sends a redirect to the original URL. While it's doing so, it can collect statistics like the number of hits, and sometimes offers features like a preview of the full URL before your browser gets sent there.,For example, tinyurl will take your long url, create a unique tinyurl link, store them in a database together, and when you use that tinyurl link it will look up the associated url and redirect you there.
