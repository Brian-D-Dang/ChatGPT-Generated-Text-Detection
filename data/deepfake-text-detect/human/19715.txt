I am a 26 year old straight, happily married male with one child. You might call me a 'beta' - my wife is assertive, opinionated, will be the primary bread-winner for our family, and I love her very much. While we both work, I am the 'primarily' parent. I do more than half the cooking and cleaning. I also like making her happy. I view our relationship as an equal partnership and we are both very happy with it. We have an active and healthy sex-life. Edit: Rule 1: I hold my view because our realtionship works, and I've seen other relationships like it that work. I have not seen a relationship where one partner is treated as "less than" be sucessful (sucess defined as both people being happy). I'm a firm believer that decisions we make should be talked about, talked through, and agreed on. We're a team and we should (and do) treat eachother with respect. While there are certainly things that one of us cares more about than the other (e.g. she will default to decisions about technology to me, I will go with her opinion on fashion or decorating), we talk about and agree on nearly everything before doing it. I believe that healthy relationships are fundamentally about treating the other as an equal partner - that truly equal relationships do not have a "leader" or "dominant" personality. Please CMV. [This thread] (red-pill approved, posted by one of the regulars there) would be a great example of the kind of thing I would like to understand better, and the kind of people I would like to CMV.
