Young kids like non-human characters a lot. I once heard an anecdote that Sesame Street was originally going to have Muppets and humans NOT interact with each other, because producers thought it would be confusing for kids. In focus groups, kids loved the Muppets, then tuned out for the people-only segments, so they decided to feature the non-human characters more prominently.
