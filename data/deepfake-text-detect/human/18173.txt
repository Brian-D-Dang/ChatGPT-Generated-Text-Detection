I have been with my boyfriend (who shares my same views) for over five years. I don't believe in marriage, but it gets me a lot of drama from family, friends and strangers. I just don't see the point; I am committed and he is, too. I feel like it is a waste of money and completely unnecessary. I feel no need to involve legal business in my marriage, and I feel like a relationship should be based on trust, love and happiness. I don't see the point in, basically, signing a contract saying that you'll be happy forever. I like the idea of a ceremony, just due to the idea of all your friends and family coming together and it being a day based around love and commitment. My cousin didn't get legally married, but had a "commitment ceremony" and they've been together for about ten years and they have a child together. I just don't see the point. I am interested to hear what everyone else thinks, and why they got married or believe in marriage as an institution. Change my view! EDIT: Thank you for everyone's input. While I am not 100 convinced that marriage would be right for me or that it is a good idea in general, you guys definitely gave me some insight on the other side and I've now got some things to think about! Thank you!
