Hi everyone, this is my first post here so I hope I am complying to the standards and rules of this subreddit. I believe that golf is an antiquated game played by old people who have outdated beliefs. Golf is a boring game that consumes way too much time to play. I've played with my parents, and while I do enjoy spending time with them, I believe that it was a game that took way too much time and we could've done something more fun to do like go bowling. Not only is it boring to play, it is excruciating to watch on television. My dad watches it and I just leave the room. Other than playing golf, I have had other experiences such as caddying at golf course. This is a really awful job, in my opinion. Yeah, you can work your own hours but putting up with some really old people playing a really long game for just an okay amount of money really sucks the fun out of summer days. Now to the elderly white men part, from my experiences caddying at a golf course, all of the people I noticed were white, and elderly. If you watch TV the majority of the people playing golf aren't older, but they're all white. In my opinion, it just seems like the game of elitist old business white men, who instead of working at their corporate offices, go out and golf on weekdays. Even with people like Tiger Woods, there is no [boom in minorities interest in golf] It just seems to me that golf is a game played by people with white privilege.
