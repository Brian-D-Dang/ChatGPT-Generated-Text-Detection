I was reminded of a story when I worked at a gas station, where everyday all day people would use EBT cards to buy junk food then pull out wads of cash for alcohol, lotto tickets, cigarettes and grape swishers (if you didn't know, swishers are used to smoke weed). The worst offense was a lady who put milk back for her kid when the EBT card declined, then spent 6.25 for a pack of cigarettes. Most of us stay quiet when we see that happen because is it considered "rude" or "offensive" if we called someone out on it... But isn't it more offensive for someone to use the money given to them on junk food or to take the money when they have means to buy alcohol, drugs and cigarettes? I am all for helping those in need, but it still seems ludacris to me that we stand silently and watch people who are working the system. Even if they are only getting a few hundred dollars a month, that could make a world of a difference to a family who really needs it. CMV
