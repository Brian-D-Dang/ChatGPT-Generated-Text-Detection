I've been having some internal debate recently over my vegan diet. I've been a vegan for two years, vegetarian for five before that. But I've also been reading into the paleo and whole 30 diets, and find their reasonings compelling. So, if we are looking at these diets purely from the health perspective, I used to believe that eating vegan was the healthiest way to do so. I thought red meat contributed to heart disease, and that poultry, eggs, and fish were unnecessary to consume, since you can get protein from vegan sources like beans, tofu, tempeh, etc. But, apparently there are things that are no good for you in beans and legumes? Cost-wise, I would think that an optimal vegan diet would be cheaper than an optimal omnivorous diet. I'm a college student, and don't have the money to spend on grass-fed meats, but I can afford beans and vegetables and oatmeal. Looking at it from an ethical view, I can't quite convince myself that it's okay to eat meat. Maybe a vegan diet isn't exactly optimal, but it doesn't contribute to the suffering of animals. I don't have to feel guilt over my food, knowing that an animal died for my meal. I'd be interested in hearing from some people that may have switched from veganism to paleo or whole 30 or something similar.
