Giuga's conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for p to be prime. Another consequence of Fermat's little theorem is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p - 1 or a divisor of p - 1. The fraction 1p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. Wilson's theorem says that an integer p 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p - 1)! 1 is divisible by p. Moreover, an integer n 4 is composite if and only if (n - 1)! is divisible by n.
