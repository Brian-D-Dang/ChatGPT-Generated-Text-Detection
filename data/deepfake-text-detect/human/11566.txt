Apple is facing an antitrust investigation after Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission for Apple's anti-competitive business strategies. Spotify is frustrated with Apple's 30 percent take of subscription fees and they claim that Apple unfairly used their iOS platform to launch a music subscription service that otherwise would not have been successful. Companies leveraging their platforms for their own benefit is common practice in the US, but the EU believes that regulators must protect consumers against such practices as they may harm innovation and limit customer choice.
