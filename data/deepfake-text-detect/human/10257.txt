One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one. Universities have done an excellent job in creating an environment that has tons of racial, sexual, ethnic and religious diversity. However, it still lacks intellectual and political diversity. People with conservative or right-wing views are [woefully unrepresented] in academia, particularly in the social sciences. Not only does this make people with conservative political views feel unwelcome and unappreciated in the university environment, it threatens the perceived validity of the research done. [This is even recognized by some leftists themselves] . How are you supposed to have valid research, let alone critical thinking, when there is an absolute hegemony of leftist views, which no one dares challenge due to their overwhelmingly disproportionate power and influence on campus? Therefore, to make university a more diverse environment and encourage critical thinking, we should prioritize student and faculty applicants who are affiliated with right wing organizations, and ensure that peer review panels have at least one right wing professor on them CMV.
