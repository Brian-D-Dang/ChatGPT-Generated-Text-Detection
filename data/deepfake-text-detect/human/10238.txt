Specifically talking about the United States. College tuition, as in, 18 years from now. I know this excludes about 95 of the population, and I know everyone wants to make copies of themselves, but it seems very irresponsible. The two trends are that seem to be increasing relentlously are college tuition costs and percentage of people attending college, I blame the system for this, not the individuals, as the U.S. moves further away from manufacturing, the need for college educating people in our work force increases, there are less and less jobs available that don't require college. It seems downright irresponsible to bring someone into a world that expects them to go to college and be 500,000 (or whatever it will be in 18 years) in debt. Would like to hear all of your thoughts on the matter. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
