with all the debate recently about how much (and whether) the minimum wage (MW) should be raised, I find it very surprising that no one has ever put this idea up for discussion. while I do think MW should be raised it's hard to strike a balance between saving families from poverty and damaging the local economy. I mean after all 20,000 a year goes a lot further in suburban Alabama than it does in Manhattan so why should the MW be the same in both places? I think the best way to do it would be to split the nation into zones and create an agency that monitors the cost of living in an area. your MW would be decided by your residency not your workplace though they could pay more. telling your workplace a false residency would be fraud to avoid people claiming higher costs of living than they have (i.e. lives in NJ and claims an apartment in NY) I'm flexible about the method but I think this is the best way to do it. because when I hear about 9 dollar an hour minimum wage I think about how I couldn't afford a cardboard box on that but cousin Jimbo can live in (relative) comfort.
