Firstly, I am a male, and a staunch feminist. I believe very, very strongly that women should be equal to men in all ways. However, the "No uterus, no opinion" view that I have encountered a lot recently irks me. I recently entered a debate, which quickly turned into an argument, with a woman who was blaming the (perfectly justified) fear that she might feel when she goes out on all men, with my viewpoint being that in generalising all men she was A) alienating male allies and B) warding off potential allies, and that in general generalising is a bad way to go about achieving change, given that a majority of legislators are male. I was told that I was being patronizing and condescending, and that I had no right in telling a woman how to "do feminism." When I told one of my friends, who's opinion I value highly, about the argument, she came down strongly on the side of the woman I had the argument with. She tried to explain to me why I was wrong, but was unable to do so in a way I found satisfying. So, I am perfectly (I hope) open to the idea that I am wrong, but so far it hasn't been explained to me why I'm wrong. Change my view, y'all. Edit: My 'V' has been successfully 'C'd by guitardreams and the article linked by them. I appreciate that there are plenty of comments and responses here that I have not read, but I no longer feel the need to read them. I apologise that I may have been acting in a detrimental way, but it was with the intention of reaching a point that I actually did understand the opposing view, rather than simply accepting everything I was told at face value.
