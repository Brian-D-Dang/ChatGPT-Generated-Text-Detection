This is something that I can't really get over. Here is my view essentially: I have worked hard in my life to allow myself to acquire an income that allows me to be comfortable, and have savings, but why should my would be savings go to someone who may not have worked anywhere near as hard as I have? I understand that there are lazy people and hard working people in both the highest tax bracket, as well as the lowest, and so I understand that not everybody worked very hard to become affluent, however there are also plenty of people who are as lazy, and are living off of my hard earned money.
