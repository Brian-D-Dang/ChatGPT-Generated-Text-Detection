The only reason we used to come here every week was for the food. Needless to say the got rid of the best menu items they had again. They used to serve pizza - gone! Chicken avacado club sandwich? gone too! The only decent salad they had on the menu the chicken avacado with garlic...took it off the menu This place sux now we certainly will not be back ever!
