I think any abortion is morally wrong, because you're talking about human life (I'm atheist). But if you're of the opinion that a fetus isn't human life and you're pro-abortion, how do you decide what's the exact moment when a fetus is just goo and when does it become a person? One month? Two months? 5 months? Does something magically occur when all fetuses grow souls? And if you think there are certain characteristics that make a human being that normally occur at a certain period, will you generalize and incur the risk of that being developing them earlier than others? Tell me exactly the point where abortion goes from a procdeure to excrete human matter to murder?
