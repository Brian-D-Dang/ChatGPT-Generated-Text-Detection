I am a dentist and I am under a lot of pressure from my boss to meet financial targets. This would mean that I would need to perform a lot of treatment which I do not think is necessary (based on evidence derived from peer-reviewed articles). On the other hand, if all dentists were to perform treatment which was in their patient's best interests, there would be significantly less dentists around. After 5 years of extremely expensive education, losing a job so soon after I graduate is most likely going to result in my not having a job for a significant period of time and a great deal of uncertainty about my future. Regardless, the time has come to make a choice. CMV, otherwise I will have to quit my job and watch somebody else who is more willingbetter at ripping off patients have a successful career until such time shit hits the fan, if it ever does.
