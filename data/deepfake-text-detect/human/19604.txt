First of all, let me clarify that I'm a non-Christian guy. So I'm not just saying this to root for my team or anything. My argument is basically what the title says. The United States was indeed founded as a country upon Christian principles, despite what liberals nowadays say. Many of our rights and liberties come from core Christian values, such as the idea that unlawful killing is one of the worst crimes anyone can commit. Have you ever wondered why we as a people give such harsh prison sentences to murderers, or make it constitutionally very hard for government to execute somebody? It's because Christianity was the first major religion to condemn wanton killing as the unholiest of sins, and this idea was embedded into the Constitution. Imagine if we had been founded by refugees from the Roman Empire or something. We would be building Colosseums and executing prisoners in carnival-like spectacles for public pleasure. I guarantee you that the ban on "cruel and unusual" punishments wouldn't exist. Now, I agree that the Founding Fathers probably didn't sit together and say "hey, let's change some words of the Ten Commandments and use that as our rule of law!" They probably did envision the country as not being derived solely from religion. However, they were born into a very religious time and grew up with that mindset; it's impossible for them not to incorporate that into their philosophical musings and beliefs, even if some of them professed to be Deistnon-religious. TL;DR: A lot of liberals say that the US was founded on entirely secular principles and I think this is wrong. The Constitution clearly has roots that are unique to Christianity, and this is the basis of our government. CMV.
