I just don't see that any of them represent anything that a) I hold to be Canadian values or b) I hold to be my own values. I believe that the majority of political parties are interested in supporting the poor and vulnerable only as much as it also supports them, or their rich friends to do so. Since I've been old enough to vote, I've had Chretien come visit my province while it was massively flooding and then call an election immediately after anyway, because the time was ripe in the populated center of the country. I've had Martin with his Adscam crap. And I've had Harper with his complete disregard for our environment, for rules and transparency, and now he's pretty much completely embroiled in scandal. On the national scale, I also was part of a team organizing an event supporting a justice issue, and we had a politician come out and speak. This politician essentially turned the entire purpose of the event on its head, and used it to basically campaign against opponents. (vague on purpose to avoid doxxing myself). Provincially I grew up with Gary F promising not to sell the jets, and then selling them. I guess we had a couple not too bad provincial leaders, because I can't remember them. Last couple years I've been in Quebec, and basically the option was between a party that was known for being incredibly corrupt, and between a party that uses fear of the English to push some really bigoted and regressive laws into the province. At a municipal level, Sam Katz seemed like a real slime-ball until I moved out to Montreal, and saw mayor after mayor go down there. Meanwhile the mayor of Laval was heading the Italian mob. I think that the mayors of Canada's cities are pretty much just fighting to be the least effective, and the most corrupt mayors ever. All this hate on politicians has me really despondent about where our country is headed, so please: CMV.
