While I understand the logic involved in only wanting native-born Americans to serve as president (uncertain allegiances, conflict of interest in foreign affairs, etc.), these are also concerns with anyone whose parents immigrated to the US later in life. Why should someone who was born to American expats in Russia be ineligible for the presidency, while someone born to Russian diplomats on US soil is? The country you were raised in and the country your parents were raised in are far more likely to impact your worldview than the country you happen to be born in. Even if you strike the birth requirement, the constitution still requires that the president be a US citizen who has resided in the US for 14 years. Those prerequisites alone seem sufficient to me. Perhaps an additional requirement prohibiting the president from possessing dual citizenship would make sense as well.
