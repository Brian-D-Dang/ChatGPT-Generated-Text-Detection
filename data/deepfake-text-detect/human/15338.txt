I am a local and went to Buddy V's for the first time. I was very unimpressed with the overall meal. The service was incredibly poor. Once we sat down and got water, it took a very long time for anyone to come over and even see if we were ready to order or had questions. Our appetizers came out and were very bland and the garlic bread was burnt. No one came by to see if everything was ok, so by the time someone did come over, our next course was out. They got us a new garlic bread, which also came out burnt. They did end up taking it off our bill. Our other food was just ok. Kind of bland and uninteresting, and definitely not worth 22! Overall I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and I will not be back.
