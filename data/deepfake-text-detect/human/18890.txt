My theory is: At this point, Valve is far too big, and the demand for news regarding HL3 is far too great for there to be a development in progress and have it kept completely under wraps for the length of time that that development would take. This is not dissimilar to the 'there are no aliens, because the government could never keep them a secret that long' argument. I think that if there were any real headway being made, we would have at some point seen a cell-phone pic of a monitor at the very least. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
