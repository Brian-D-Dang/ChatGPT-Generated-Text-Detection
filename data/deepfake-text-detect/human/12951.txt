From birth, criminals were one of two things. Those who indulged in great evils, And those who composed them. Music, more known by its legal name "erroneus rhythm'or "treasonous cacophony" Is the ultimate taboo. I won't pretend I know everything about it, but it nearly collapsed the country. In the rebellions of decades past, messages and intelligence was spread through music. Passages, words "sung" at different pitches to pass on information. It's my job to make sure it stays gone. At least, it was. Their reason? "Suspicious action or choice of words involving the nation." Needless to say, I haven't quite caught up yet. The rain cascades down in the way it has for years, almost like a chorus of applause to congratulate my failure. I look up and realize that I've strayed far off my normal path home, focused instead on the horizon. Looming gray buildings, with decrepit doorways and a sea of graffiti present itself as if it were alive, imposing on the senses in a way that suffocates the beholder. Turning back towards the path, the rain shifts in tone. It's soft, almost sensitive to my distress, calling out in a way that felt otherworldly. I'm frozen, the buildings stand taller and taller against the sky, in a mock challenge of power. But the sensitive tone continues, indifferent of the titanic buildings or the weight of the sky. I stagger forward, suddenly enraptured by the sound, desperate to drown myself in it. A door vibrates underneath my touch with the sound. I revel in it, echoing across my palms, caked with mud and the incessant rain. Trembling, I push open the door. A hall with hundreds of chairs, derelict in a unique way from burns to pieces missing, to crumbled pieces of wood. A lone figure occupies the stage. I had indulged in a great evil, And fallen in love with the maestro. kinda new to WP, please send some criticism! Thank you very much for reading this!
