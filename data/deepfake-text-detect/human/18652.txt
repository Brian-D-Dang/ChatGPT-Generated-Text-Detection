This is mod post 13. You can read the previous mod post [here] , or by visiting the [mod post archive] in our wiki. Last week we decided to [remove the downvotes from comments] as a result of quite a few requests from the community. Hopefully it didn't drive you all to turn off our CSS (which I think is pretty). So, what did you think of having no downvote arrow? Should we bring it back, and if so, for both the comments and posts? If not, why? I'd also like to take this opportunity to welcome our three new moderators: uDrMerkwurdigliebe, uIAmAN00bie, uGameboyPATH We were definitely spoilt for choice with the applications, but we felt we could add no more than three at once. We will likely be recruiting again in the future, so to those who missed out - please stick around! Regards, your ever loving mods.
