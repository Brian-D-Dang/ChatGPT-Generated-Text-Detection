Update: My mind has been changed. No longer have any notion of cheating at all or getting divorced because of subpar sex alone. We were both raised in religious families and had no sex before marriage. I messed around a little with previous boyfriends. (no anal or oral, really tame stuff like getting naked and playing with each other. Gave an ex a handjob one time. Was never fingered.) the extent of my husband's experience is even less. He refused to make out on the grounds of being scared of going too far and losing our virginities. We talked about sexual preferences before marriage. I stressed the importance of sex and my high sex drive to him and he agreed to experiment and use toys. After our first time he just wanted quickies three times a week. He has tried different positions and we have gone to a sex therapist but none of it has improved sex between us. We bought one vibrator but he refuses to go to sex shops with me. After 2.5 years of marriage I have had satisfying sex about five times and no orgasms except though solo masturbation. I want to know if I am missing out on something grand before I leave over bad, infrequent sex. I want to have a physical affair to confirm whether or not considerate sex is important to have. CMV edit: He has told me he has no fantasies and is uncomfortable listening to any of mine. Says that sex is just about penetration and that my concept of sex being everything before and after is strange to him. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
