In my dual enrollment English 1010 class, we are not allowed to use "you" in it or we automatically fail the essay. This is crazy and doesn't make any sense as it helps the reader connect to the story and understand it better. Usually after writing the essay I go back and change all of my "yous" to another word that can substitute in. After I do that then the story starts to sound weird with these words in there and I think it actually sounds worse than if I left all of the words as "you." Using "you" also let's the writer come up with examples for whatever their purpose heshe is writing for to better get their message across. Many of my friends also feel the same way and I have seen a couple of them fail due to this rule. Usually after class, we all walk out complaining about all of the stupid reasons we got a bad grade on our essay. I may be missing something that makes "you" ruin an essay but I just can't see it.
