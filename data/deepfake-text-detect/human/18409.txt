People in my neighborhood just got notified that a house recently sold to a corporation and they have the intention of turning it into a "group home." We went to a meeting last night to get some details on exactly what that means, and I'm worried that it is going to be very bad for the neighborhood. My concerns are: 1. The company may potentially be moving "dangerous" people into the house. I live in a very quiet residential neighborhood, and the thought of drug addicts being housed near me is disturbing. Even if the residents are well behaved, there is going to be traffic of their "friends" who I'm assuming will be similar in nature. The company won't say who may be living there. It could be just infirm elderly people, but it could also be "sexual predators" for all I know. 2. My house will lose value when people find out that it is near a group home. Even if it isn't logical, I'm assuming that when someone is looking to buy my house they will be put off by the presence of group home nearby. 3. The business buying the house is a tax-free organization. I don't exactly know what that means, but I assume that they won't be paying property taxes. That means that they will be consuming resources but not paying for them, and my share of the community taxes will increase. 4. Even if this particular place only houses people who are complete angels, this will set a precedent and open up the neighborhood for other homes, and there is no guarantee that the other homes will be run as well. So, that's it. I'd love to hear from someone with experience with group homes moving nearby to tell me that all of my concerns are invalid. And, in truth my real view is that I don't know if my uninformed opinions are correct or not, so if you happen to be able to confirm my thoughts I'd consider that to be changing my view as well.
