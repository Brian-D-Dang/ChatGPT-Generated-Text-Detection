Amazon recently unveiled a brand called'Made for You' that makes custom-fitted clothes. Its first product is a 25 custom t-shirt. The process starts with the user inputting body dimension data to create a virtual body double, after which they can choose the color, sleeve length, and neckline of the shirt. Amazon has declined to discuss its manufacturing process in detail, but its website says the shirts are made in the US with imported fabric. It plans to offer other types of garments on the platform.
