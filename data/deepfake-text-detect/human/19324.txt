First off - The basis for my statement is that I don't think there is any reason to believe there is life after death. Without debating this notion, and accepting the proposition that people's existences are terminated, I see no reason why being dead is so bad for the person who is dead. Someone dying is terrible, but for the living. For the dead, they cannot look back in retrospect and contemplate what happened to them. So in the case of murder, all crimes committed upon them must necessarily be worse than murder (after the act has been committed) because the victim can contemplate it. I understand there are concerns regarding the living, but I am speaking purely on behalf of the dead. And I thought of this purely as a language construct, but I am also interested in its morality.
