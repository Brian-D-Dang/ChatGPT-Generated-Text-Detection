Long movies used to have intermission, now they don't. This is bad for the following reasons: People will often need a break: bathroom, food, drink, simply to stretch. It will be nice to pee, grab a soda without missing part of the movie. People who will inevitably NEED a bathroom, will inevitably disturb other movie watchers, if there is no set break. Intermissions work really well in theaters, operas and musicals. Why not movies? To anticipate some objections: Sure, maybe ONE movie out of a thousand can't be interrupted without ruining artistic vision. However most movies will easily tolerate a 5-10 minutes break. Directors cam even use it to their advantage: for example by creating mini climaxes, or small cliffhangers before the intermission. Money. Movie theaters did away with breaks to squeeze in more screen time, so intermissions will cut into already slim profit. My response: movie theaters already show commercials pre movies, why not just shift some ads from pre-movie time to the intermission time? No money is lost. I simply see no good reason as to why intermissions went away. CMV! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
