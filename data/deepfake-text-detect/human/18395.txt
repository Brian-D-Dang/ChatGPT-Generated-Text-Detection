States control who can occupy their territory. People can enter their territory through immigration or birth. States can set restrictions on who can enter their territory and impose minimum earned income. Canada requires three years minimum earned income, Since most residents enter through birth having these restriction just on immigrants is not completely effective. Children who grow up in poverty do not do well, The causes are both a result of lack of resources and poor genetics from parents who lack the ability to earn an adequate income. That is why the requirement would be earned income. Those who get pregnant without the three years minimum income would be subject to forced abortions. Those discovered after birth would be deported.
