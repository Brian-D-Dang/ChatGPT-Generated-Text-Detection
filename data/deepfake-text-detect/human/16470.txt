It is a considerable task to collect digital trace data at a large scale andat the same time adhere to established academic standards. In the context ofpolitical communication, important challenges are (1) defining the social mediaaccounts and posts relevant to the campaign (content validity), (2) operationalizing the venues where relevant social media activity takes place (construct validity), (3) capturing all of the relevant social media activity (reliability), and (4) sharing as much data as possible for reuse andreplication (objectivity). This project by GESIS - Leibniz Institute for theSocial Sciences and the E-Democracy Program of the University of Koblenz-Landauconducted such an effort. We concentrated on the two social media networks ofmost political relevance, Facebook and Twitter.
