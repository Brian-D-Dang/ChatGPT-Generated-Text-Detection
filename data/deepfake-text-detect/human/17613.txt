I'd describe his style as rambling and his ideas simple. From what I have read (and I haven't got through all of Infinite Jest), his work seems to hinge on the expression of alienation in modern American suburbia and post-modern "playfulness." Well, Garfield Minus Garfield does both much more succinctly and effectively. I have met a lot of people in my life (I'm in my 30s and highly educated) who really use high-profile texts to create and assert their own high-mindedness. In actual fact, 90 of this is bullshit andor pretentiousness. I think Wallace, kinda like Pynchon and to a certain extent Joyce (even Nabokov admitted Finnegan's Wake was crap), fall in that same category to a certain extent. But like many other writers have some redeeming qualities, I see none in Wallace. CMV. Edit: I want to emphasize that I am talking about his NOVELS, not his essays or non-fiction pieces.
