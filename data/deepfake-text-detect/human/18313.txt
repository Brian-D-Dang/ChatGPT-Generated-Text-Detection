When a sane and sober adult decides to take up a clearly risky hobby, he or she knows going in that it may not end well. Whether it's hangliding, skydiving, rock climbing, or car racing, the participant is choosing to put his or her life at risk for the sake of adventure. If the participant has children, it's an even more questionable decision. In any event, if he or she is killed in the act, there should be no sympathy for him or her. Our sympathy should be reserved for those who die as a result of unavoidable tragedies, such as a rare form of cancer or a head-on collision with a wrong-way, drunk driver. If someone's job is dangerous, sympathy is warranted if something goes wrong. After all, he or she was simply trying to earn a living. On the other hand, if someone dies while partaking in a dangerous hobby, the logical response is, "Yes, that was a risky decision."
