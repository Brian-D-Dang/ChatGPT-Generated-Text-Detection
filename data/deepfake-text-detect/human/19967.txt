There seems to be a whole culture on hating on snitches or people who rat out on what other people are doing. I started thinking about it after watching scent of a women which Al pacino defended a boy for not snitching on his classmates and paraded it as something that's morally right, something none of his peers seem to exhibit. I myself has been ratted out for something that I have done. However, personal I feel that while the feeling of being exposed by someone of something you have done that might be wrong does not change the fact that you have committed something that should have been done. It seems to be that society's view on snitches especially when portrayed in the media are not entirely justified. I'll be happy to know reddit's view on this. Thank you!
