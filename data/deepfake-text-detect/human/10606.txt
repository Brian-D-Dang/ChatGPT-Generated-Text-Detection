In a magnet, all of the atoms are aligned with their poles in a single direction with the positive ends all facing one direction and the negative facing the opposite. This is what creates a magnetic field. In unmagnatized metal, the poles of the individual atoms are not aligned and cancel each other out so there is no magnetic field.
