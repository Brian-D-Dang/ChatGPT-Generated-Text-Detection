Healthcare is one of the few services where you have no clue how much you'll pay until the very last provider thinks they gouged whatever they can out of you. Force every provider, facility, etc. to publish all the costs - hospital stay fees, medical devices, medication, nurse services, doctor fees etc. for each procedure done. Publish it o the internet and on paper at entrance to each facility, hospital, and doctor. People flocking to cheaper hospitals and doctors will reduce healthcare costs more efficiently than anything else (price ceiling, floors, etc.). Let the providers compete on the pricing, not patients.
