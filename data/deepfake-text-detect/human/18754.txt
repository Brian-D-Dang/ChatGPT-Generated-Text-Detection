KFC recently released a new option for drive-thru customers: [a chicken basket that is perfectly sized to fit in a cupholder] . A lot of people got upset about this because, while people may have been eating and driving beforehand, and having all the food right (in the cup holder) there is better than looking around for it while driving, it sends the message that eating and driving is okay. My problem: if you are eating out of something like a Go-Cup, you don't need to look at the food, so the only distraction can be the physical action of picking up the food and putting it into your mouth. Therefore, I have concluded that eating while driving, KFC-Go-Cup-style, is no worse than other things such as operating a stickshift (as both only require touch; you don't need to look at either to complete the action). what I mean is, in other drive thrus, they give you your food wrapped up and in a paper bag. This is way more difficult to open and eat while driving than the KFC go-cup, which doesn't require unwrapping.
