I am a las vegas local who has been to plenty of buffets all around vegas with that said I was not impressed with this buffet what so ever! After waiting in line about 45 mins we assumed the food must've been great. I would think a popular casino right off the strip would have excellent food selections, wrong. The food did not look appealing. I couldn't even bring myself to try it. The desert selections are very very limited, and sad. The only thing that made the buffet was the crab legs. Those were great but that's it!! Buffets should rely on one item alone! If it weren't for the crab legs and a decent slice of meat this buffet would have only got one star. If u want a great buffet go to the M resort. That is one of the best in vegas.!
