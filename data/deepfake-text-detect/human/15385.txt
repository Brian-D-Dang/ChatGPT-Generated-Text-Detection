This review is for the Spa at GVR... It was amazing. They now offer 20 off 7 days a week for vegas residents. The massage was amazing. I had Jodi, and she was awesome! It was relaxing, and perfect. The only thing I would have hoped of more for was more co-ed stuff. They only had 1 jacuzzi where I could hang out with my boyfriend beforeafter our massages.
