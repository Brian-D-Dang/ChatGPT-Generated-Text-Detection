A pretty simple google search will result in many horror stories surrounding lottery winners. Many are forced to move from their home towns, face lawsuits from people looking for a quick buck from a deep pocket, and even have a much higher chance of being murdered. I feel that it should be a person's right to choose whether they want the public to know about their winnings. I understand that the main dissenting opinion is the idea that this could lead to people believing the whole thing is rigged, and that nobody actually wins the big jackpots. However, it's kind of ridiculous to think that hundreds of millions of dollars in jackpot money just magically disappear without any Lottery employees coming forward. Furthermore, why do we not doubt the legitimacy of other large jackpots? For a long time people have been buying scratch-off tickets without the ridiculous self-identification laws.
