I'm not referring to some sort of god-based determination. It seems to me that the view of causal determinism is pretty much true. Any action that we take results from prior causes, which, in turn, resulted from prior causes. Any thoughts that one has are a result of chemical reactions in the brain that exist because of a prior state. There's also the studies that have surfaced in light of Libet et al's tests a while back. From what I've read, the brain functionally decides what the body is going to do before a persons thoughts catch up with their actions. Change my view. P.S. Let's not make this a "God exists" discussion, we'll save that for another CMV.
