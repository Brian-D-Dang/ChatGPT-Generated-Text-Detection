With all the hoopla over the fifth anniversary of Michael Jackson's death (which I don't think was truly accidental but that's for another CMV), I'm reminded of how his death did something powerful. Dying more or less voided out most if not all of the bad he did in the public conscience. I know MJ isn't an isolated case and it seems to be the rule for people who die young from JFK to Tupac or from John Lennon to Andrew Brietbart. However, outside of the "never speak ill of the dead" adage I can't see any reason why humanity keeps deifying the prematurely dead. To see one's bad deeds scrubbed away on Earth with no one to speak of them again just feels wrong and downplays their earthly acts. I think speaking ill of the dead who did bad things should totally be acceptable and death should not be a cleanse to one's legacy. Am I alone here?
