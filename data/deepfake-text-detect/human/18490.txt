I believe that charter schools are superior to public schools because they do not have to follow a traditional teaching model. I think that public schools, mainly due to things such as standardized testing, restrict the curriculum so that they can follow standards given to them by the county. Many textbooks I have seen in my school classes, for example, are designed solely to teach students the information they need for a standardized test, and will likely be outdated in a few years because standardized tests change in difficulty every year. In contrast, charter schools are not in the control of a county's school board, and tend to focus more on a child's learning and skill-improvement and ensuring that they know and will remember the information taught for them, rather than just focusing on passing a test. Also, charter schools usually have a much higher success rate than public schools, and students who attend charter schools are more prepared for college learning than the average public school attendee. Here is one of the sources I have used: Please try to offer infoopinions that can change my view, I'm open to anything you may have to say! Thank you for your time and for any comments and insight you may have. Edit: I forgot, here's the definition of a charter school: (in North America) a publicly funded independent school established by teachers, parents, or community groups under the terms of a charter with a local or national authority.
