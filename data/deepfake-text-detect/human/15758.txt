Each chapter has a number of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material. A chapter typically has two "coordinating lead authors," ten to fifteen "lead authors," and a somewhat larger number of "contributing authors." The coordinating lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors, ensuring that they meet stylistic and formatting requirements, and reporting to the Working Group chairs. Lead authors are responsible for writing sections of chapters. Contributing authors prepare text, graphs or data for inclusion by the lead authors.
