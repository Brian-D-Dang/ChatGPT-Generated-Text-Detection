Amazon plans to add a fuel and inflation surcharge to the fees it collects from US third-party sellers who use its fulfillment services. The new fee will go into effect from April 28 and is subject to change. It will apply to all product types. The surcharge is 24 cents per unit, lower than UPS's surcharge of 42 cents.
