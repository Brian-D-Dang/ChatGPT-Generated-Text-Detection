There's a very good reason that the Dane County Farmers' Market routinely appears on many top ten lists of best markets in the countryit's tops in every category. The market takes place on the square surrounding the state Capitol; the setting so picturesque and the vendors so plentiful, that it's in a class by itself. So much bountiful produce that it's staggering; so many varieties of baked goods that it's mind-blowing; and tons of other odds and ends (spices, maple syrup, jamsjellies) to tantalize and delight you. You'll find all walks of life at the market. Everyone from hippies to grandmas to college students. It's a true sea of humanity. This market boasts the best of everything. The vendors here supply the top restaurants in Madison and the Midwest. Totally worth getting up at the crack of dawn (even while on vacation) to check this out.
