Every time someone brings up televised talent contests (e.g. The Voice, X-Factor, Idol) someone in the group tends to bring up how they hate how 'produced' the artists are. Often I'm told that winning one of these contests is somehow a cheat into the music industry, and that the winners are undeserving of any fame. Honestly, I view these shows essentially how they advertise themselves- simply a second chance for someone who hasn't devoted their life to their passion for music (which can be a financially inviable option in many cases) to have a go at being a professional artist. When Kelly Clarkson won the first season of American Idol years ago, it seemed like the general mood was one of celebration, people were rooting for a regular person they could identify with to achieve their dreams. Why are so many people now years later so jaded by the idea of television contests as a manner of achieving stardom? Is there something I'm missing about why they are so loathed?
