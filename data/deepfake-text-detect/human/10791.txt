I think a lot of it has to do with religious alliances spilling into politics. American Christians are BIG on Israel. Many Christian churches in my city fly Israeli flags. Those Christians in vote. Besides that it goes back to WWII and to admit that Israel is a horrible apartheid country is to admit the US wasis wrong and to accept some culpability.','The political science answer is that the US has very few allies in the Middle East and needs a sphere of influence in the region. The "conspiracy theory" answer is that the US is controlled by Jewish bankers. The real reason is probably a combination of the two. The US does have a lot of rich Jewish people and the Rothschilds were influential in creating and sustaining the Zionist state. US foreign policy also has a very real interest in having such a powerful ally in that region who can act with impunity. So why do the people stay silent? The last thing you want is to sound Antisemitic and if you speak against Israel you are likely to get that label. There are also a lot of Christians in America who feel that the Israelites are the chosen people of God and the Jewish people must have their homeland before his second coming.','Because the American economy and political system are dominated by the military-industrial sector which is basically just all the generals, the military contractors, the C-level executives of the defense industry, the stockholders they are beholden to, the lobbyists they send to Washington, and the politicians they bribe. The people in charge of that system make billions of dollars of profit from our alliance with Israel just as they make billions from the "War on Drugs," the militarization of our police forces, our private prison industry, and any other sector where lots of government-employed people want to buy guns and use them to controleliminate some other people.
