Get (or imagine) a skipping rope. Put a pulse in it, the pulse travels down the rope. Does this pulse exist? Most things that are massless are like this pulse, they are an excitation in a specific field. For example, light in an excitation in both the magnetic and electric fields (put in a way where one influences the other, allowing it to travel forever). A field is something that can have a value. The skipping rope is a field because you can measure the height difference between that and a straight one. Certain fields are interesting when excited (having their values changed).
