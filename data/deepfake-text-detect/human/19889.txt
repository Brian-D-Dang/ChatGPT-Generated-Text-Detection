This won't solve everything. Jews and Palestinians still won't like each other, but hopefully they will be able to slowly transition from bombs and rockets to parliamentary debates. The refugee issue would also still be problematic, but there would be the possibility of working it out. I don't think that anyone seriously believes in a two state solution at this point. Israel Palestine is too small, Jerusalem is too important and Palestinian territories aren't even contiguous. I know many Palestinians want all European Jews to leave Palestine, but this isn't realistic and would require really bad ethnic cleansing. North African countries ethnically cleansed the European settlers there in the mid 20th century and their economies still haven't recovered. Furthermore, many Israelis don't want to live as equals with Arabs, but given demographic and political trends they won't have a choice pretty soon. The majority of Israeli citizens will probably be Muslim Arabs by the middle of this century, and this isn't even counting the people living in Gaza and the West Bank with no rights. It seems that if Israelis want to live in peace and sustain a Jewish presence in the Holy land they are going to have to give the Palestinians rights. Hello, users of CMV!
