Nearly all of my close friends are extremely into sports, specifically the upcoming NFL season and their fantasy league. But, I just can't seem to get myself into the whole sports thing. I'm athletic and have played sports my entire life, but just never watched (my family just watched their first superbowl last year). The rest of my friends are hugely into watching professional sports, but I don't understand the hype or why I should be idolizing a single person for how many yards they can run in a game. There are a million other things I find more appealing than watching a football game on a Sunday, but then I end up being left out of the loop during the season. I feel like I'm missing the big picture.
