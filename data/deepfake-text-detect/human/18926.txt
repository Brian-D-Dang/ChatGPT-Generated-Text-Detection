Recently I read that there are two kinds of views towards talent and failure. One says that talent is mostly inborn. People who think in this way are afraid of failure because it means they're not living up to the expectations. If they fail, it reflects negatively on them as people. The other position says that talent is mostly the result of effort you put into developing your skills. For such people, failure is a positive thing; if they fail, it means they reached the limit of their current skill and can now work on expanding their skill (the thinking is that if you never fail, you never try anything new, and thus never learn anything new). I can see how the second mind view is more productive and helps in life. However, my belief is that failure is most often a result of negative personal traits: laziness, stupidity, immaturity, lack of foresight, being unwilling to think of consequences and such. I know there are external factors (being new, being ill, being discriminated against, equipment breaking) yet if they are brought up, to me they sound like seeking excuses and being unwilling to accept responsibility for ones failure.
