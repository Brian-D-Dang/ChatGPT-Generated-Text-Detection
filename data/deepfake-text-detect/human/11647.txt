SpaceX Starlink engineers took part in a Reddit AMA on Saturday. Starlink will try to avoid having data caps on their service, but there may have to be measures in the future to prevent abuse and to ensure everyone has a quality service. The beta will be expanding in late January. Starlink is currently looking for more staff, and people are encouraged to apply. Other topics covered in the AMA, such as mobility, weather, coverage, power consumption, and more, are summarized in the article. A link to the original Reddit thread is available.
