Best sushi in town! Definitely is a little hole in the wall place but has the best tasting sushi hands down! Very affordable, great all you can eat special and cheap saki. Staff is very friendly except for one of the servers is a little rude straight forward sometimes but other then that its my go to sushi spot for sure.
