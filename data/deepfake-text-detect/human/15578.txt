There's nothing better than having a flat tire, standing in line for service, and having the staff completely ignore you. What made my last visit even better, was four people being helped before me. Despite their arriving after me. Apparently, I am not the type of customer they want money from. Too bad, as I have used them many times over the years. Not anymore.
