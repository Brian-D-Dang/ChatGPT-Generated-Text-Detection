For the regular consumer it means literally nothing. You won't notice a thing. For us IT people, it means we better get to learning IPv6 (if we didn't already know it).,It means that every possible IPv4 address is used, which also means switching over to IPv6, which allows more characters to be used in an address and presents a practically infinite amount of addresses.','We're out of "telephone numbers" for the internet. So now we need to make the "telephone numbers" longer. The problem is that a lot of hardware doesn't support the longer "telephone numbers" so they need to be updatedreplaced. So if your modem doesn't already support IPv6 (and can't be updated), your ISP will probably send you a new one sometime in the future.
