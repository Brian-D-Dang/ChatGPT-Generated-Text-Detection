Pretty much summed it up in the title. I know the scientists will say that they do adopt a neutral perspective but in popular culture, this is not what happens. In popular culture, anything not backed by scientific evidence or at least deemed possible or credible is ridiculed. In turn this makes whatever is being ridiculed politically incorrect to study. As a result, there are many fields that scientists would like to explore but can't simply because of the political backlash they would suffer to their careers. And so as a society, we are restricting our discoveries and inventions to the small areas of science and technology that we know about so far, that we think are credible and worthwhile. Some of the greatest inventions and discoveries of humanity were the result of scientists ignoring what was politically correct. What if Galileo had only studied what was politically correct?
