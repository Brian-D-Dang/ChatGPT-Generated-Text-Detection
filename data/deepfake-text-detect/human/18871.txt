I think people find a technical definition of something (rape, abuse, whatever it may be) and turn it into claims that actually arent that. I did this when I was younger. I said my boyfriend emotionally abused me after I found out the signs of emotional abuse. Its offensive and rude to do that and I really regret ever thinking that. I was reading an excerpt from a book and a girl was saying she was raped twice, but in my view of it, she consented to having sex but later realized she was probably too immature and young to have had sex. Making claims like that could be detrimental to someone elses life who was trusting you with your consent. I know there arent black and white definitions of rape, but it just angers me to see people throw the word around instead of "I reget having sex when I was young."
