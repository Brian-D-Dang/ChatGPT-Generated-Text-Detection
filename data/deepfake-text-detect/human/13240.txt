Most people would be waiting to the last minute to check out their new power as soon as it manifested. I wanted to, but that would be at 3am and I had work in the morning. So reluctantly I slunk off to bed. Come morning, I tried to see what I had. My breasts were still small, I couldn't fly, and no matter how I flicked my wrists nothing came out. Was I a genetic defect? I resigned myself to the hope that I was adopted and my true power would manifest when my real birthday was passed. I showered, dressed, and hopped in my rust-colored DeLorean to go to work. Where I was the only one'of age' without some neat power. Carrie could cook the pizzas with her hands to get our orders out faster. Luke could increase the size of his hands to roll more dough. Jim could read customers minds to make suggestions and keep accurate orders. I..... could drive delivery. After teasing me mercilessly I finally got an order across town. I put my phone on mute so they wouldn't keep bugging me and then I set out. The backroads were a convoluted mess since schools were out, so I opted for the freeway. Traffic was tight but there were no slowdowns, so I had some fun speeding around big rigs and old ladies. Then I hit 88 miles per hour..... and I saw some serious shit. Literally, there was a septic truck stopped in my lane. I swerved around him but rear-ended a beetle that had stopped beside him. I barely had time to register what was going on as I flew out of my windshield. Always buckle up, kids. I hit the beetle and flipped over it, landed on its hood, then rolled to a stop some ways in front of it. As I'm laying and bleeding the beetle goes from 0 to 60 immediately and runs right over me. I hear the tires screeching and people yelling, but I can't understand them. I'm in shock. Why the hell would I need a power that stops time when I'm speeding? FML...
