17 years, and 364 days had passed since David's birth. I grew extremely anxious and stressed more than I ever could. What could be more stressful than never receiving your child's 18th year letter? David sat across the room. He was reading a Calvin and Hobbes comic. His father had left the day he was born, and I never knew why. But that never bothered David. The boy still adored going through his father's wares. Books, comics, video games, tools, DVDs, computers, clothes..... David studied his father more than anything in the world. I softly cleared my voice. "Davy, sweetheart, do you want some tea?" David didn't look up from the comic. "Sure thing momma. Can I have some green tea, with some milk and honey in it?" I always loved making tea for David. "Sure thing Davy." I reached for the cabinet with the tea when suddenly there was a knock at the door. "Davy can you get that?" "Yes momma." David ran to the door. Odd. David never ran to the door. He opened the door. "Davy sweetheart, how much sugar did you want?" The wind scratched the door on it's way in. "Davy?" I walked toward the door. I heard the door swing gently as the breeze pushed it open. I looked outside. Nothing. No car. No shoes. Just footprints from the grass. But they only pointed one way though, towards the porch. I saw a letter on the porch. And on it was David's handwriting. I opened it up and there was a small note inside, a key, and a flare. The letter read the following: "Dearest Momma. Daddy came by and needed my help. I knew this day would come so I wrote this letter ahead of time. I'm sorry I won't be having tea with you right now momma. But you can come see us. Head to Old Glimmer Road and get to that old shed with the lock. Open the lock with the key and head inside. Light the torch, with the door closed, and hold it in your right hand. Papa and I will be on the other side. Best of luck Momma. We'll be waiting for you there."
