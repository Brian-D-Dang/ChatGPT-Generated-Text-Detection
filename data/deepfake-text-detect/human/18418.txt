Every time I hear the Wilhelm scream (and it has been used in over 200 films) I am completely removed from the scene and sometimes even laugh at what might be a serious scene. Often it is used so unsubtly that it just reflects lack of effort from the director and it seems as if they are just trying to fit the scream into the film somewhere with no regard to what effect this has on the film. I understand that it is an "in-joke" but I believe that it is too widely recognized to be used any more without the audience acknowledging it.
