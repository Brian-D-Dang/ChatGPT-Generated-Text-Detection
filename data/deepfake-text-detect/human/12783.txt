Susu's mother was a junkie, She used to hit and swear, Their family had no money, And his father wasn't there, nbsp; Susu's mother's was a fuck up, She liked to shoot up smack, They never had maple syrup, Susu blamed herself for that, nbsp; One day on a subreddit, Her mom was a little wasted, She saw a prompt and read it, And then a gun she tasted, nbsp; Susu took the hunting rifle, And put it to her tongue, And all her tears were stifled, By the smell of her mom's blood, nbsp; When Susu pulled the trigger, And joined her mom in hell, She thought she'd become bigger, But left on earth just a bad smell.
