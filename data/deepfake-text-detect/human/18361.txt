The King should absolutely not have let that Horse Statue into our great city. I understand that his intentions were to please the Greeks, but I fail to see how we owe anything to them, they've been holding us on siege for ten years just a few days ago! Now, just to be clear, I don't have anything against the Greeks, but that statue is of such ugliness that it plagues our city. We have one of the nicest city in the world architecture wise, why must we endure the sight of that horse in our city? It was made from junk they found on the beach for Zeus' sake! It even smells like Greeks (no racism, let's face it, all Greeks have that particular scent to them)! Ugh, I can't take this, I'm off to getting drunk, in hopes of forgetting the presence of that piece of rotten wood in the middle of our beautiful central courtyard. Hello, people of the past. This is a footnote from the moderators of this 'internet forum'. I'm afraid to say that some wannabe scientist, while looking into time travel, has caused a temporal distortion field. It should dissipate in the next 24 hours. In the mean time, feel free to [message us] about a view you hold while you're visiting the present, and remember to have a look through [our rules] .
