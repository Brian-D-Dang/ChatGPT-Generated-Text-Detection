We'll stick with Wonga on this. People get angry about APR because it's so high, but no one ends up paying that much. Wonga actually show you exactly how much you'll pay back right from the start. Wonga say they don't let things get out of hand, and freeze the balance and work out a suitable repayment plan if things go wrong. Even if people ignore them, they freeze the balance after 60 days. It's a personal decision to take out a loan, and wonga isn't forcing you to do so. Loan shark seems to be a misused term to defend those who make bad decisions. Having said all this; people I tend to agree with on most stuff tend to hate these sites, so please have a go at changing my view!
