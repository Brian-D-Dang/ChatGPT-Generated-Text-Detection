The total amount of force one can apply by suction is 15-ish pounds per square inch provided by the ambient air pressure, and it doesn't translate well through a soft container such as a collapsing cyst. So if the cyst walls collapse then deeper material might remain in pockets. It's like trying to get all the sugar water out of a Capris Sun. No matter how hard you suck there's no getting it all. Meanwhile fingers can supply far more force. They can tell whether the material has been properly removed. And you can feel any irregularities. Additionally the internal structure of the cyst may be convoluted, so a blind force could rupture something by poking it or sucking good tissue into the nozzle. So vacuum is less effective, potentially damages more tissue, and provides less diagnostic information.... but it is cleaner.," "Because we don't know what is at the base that could be vacuumed out. There might be nerves, arteries, or other structures that could injure or kill the patient if they got vacuumed. If we can see it, we aren't going to blindly suction.
