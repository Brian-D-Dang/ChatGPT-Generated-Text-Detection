here's an example where a cable was cut by a low flying jet] (URL0),This is what happens when the brake fails: URL1', "Nothing. Most lift cables have redundant cables so if the main cable snaps, the redundant cables hold the weight. Except that since you are down one cable, the whole system comes to a halt and people have to be rescued because it is too dangerous to keep the lift moving without the redundant cables. Sure, if all cables snap (extremely rare), then you fall and might die, like the example from anomalouscowherd.... though that was caused by a jet, so shouldn't count.," "There are a lot of fail-safes involved, so nothing would likely happen other than the lift stopping and a long wait to get down. I saw a video one time of an older ski lift being pulled to it's max without any of the modern safeties as part of an experiment. When the cable let go there was destruction everywhere.,People die. Seriously though, the cars all fall down and people will get hurt, a great deal of work goes into making sure these cables do not break.
