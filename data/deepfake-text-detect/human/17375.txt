I'm not saying they have to be eligible for service on the front line or anything like that, but for hundreds of years women have been fighting for the right to be equal. I don't understand specifically why they don't have to sign up for it like American men have to when they turn 18. I think it's wrong to force men to sign up while their female counterparts don't have to worry about a draft being enacted. If they had to sign up, knowing men are biologically more physically gifted than women, I think we could make certain exceptions for them to work in offices, factories, and other parts of the military instead of putting them out into battle. Change my view.
