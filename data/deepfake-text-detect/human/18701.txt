I'm black, so here's some perspective. I'm mostly referring to pimps in modern day America. But also the sex trade around the world. People say Thailand has a pretty gruesome sex trade, but I don't think it's much worse than America's. In the 18th century, a slave worked sunup til sundown for no pay (rarely some pay, but even then very little). If they tried to run away, they were beaten savagely to break their spirit and keep them enslaved. In fact, even as children as soon as they come of age (4-7), they were whipped mercilessly just to teach them their place, that they were property to be bought and sold. In modern day America, the same thing happens to prostitutes. In 2014, slave owner will kidnap a girl, or take in a run away, and "pimp train" them. Which means constant rapes and beatings until she realizes that the only reason she exists is to have sex for money, 90-100 of which is owed to the slave owner. Some pimps pay their slaves a small portion, but most do not. And guess what happens if a slave tries to run from the life? They will be beaten and raped until they realize their is no escape, aka (Broken spirit). In 2014, if a whore tries to run from a pimp, he will view it as someone messing with his money. Because all the money she gets is his ultimately. See how I'm using pimp interchangeably with slave owner and prostitute interchangeably with slave and it makes sense? Yes, there are a few prostitutes that work for themselves and are in complete control.... but those are exceptions to a rule because they are so few. TL;DR. Pimps are slaveowners. Prostitutes are slaves. Black music that promote pimping is the same as 17th century white media that promotes slavery. US gov't should abandon the unproductive war on drugs and start a war on slavery instead. CMV.
