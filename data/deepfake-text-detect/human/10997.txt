There is a column in the [Straight Dope] (URL0) that discusses several of the theories already discussed, and concludes it came from the peso abbreviation 'ps' being written over each other. Relevant quote below: So much for the tomfoolery; now to get serious. Professor Cajori contends that the dollar sign is an abbreviation for "pesos." Bear in mind that the Spanish dollar, also known as the peso de 8 reales, was the principal coin in circulation in the U.S. up until 1794, when we began minting our own dollars.

The dollar sign and the PS abbreviation were used interchangeably from around 1775 until the end of the century, after which the latter faded from view. Professor Cajori backs up his argument with examples from manuscript, and I'm prepared to declare the matter settled.', " The most accepted hypothesis holds that the sign derives from the symbollic representation of the Pillars of Hercules - this representation can either have a banner separately around each pillar, or [as in the Spanish coat of arms] (URL1), a banner curling between them. It's basically from the Spanish coins.
