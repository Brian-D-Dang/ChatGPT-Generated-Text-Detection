As previously arranged by his father, Temujin married Borte of the Onggirat tribe when he was around 16 in order to cement alliances between their respective tribes. Soon after Borte's marriage to Temujin, she was kidnapped by the Merkits and reportedly given away as a wife. Temujin rescued her with the help of his friend and future rival, Jamukha, and his protector, Toghrul Khan of the Keraite tribe. She gave birth to a son, Jochi , nine months later, clouding the issue of his parentage. Despite speculation over Jochi, Borte would be Temujin's only empress, though he did follow tradition by taking several morganatic wives.
