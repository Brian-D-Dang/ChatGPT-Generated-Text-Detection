The host country thing has run its course. Organizing the Olympic games is financially ruinous, blatantly wasteful and the procedure favors corrupt regimes willing to put themselves on the map. Similar to the financial organization of the UN, all International Olympic Committee members should pay according to their ability. The Committee could invest in large stadiums that have an actual purpose after being used for the Olympic Games, namely, the next Olympic Games. Furthermore, and this is just speculation, this would allow Greece to reap the benefits of the economic surplus generated by the Games. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
