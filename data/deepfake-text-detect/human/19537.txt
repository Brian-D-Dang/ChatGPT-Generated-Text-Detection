What happened today was a tragedy. So far 3 people have died, and 150 are injured. I am getting sick of hearing people talk about how they are sad for the people finishing the race because finishing the Boston Marathon should have been such a great moment for them. I could not give a flying fuck about how their perfect race was ruined. An 8 year old child and two other people died today. I am pretty worked up about this so I know I may not be being fair to people who must clearly be traumatized or shocked as well. I just can't understand how people even care about how someones nice race memory was ruined when people have died.
