A Mexican startup called Biomitech has developed an artificial tree that it claims is capable of processing the same amount of air pollution as 368 living trees. Unlike trees, Biourban doesn't require many years to grow. The 14-foot metal tree uses microalgae that pulls carbon dioxide and other contaminants from the air, releasing pure oxygen as a byproduct. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 7 million people die from exposure to air pollution each year. Each artificial tree costs around 50,000 to construct, which might prevent the technology from spreading to areas where it is needed most. Another project from a German firm, Green City Solutions, uses vertically installed squares of moss cultures to achieve similar results.
