Really, it's not the '50s anymore. I know that switchblades were originally outlawed because they were a gangsters knife, something he could hide and whip out in a flash. However I can purchase a perfectly legal folding blade pocket knife thats far better than a switch blade and draw it just as fast without effort. Since we can already buy knives just as concealable as switch blades while being of far higher quality, we should be allowed to buy switchblades again. They're neat, nifty little knives that plenty of collectors would love to get. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
