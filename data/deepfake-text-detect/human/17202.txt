The primary difference between family relationships and non-family relationships (specifically, friends and romantic partners) is that family is supposed to mold you as a person, teach you the right way, and support you no matter what. Whether your family is your biological family or your adoptive family, that's their job. Yes, friends and lovers are nice, but they're not supposed to play such an essential and important role in your life. Yes, friends and lovers can make you feel nice and they can provide you with love, but their relationships to you are purely arbitrary. They don't have to be there for you, and often times, friendships and romantic relationships come to an end, and for a variety of reasons. Friends and lovers get into fights. Friends drift apart naturally. Lovers cheat. Either way, friends and romantic partners come and go, but you can't say the same about family. Now, obviously, if you don't have a supportive and loving family, then you need someone else to fill the role that your family should play. That could be friends or lovers, but it could also be teachers, neighbors, mentors or even coaches. But if you have the love and support of a family, you certainly don't need friends or a romantic partner. Yes, they're nice, but at the end of the day, they're luxuries, whereas the love and support of a family is a necessity.
