I believe people after a certain age people have to nothing to offer anyone and are only a burden on our health care and other strained resources. Also, Americans especially, should be forced to retire at later age. Real world examples of the elderly leeching off society can be seen in japan where the huge influx of older people is absolutely destroying their economic and political system, japan may as well be a necropolis (seriously graveyards in japan take up way too much space)! A similar belief I hold is that it should be legally required for parents who know their their child will have autism to be aborted. (Also no I am not fucking special after I'm 80 and need help pooping I'd off myself) Edit: Link to other deleted post 2nd Edit: To clarify some questions on a "Functional Age" I mean literally that when they can no longer support or care for themselves. Not as soon as their 80 they die.
