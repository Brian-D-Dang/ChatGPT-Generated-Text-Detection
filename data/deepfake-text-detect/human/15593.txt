My family has been attending or performing in shows at the Tuscany Theatre in conjunction with AYT since January 2014. We have been cast in two, helped backstage with one and simply attended another. Throughout, the experience has been very fulfilling not only for my daughter but also for myself and the rest of my family. AYT does a wonderful job truly making you feel like family. I can't see any reason why my family would go anywhere else. If you are looking for somewhere for a show or for your child to get involved, look no further. This is where you want to be!
