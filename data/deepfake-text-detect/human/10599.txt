the most important factor in how "foamy" a soda acts is which of its ingredients raise or lower surface tension. Aspartame promotes the formation and persistence of bubbles, as do certain preservatives. The combination of multiple foam-promoting ingredients and circumstance is why Diet Coke reacts so energetically with Mentos candy.','I know this! The answer is because sprite, unlike coke, contains citric acid, which lowers the surface tension of the fluid making foam less likely to forms and quicker to dissipate when it does. You can create this effect yourself with Coke or Diet Coke by pouring the beverage over a lemon wedge placed in the cup. The lemon oil and citric acid from the lemon prevent foaming.', "Well, that's because Coke needs an alcoholic beverage, as far as that russian explains: URL0," "It also has to do with how cold the beverage is. The bubbles are CO2, which are dissolved into the liquid and released as they're agitated or at nucleation points. The colder the liquid, the harder it is for the CO2 to come out of solution. Try it yourself, take two cans of coke, and put one in a cold fridge overnight and leave one at room temp. Then pour both into separate cups and observe the foam production.
