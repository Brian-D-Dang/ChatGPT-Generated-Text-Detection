I've seen bullying threads go this way on reddit all the time. It starts out with one person having (or bringing up a period where they did have) an issue with bullying, then people reply with, "You should just bully them back." Then it turns into a circlejerk about how terrible the school "no bullying" policies are, which is true, but that's aside from the point. I think it's wrong. Don't bully back. That's a terrible, hypocritical, and selfish thing to do. I don't know that guy. Maybe he's dealing with abuse at home and taking it out on me. Maybe he's insecure. There has to be a reason and odds are that beating him up verbally or physically is going to do him more harm than good. Yeah, he might stop bullying you, but what about others? What about the bully? The problem isn't being solved by doing that; it's just being passed to a different person. It's likely the case that they decided to bully you because you looked like you were lacking confidence. You seemed like an easy target. So it's easy to counter: be assertive. Act in a manner that implies that you're not afraid, that you're not submissive, and that you're not trying to attack them. Learning how to act and speak confidently will get you out of bullying much more painlessly than bullying back, and it's a much better life skill to learn. There might be something I'm not seeing. I feel my argument is concrete but I've never seen it done in action. I myself have never been bullied so I hold a lot of prejudice. I want to see other viewsat least so that I could understand that there's a bit of rationality behind the "bully back" argument. EDIT: Sorry for not being active; I had to sleep. Now I have school. I'll read all of the replies soon. EDIT 2: You did it, guys. You did it so well that now I hate my past argument. The delta was given to uMiPastaSuPasta, but it was a joint effort from the lot of you. His response just broke the ice. Thank you so much.
