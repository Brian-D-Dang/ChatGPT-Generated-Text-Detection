Does your dog eat exclusively dry food? If so, it is extremely dehydrating. I just looked up a random Pedigree dog food, and they list a max of 12 moisture, which means 88 of the food contains no moisture at all. Any liquids your dog is drinking is helping them digest their food and isn't necessarily hydrating them. Pet food companies will add salt to their food to encourage cats and dogs to drink more, but it often isn't enough to properly hydrate them. If your dog's urine is ALWAYS yellow and stinky, he is probably in a constant state of low-level dehydration.
