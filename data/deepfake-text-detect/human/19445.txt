Hi everyone, Being an eager reader, I have tried to read some books by Franz Kafka, but the thing is I have had a bad experience with him. Some years ago (I must have been around 15 yo), I read The Trial. It's been some time so my memories may be wrong but the overall thoughts I have over this book is that it was a sequence of confused, very absurd and unfair events. I am not saying I reject the idea of absurd, I really enjoy plays by Beckett or Ionesco. But here I thought that I had missed something, a meaning, or maybe I was too young for this. So, this summer, I dediced to give Kafka a second chance and I got myself a copy of The Metamorphosis. After a couple of chapters, I felt that I was not in the same mood as he was and I found the book (juding from the few chapters that I have read !) quite naive and not entertaining. Therefore, my relationship with Kafka is disappointing. This partly saddens me for I know there must be something that I did not grasp. But maybe I'm just not into it, the absurd and weird literature I mean. Go ahead and please change my view.
