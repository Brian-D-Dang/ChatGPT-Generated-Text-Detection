First called and delivery would take over 1 hour. Decided to dine in and no one was there to take my order. It took a couple minutes for someone to realize I was ready to order. (Apparently messing around in the back.) While waiting for the pizza someone was juggling pizza dough and tossing it from one person to another. Pizza was good but the flavored crust either sucked or wasn't applied. It was clean and pizza was ready really fast. My wife will probably go back but I will not.
