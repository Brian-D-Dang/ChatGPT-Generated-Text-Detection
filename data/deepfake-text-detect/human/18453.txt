Will Keith Kellogg's was a Seventh Day Adventist and created Frosted Flakes to prevent teenagers. I believe that's wrong and as such, we shouldn't condone this behavior by consuming Frosted Flake (or other products) I can't help but think about the teenagers's family reaction when they find out that the company who sewed their child's penis is now a successful and worldwide company. I also believe that it's hypocritical that their commercials and line of products are targeted towards children. Change my view! Edit: i'm busy at the moment, but i will reply to everyone.
