Im Australian. It really shocks me the way people will just accept what they're told without thinking about it. Statistically I have more of a chance of being struck by lightning than killed by a terrorist (the same goes for anyone else in a western country). If im afraid of terrorism I should be very very afraid of fast food and driving because its hundreds of times more likely that ill die from over-eating or in a car crash. I have a higher chance of being killed by a police officer than a terrorist (even if im innocent of any crimes) If you are afraid of terrorism its just because your fear is good business for the media and makes you easier to control for the govt and both those groups engage in constant fear-mongering. edit: More than [1 in 10 americans] think about the threat of terrorism on a weekly basis, and more people worry about terrorism than violent crime.
