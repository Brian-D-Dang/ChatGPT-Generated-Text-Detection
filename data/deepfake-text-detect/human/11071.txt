Konami is undergoing a restructuring, and will not be focusing on developing console games as their primary projects, favouring casinos and mobile game development instead. To this end, Kojima Productions has been liquidated. Kojima himself is still under contract to Konami, though it will not be renewed once The Phantom Pain is released. His name is being removed because his company has been liquidated, and Konami would rather have Metal Gear associated with them, than Kojima. People are likely to tell you it's one of Kojima's ruses, but the stocks plummeted in Konami after the news, projects have been cancelled, and dozens of people have lost their jobs. Konami have also begun hiring for future Metal Gear projects.
