A person who drinks or otherwise takes mentally altering substance does so knowing the effect of said substance on his decision making ability and that he may do something stupid and cause an accident. Just as a person who fires a gun is responsible for his bullet where-ever it hits, a man who drinks is responsible for his personal action what ever it maybe, the fact that a man didn't aim at a guy but hit him anyway or the fact that a guy was too drunk to know there is a guy in front of his car, should not stop him from being responsible. It is a person's choice to drink thus all consequences from said drinking (or taking whichever drug) should be on him and running people over and then getting probation because "I was drunk lol" is utterly stupid.
