When you're watching a scene and the camera moves, say left to right for example; The stuff that's closer to the camera will move faster than the stuff that's further away. They use the speeds of all the different objects to put them on separate layers. The slower the movement, the further away they put the layer. This is called parallax URL0 They then use some method of getting different images to your right and left eye. Your right eye will get each layer shifted a little to the right closer stuff being shifted more. Your left eye will get stuff shifted a little left with closer stuff being shifted more. Your brain stitches this together as three dimensional information. I have a TV that can do this in real time, it's pretty crazy but works well. edit The shift may actually be backwards a little left for the right and right for the left now that I think about it.
