Denying someone who is over-educated and over-qualified for a position is like denying someone with a perfect SAT score and a great GPA entrance into a Community College. Sometimes people fall on hard times and need a job just to sustain them while they search elsewhere. If a master's degree holder needs a secretary position for a while, why should they be denied consideration for that job in favor of someone with less experience? This is only true in situations where the applicant knows that they are over-qualified.
