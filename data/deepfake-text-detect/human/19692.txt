Fairtax is a system that replaces federal income taxes including personal, estate, gift, capital gains, alternative minimum, Social Security, Medicare, self-employment, and corporate taxes with a single tax paid by end-users for retail goods. Current estimates put the rate at about 23 inclusive (30 exclusive) on goods sold in the US. This makes the actual cost of taxes more apparent because a substantial portion (22) of the price of retail goods is taxes rolled in at various parts of its manufacture and transport. Additionally it provides a prebate equal to the taxation level present at the poverty level, effectively zeroing out taxes for people at the poverty level and providing a negative tax for anyone below it. Currently the poverty level for a 2 adult 2 child household is 31020, so that household and those like it would receive an annual prebate amount of 7135 or 595 a month. Used goods are not taxed, nor are goods transferred business to business before sale. a huge number of objections are handled [here] and they make a very good argument for it being progressive, better for lower income earners and families, more difficult to find loopholes in, and frees up a tremendous amount of human capital by getting rid of nonsense like tax preparation services and the like. This system may not be perfect but there is no such thing as perfect. I believe it is a superior system for the United States compared to what we have now, the loophole-filled 73,000 page US federal tax code that was written by lobbyists for big business. Change my view.
