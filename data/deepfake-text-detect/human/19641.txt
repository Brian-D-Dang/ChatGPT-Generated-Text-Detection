So in the game of poker, the only way to get a straight while holding an ace would be an A, 2, 3, 4, 5, or a 10, J, Q, K, A. This provides a little bit of frustration in the gameplay because the ace is the only card that does not allow for an open ended straight. For instance, a straight could not be achieved by having a Q, K, A, 2, 3. The argument I could foresee coming up would be that since the ace is the highest card in poker, making it the it the lowest card in a straight does even it out a bit. For instance, if the flop shows a 2, 3, 4, 5, then a 6 would be more beneficial than an A whereas 6 is not as valuable of a card otherwise. That may be the reason for this rule, but I doubt it. Anyone want to shed some information and CMV? edit: Two users have given great counter-arguments that have indeed changed my view. I have awarded deltas to both.
