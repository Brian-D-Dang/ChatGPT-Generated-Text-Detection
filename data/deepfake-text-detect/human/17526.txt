Our modern society (Canada, but I'm talking about the western world, in general) is getting easier to live in, but at the same time, this means that we must live increasingly sedimentary lives. We do less with our time and less with our days, for the sake of "ease," and doing things not because we want to do things but because we feel that we have to do things. We get up to work to get money for our cars, so that we can have cars to go to work with. It would appear that we no longer grow as a society because we are becoming increasingly locked in a pattern of tediousness - and the human species is suffering for it. People are markedly becoming less intelligent, quite evidently becoming less healthy (probably partly due to our sedentary lifestyles), and most definitely becoming lazier.
