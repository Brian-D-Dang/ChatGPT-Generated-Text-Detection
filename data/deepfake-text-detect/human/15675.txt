Mid range restaurant in Aria Resort that is kid friendly. (Not screaming loud kids, but well behaved children were tolerated) I expect Vegas to be pricey so I wasn't too suprised to find the bill coming up to 350 for 6 people. What am I surprised with was the level of service. Our waiter seemed to be having a bad night the whole time he was serving us. No'thank-you's', no smile and anytime we asked for anything, it seemed as if we were cutting into his standing around time. Most of the items on the menu ranged from bland to good, but the stand outs were: Atlantic Cod - served with a salsa verde sauce, clams, asparagus, green peas and hardboiled egg. Even the picture looks great. Steamed Mussels - served with shallots and garlic. The mussels were a bit on the small side, but still flavorful.
