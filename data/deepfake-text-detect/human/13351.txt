Day 3: First entry I don't know where to begin. I had been working for a secret agency for the last five years. Myself and thirty or so other men. Three days ago, each of us were escorted into the wilderness - individually. We were blindfolded soon after we were taken, so I don't have a clear idea of where I exactly am. All I know is that we're on our own. Thirty separated into ones. I've spent the last days building a shelter. They left me in the woods, stranded, with a small backpack barely filled with supplies. This is the last thing I've found in it, along with a dull pocket knife, a canteen water bottle, a pen and some thin string, which I've been using for snares. When I was recruited for this project, I thought I would be helping humanity. Working towards a greater good. But now, now I see what this corrupt government is really like. Taking us men and using us as test subjects. Treating us like rats in a cage. I know they're watching me. I can feel it. But I can play this game. I know I can survive. I know. Day 7307 (or so) I feel like I'm going insane. I don't know if they're still there or not. Watching me. Testing me. Maybe they've forgotten I still exist. Maybe they've forgotten I'm still alive. Perhaps it wasn't an experiment after all. I don't know why I still have hope. Why I've been writing all this time. Perhaps it's the last thing I have to hold on to. If anyone reads this, please know I'll be gone long before you've discovered it. I've learned a few things in the time I've been here. I've learned humanity is cruel and the bushes are as well. My pen is running out. I can't find clean water. My knife has no edge to it and my stomach is empty. Except I still have snare string. I can make it thick enough, and the branches here are sturdy. Perhaps this was a test to see how long I can withstand this vast, solitary cruelty.... Well, you have your answers now. Tonight I'll be gone.
