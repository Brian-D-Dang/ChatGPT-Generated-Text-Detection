It is easier to show premeditation when you kill a LEO. Tough to claim something else happened given most scenarios with police confronting the soon to be murderer. It also is more likely that such an act brings more public outcryscrutiny (and more emotional investment from the prosecutor's office) which reduces the possibility for plea deals that take execution out of the equation.,The state of New York divides murder into degrees. The killing of a police officer in the line if duty is one way to be charged with First Degree Murder, the most serious offense. Therefore, a cop killer is more likely to receive the death penalty.
