Let's escape our prejudices by looking at Christmas as if it were some other social program like a subject in school, since it affects children: Kringle Studies. In Kringle Studies the teachers lie to the students because it's cute and fun. KS teaches kids to be either religiously submissive or crassly materialistic. The lies of Kringle Studies cause seasonal suicide. And if anyone criticizes Kringle Studies there's a special word for that kind of trouble-maker: "scrooge." And we all hate scrooges, don't we kids? I fully oppose Christmas. Change my view.
