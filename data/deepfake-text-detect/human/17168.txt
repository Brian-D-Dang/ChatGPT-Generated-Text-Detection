I want to firstly put out there that I believe diversity is one of the greatest strengths of America. That being said, I believe trying to force diversity actually hurts rather than helps our society. A couple of my reasons for believing so are as follows In the case of college admissions, lowering the bar for admissions for specific groups of students hurts the academic quality of the institution and is unfair to those who worked harder and excelled in extracurriculars. Studies have shown that students who have benefited from affirmative action graduate at a lower rate than those who have not. In workplaces there are similar consequences. Someone less qualified may get a job, simply to meet a quota. Skill and productivity should be the prevailing factors not gender or race. It continues rhetoric that some groups require special treatment to succeed and continues discriminatory ideas that are still prevalent in our society. Lasty Executive Order 10925, signed by President John F. Kennedy on March 6, 1961, required government contractors to "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin." By affording denying fair treatment to some and affording special treatment to others aren't we going against what Kennedy said? Thanks in advance for all your responses. P.S. It's late and I'm tired as I type this, so if anything may need rewording or clarification please let me know.
