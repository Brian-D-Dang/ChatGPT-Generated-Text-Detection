Our civilization today is almost entirely dependent on petroleum for energy, materials and the sheer scale in which we operate. If the oil runs out, we will have nothing- no feasible backup source of energy, nothing to build today's miracle materials like plastics and composites with. Rare earth metals will run out within 20 years. Significant parts of our technology are based on rare earths, and like petroleum, we have no alternatives. With the increasing connections and interconnections that are essential for our survival, the failure of a few links would not be very significant. However, if multiple catastrophes that affect different levels of the supply chain due to different reasons occur together, the results will be disastrous. One of the examples I read about says that if China gets really screwed up and stops rare earth metals supply to the outside world (they account for 95 of the production), we will suddenly have a electronics production shortage. If that happens to combine with a petroleum supply issue, we will have a major economic disaster. Of course, this might be simplifying a lot of issues, but my core issue still stands: if a perfect storm of problems happen, we are screwed. We have had massive civil unrest and economic problems like the Great Depression for far smaller issues. I think if our resources run out, we will be caught unprepared. Hello, users of CMV!
