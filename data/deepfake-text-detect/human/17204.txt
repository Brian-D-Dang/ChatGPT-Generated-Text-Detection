I'm not on the anti-vaccine bandwagon. I've had probably a dozen or more vaccines and their boosters (I presume the normal ones like Hepatitis and Tetanus, whooping cough etc), but my mother definitely didn't push for a flu vaccine when they were made available maybe when I was 17, and she didn't get one, and I therefore didn't get one. There have been numerous occasions where I could get them for free (I'm not even too sure if they cost anything here in Australia), but now I don't feel like getting one. I believe that because the flu is changing every year, it makes no certainty that I won't get one next year (not that I often get the flu anyway). Maybe I'm misinformed, but I don't really see a reason to get the flu vaccine, even whilst (obviously) supporting the vaccines for the famous diseases (smallpox and what have you).
