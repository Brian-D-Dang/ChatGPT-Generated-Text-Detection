I just finished reading George Orwell's "1984" since high school (and I sparked-noted most of it then). After reading it I have become much more suspicious of our government. With the firearm legislation that Obama is trying to enact and legislation like CISPA and the Patriot Act (legislation that takes advantage of modern technology like the internet), I think that the U.S. is slowly morphing into an "Oceania" like state.
