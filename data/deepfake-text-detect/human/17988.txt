My reasoning is as follows: Imagine you are in a room. You want to approach a retain wall and touch it. Easy, right? No. Let's take a look at what you are doing here, using some simple Pythagoras: 1.) In transversing the distance between A (you) and B (the wall), you are crossing a midsection, C. 2.) AC is 12 the length of AB (see definition of midpoint) 3.) After C has been crossed, a new midpoint is created between you and the wall, D. 4.) CD is 12 the length of CB, ergo, CD is 14 AB 5.) Repeating ad nauseam 3 and 4, we notice that the distance between the midpoint and the wall B continues the become smaller. 6.) As you cannot attain 0 through dividing a real number by a real number (excluding 0), you will never reach B (the wall). 7.) Ergo, change is change is impossible because movement is impossible. QED CMV, followers of Heraclitus. Hello, people of the past. This is a footnote from the moderators of this 'internet forum'. I'm afraid to say that some wannabe scientist, while looking into time travel, has caused a temporal distortion field. It should dissipate in the next 24 hours.
