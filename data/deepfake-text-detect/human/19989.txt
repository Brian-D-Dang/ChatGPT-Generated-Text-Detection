To me, it seems like it's just another form of entertainment. After being able to learn how to read in general, I see no reason to read the Oedipus Cycle or The Catcher in the Rye. The morals of these books could be shown through movies and TV shows so why is this any different? Studies show that people that read more in their free time have higher GPAs and SAT scores but I think that's just correlation and not causation because people who read on their free time probably don't have the most action-packed social life so they have more time to study. Why is reading different than watching a movie?
