Here's how it is: Earth got used up, so we terraformed a whole new galaxy of Earths, some rich and flush with new technologies, some not so much. Central Planets, them as formed the Alliance, waged war to bring everyone under their rule; a few idiots tried to fight it, among them myself. I'm Malcolm Reynolds, captain of Serenity. She's a transport ship, Firefly class. Got a good crew: fighters, pilot, mechanic. We even picked up a preacher for some reason, and a bona fide companion. There's a doctor, too, took his genius sister from some Alliance camp, so they're keeping a low profile, (you understand). You got a job, we can do it, don't much care what it is.,'If your favorite old western and your favorite sic-fi were to have a baby...it would be Firefly.', "Browncoats are the rebels (Kinda like in Star Wars!). The Alliance are the bad guys (Think Empire form Star Wars). Almost everyone aboard the Firefly Serenity are the good guys (don't wanna spoil anything:P). personally, I find Captain Reynolds (That's Nathan Fillion's character) crew to be more of the Anti-hero of the show.
