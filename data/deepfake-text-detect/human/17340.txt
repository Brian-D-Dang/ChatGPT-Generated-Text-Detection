I am a Marine Biology graduate student who thought it would be really exciting to study coral reefs. I am in a class that reads published articles, brings an additional and discusses the topic. Coral reef study is depressing. We know next to nothing about them, how they function and even less about their zooxanthellae. No matter what changes we make, it has already been calculated that by 2050 (even if we stop CO2 emissions TODAY) coral reefs as we know it will be gone. I get that understanding them will help us preserve our fisheries for the moment, but what about after? No matter what plan is implemented, its too late. Hello, users of CMV!
