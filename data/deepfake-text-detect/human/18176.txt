RISK is nothing more than a game in which players slowly collect cards and try outlast their opponents just long enough to cash in those cards in exchange for a massive army they can use to run the table in a final push toward victory. By the time the game reaches this point, the outcome is nearly inevitable, draining any suspense out of the game. Moreover, the "last man standing" format means that players who come in 3rd, 4th, or 5th place are forced to idly sit on the sidelines before the game is even over. This adds up to an experience that is not inclusive nor engaging, which strongly favors "luck of the draw" over any real strategic thinking. I know that RISK has many fans out there. Please change my view.
