The analysis and quantification of sequence complexity is an open problem frequently encountered when defining trajectory prediction benchmarks. In order to enable a more informative assembly of a data basis, an approach for determining a dataset representation in terms of a small set of distinguishable prototypical sub-sequences is proposed. The approach employs a spatial sequence alignment, which enables a following learning vector quantization (LVQ) stage. A first proof of concept on synthetically generated and real-world datasets shows the viability of the approach.
