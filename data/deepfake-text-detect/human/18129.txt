I believe that only having two parties is grossly polarizing the United States and horribly messing up our ability to govern ourselves as a country. You either lean left or right, but if your beliefs land somewhere in the middle (which most peoples' tend to) you have to choose the lesser of two evils. Politicians can no longer really be "Moderate" and it's borderline scandalous if they don't vote along party lines. I think we'd have a better time of it if we had 3 or 4 (or even 5) parties to choose from, so that everyone's views could be better represented on the political spectrum.
