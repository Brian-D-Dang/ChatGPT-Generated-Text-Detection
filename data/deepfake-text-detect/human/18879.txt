I have a borderline hate of japanese things which includes anime. I have friends that live by anime, but I've never understood it. One of my friends "forced" me to watch a few episodes of Soul Eater, and I did not find that entertaining at all. I really did not find the style very redeeming, nor the story. I simply cannot agree with someone that anime is at all worth watching. It has no redeeming value to me. Also, the culture that comes with anime. I really don't like the people that associate with anime. The people (in my school) who are watchers of anime fall intoto simply put itthe "loser" category. Honestly, I also believe that products of japan, whether they be books, shows, cars, games, or even foods, are inferior to their Western counterparts. I will not buy a japanese car nor watch a japanese show nor play a japanese game. Edit: I guess I sound like an idiot now. Thanks for replying. I feel like I came off a little harsh, too. I'm sorry if I made anyone mad. My ignorance of a whole culture has spiraled out of control. I may have spent too much time over in rpropaganda (joking)
