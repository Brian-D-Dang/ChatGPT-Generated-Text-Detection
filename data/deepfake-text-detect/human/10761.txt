It wouldn't help. The suction would basically force the bird through the grate, causing it to be sliced to pieces like if you stomped a piece of cheese through a shower drain. Jet engines are powerful.," "My brother, who works in aerospace, told me that screen-like coverings would affect the air intake and cause turbulence, which could not be handled by the engines. Apparently, the way the engines are designed, they are very sensitive to that type of disturbance. Don't ask how it wouldn't be affected by changes in pressure, wind direction or other variables, since I wouldn't know. Hope that helps!
