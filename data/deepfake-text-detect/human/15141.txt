The worst Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh! The taste is ok, but not worth the price at all, neither the taste nor the amount. I'd rather go to Oriental Express or any other fast food to get a moderate Chinese food with cheaper price. I've been here several times with friends, nothing impressive, and the last visit was the least favored. The Lamb Kebab is really, really just a few bite.... and it taste like fried, not roast on fire.... I would like to pay only half the price, or even less for it...The Xinjiang Style Chicken was not in so large amount as the menu says (serves two), and it is the least authentic Xinjiang Style Chicken I've ever got (and much worse than the one I cooked) I never try their Sushi, seems much better than it's Chinese.
