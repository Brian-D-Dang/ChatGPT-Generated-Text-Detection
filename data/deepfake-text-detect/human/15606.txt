I came here during the Mtl a table festival, a festival that allows foodies to try out new restaurants at a fraction of the price. I was looking forward to this since I've been here before but only to have a drink. I started out with the bison tartare which was very tasty. It's after that that things started to deteriorate. We waited 45 minutes for our main course and when I spotted the waitress with our dishes I said to my friend that we're finally going to eat. Since she was facing the kitchen she said that she hoped not since those plates have been sitting next to the bar for quite a while. Sure enough, those were our plates. My osso bucco was still warm, but she said that her fish was a bit cold. Because we were so famished she didn't say anything. Speaking of my osso bucco, it was bland. There was no seasoning at all. Disappointing. I was really looking forward to the dessert since I love anything sweet. My pudding chomeur consisted of a dry white cake with caramel on top. The cake was so dry that the caramel couldn't even moisten it, which is what it's supposed to do. I've had a better pudding chomeur at rotisserie St-Hubert. Because this was during the Mtl a table festival, I paid a set price of 39 for my food. At that price, I felt that it was slightly overpriced for what I got. However had I went any other time, the same meal would've cost me 54?! That's just insane. There are better and cheaper options nearby. Another thing; there are a couple of reviews that mention the loudness of the music. I have to agree with them. Is it necessary to blast music at 6pm? People are eating and we can barely carry on a conversation. Raise the volume at 10pm, but prior to that keep it low.
