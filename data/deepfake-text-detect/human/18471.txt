Note: I'm not German. I don't speak German. I have no particular ties to Germany. After WWII, it became a big no-no for Germans to express patriotism for their country. This cultural value continues in Germany to this day - as you may have seen if you saw that GIF of Merkel taking the German flag away from a guy on stage and discreetly handing it to someone off stage. I have met many Germans, above the age of forty, who do not think that it is appropriate for Germans to show patriotism. I think this is bullshit. WWII ended almost seventy years ago. I know that the Nazis were horrible and the Holocaust is one of the most important moments in human history, but come on already. It's been long enough, I think Germans should be proud of today's Germany, and they should be allowed to show their patriotism. American politicians wear the American flag all the time, and I'm sure John Boehner has a bald eagle tattooed on his penis. Today's Germany has one of the strongest economies in the European Union (if not the strongest), while at the same time having numerous environmental-friendly laws and encouraging alternative energy like wind - not to mention, Germany has universal health care! It has a great education system! Despite all these things, if I were to talk to a German person and say "Hey, let's fly the German flag on a pole attached to your house, like we do here in America with the American flag," I'd get a big disapproving look. I think this is dumb! CMV.
