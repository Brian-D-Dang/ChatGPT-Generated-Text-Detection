1) They enjoy each others company (smokes, runs, meechum) 2) They are completely honest about themselves and about what they do (open relationships) 3) They are open to each other's ideas. (constant communication all over the series) 4) They support each other on their goals (tricia manipulation, fundraisers) 5) They respect the decisions each other makes (open relationships, Claire not backing Peter Russo bill, Claire coming out on rape, abortion) 6) There is no pettiness, no jealousy, no lies, no manipulation (All over the series) 7) They trust each other entirely. (Meechum, open relationships) 8) They understand the needs of the other and don't stand on the way of the other, unless it's explicitely something that will go into confilct with what they're after. (Claire's funding from Sancorp Vs Pushing the two congressmen to support Peter Russo's bill) 9) When big differences arrive, they do what they feel its right, and once it's been solved they don't look back. (Claire goes to Adam, Frank doesn't question it) There are many others, that's off the top of my head. CMV.
