So.... although I was celebrating my 25th in Vegas..... and it was my first time- I have to say that I had a great time and I didn't stay on the strip. The staff is great and we were greeted with a smile and 2 warm cookies! There is a shuttle that runs to the MGM every hour- so that was quite helpful! Saved me and the BF about 60 in taxi fares. It'll run about 20 from the strip back to the D.T. They have an applebee's on site- pretty cool.... especially when you don't want to pay to go anywhere.... Although they did have a cafe in the lobby..... I didn't get a chance to check it out. Anywho- they have a nice workout room and small pool..... for the price and convienence- not bad at all!
