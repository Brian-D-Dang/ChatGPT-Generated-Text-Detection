I think that cigarettes and chewing tobacco should be outlawed. There are no positive benefits whatsoever. Smokers say its relaxing, but have you ever seen one stressing because they need a smoke but ran outcant leave to smoke at the moment etc, so if it is relaxing, it also adds to stress. Not to mention it's relaxing because it's a form of self fulfilling effect. It is relaxing because their body wants those chemicals, and they are giving it to the body. All the unhealthy effects are well known, I'm not going to list all them. It pollutes the enviroment. All the chemicals in the smoke, and the filters.... how many smokers actually throw away the cigarette butts. I am sure 95 of them just flick them on the ground.... look around outside anyplace where people go on smoke breaks. They are everywhere, blowing around, getting in the water, and animals eat them. Im sure the main counterpoint to this is going to be "how can you or the government tell me what I can do with my body and health..." They already do though. They pass laws all the time because they say it's for our own good. Seatbelt laws for one example. The only person you hurt by not wearing one is yourself, but they make that a law. They have laws about what toxins and chemicals can be in our bug sprays, paint, and food, so it isn't like they dont already do that. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
