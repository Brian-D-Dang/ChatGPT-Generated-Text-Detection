There's no denying that the Bellagio is just a beautiful casino. However, there isn't much to offer to the younger crowd. They now have a club, but it's rarely crowded as the casino originally wasn't geared towards the younger audience or children. Because of this, it's more of a place to just walk through once or twice instead of somewhere to stay.
