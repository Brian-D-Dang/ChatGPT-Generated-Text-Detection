Just as it is a crime to knowingly infect someone with HIV, it should be a crime to gamble with the life of a child. If both mother and father carry copies of an autosomal recessive gene that causes a deadly, incurable disease, their offspring have a 25 chance of dying of the disease. Children who are born with conditions such as Alper's disease, cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs, and spinal muscular atrophy type I, typically suffer their entire lives, and then die painfully as young children. I believe that if a couple is willing to gamble with the life of their child, they should be willing to gamble with their freedom.
