So we currently tax people based on how much they earn. I think this is wrong, as the free market means that high earners tend to be people whose work is very beneficial to society and, furthermore, it makes people less likely to aspire to high earning careers. I think instead, jobs should be separated into different bands of usefulness, and the more useful someone's band is to society, the lower the percentage of their income we should take from them. Here are the bands, from best to worst: 1) The Advancers: people whose work pushes back the barriers on human progress. Examples include engineers, scientists, doctors, programmers and software engineers. 2) The Thinkers: people whose work, if not advancing humanity, adds to the enjoyment and meaning of life. Examples include good musicians, directors and authors. 3) The Enforcers: people who, while not improving it, keep society running. Examples include policemen, firemen, soldiers, lawyers and garbagemen. 4) The Passive Benefactors: people who don't contribute to societal improvement, but don't harm it either, and work regular jobs. Examples include waiters, baristas, retail employees and sports pros. 5) The Destroyers: people whose work harms society. Examples include certain religious preachers, gangster rappers and reality show celebrities.
