The entire process is a bit screwed up- you go to a store, you buy your pet (whether from a pet store or a shelter), and you lock it in your house until it loses the will to run away or develops Stockholm syndrome. I'd even go so far as to say "If you love him so much, why aren't you sharing your food instead of feeding him gloop out of a can?" You'd never treat an actual family member the way you'd treat a dog or a cat, so why imply they are one? I saw [this post] on the front page, and it bothered me. It's creepy. I'm not saying don't have pets- I have pets. I just recognize that I own them and am not their dad, big brother, or whatever other weird term pet owners use.
