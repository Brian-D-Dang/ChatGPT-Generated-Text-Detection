Your mind encodes your memories. Obviously, it won't remember everything, but various significant or trivial events can be stored for a long period of time under the right circumstances. Sleep, emotions, and food can affect your memory. I have vivid memories of childhood nightmares and a couple flashbulb memories of my infancy and toddlerhood. However, I can't remember a single thing that my professor is saying as I type this.... Some crap about Excel, I think. Anyways, everything you've forgotten, all of your lost memories, are all events that weren't encoded properly. That's why your mind can't retrieve them. Childhood memories get nailed in because of emotional or subconscious experiences at the time that made them feel significant. Side note: there's plenty of ways to enhance your memory, but I won't explain it all here since it's a Google search away.:) TL;DR: Feed your mind so that it shall feed you.,As time goes on you will lose exact details of events especially if they weren't that important. The "false" feeling you get is your brain unsure and attempting to fill in the blanks!
