A completely pointless poem. THE WHITE ROOM HE WOKE UP, IN A WHITE ROOM, WITH A WOLF PUP, AND NO ELBOW ROOM. THE ROOM HAD VINES, AND A SPIDER, HE HAD TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES, HE WAS IN A SUPERCONDUCTING SUPERCOLLIDER AND AS HIS MENTAL STATE DEGRADED, HE SAID SOME THINGS NOT TOTALLY UNRELATED HE SAID SHIT, AND HE SAID FUCK, HE SAT THERE COGITATING IN THE MUCK AND THEN HE ATE A COUNTERFEIT DOUBLE KNIT BANANA SPLIT. WHAT A HYPOCRITE. AND THEN HE SAW A GREAT BIG FIG, HE PREPARED TO DIG A HOLE IN HIS DAZZLING RIG, TO AVOID THE GUINEA PIG HE DUG ALL THE WAY TO AUSTRALIA. THE DESERT LAND OF MARSUPIALIA. BUT THEN HE WAS SUED, FOR ALL OF THESE RHYMES, PEOPLE SAID HE WAS LEWD, HE SHOULD DO HIS TIME, SO EVEN THOUGH HE HAD COMMITTED NO CRIME HE WAS WHISKED AWAY, SOME SAID IN THE NICK OF TIME HE WENT TO MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON, BUT AFTERWARDS HE FELT NEWLY ARISEN, HE JOINED THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION. HE FOUGHT A BEAST, IN BERKSHIRE EAST HE WENT SOUTH-EAST, TO ANCIENT GREECE HE RODE A RAPID, IN MAR DEL PLATA HE ACTED LIKE QUITE THE PERSONA DE GRATA HE FLEW FROM THE ISLAND OF GOTLAND TO THE KINGDOM OF SCOTLAND HE DRANK CHAMPAGNE IN THE LAND OF SPAIN HE WENT FOR A 200 MILE DRIVE IN AREA 45 HE BECAME THE PROPAGANDIST FOR POPE FRANCIS THEN HE HAD TO ASK FOR SOME CANVAS TO MAKE A TENT, FOR HE WAS HUNGRY IT WAS ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH LENT, IN THE COUNTRY OF HUNGARY ALL HE WANTED WAS MEAT, HE FELT LIKE A MONKERY EATING HIS WHEAT, HE HAD A LAPAROSCOPERY
