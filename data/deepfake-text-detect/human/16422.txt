In this paper, new results on convolution of spectral components in binary fields have been presented for combiatorial sequences. A novel method of convolution of DFT points through Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is presented which has lower complexity as compared to known methods of spectral point computations. Exploring the inherent structures in cyclic nature of finite fields, certain fixed mappings between the spectral components from composite fields to their decomposed subfield components has been illustrated which are significant for analysis of combiner generators. Complexity estimations of our CRT based methodology of convolutions in binary fields proves that our proposed method is far efficient as comparised to to existing methods of DFT computations for convolving sequences in frequency domain.
