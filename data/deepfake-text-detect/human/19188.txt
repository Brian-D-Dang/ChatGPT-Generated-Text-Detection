Edit: got rid of the caps, made me seem angry: I always hear "we're raising money for breast cancer" or please donate to (some illness or situation for humans charity) but I never hear "we're raising money for the protection of the wilderness of Canada" or something along those lines. Humans are overpopulated. We do not need more of them surviving and living through things that are normal things to die from. I get the whole "think of how they feel" but think how our ancestors will feel in the future when their population is slowly destroyed bit by bit by storms and lacks of proper resources. Not only that but other animals starve to death and have disabilities. And not only that but its necessary for other species (including plants) to survive in order for us to survive. Everything on this planet has to deal with trauma. It's not just us. We are destroying the planet we live on but we aren't doing enough about it, while people donate to charities that have the best sob story or make you feel pity the most. All those charities are just hypnotizing everyone to think that those are the things that need to be changed with thoughts like "I'm only spending for myself lately, let's help others" when really that's a nice thought they don't help others in the right way imo. anyway, please share your thoughts and CMV:)
