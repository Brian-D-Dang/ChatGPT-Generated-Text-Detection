Fins, Gyros, and Thrust Vectoring. Fins are what you'd expect: They are on the outside of the missile, and redirect the flow of air. Gyros are internal and can induce rotational force on the missile. Thrust Vectoring doesn't change the rocket motor position, but it does redirect the exhaust. Combined, these systems give missiles a large degree of control and ways to follow the instructions on the guidance computer.,If you want to understand the gyros, Google the "wheel tied to rope" experiment, then follow that with "Boats with cylinders for sails" Spinning things produce a directional force perpendicular to the spin. So spinning a thing on the axis produces either an or v force (depending on the direction spun) It's a pretty incredible bit of physics. It can push things in a direction easily with no wind required, so the fins hold the missile in a direction, and the gyros spin to steer it (otherwise up might not be up, if the fins didn't guarantee a position.)
