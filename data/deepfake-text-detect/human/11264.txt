China blocked Wikipedia in April, using DNS injections to prevent its citizens from accessing the encyclopedia. There has been no official statement as to why the website was blocked. In May 2017, China put forth plans for making its own encyclopedia with over 300,000 articles from 20,000 scholars. Other countries such as Turkey, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela have also blocked access to Wikipedia in the past.
