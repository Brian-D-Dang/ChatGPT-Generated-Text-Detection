GREAT selection of local beer, good food, trendy and semi-classy, loud live music that kills conversation and packed. If you are looking to go out with friends for a drink and a live band and don't care about conversation, this is a great place. The set up is cool, the band plays behind the bar, but that makes it really hard to talk to the bartender. They have A LOT of beers on tap and I was impressed by their selection of local brews. They even had a few THAT Brewery beers which I can't recall seeing anywhere else. Another good feature is that the kitchen is open late and the food is very good, it's much better then typical bar food.
