Dj shai was an amazing dj at my Wedding. I was nervous having a dj for such a small wedding (30ish people) inside dal toro restaurant Inside the palazzo. But I'm so glad I did! He kept the night going PERFECT! He met with us before to make sure to cater the service around our preferences! He seemed very passionate and super knowledgable about how the night should go when I was clueless!. Dj shai was AMAZING without him my wedding would not have been half as good as it was.
