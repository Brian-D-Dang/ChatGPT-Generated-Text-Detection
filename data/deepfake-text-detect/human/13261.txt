"Yeah, someone bet that I wouldn't suck Brendon's dick. So I sucked his dick." "Who bet you?" Danielle's eyes narrowed. "Brendon." Danielle shook her head and half smiled, "Sounds to me like Brendon paid you to suck his dick." "Nah," Jimmy shifted uncomfortably "it was a bet." "Ok Jimmy." Danielle spoke softly and grinned, "And what about Toby?" "What about him?" Jimmy asked defensively. "He's..." Danielle began. "He's my best friend!" Jimmy's voice cracked slightly as he spoke. "He's with us right now Brandon! on our "date Danielle made air quotes as she looked over at the quite face of the guy sitting next to Jimmy, "You held his hand all the way through the movie." "Horror films make him anxious," Jimmy blushed as he buried his head in a menu. "Shall we order some food?" "You know, I think I'm going to call it a night." Danielle unfolded her coat from the back of her chair and stood up, "I guess I'll see you Monday Jimmy." Jimmy looked up at her, with a mixture of wonder and defeat. "Ok, sure Danielle, see you soon."
