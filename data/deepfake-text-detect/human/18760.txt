When WW2 started, America was in one of the worst depressions in history. World War 2 saw nearly every country in Europe involved in orgies of war and America suddenly found itself benefiting as the salesman for every side (including the Axis Powers). The USA didn't enter the war because of Hitler, nor the Holocaust, nor Italy, nor the crimes against humanity committed by Japan. Contrary to popular beliefs that Pearl Harbor pulled the USA screaming and kicking into the war, America was starting to fear the fall of Asia to Japan means the Eastern market would be closed off to America. There has been new evidence showing that CongressFDR was looking for ways to justify a war with Japan. America's interest in the Pacific Islands and Asia was at stake if Japan conquers China. Pearl Harbor was exactly the blow that FDR was wishing for to go to war with Japan. FDR lied to the American public about his real intentions in declaring war on Japan. After the war, America saw itself at the very center of attention - it has pushed it's competitors way behind in terms of influence in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. World War 2 was extremely economically good for America. The USA only got involved in it for economic benefits and changing the balance of world power not for noble and humanitarian purposes like we're made to believe. Hello, users of CMV!
