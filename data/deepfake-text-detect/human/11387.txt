YouTube and Amazon have finally ended their feud after a year of negotiations. The YouTube app will now return to Amazon's Fire TV products, and the Amazon Prime Video app will be adding Chromecast support. No dates have yet been set for when these changes will occur, but Amazon users can still access YouTube through the built-in browser while they wait. There are still disputes yet to be resolved between Amazon and Google, for example, Amazon still won't stock some of Google's devices on their marketplace.
