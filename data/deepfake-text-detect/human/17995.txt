Democracy is considered by many as the best political system to date. So good, it is not to be questioned. I think it's a good system, but I am struggling with the one aspect: voting. I do not believe that voting always brings out the best solutions for a given problem. The majority votes for selfish reasons and not for the common good. These votes are what gets political parties in power, so, when a party starts it 4 year term, it uses most of its energy to please the population so it can be voted again for an other term. Long term plans (like overfishing regulations or a new education plan) can be washed away because a new party has been voted and a new plan is created. This can happen and does happen every 4 years without a certain plan ever being completed. Why is it considered so good and holy, that anyone who dares to criticize it is automatically a communist or something else? Change my view
