While CRISPR technology has the potential to help many people, it also has the potential to be used as a dangerous weapon. The technology works by editing genes within living cells, which can potentially cure, or cause, genetic diseases. In September 2016, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began a program called Safe Genes that aimed to find an antidote against CRISPR. More than 40 anti-CRISPR proteins have already been found. Scientists have combined CRISPR and anti-CRISPR technologies to develop more targeted treatments. Finding a way to disable CRISPR technology is important as the consequences of an accident or attack can be catastrophic.
