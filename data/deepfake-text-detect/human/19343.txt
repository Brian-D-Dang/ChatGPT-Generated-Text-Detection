Hope that didn't come out as too crazy sounding or confusing. But basically I was talking with my parents who are both vehemently religious and I made a realization that while religion does contribute to wars, the biggest problem that religion is that it prevents the spread of advancement in science, specifically in the fields of medicine, climate, and biology (with issues in climate change and evolution), and society, specifically with same-sex marriage, abortion, contraception, marijuana, et cetera.
