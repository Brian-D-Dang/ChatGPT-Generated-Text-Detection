The notion that polyamory is all a selfish choice that's just about having the kind of sex you want, and world be damned if its not 'traditional' or 'natural' smells just like homophobia and those that opposed interracial marriage. But the fact of the matter is it's not just about sleeping with whoever you want. It's also about exploring your feelings and falling in love when it comes naturally. It's about making boundaries with your loved ones that you can all agree upon mutually, and not confining yourself or your relationships to what's socially acceptable. But instead to appreciate what people mean to you for everything they are, and for what they are not. Some relationships don't fit into boyfriendgirlfriend or marriage. And to say those aren't good relationships just because they don't hold up to society's end-game fairy tale of happily-ever-after shouldn't make them less meaningful or relevant to our lives. Polyphobes come out of the woodworks when they begin to fear that the rising popularity and acceptance of non-monogamous lifestyles will spell certain doom for their way of life. They fear we'll turn people one by one until they have no one left to date.
