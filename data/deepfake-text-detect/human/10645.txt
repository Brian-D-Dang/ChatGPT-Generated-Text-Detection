I'm guessing that the deer you see are not in a hunting "zone" so are unaware and unafraid. Also, why would you wear camouflage and then on top of that a large bright orange safety vest? The camo in this case is fashion.','In addition to the other answers, if you are bow hunting, you have to get much closer than 100 feet usually.
