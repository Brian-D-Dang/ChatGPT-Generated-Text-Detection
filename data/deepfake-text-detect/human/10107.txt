With our constant fast technological advancement people seem to think that we will lead our selves to destruction because we do not use technology with care, but recently all new modern technologies that are being invented are completely beneficial towards society as a whole, such as L'Oreal teaming up with Organovo to 3-D print human skin to use in product tests, and NASA announcing a new rover able to make autonomous decision on its next mission to mars. These technologies have no downside and cannot be used with evilbad intentions (like in the past with nuclear weapons) to lead to a doomsday scenario. Hello, users of CMV!
