It's rare, but sometimes it happens (one study found that looked at 138 gun suicides found that 5 involved two or more shots to the head, which is about 3.6). You shoot yourself in the head, it doesn't kill you or totally incapacitate you, so you do it again. There's even one reported case of a man who shot himself in the head four times in a suicide, but unfortunately I can't access the medical journals that discuss it (the abstracts are [here] (URL0) and [here] (URL1. A lot of times when a multiple gunshot wound suicide occurs, the initial shots are to the chest or throat or jaw and don't actually hit the brain. Also, oftentimes multiple gunshot wound suicides are first investigated as homicides. It's possible that some cases are just really well-covered up homicides, but the simpler explanation is just that the first bullet didn't kill. The human body can be both remarkably frail and remarkably durable.,I've been to suicide scenes where the victim attempted to shoot himself in the head via a small caliber cartridge. The first shot was angled in such a way that it "rode the skull " and came out the other side never had penetrating the cranium. It knocks the victim unconscious (usually) then, upon awakening, they attempt it again. I haven't scene suicides with 3 GSWs to the head but two is not unheard of.
