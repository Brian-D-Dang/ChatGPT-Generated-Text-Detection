My wife and I went to this office about a year ago for our annual check up. We weren't thrilled immediately. If felt like they were interested only in getting us in and out so they could collect their fees. Still, my wife got glasses and I got a refill of my contacts, with a modified prescription. Initially all seemed OK, but not too long after I started to need reading glasses to see smaller print. I figured it was just a normal progression of my eyesight, as that is a common development for most over time. My wife started getting headaches if she wore her glasses for very long. She thought that was just a case of adjusting as she hadn't worn glasses, other than reading glasses, before. Not being happy with the feel of this office, this year we went to a different provider. The experience was much better, to start. But, then, we found that the prescriptions of my wife's glasses and my contacts were not correct. It seems quite unlikely that it was due to changes in our eyes. The prescription for my wife's glasses was too strong, not too weak, and her eyes did not improve during the past year. She has new glasses now and her vision is much, much better. In my case, with the correct prescription for my contacts, I no longer need reading glasses for most things, and again, the prescription is not as strong as before. We are very happy with the new provider and feel we were just a customer to get in and out for this provider.
