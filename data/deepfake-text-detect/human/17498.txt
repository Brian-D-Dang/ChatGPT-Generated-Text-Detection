So I recently went to vote for the first time and in deciding that none of the candidates represented my beliefs strongly enough, I spoiled my ballot paper. However it got me thinking, how are the politicians meant to change their policy if they don't know who to target or what they are doing wrong. I think that I should be able to hand over certain details about myself such as my age, my gender and possibly why I havehaven't voted for a specific party. Let me stress, this would be a completely voluntary scheme and while not all would choose to participate, it might give the politicians some insight in to what they're doing wrong and how they can change this.
