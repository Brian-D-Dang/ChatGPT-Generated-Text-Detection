If you're not familiar with the wilhelm scream, don't read this, because it will ruin movies for you forever. Apparently there is some "inside joke" among movie makers to insert this sound when a character dies or is injured. As soon as I hear it, and I know I'm not alone, it instantly pops me out of the movie. I can't really think of a good analogy of another technique used in movie making that is so instantly recognizable, and identical every time. It would be like the "toasty" guy popping up in every single video game when someone dies, regardless of the genre or levity. Imagine Red Dead Redemption's ending with the "toasty" guy popping up on the screen at the climax (RDR also happens to use the wilhelm scream). I also don't particularly think it's a very good scream. It's cartoony sounding, and is often shoehorned into scenes where something important is happening, and I just KNOW there was some guy, be it the director or a sound guy, who spliced that stupid scream into a scene "huehuehue"ing to himself! Here's a 12 minute compilation of the god damned wilhelm scream:
