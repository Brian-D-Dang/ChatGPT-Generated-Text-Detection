I recently went to a lecture at my university that had a bit on Tibetan independence movements and what Tibet was like before communism in China really kicked off. I have to say I was completely stunned by how there was a strict abusive religious caste system which had religious figures who were at the top and peasants who essentially slaved away for them. I was even more surprised that there were people subjected to horrific torture during these theocracy periods. I'm aware in recent times the Dalai Lama has spoke more on autonomy for Tibetan people and the region rather than it being it's own independent state, but obviously there are endless amounts of people championing support for a free Tibet, the idea is still going strong. While I'm also aware that things aren't exactly great in Tibet due to the persecution and constant harassment of Tibetans by China, I'm not entirely sold that things would be better in the long run if Tibet were to become independent. I highly doubt that there would be a government structure that wouldn't involve religion, and going off of how things were in the past, it's tough to say if there wouldn't be castes set by religion and power. I know this whole debate is a lesser of two evils sort of situation, but I just feel that systems based on religion allow for people to abuse others more easily due to figures being seen has having divine protection and reasoning. The whole title and premise of the Dalai Lama doesn't sit right with me, kinda like the whole idea of being a pope. Lastly I feel celebrities being all gung-ho for Tibetan independence is just a cheap ploy to make it seem like people with money can give two shits about something they're so far removed from, like it's fashionable to care for certain causes. CMV on the matter. I also welcome any corrections on anything I possibly misinterpreted or misunderstood. Cheers.
