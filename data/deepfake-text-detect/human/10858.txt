Most fast food operations operate pretty much identical, be it Burger King, Taco Bell, or Jollibee. The cost of their ingredients, workers, and everything needed to keep the store going is kept very low. This allows them to sell items at low rates and still make a reasonable profit. The low prices also lower customer expectations of the product (they know what they are getting based on the price), so that is a good signal and value offer for the company, yeah its cheap, yeah its kinda nasty, but there is a large crowd thats OK with that trade off. Just think about the last time you ate fast food it was quick cheap, and yeah ok not great, but whatever right? And since the store's costs are even lower then their low price, they do pretty well and there is a good audience for this value based food. [There's additionally a more complicated answer involving real estate investments, but thats way out of the ELI5 of the business model
