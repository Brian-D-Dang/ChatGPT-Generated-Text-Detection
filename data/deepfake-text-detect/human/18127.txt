The moderators of CMV would like your opinion on how things are going, so we've decided to post periodic feedback threads to take the pulse of the community. Feel free to post any comments, criticisms or suggestions. Also remember that rideasforcmv is always available if you have ideas for improving the sub. Please note that Rule 2 (no rude or hostile comments) and Rule 5 (no low-effort comments) are still in effect. We look forward to hearing your thoughts.
