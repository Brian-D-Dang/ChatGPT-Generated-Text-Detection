I know a lot of people complain about Obama and hate on him, even the fairly "liberal" people. However, in the US, realistically, Democrats and Republicans are the only ones that are capable of taking the seat in the Oval Office due our (seemingly) two party system. If Romney or McCain was elected into the office, we would (more than likely) still have the PRISM, NDA, etc. But not only would we have that, we would have strict abortion laws, no progress for gay rights, women's rights, etc. So I'd much rather have a PRISM supporting president that supports equality than one who is a social conservative. Whenever I hear people complain on Reddit about Obama (and the majority Reddit is pro-equality), I always point that out, but get downvoted into oblivion. Please tell me why that is? EDIT: To clarify, I don't mean complain about his actions. complaining about his actions is okay, I mean to complain about him becoming president overall is pointless. UPDATE: A lot of you guys raised a lot of good points. [This post in particular] changed my view.
