[Budyko's Blanket] Is a system outlined by Intellectual Ventures to act as a sort of artificial volcano, pumping Sulfur Dioxide high into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight, much like a volcanic eruption does, but regulated. Since the carbon output is so massive and countries like India and China would take decades to get on board any Carbon reduction program, would it not be a good idea to reverse the course of global warming? It is also cost effective as well, see link. Since we know volcanic eruptions have an effect on climate change, with sulfur dioxide being the main cause, (it was once used as a refrigerant gas) and such a device is completely controllable. Possible problems: Sulfur Dioxide may be dangerous, but we already pump out billions of tons worth of carbon monoxide every year, and the design of Budyko's blanket prevents most of the problems. Only a few countries would need to do this due to the wind. if you read SuperFreakonomics this idea would be known to you, as the idea is explained so much better by the authors. Hello, users of CMV!
