I used to live on the second floor in a 7 story dorm and after I made my way back to the dorm after school I was fairly tired. I like to walk up the stairs but every now and then I'd take the elevator. And every now and then someone would complain: you can't take the elevator for just 2 floors. Even worse off were the poor sods who lived on the first floor. Jeez - relax. If you think people should climb 2 floors - why don't you get to the 2nd and climb 2 to to 4th? Or just wait it out. Blah! What do you guys think?
