Or more laymen's terms: We can stop companies from making 1 billion percent profit, for virtually no reason, and without being "communist" as they say. Capitalism does not mean "con artist." Point being, I think it is vile and corrupt for someone to take a piece of sand and sell it to an unknowing person as a 5 lb. piece of gold. Who would do that you say? EVERYONE. The profits that most corps. make these days are insane, which is exactly why we have monopolies ruining the US and ruining the world. But in the midst of it all we have all these people (who I am struggling to not call idiots) who claim that putting a cap on profits would be "communist." How the hell is that communist? Especially in the face of this disgusting abuse of power? It's like saying "Let's not kill that guy running down the street murdering people at will, because that would be hypocritical" Wait, what?!? I'm not saying everyone should make the same pay, and I didn't say we should develop a damn cast system, I'm just saying cap these damn monopolies so they don't turn us into slaves, is that communist? I say not. You should say it's the opposite of communism. CMV!
