Who are we to decide people can't have the freedom to smoke marijuana just because we don't like it? Or to decide Muslims can't pray because it makes some other people uncomfortable? These all follow the same logic: "x should be illegal because the majority doesn't like seeing it." Making victimless things like these illegal based on our opinions of them is like making rap music illegal because some people find it insensitive and uncomfortable to listen to. Why should having sex in the park (or other things along the same lines) be illegal? CMV EDIT: The argument of sanitary issues has been brought up. It's a very good point, so assume this raunchy couple does their business on a tarp, keeping all their germs off of the grass. Make littering of bodily fluids illegal, but not sex itself. EDIT2: Imagine you're in a park in the deep south. A gay couple is walking through the park and they are holding hands. Maybe they kiss once. Meanwhile a few very conservative, religious mothers are at the park with their children. They get very upset and uncomfortable because they don't think it's appropriate for their kids to see this, and they think it's wrong. Should the gay couple be forced not to hold hands because it upsets these mothers who don't want their kids seeing? The same reasoning applies to sex. If you make one of these scenarios illegal but not the other, that's totally inconsistent: Both scenarios involve actions that are harmless to others, don't even involve interaction with others, and make some people uncomfortable with their children seeing or themselves seeing. Causing others to be uncomfortable is not a reason to make an action punishable by law. (Think hate speech, which is fully legal).
