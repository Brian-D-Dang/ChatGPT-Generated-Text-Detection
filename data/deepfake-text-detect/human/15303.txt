Had this review sitting in my drafts for over almost a year. I still remember my disappointment with this restaurant even after all this time. Besides the atmosphere and spacious outdoor seating, I was rather disappointed. The food is overpriced yet manages to under-deliver. I also found the service to be perfunctory. If you must eat Thai food in the sun, then this will suffice. That said, if you want good Thai, go elsewhere.
