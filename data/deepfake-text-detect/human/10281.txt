They've been saying this since the 30s. Keynes predicted that as technology increased and our material needs would be met, we would only need to work 15 hours a week, instead we are working longer hours than ever. There's no reason to think this will change anytime soon, if it hasn't in the last 80 years. People were saying from the 18th Century that the industrial revolution will make man redundant? But did it? People moved on, new types of job openings which we'd never have imagined before came to be, think about the luddites' opposition to technology. We do not have anything to fear.
