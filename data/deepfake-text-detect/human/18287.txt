At least in a capitalist society, I feel as if there is no such thing as people being created equally. The crack baby is predisposed to narcotics. The baby born into a white-collar family is demanded to attend college. The adopted asian child is tormented throughout middle school. The disabled child is abused, neglected, and drugged up for a lifetime. The not-so-attractive girl feels incompetent, and fucks everyone in sight, ruining her own morals. The gay kid is harassed, tormented, and told that their lifestyle is a decision, when it's not. All of these things are indicative of inequality. Please CMV.
