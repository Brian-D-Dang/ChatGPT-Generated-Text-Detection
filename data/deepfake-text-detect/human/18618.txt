So I was raised in the Church of Christ under the heavily implied belief that the world was created by God in 7 literal days. Throughout my life however, I have been exposed to many different ideas and liberal interpretations of foundational beliefs in the Church of Christ. This has led me to question and educate myself on many of the typically controversial Christian topics (e.g. Homosexuality, abortion, etc...) and more recently one of the most controversial: evolution. Now as you might imagine, bringing this topic up with any of my conservative Christian friends can cause quite a ruckus. I am afraid to even suggest to them that you can believe in evolution and God at the same time- or heaven forbid, that you can interpret the Bible with evolution in mind (which for those of you who don't understand the impact, is often held equal to God, though nobody would ever admit that). So what's the deal here? Can you believe in both evolution and a world created by God? Edit: Minor formatting. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
