I should first state my bias: I grew up in a typical Asian family, so math, english, and science were the subjects I had to score well in. I have come across Ken Robinson's TED Talks about how schools are killing creativity, and that fine arts should have "the same status" as math and science. I however, still think language, math, and sciences are the backbone of one's education. If heshe doesn't excel in these subjects, then college and future are probably out of the question. There are only so many people who can succeed in the entertainment field (singers, athletics, etc.) What makes one think heshe can succeed in those fields? I have the view that majoring in courses such as music technology, animal science, etc is the easy way out and won't get you anywhere in life. CMV please? Thanks in advance.
