This is SUCH a lovely place to have breakfast!! They get 5 stars based on their vanilla yogurt alone. It's deliciously creamy and it's filled with real vanilla bean seeds. Oh.my.goodness. And for a cup of this, priced the same as a glass of iced tea, it's a steal.. My husband said he's never had fresher tasting fruit in his fruit plate. This place completely gets an A for their food. And while their prices are high, you are definitely getting your money's worth as far as quality of food and quality service. We went here a few times and really enjoyed ourselves.
