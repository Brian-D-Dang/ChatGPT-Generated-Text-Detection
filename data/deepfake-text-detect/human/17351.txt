My personal view is that it is unethical to publicize the arrest and charges brought against suspected criminals. I understand that media corporations profit from viewership and people freely choose to ignore the immorality of these publications because they are interesting and shocking, however I think that any news source worth respecting would moderate coverage to a mere mention (at most) of allegations. A less venerable company would create entire news stories out of stories as minimal as charges being brought against an individual. The immorality herein (to me) lies in the seemingly lost presumption of "innocent until proven guilty," as many people confuse arrest and charging phases of the executive system with the conviction phase of the judicial system. This causes the accused to be treated like assumed criminals, defaming them and their loved ones before receiving a fair trial.
