For a long time I did not understand why Vegans were against eating eggs, but eventually I learned that the reason for this is because the chicken egg industry kills male chickens en masse because they only need a few of them in order to keep producing more chickens. For this reason alone, some vegans will not eat eggs, no matter the source because it will support an industry that harms animals. This makes sense, but I believe that anyone who purports to not eat eggs for this reason could not morally eat at a restaurant that offered vegan options, as by offering your business to a restaurant that also serves meat you would be contributing to the livestock industry in a similar way.
