Basically a dude in my grade's father died of a heart attack. Obviously it's sad and all but a huge chunk of my grade has decided to go to the funeral tomorrow morning (and also to sit "shiva." This is in Israel.) IMO they are all going mostly to miss school but they'll never admit it. Anyway, i just think it's inappropriate for a bunch of kids who only know this dude by name and have certainly never met, seen or even know the name of the Father to go to the funeral. Honestly, I think it's just fake as hell to go to the funeral, say something like "I'm sorry for your loss. Your father was a great man" when I've never even met the guy.
