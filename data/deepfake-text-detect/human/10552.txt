Your body spends a lot of energy to heat a small layer of warm air around it. Fans and wind blow this small layer of air away. Thus your body isn't in contact with a warm layer of air any more but with a cold layer of unheated air. And when a warm body meets cold air heat rushes from the warm thing to the cold thing and you feel cold.
