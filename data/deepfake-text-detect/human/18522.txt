I'm currently studying computer science and math at a top 10 university, and I'm interested in working in field of cryptography. I was considering working for the NSA mainly because they offer good positions to people who only have bachelor's degrees, and working for the government is more appealing to me than working for a corporation or business. Since the PRISM debacle I've been reconsidering even trying to get a job there in a few years. It seems wrong to work for an institution that spies on American citizens.
