I'll firstly head off a common argument I've heard- the niqab is not actually as common as people would care to think. In France the total number of actual women wearing the niqab is less than 400, in a Muslim population of 200,000. The ban therefore affects a minority of a minority, and it seems odd to my mind such a minor issue has reached the highest heights of government. I also feel the ban also contradicts the principles of religious freedom which exist in Europe and in the West. The ban seems to have involved little consultation from the actual veiled women themselves, and rather seems to be fuelled by the mass of right-wing sentiment which seems to have sprung up in the West in more recent times than any real concerns. I also find the idea that the State can mandate the clothing choices of people abhorrent, and it seems hypocritical to my mind that whilst the average European recoils in horror at the sort of mandatory niqab rules, the same people can then put in place an almost identical reverse law. No state body should have any say in the clothing choices of the citizenry. Regarding security, this is a non-issue to me. If there is some need for identification or security, I am sure that provision could be made that niqabed women would be required to remove their niqabs for this purpose infront of an appropriate female, and identification made. Plus it must be said that if it were really a security issue, then the ban would not prevent women from walking down their own front streets (where the niqab presents no security risk whatsoever). So, CMV otherwise.
