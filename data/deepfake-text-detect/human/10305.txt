I was only able to find one other thread about this topic, and it was kind of a train wreck. Common arguments: "It's not Jraphics Interchange Format" by that logic, NASA would be pronounced Nay-sa and SCUBA would be pronounced Scuh-buh. Acronyms that are not initialisms are pronounced like they are words of their own, which brings me to point 2: "It's pronounced like'gift' because that's the only other word with'gif'!" by that logic, due to the existence of the word'girth','giraffe' would be pronounced with a hard g.'Gift' is the exception not the rule. See; [here] . To base the pronunciation of a word on an exception is highly illogical. "The dictionary says both pronunciations are fine!" The dictionary also says that'literally' means both literally and not literally. See; [here] . This is because the dictionary typically reflects how words are used, not what is correct. So if people started pronouncing epitome like its spelled, the dictionary would also likely say that the incorrect pronunciation is fine there, too. This does not, however, make the pronunciation correct. So without further ado, Change My View! Edit: For future commenters, I will be arguing only at the grammatical level from here on out, as I have seen the same arguments from a common usage standpoint enough, and have already awarded several deltas in that category.
