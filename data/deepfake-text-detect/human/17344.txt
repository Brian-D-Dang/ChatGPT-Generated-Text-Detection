Every time I go out to a restaurant these days, I see a family with children who are glued to a cell phone or tablet device. While I understand the the goal is generally keep the child from disrupting the parents or other patrons in the restaurant (which it doesn't always), I feel like this is keeping kids from learning basic behavior in public, social situations. While I understand that children do learn other behaviors while in school or at home, I believe it is important to practice good behavior and to prevent children from growing up with their eyes glued to a screen. Communication skills suffer greatly. Also, there have been several times where children's electronic devices are distracting, and I'd rather not hear Dora the Explorer during my anniversary dinner.
