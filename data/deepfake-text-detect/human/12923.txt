This teenager works for Torchwood. The gizmos are alien. The 19 year old found himself in the last wizards' colony hidden in Iceland on earth in the present. Since he has been inside the Doctor's TARDIS on a few occasions, the ancient language the wizards and witches speak is translated into English. My teenager was recruited by the newest Torchwood in 2015. Haven't decided to make the teenager a boy or girl. He (singular pronoun) is from New York City, but his wealthy British-American parents sent him to Cambridge. He's a student, part-time time-and-space traveller, and a manwoman in black (MIB, WIB). The MIB are real; so are the "x files."
