A capital city holds the highest form of government within a country. Even if (and there almost always are) smaller localised governing bodies elsewhere, the federal or sovereign government will lie in the capital. It is often decided on by some sort of constitutional law, most likely common law. In many countries a constitution is rarely amended due to the length and difficulty of the process. This is why capital cities do not change, despite larger cultural or social influences becoming more apparent in cities elsewhere in the country.
