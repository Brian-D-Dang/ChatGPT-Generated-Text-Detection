Good question! Root vegetables generally grow to a certain size before they are eaten, but you could eat an undergrown carrot or sweet potato or onion. And all 3 of those can go bad at some point, they just generally take a long time to spoil (months). In culinary terms, peppers are vegetables (because of their savory notes and applications in dishes), but biologically peppers are fruits (just like tomatoes). And both tomatoes and peppers go soft when they begin to spoil, although there are varieties of tomatoes that stay good for many months. Corn actually spoils faster than most people would assume, and it does go soft. Side note: please do not eat potatoes that have gone soft. A chemical process happens that turns the starches to sugars, so they smell different and are not good for you.
