As the title says, I think that getting rid of the corporate tax rate would allow for greater improvement in product lines and create jobs. It would also allow corporations with money off-shore to bring their money here. I do not know the full specifics and proscons of off-shore vs on-shore, just know the generalities of it all. CMV
