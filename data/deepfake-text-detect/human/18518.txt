Let's start with the on paper musical qualifications. He plays three instruments that I know of for sure: accordion, harmonica (he can play those two at the same time), and piano. I'm fairly certain he plays more. He has astounding vocal range (he can belt a high C as seen at the end of Jurassic Park and has a fantastic baritone for the lower end) as well as astounding adaptability of style. In addition he and his band transcribe all of his parodies completely by ear. He has been a staple of the music industry for more than 30 years and has won three Grammys. Despite the fact that his parodies are explicitly covered under fair use in US copyright law he maintains respect among other artists by asking explicitly for permission from the song's creator before producing a parody. Many consider it an honor to be asked to have their song parodied. His songs range from amusing to poignant to hilarious and yet people continually dismiss him as an illegitimate hack who gets famous off other people's work, in spite of the fact that he is more successful than many of the people he parodies. No one has ever given me a a legitimate reason that he is not a fantastic musician and recording artist, so good luck Changing My View.
