I know that nobody is all good or all bad, so I'm not saying that if someone has a particularly bad opinion about something, then they are a bad person, all around, just that I think less of them for it. And I don't feel this way about generally dissenting opinions. If a person feels differently about the current health care issues than I do, that's not the sort of thing that I hold against them. The things that cause problems are when people campaign to get others to vote against allowing homosexuals to marry. Or when they say that women shouldn't be in the workforce (not that they shouldn't be ALLOWED, just that women should choose not to because they belong at home). Things like that make me think less of the person saying them - not just that I disagree with them, but that they are less of a person because they believe that. It's become a problem because most of the people I know are either racist, sexist, or homophobic and so this mentality of thinking that they are lesser for those opinions has damaged a lot of my relationships. I'm constantly being told that I have to separate the person from the opinion, but I think that we are our thoughts and opinions.
