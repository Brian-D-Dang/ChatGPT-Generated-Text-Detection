I think English should not be the international language for these reasons: It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words here uBrotherChe makes a really good point in another thread I saw. Other languages such as Spanish the pronunciation of a word is pretty straight forward. I understand that the conjugation is the only tough part and the whole gender thing might be confusing at first (not that crazy if it ends on an a it's female, except agua which can be both, the only tough part is if it end on an e). Also English is not even the most spoken language in the world where Mandarin is first followed by Spanish. English is rising only because it's commonly being taught as a second language, if you change the language it will also rise. Also the whole small scale system that English has does not even make sense like why a billion is a thousand of a million where in long scale it's a million of a million. I know this seems biased like I am arguing that Spanish should be the international language and it's my native language, but it makes more sense if it were. I didn't defend Mandarin because I've always had the impression of it being one of the hardest language to master. If it's otherwise I apologize and anyone who speaks other languages are welcome to support why your language should be the international language. Hello, users of CMV!
