I think that people are over weight because of choices they make. I think that saying you have a "big bone structure" or your "genes" make you fat, is a cop-out for being overweight. I do understand some medical reasons make it harder (not impossible) to be fit, but otherwise, I think it's a bunch of excuses. I personally have lost a significant amount of weight from eating right and exercising. I make the choice everyday to live healthy, and it bothers me that people think I'm in good shape because of my genetics. I have also researched and seen a lot of people who have gone from morbidly obese, to extremely fit. Because of this, I don't believe that fitness is reserved for a select few. CMV EDIT: I should have said that I don't believe these are valid reasons to justify not being healthy. If your genes make it harder for you to lose weight, I understand that. But I don't think it's appropriate to sit around d and eat cookies, never exercise, and say "I'm this way because of my genes" or "I'm jut big boned"
