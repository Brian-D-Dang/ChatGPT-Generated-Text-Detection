Blueberry Hill serves up completely average diner food. It has it's purpose, though, and it makes great late-night or hangover food. My chorizo omelet came out as more of a scramble, and only tasted OK. If you're looking for a local, family-owned alternative to IHOP that's still open 24 hours, this is your place. It's a strange little restaurant, layout-wise, but on the plus side, they do have booths for odd numbered groups of 3, 5, etc.... The service was honestly just bad. We rotated between 2 different waiters, and neither of them really paid us much attention. To top off the misery, the guy at the cash register was one of the most pessimistic people I've encountered. When my friend's credit card wouldn't swipe on the first try, he grumbled, At lest you have credit.... Most people in the country don't! Nice.... Blueberry Hill will serve in a pinch, but there have got to be better local 24 hour food options in Vegas...
