Assassination should be allowed against people that are deemed the enemy. Now I clarify my statement to not include just war because we know that the United States has not gone to war since WWII. President Carter's EO 11905 12036 banned the use of assassination against targets by the intelligence community. What I would currently like is the United States intelligence community to be able to "take out" the head of terrorist groups. This does not include politically let locations but "heads of the snake" like Kony or the leader of Boko Haram. While this might hydra, it has a chance of splintering a group making them weaker and easier to mop up. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
