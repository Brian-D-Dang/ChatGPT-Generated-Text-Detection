Google employees will hold a sit-in protest to protest retaliation against employees on May 1. In November, more than 20,000 employees walked out to protest against the company's handling of sexual harassment allegations, and since then many employees have found that their job responsibilities have diminished. Employee protests at Google have been effective in creating change in the company. Google officially prohibits retaliation at the workplace, and a spokesperson has stated that the company has multiple channels, including anonymously, for employees to report workplace retaliation.
