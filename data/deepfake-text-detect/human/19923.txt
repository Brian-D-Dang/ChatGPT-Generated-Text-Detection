I think that parents of a particular religion should not be able to send their children to schools that teach that religion as the out and out truth. I believe that this will only lead to children growing up with more closed minds about religion. Especially if they are taught at the school that the religion is the absolute out and out truth. In my opinion, all schools should teach that all faiths are acceptable. No parent has the right to channel their child to a specific religion (or no religion) and that the child can have an open mind to choose their religion once older. CMV.
