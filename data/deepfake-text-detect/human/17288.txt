I just don't get the stink about this. The media talks about the bombers all the time and this is just another piece of that. Every news network dug this guys life up from the very start of the fiasco and I don't think Rolling Stone publishing is any different than anyone else. In my opinion the Rolling Stone is entitled to publish whatever they want to. And I truly don't see the harm in publishing this. I feel that the right to free speech should supersede people's concerns of a copycat. Also I don't think that trying to suppress the article will do any good for the opposition of this article. The Streisand effect will just set in and get this thing more publicity. Which is the total opposite of what the opposition wants. CMV
