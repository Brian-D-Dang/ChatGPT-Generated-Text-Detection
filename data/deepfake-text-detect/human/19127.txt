This is mostly in reaction to the release of BattleBlock Theater, a long-awaited downloadable Xbox game by the creators of Castle Crashers. Like most games, especially indies, it has its fair share of bugs, and from how I understand it, it costs quite a bit of money for developers to patch their game on Xbox live. This issue, combined with the greater opportunity for building a community around things like custom content on PC, leads me to wonder why, If a dev team's budget can't support developing for more than one console, they would choose one that hinders their game's growth and improvement.
