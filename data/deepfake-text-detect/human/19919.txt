Title pretty much says it all. I think companies that do this are pretty bad. I've never signed up for a free trial, because they don't cancel the payments after trial ends. They just assume you want it. This essentially screws the customers if they forget, which a lot do. If they genuinely wanted to get use out of the customer, they require the filling out of a questionnaire or they apply a one time of a monthly fee at e end, and and cancel card information. This way charges don't build up, and those truly interested give feed back and even sign up for continuation. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
