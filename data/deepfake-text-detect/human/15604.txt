This is probably one of the best hotels I have stayed at ever, and I have been in some crazy hotels, from the Gritti Palace in Venice to the Plaza Athenee in Paris. None however were as warm and welcoming as the Scots running this prime Edinburgh hotel. It might be a short schlep out of the centre of town, but pound-for-pound, compared to the likes of the Missoni it is one helluvalot better. I ended up here the marathon weekend over the summer, and was only able to book 1 night. Having arrived, I told them I needed another night, and within a couple of hours they squirreled me out enjoying afternoon tea in one of their beautifully decorated reception rooms to inform me that there was another night available if I so desired. From the moment I stepped through the front door the staff made me feel as if I was a long lost friend returning home. Their courtesy and warmth was impeccable, and delivered with traditional Scottish gusto. No doubt to remind me of my English-ness they put me in the Churchill suite, and I wasn't disappointed in the den they had assigned me, which was super cosy and intimate. The grounds are surrounded by a large golf course and there are plenty of good vantage points for Arthur's seat and beyond. It's a quite and idyllic spot to be in, and all the more amazing considering that the bounds of central Edinburgh and not that far away, with everything it has to offer. Edinburgh taxi drivers are certainly friendly! If you are looking for a well-served, romantic weekend away, with excellent hospitaility, amazing restaurant (michelin-starred if I remember correctly) and great afternoon tea, then look no further than the Prestonfield House Hotel.
