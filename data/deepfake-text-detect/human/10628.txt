Many of the solids in bourbon are more soluable in alcohol than water. When you add water to the bourbon they begin to percipitate out of the liquid turning the bourbon cloudy. That is one reason they have to filter 80 proof bourbon so much and thus remove a lot of the flavor. If they did not do so, then the bourbon would get cloudy, particularly when chilled. The solution is, drink it neat.
