I'm a liberal progressive that looks down on people that would leave the poor to struggle while taking the spoils for themselves. I believe selfishness is a universal character trait that is neither good or bad but rather just is, but when others behave selfishly I can't help but consider them bad people. I recently had a conversation about how people tend to actively avoid reading. There was a blanket statement about how some people can't read, read without comprehension, or are dyslexic. I immediately thought of how when I worked retail a regular used to come in that couldn't speak english. He'd always pay in check but needed me to fill them out for him and it always really annoyed me. This is where my viewpoint needs to be changed: I feel no sympathy towards anyone that has a problem reading, by choice or by chance, merely because it puts others (by others I mean myself) in a position where they have to assist. Basically, I don't want to help because I don't feel like it, and I feel this is an unjustifiable reason. Sure, I could've told that guy to learn to write in english but it would've taken less time to fill out the damn check than for him to learn an entire language. Like I said, I'm a liberal. It's not often I feel the need to help isn't as important as selfish desires, but if I'm going to feel that way I at least want some insight into that viewpoint and if it's one worth having.
