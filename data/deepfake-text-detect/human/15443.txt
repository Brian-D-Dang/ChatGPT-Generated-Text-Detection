This place just plain sucks! After getting turned down at SW for not having a reservation, we strolled into this horrible excuse of a fine dining restaurant. The menu looked so appetizing, however the food was terrible. Two of us ordered the lobster risotto, one ordered the pasta with prawns a scampi sauce and the other ordered the short rib pasta. The lobster risotto sounded so promising. What a disappointment! It was terrible. We kept joking around that they pulled out a box of broccoli cheese rice-a-roni and threw in a tiny piece of lobster to spruce it up a bit. Both pastas were so mediocre. Olive Garden has better food than this. All of these dishes were around 35. Originally planning on going to SW, we knew we would be paying out of our noses for dinner, so paying 35 for pasta wasn't that big of a deal. However, 35 for crappy, half-ass food is a crime. If you ever come across this place, turn around and run as fast as you can. What a waste of money and what could have been a great Vegas dining experience.
