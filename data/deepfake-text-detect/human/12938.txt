"1 Gods are only gods, there are things even more gruesome and feed on the blood of heavenly bodies 2 and bodies of those born to the heavens. 3 Even these god-eaters fear for their flesh and muscles when their elders make themselves known. 4 The heavenly decided to prepare for a clash against their own makers 5 by making, the making of humans. 6 the spirit of mortals manifests at immortals, whose power rivals, but not eclipse that of the elders." He looked down at the hammer in his hand, and the bodies strew about him. The griffon he had ridden to combat the elder-god was left broken behind with the Great Courier. They had managed to kill the, Cthulhu? but had taken grievous casualties and most of the Pantheon of Greece had been slain before Thor and his people could reinforce the Battle of Nyarlathotep. It was amazing and terrible to watch the razing of the planet by the elders. And more amazing and more terrible to watch the fight the gods and myths and imaginings put up. Yip, thought to be one of the strongest of these invaders, had been slain by a small joint-force of Wendingo savages and cultured vampires. Azathoth was swarmed by millions of gnomes and lizerdmen that had burst forth from the Earth. Thor stopped his survey of the land battle to look up and see the strongest of the Earth struggling against the strongest of the Elder. Odin, Zeus, Ganesha, and Jesus fought a losing battle against Ghatanothoa and a horde of lesser Demonic beings of impossible dimension. A large illogical hand appeared over the edge of the brink Thor had been watching the war from. He began swinging his hammer in wide circles, and prepared himself for a solo battle with the elder-bane of the universe.
