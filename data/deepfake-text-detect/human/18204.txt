As greater numbers of young people in socially progressive regions identify as non-religious (1), the most conservative areas in the world find themselves more at odds with global society and declare themselves to be its enemy and at war (2). I don't think these two articles prove the death of religion, I think they exemplify a growing divide that is not going to be fixed. I believe this divide is heading toward a turning point in the macro-history of humanity. People have been moving toward a secularized society for centuries, and in the past few decades it has reached a level where the most conservative and religious elements can no longer find enough common ground to coexist. When this happens, fighting is bound to happen, and if long term trends are to be believed, Religion won't last out the battle. (1) (2)
