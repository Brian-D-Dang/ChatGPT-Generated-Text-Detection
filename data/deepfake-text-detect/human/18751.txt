I just don't get it. One friend is a single mother of two, just posted something comparing Obama to Hitler. Another friend is a lesbian friend that drifts from job to job and votes GOP. The best one is a person I used to know that is a felon, single mom, and works at Burger King (at the age of 30 manning the drive through). Another dude is a public school teacher. If these people do not want to vote in their own self interest, why should I vote for a party that stereotypically works more to help out the poor and working classes? EDIT: Ok, thank you very much folks. I was not considering ALL of their priorities in figuring out their voting habits and just one or two aspects of each person's political alignment. You folks are really good at this.:) Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
