Employees SHOULD describe in as much detail possible what they didn't like about their old job while interviewing for a new one. This question was inspired by a post I recently saw in raskreddit. To begin with, let me state that I'm well aware that the general guideline is that an interviewee should not complain about his or her old job, manager (s) and pay. Don't tell me, "Well, at my job..." Yes, I know there are exceptions, but that is widely regarded as standard by many in the interviewing process. As an interviewee, if I'm leaving my current job it's always certainly because I am dissatisfied with it in some regard. I may want better pay. I may want a position with more responsibility and opportunity. I may see my chances for advancement at my current employer as poor. I may dislike the culture of the company I work for. I may personally dislike my manager and his or her management style. Each of those is profoundly relevant as to whether or not this new hypothetical job for which I'm interviewing may be a better fit for me than my current one. As an interviewer, hearing what people dislike tells you every bit as much about them as what they do. If a candidate says they hate their job because their current boss is a micromanager, and you yourself are an extremely hands-on manager, you may want to consider someone.else. if a candidate complains about "drama" at their current workplace, you can be fairly certain they'll bring a fair amount of it to yours, too. If they say they didn't like the culture at their current place of employment, you can ask them to clarify and assess how it compares to yours. And there are countless others. Therefore, I think interviewees should tell and should be asked what they absolutely loathe about their current place of employment, managers, and so on.
