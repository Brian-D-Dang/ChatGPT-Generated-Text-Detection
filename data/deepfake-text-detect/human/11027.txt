The difference in distance matters as a percentage. We go from 147100000Km to 152100000Km, which is a difference of about 3. Now imagine a beam of light one metre square coming straight down on you from above. All that energy lands on one square meter. If it's at an angle of 26 degrees, then that same square meter gets spread over two metres of ground, so each part of the ground is only getting half the energy from that incoming light. You can see that the angle the light hits the surface makes a much larger difference than the 3 difference in distance.
