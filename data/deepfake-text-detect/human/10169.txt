I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other people from real life for inspiration. Every time someone does something like that, I can't help but think less of their tattoo. Many a times, I've seen a really nice tattoo and it's always a bittersweet feeling. On one hand it's a beautiful piece, on the other, I never want to have a similar one to that, as I'd feel I was just copying the other person. Whenever I ask a friend why they picked a tattoo from a portfolio, their answer is never far from "because I think it's cool," so elaorating beyond that would be best I suppose. Is this a normal feelling? It seems perfectly normal to look for inspiration on other things, but then again, it makes me feel as if the art isn't as original as it should be. Thanks! EDIT: Lots of replies on inspiration from random sources. I don't think that's bad, only that inspiration from other tattoos (or copying of tattoos) display lack of originality. Hello, users of CMV!
