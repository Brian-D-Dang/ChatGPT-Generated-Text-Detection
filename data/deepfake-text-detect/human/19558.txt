I don't mean the regular or accepted amounts of violence (i.e. a little "roughhousing" in hockey, or actual hitting in boxing) but the stuff that's considered too violent. I've noticed that this tends to result in a fine or a suspension of the player or both. However, if someone were to transgress on my right to be reasonably safe from harm, I would want that person prosecuted criminally. Why do we not treat excessive violence in sports the same way that we would if it were happening on the street? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
