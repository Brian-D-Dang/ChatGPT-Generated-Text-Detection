Recently there has been a lot of buzz about the release of the Fifty Shades of Grey movie on Valentine's Day. The story surrounds the complicated relationship between Anastasia Steele, a college senior, and Christian Grey, a 27-year-old, incredibly wealthy businessman. Personally I think the movie portrays a relationship that blurs the line between physicalemotional abuse and a BDSM relationship. I think that people watching this movie who are in abusive relationships in real life may be swayed to believe that abuse is acceptable, or even normal, in a relationship because it is masked by the facade of a "love story" in this movie. Yet looking purely at the facts, it is true that Ana and Christian's relationship is technically one of mutual consent. Do you think this movie is sending out the wrong message, or is it simply a fictional story about a consensual relationship that will not affect people in real life?
