Same situation. I called yesterday to schedule an appointment. I made sure to ask if the rental was definitely available and I was assured it was. I made the appointment. Called today to verify and there was no record of me making it (even though yesterday I received an email from the company detailing the appointment!). Leasing Agent's name I was given was Ryan and I am not sure he even works for them. The whole company is weird and I would not trust renting from them. Stay away if you're renting, their is something weird going on there.
