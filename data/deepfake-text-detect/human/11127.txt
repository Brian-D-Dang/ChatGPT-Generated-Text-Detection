Short answer: Whatever way is comfortable for you. Longer answer: I generally recommend that people don't sit in the exact same manner for too long. Don't sit too long upright, or too long slouched or too long reclinedsupported by backhead-rest or too long on a ball chair. And don't sit too long period. You may still have an 8-10 hour work day, but plan on about 1-1.5 hours total of that work day that you are not sitting (including your lunch break, sit to eat, but walk some, too). Sitting isn't as bad as it it's made out to be, as long as you give your body variations. One of the most important mechanical pieces I believe is to make sure your hip joints are level or just a little higher than your knees. Sitting (as in a bucket seat in a typical car) with your knees higher than your hips makes it very difficult to sit on your "sit bones" (sit on your hands and feel the bony "sit bones. Vary your position on these sit bones. One way to do this is with a [inflated disc] (URL0). Sit on the disc for a while...when you feel like you've had enough of the disc, remove it and sit on your regular chair. Switch between the two occasionally, with regular (2-3x per hour) breaks to stand up and walk around a bit.', "Supported chair back (roughly 90 deg) with a head rest allowing you to lean slightly back, relaxing your back and neck muscles. Arms dropping straight down to elbowrests, and your wrists resting on a support just above the keyboard (letting your fingers drop down to the keys). Legs at 90 deg to the body, with knees resting just past the seat and allowing the feet to drop naturally to a flat position. Overall, very difficult to do because of fixed desk height, but you can probably fudge it with some lifts under your keyboard. Oh, and an important point is to make sure you're looking slightly down and straight ahead at your primary monitor (10 deg declination).
