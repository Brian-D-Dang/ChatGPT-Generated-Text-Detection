While Dick's is a large store, the employees do not seem interested in helping customers. My wife and I were there for over an hour and no one ever asked if we needed anything. The only time an employee could be found was when we pushed the button to get into a fitting room. Even then, they just opened the door and walked away. They never asked if we needed help. Then when checking out, the cashier was so unfriendly, it was frustrating. Two stars only because of they had what we were looking for. Service rates a zero!!!
