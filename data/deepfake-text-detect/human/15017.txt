Dr. C. is THE. BEST. VET. EVER!! He is the most compassionate, wonderful vet I have ever met. He cared and treated for my guinea pig, Nibbles, for 3 weeks and tried to save her life with everything he could. He was amazing and even performed an autopsy on her after she passed just to give me peace of mind that there really was nothing else we could do. Thank you so very much Dr. C. I couldn't have asked for a more wonderful vet.
