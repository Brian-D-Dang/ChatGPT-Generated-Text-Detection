Flying with any airline can be painful, as many reviews indicate. Over the last ten years of nearly weekly travel I have come to know many of the Phoenix employee's of UnitedTed at Terminal 2. I have to say that all of them are great! Everyone here is challenged with many bad things every day, weather, delays, mechnical problems, air traffic control, and worst of all - egotistical travellers. I have seen so many rude travellers over the years, my mind reels at how these guys can keep their sanity. With very few exceptions there are just a ton of superstars at United in Phoenix. The Red Carpet club is staffed by many of my United favorites and they are always kind and helpful as well. At least at Terminal 2 you can at least find an employee and get help compared to many airports across the country. Travel sucks, but United sucks less than the others!
