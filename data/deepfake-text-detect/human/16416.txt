This paper deals with subsampled spectral gradient methods for minimizing finite sums. Subsample function and gradient approximations are employed in order to reduce the overall computational cost of the classical spectral gradient methods. The global convergence is enforced by a nonmonotone line search procedure. Global convergence is proved provided that functions and gradients are approximated with increasing accuracy. R-linear convergence and worst-case iteration complexity is investigated in case of strongly convex objective function. Numerical results on well known binary classification problems are given to show the effectiveness of this framework and analyze the effect of different spectral coefficient approximations arising from the variable sample nature of this procedure. Key words: spectral gradient methods, subsampling strategies, global convergence, nonmonotone line search.
