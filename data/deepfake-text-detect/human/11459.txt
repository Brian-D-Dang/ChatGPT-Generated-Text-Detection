NASA has given SpaceX approval to launch its first astronauts into space. There are still additional reviews to be completed, but there should be no major issues standing in the way of the launch. Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will fly to the International Space Station on May 27th. The Crew Dragon program has been in development for six years. It is part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which enlists private companies to make spaceships to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS.
