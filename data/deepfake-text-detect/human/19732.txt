Okay Ill start of by admiting that there are older bands that are recognized and famous all over the world for being pioneers in certain areas and doing things never done before. The electric guitar and the rock as we know today really only started becoming known in the 60s. I like Queen or ACDC because of the vocals and guitar solos which are just epic. Pink Floyd for instance started the whole psychedelic rock scene and they managed to create music like no other before and are still pretty unique. Ill also admit that most of todays most popular music are just mass produced pieces of crap that are extremely simple and with nothing but money in mind that will be forgotten in a matter of months (When was the last time you heard Party Rock Anthem?) BUT There is still lots of good music to be found and just because the crappier, more superficial music is the only we hear in the radio doesnt mean the rest is crap. What I mean is that most people say that they just dont make good music anymore, nothing that compares to said classic bands and that electronic music is shit. I listened to some Rolling Stones and really it wasnt nothing special for me. Just a cool beat with Jaggers typical voice. Same for Stairway to Heaven of Zeppelin. They are cool, but "Best band evah!!!1" ? I just dont get it What for instance makes these bands that much better then a modern rock band like Muse? Or why is EDM looked so down upon when its actually very hard to produce a good song with soul and feeling like deadmau5? CMV:)
