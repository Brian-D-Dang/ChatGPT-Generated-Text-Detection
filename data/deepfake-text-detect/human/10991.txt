You pay the tax rate for each bracket only on the money that falls in that bracket. So if you make 8926 (the brackets have raised over time), you would pay 10 on 8925 of that, and 15 on the remaining 1. There is no way to get more take home pay than someone in a higher tax bracket.', " Is it possible to get more take home pay than someone in a higher tax bracket? It isn't. Let's simplify the tax brackets for the purpose of this discussion: Up to 50k - 10 50k and higher - 20 So if you're making 20k, you'll take home 18k (taxed 2k) If you're making 50k, you'll take home 45k (taxed 5k) If you're making 60k, you'll take home 45k 8k 53k (taxed 5k on the amount up to 50k, and taxed 2k on the extra 10k). Let me know if that makes sense. The key thing to realize is that in general you're not punished for making more money.
