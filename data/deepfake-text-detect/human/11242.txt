A hacker claims to have stolen over 500GB of data from Microsoft's private GitHub repositories. The hacker had originally intended to sell the information but has now decided to give it away for free. A small code sample from the hacker showed nothing that seemed significant. Security experts are concerned that there may be some private API keys or passwords accidentally left behind in the repositories. It is unlikely that the leak is real as Microsoft has a rule that its GitHub repositories be made public within 30 days.
