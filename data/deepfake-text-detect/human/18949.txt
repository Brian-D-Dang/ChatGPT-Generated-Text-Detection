This applies to every comparable situation just taking smoking as example. I believe that terminally ill lung cancer patients should be allowed (by society) to continue smoking if they want to. I'm not a smoker and I really dislike smoking in general, however I believe that people should should be able to decide for themselve since their is no defined way to live someones life every life is individual. And if someone enjoys to continue smoking because he enjoys it then said person should be able to do so without being criticized. Also why should a person suffer from withdrawal symptoms for something they don't want to get rid off in the first place. If someone decides to die some years ealier for something he enjoys then it's the person's decision which should be completely fine.
