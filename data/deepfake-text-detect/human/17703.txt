Whatever form the hell takes be it literal torture or internal anguish is irrelevant. Whilst the vast majority of people who believe in the idea of a Hell for non-believers do not actually want anyone to go there and do try to 'save' people from that they still endorse the system. They still believe it morally acceptable for billions of people to be permanently tortured or tormented for not believing a certain way or being in a certain mindset. To me, this is little different than someone endorsing the actions of a tyrant who imprisons political dissidents, except this is literally on a global even galactic scale and the means used far outdo any means that these worst dictator has ever used. These people are both endorsing torture and thought-crime and society should hold their positions in contempt far more than it does now. The position should not be treated with respect, nor consideration and I personally am inclined to shun people who think this. In terms of what it means, it is one of the most repugnant and revolting beliefs one can have. There is no tragedy in human history that even comes close to it. Note: I am not including people who believe in Annihilationism (I have issues with that, but not to this extent) or a non-eternal Hell as a form of cleansing (I also have issues with that, but not to this extent) nor people who believe only people who have committed really bad acts go to hell regardless of their metaphysical beliefs.
