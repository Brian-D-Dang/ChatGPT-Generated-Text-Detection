It should be noted that I'm late twenties and I have a toddler, so sexting was not a thing when I was growing up, but I have thought about it at length as a parent, and I've decided that I will not punish my son for sexting, or even recommend that he not do it (within reason of course). I'm very interested in having my view changed on this, because I want to be the best parent possible. I will of course, explain how it should only be with people he trusts, how it can be shared and all the other concerns I can think about. This would be consistent with my overall strategy on this, which I won't get into, but let's just say I'm very sex-positive and I will give him tonnes of education about it with no embarrassment or shame. When I was growing up, we would play truth or dare, "seven minutes in the closet" and all manner of very sexually experimental activities. I believe that these sorts of activities are perfectly normal for teens, and as long as they are done from an informed state of mind consensually with trusted friends, no pressure, and the knowledge that one can say "no" at any time they are not harmful at all, and probably even beneficial. Change my view.
