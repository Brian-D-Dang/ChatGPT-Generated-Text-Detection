The 29-year-old limped off after just seven minutes of the 2-0 win over Leicester City on Sunday. A Premier League winner while on loan at Leicester last season, Dyer will have surgery in due course. The former Southampton player has featured in five games since Paul Clement was appointed Swans manager last month. "The initial prognosis is it doesn't look good," Clement said. Swansea are also without fellow wingers Jefferson Montero (torn hamstring) and Mo Barrow, who is on loan at Leeds United.
