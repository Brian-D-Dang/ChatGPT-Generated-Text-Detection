I was listening to NPR yesterday and they were discussing a situation in Hollywood where a casting agency casted a white stunt double for a black character and having the white stunt double covered in black skin tone makeup to make her fit the roll. People are going nuts over the painting her black. I never understood why people freak out over "black face" if it's not meant to be derogatory. I mean, if they couldn't find a black woman that fit the part of the stunt double, then they couldn't fulfill the part. I don't see people flipping out over fat suits or fat makeup in movies, or wigs even. I don't see anything wrong with changing someone's appearance with makeup for a role in any case, including race... Change my view?
