Back in 2012, my friend got pissed that I didn't vote. She told me that I was squandering the rights afforded to me as an American, and that it was people like me that slow necessary changes from occurring. In my opinion, I am just a single person who couldn't be inconvenienced to get registration, learn issues, take sides, stand in a line and cast a ballot, etc. My single vote will probably never decide the outcome of any governmental election, so why should I even bother? Is casting a single vote worth wasting a couple hours of my time? Edit: I know the "If everybody thought like you did..." argument all too well. However, I don't care what a mass of people think. I want to know how does MY vote matter? My single, puny vote, among a hundred million others, swept away in a sea of insignificance .
