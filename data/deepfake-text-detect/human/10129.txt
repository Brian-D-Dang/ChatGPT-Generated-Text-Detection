I just moved into a new apartment and the fridge-freezer that came with the unit has the freezer on top and the fridge on the bottom as opposed to the opposite, which is what I had at the last place I lived. My reasons for arguing that freezer on bottom is superior are several: 1. 90 of the time you will be interacting with the fridge, not the freezer, so it makes sense to have it eye level. When the fridge is on the bottom of the unit and not the top, most average-sized people have to bend down to see what's inside, which is less than ideal. 2. Freezer on bottom allows you to make use of a sliding drawers arrangement like [this] rather than an open door arrangement like [this.] The former arrangement gives you greater access to more shelf space, since you will never have to reach around something to get at something else at the back of the freezer, you can just slide the drawer out and grab it off the top. 3. If the power goes out, you want the things that need to stay the coldest to be on the bottom. Heat rises, and so it makes sense to keep the frozen items on the bottom so that if your power goes out, they will stay cold the longest. [See uNaturalSelectorX's comment.] Hello, users of CMV!
