Dear rcmv It is my belief that people with disability such as being unable to walk, talk and so on do not really deserve any special treatment apart from those that enable them to have an equal footing within the society (i.e. wheelchair access to public buildings). I'm not talking about the government funding to allow wheelchair access to all the buildings and whatnots either- but rather, about things like disabled parkings and the widespread attitude about 'oh the disabled people have it harder than us so we should respect them'. What I really want to get across here is that because someone has lost an arm or a leg and they lived to tell the tale, it doesn't make them more heroic than everyone else who have their own troubles and obstacles they need tackle every freakin' day. I feel that by making heroes of the disabled people, we are trivialising everyday struggles that all of us equally share (to a degree). Sure, doing chores without an arm or a leg is more difficult than to do so in a more whole body; but so is scraping a living on measly income and juggling time between work and home. We, as people, should draw the line between enforcing equity (equal footing) and blatant spoon-feeding. For example, I feel the 'disabled' parking spots are a joke. I mean, why don't we start having 'for bad drivers' spots reserved as well? rcmv, CMV.
