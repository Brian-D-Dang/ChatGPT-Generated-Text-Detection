I believe that most debates between unimportant people are pointless because the outcome is almost always inconsequential. I also don't see any real benefit to changing my view because I'm not important either, but give it a try. I would like to add that I'm not overly apathetic, shallow or boring, I just don't see how debating changes anything for the better in the case of most people. If you like arguing and you like winning arguments, good for you, but that just makes it like any other game or sport, and the outcome of those usually don't matter either. Change my view, but it's not important if you fail or succeed. EDIT: I've read the same old arguments that people always use when I say I think debates are pointless, and I'm still not convinced.
