It seems to me that nearly all high schoolers, at least at some point in their schooling, learn a classical musical instrument, and only 0.01 of them will end up in a symphony orchestra. For the rest it's a waste of time, a massive waste of money, it pressures them during school when they really should be having fun, and can cause disappointment if their parents have high expectations. Even with 'rock' instruments, you're only going to get somewhere if you have motivation, not because your parents told you to learn the instrument, and if you're motivated, you'll learn the instrument on your ownorganise lessons yourself, so there's no point. Learning an instrument doesn't even teach you valuable skills that apply to the rest of life. The ability to keep time? The ability to read sheet music? None of that matters. Maybe little things like hand-eye coordination but you could improve that by playing wii sports and have fun at the same time.
