So by my understanding anyone on Reddit can create any subreddit they want, and govern by their standards. If I want to start a sub dedicated to Arnold Schwarzenegger quotes, that's fine. The issue seems to be that there are many, many subs on Reddit that are absolutely insidious. I don't even want to link to them because I don't want them in my browser history, but I'm talking about the sludge of society: racism, homophobia, inciting violence, and all kinds of other truly fucked up things. There's a sub on here that's main purpose is to be hugely racist to black people (probably more, but only one I know of). There's another sub that's main purpose is saying it's cool to beat trans people to death. I'm all for freedom of speech, but I don't like the message Reddit sends by saying it's OK to have subs that are this hateful. I think by ignoring them, they are in some ways validating them and saying they are as acceptable as, say, a sub about knitting. What can these subs possibly be adding to the Reddit community? ETA: OK I'm going to bed, but feel free to continue adding to the discussion. I really enjoyed reading your replies, so thanks for the contributions!
