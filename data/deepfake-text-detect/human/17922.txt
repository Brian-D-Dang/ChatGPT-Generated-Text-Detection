I was formerly of the opinion that prostitution should be legalized and regulated, and that this would improve the situation of the prostitutes by giving them more autonomy, lower the potential for exploitation, and give them the ability to work safely, and it would improve the situation for Johns because they get slightly more assurance that they won't get a disease, and it would be impossible to stop them from buying sex anyway. Then I read this article: It hasn't swung my view all the way to the other side, but I definitely no longer believe it is guaranteed to be a good idea, and whether or not it turns out well could depend on a lot of things. Ideologically I think prostitution should be allowed, but to me, practical concerns trump ideological ones and if legalizing prostitution would be harmful in practice then I think we should keep it illegal. I want to believe it will be helpful in practise though. I'm Canadian for reference.
