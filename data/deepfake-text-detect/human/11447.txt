Airseas' Seawing is a parafoil kite designed to attach to ships to reduce emissions on shipping trips by up to 20. It can be mounted onto the deck of any ship type. Shipping accounts for more than 2 of global carbon emissions and between 10 to 15 of the world's sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions.
