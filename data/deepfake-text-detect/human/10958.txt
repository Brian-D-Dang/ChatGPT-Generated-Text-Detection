So they start healing from a sort of tearingripping. It takes a while to send the right stuff to your muscles. There is a term for it called doma. (edit: doms) It is a reaction to injury that your body firsts tries to heal neutrally, it is though once injured and not being repaired you get hyperalgesia, which basically your body trying to stop infection, thus causing the pain. It really isnt known.
