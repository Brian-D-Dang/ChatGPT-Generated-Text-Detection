I don't personally feel that the arguments against meat eating (morality, sustainability) have enough depth andor meaning that directly affects me or others around me to make me feel as though I don't want to eat meat. I honestly do want this view changed or at least challenged cause I feel as though the majority of arguments I have heard have been weak and haven't appealed to me, but I am quite naive about the subject overall. I eat meat because it's delicious, less effort and price isn't really a thing for me as I am 17 and living with my parents, but why shouldn't I eat meat?
