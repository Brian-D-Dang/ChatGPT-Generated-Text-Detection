From his personality to the way he handled Southern Succession there is nothing to dislike about him. He had intelligent, moderate religious views, he was compassionate and held the moral high ground (He criticized the American annexation of Mexico) and he literally died for the preservation of the United States. I think if he lived we would have avoided the problems of Reconstruction. To top it all off, he literally is the highest rated president among scholars on history. So change my view.
