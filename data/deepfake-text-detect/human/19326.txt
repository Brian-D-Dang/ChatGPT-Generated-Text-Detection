My friend posted [this] on Facebook and I don't understand why it would matter what gender you think is right rather than how you were born, or why they would care. People are generally born either physically male or female, if you think you're anything else there is nothing wrong with that. I sure as hell don't think these individuals should be discriminated either against as they should have the same rights as anyone else. What I don't get is how anyone would consider it discrimination if they don't have the ability to put agender, transgender, genderfluid ob there. From what I know, employers are only concerned with what physical gender you are due to possible health insurance reasons. I want to understand and be open minded, change my view. Edit - My view has been changed! Thank you for helping me open minded:
