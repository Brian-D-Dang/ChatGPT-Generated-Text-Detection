On the beach in particular this really gets to me, not sure why. Sure if a babytoddler is getting changed and is naked with their family for a few minutes that's okay. But it's when they're sitting in the sand, running to and from the sea, just generally being in public naked I find awful. If an adult (on a public, non-nude beach) ran around naked and were exposing their body, people would feel it was inappropriate, as their families and children see in real life a woman's boobs or a man's penis, or asses, they'd want to protect their children from seeing it. Plus they would think badly for the person for allowing themselves to be naked on a family public beach. How come babies can do it? What if a beach that day had a peado on it? Just because your child is young and innocent does not mean they can run around naked! Clothes were made to cover our bodies up, in one way or another. Why do parents feel its okay to not cover up their children? I'm very curious to hear people's opinions and the other side of this argument. EDIT: Just so everyone knows, I do not sexualize children, thats gross EDIT2: Another reason I do not like it is because it draws unnessecary attention to the children, from anyone including the creeps out there. FINAL EDIT: You guys all have reasonable arguments I guess, but I find personally seeing children naked makes me uncomfortable as well as other reasons Ive mentioned. Dont think my view has changed though! Thanks for contributons:)
