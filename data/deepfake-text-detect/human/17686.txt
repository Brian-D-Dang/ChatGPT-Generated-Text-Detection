I went to plenty of presentations of these "opportunities" when I was in my teens and tried to act as the voice of reason to my friends who took me to them. Not only was I smart enough to see right through the scheme, but the business they were promoting just didn't make sense with so many participants involved. Selling knives? Come on... Well, last night I went to one that almost changed my view on it. Not because I didn't think it wasn't the same (it was), but because the product sold seemed possible with the people I know. I figured, if the numbers were true, I'd get my ROI and more within a month. They have the same recruitment bonuses as every other scheme, so that would be a great incentive. Anyway, I had never been open minded about these businesses, but now I could consider some arguments. CMW
