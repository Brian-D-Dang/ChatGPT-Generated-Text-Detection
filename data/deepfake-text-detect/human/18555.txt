As a preface, my sentiments merely come from my personal observations, so I don't have figures and stats to back them up (hence the desire for the CMV). When I spend time with a vast majority of my friends (aged 20-24), I find that they spend most of their time together on their phones talking, snapchatting, tweeting, what have you, to people that aren't in the room. Aside from being rude, I think the prevalence of this phenomenon is a force to be reckoned with. I find that my generation's obsessions with their social media (myself included) is diminishing our ability to have real conversations with other people and express how we feel genuinely to them. Our cell phones dilute emotion to a point where so much gets lost in translation whereas a real conversation would clear up most confusion. It scares me because it is much easier to Facebook unrelated people and avert the issue rather than confront issues or people in person. This to me seems like a numbing addiction. I might be rambling, but I fear for the day when having actual conversations becomes passe; as if it were an outdated way of communication, and when we then lose the ability to connect with the people around us on a real emotional level.
