If I could give this company Zero stars I would. I signed up with them in October of 2011. It took until May of 2012 for my installation to be complete. Building inspectors and APS inspectors showed up randomly to meet with them at my property and they never bothered to show up. This happened about four times. Even the building inspectors were exasperated by the end. A year after installation I noticed I wasn't producing what I should based on the contract and called Sunpower (manufacturer of the system). It took over 6 weeks for Arizona Solar Concepts to send someone out, and that was after I called weekly and finally sent a letter to Sunpower threatening Arbitration. They sent someone out without setting an appointment with me and when they showed up I was on my way to work and couldn't stay. They never called me or notified me of the results of their inspection. Sunpower called me two weeks ago to follow up that everything was complete. I told them I had no idea since no one has contacted me. I still have heard nothing. RUN! Don't walk away from this company. It is run either by the Three Stooges or the Keystone Kops. I haven't figured out which yet.
