The purpose of Jail is not to punish or torture, so why force someone to live out their lives like that if they don't want to. Society is safe (a big argument for the "actual" death penalty) and everyone walks away happily except potentially some friends of the deceased. Who is spending his entire life in jail. There are exceptions like parole and being found innocent, but if they can be judged to reasonably decide to die instead of spend their life waiting for the exception, why not let them?
