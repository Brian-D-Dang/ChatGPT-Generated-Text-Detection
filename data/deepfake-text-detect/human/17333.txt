Like Judith Thomson, I believe that accepting whether or not a fetus is a person is irrelevant to the topic of abortion because personhood isn't the focal point of which the morality of abortion depends. Such an example would be that if you were to be fused to a person that was dependent on you for 9 months, and after that point would be fine if you unhooked yourself, and die if you unhooked yourself earlier. Under this scenario, even if we were to say that the person providing the life saving support did so willingly, that person may cancel that arrangement because they are under no obligation to provide it in the first place.
