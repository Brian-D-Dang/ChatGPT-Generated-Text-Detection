I think having political parties do not encourage voters to properly know about a candidates proposals. I believe people just go for the party because it resembles their belief, without taking into consideration that every politician has different approaches to each subject. The solution should be to have every candidate run on their own as independents. This way, people actually have to listen to what their ideas are, and not just the color of the tie they're wearing. I also believe that this does not tie down a politician to follow what the party believes, but what he believes. I also believe that parties make it easier for a bunch of politicians to abuse a system for their own personal gains, making corruption easier for people in power. Now, under this system of independents, all these problems will not be abolished, but rather make it harder, since you are a person with ideas and not a conglomeration of people. CMV!!!
