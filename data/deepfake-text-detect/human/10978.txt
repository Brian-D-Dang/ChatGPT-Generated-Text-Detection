There are two types of light sensitive cells, one that react to intensity of light in whole visible spectrum, but cannot recognise colour (animals that see in black and white have only those), the other react only for certain part of spectrum sou you can actually see colours. There are 3 types for Red, Green and Blue part of spectrum. The ratio of cells is something around 3:6:1 for R:G:B. This may differ a bit from one human to other. In your case it seems its differ from eye to eye. So in your left eye there is more of the cells sensitive to blue colour then in the other. That makes left see more blue and the right to see more yellow when you use only one eye. The yellow light is combination of red and green light.', "I have this effect on my eyes too. I'm not really sure what is going on so I would like to know as well. This sentence is extra because I have no clue how long a comment needs to be to not be deleted.,This isn't really an answer to your question, but I have noticed this phenomenon myself, though it's usually temporary. In my case, I have an explanation that probably isn't true for most people. I work as a TV camera operator, and most of the cameras I use have a small black-and-white LCD screen (behind a diopter) in the viewfinder. However, this LCD screen (like most LCD screens) has a blueish tint. I use my right eye to look in the viewfinder, and I've noticed after extended times at work that my right eye will take on an orange cast to compensate for the bluish tint of the LCD. By comparison, my left eye looks "blue." This phenomenon isn't permanent though. I only really notice it the rest of the day after a long day at work. When I have days off, it usually goes away.
