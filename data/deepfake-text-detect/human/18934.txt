It is simply true that everyone isn't equal. Some people have biological advantages w.r.t. intelligence and physique. The reason I get behind equal rights is simply because I think everyone deserves equal opportunity in spite of their talents. I'm not even claiming that I know the truth of how equal people are, but I can't get behind denying someone rights because they may be inferior. That is all. To give an example - if the foundation for equal rights for blacks and whites is that they are equal - if research presents itself that they statistically aren't - it would damage the case.
