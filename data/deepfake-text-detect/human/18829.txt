Because there are so many career politicians that know what they are doing and decide not to run for presidency, they may be harming us, because lots of other people who think they are not worthy are doing so as well. Only people who are foolish enough to think they can run an entire country are doing so. Take the exchange of the president of Ecuador with John Oliver of Last Week Tonight as an example. You may ask, will a person who is elected and doesn't want to take office just not do anything? And to that, I say no, because that would land the country in chaos. They would feel morally charged to do what they can, with the support of a nation saying that they probably can do the best job. As many people have said, "only a fool thinks he's a genius." By only allowing people who think they're electable, we're missing out on better candidates. CMV Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
