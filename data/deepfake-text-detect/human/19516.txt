the military has more weapons than the citizens do so over throwing the govenrment just sounds insane, as well would be illegal. only people with an actual need for guns should have them since we have so much violence with guns in america, making it easy to get them just puts people in danger. I belive if we ban guns, eventually the bad cities will become bettr due to less crime and thus sustain the economy with more people wanting to visit a now safer city, which would lead to more police being able to be hired and keep the city even safer.
