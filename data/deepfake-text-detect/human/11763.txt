An engineer at a startup that is planning an exit asks others for experiences for how their workplaces changed after other startups either sold via IPOs or changed ownership in other ways. In general, employees saw productivity in the company drop as people focused less on working and more on the potential money coming in. They planned more for their futures and had less urgency in developing products. Some companies had slower transitions, but eventually, they all saw a similar drop in productivity until the sale and transitions were complete and new management was installed.
