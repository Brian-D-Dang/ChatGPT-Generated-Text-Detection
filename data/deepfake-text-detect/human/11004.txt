Federal law supersedes state law, and cannabis, for medical or recreational use, is still prohibited by federal law. The reasons they give for keeping it illegal never hold water, though. Obviously some people benefit from its medicinal use. Personally I think it's only a matter of time before it is legalized on a federal level.,One argument I have heard is that marijuana is a poor medication. The main method of taking it is smoking it, in which you burn the plant and all sorts of unknown (and known) chemical reactions take place and exactly how much of, and what exactly you are inhaling is not consistent. Even if taken by another less harmful way (via oils or vaporizing) there is no way to really control the dose (or how much) of the active ingredient (the chemical doing the work) you are getting. An analogy is the willow tree, which contains a chemical commonly known as Aspirin. You could take extracts or poultices of willow bark and potentially have the same effect as a aspirin pill, however there is no way to know exactly how much aspirin you are getting or what other chemicals might be present. Modern medicine prefers precision in its medications so that it can try and give you the appropriate amount, this is easiest with a standard amount delivered in a pill, which is available for marijuana in the Marinol pill which I think contains just delta-9-THC, the main active chemical in marijuana.', "There are many, MANY other medicines that treat the same symptoms. From a medical point of view, there isn't anything marijuana can do that another medication doesn't already do better.," "I think a part of it is the Federal government doesn't want to back down, or be seen as weak. Kind of like what parents do sometimes.
