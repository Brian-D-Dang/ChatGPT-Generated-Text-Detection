I have recently been told that my pro-life position is "forcing my ideas on others." I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary. This " forcing ideals on others" is an argument I hear often and I just want to understand it better. I believe that a fetus is a human being. I confess, that is my view, not everyone's view. I believe an abortion is the murder of that child. This is still my view. Not everyone's. United States law entitles all humans to life. Passing legislation opposing abortion is simply following that idea in my way. I am not forcing anyone to agree with me. I am simply making sure the law is followed as I read it. For a hypothetical: It's 1870 and there is a white who believes that black people are subhuman (not so uncommon at the time). If I say no they are not subhuman. They are human beings and I will prosecute you if you kill them am I " forcing my ideals on them" or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life. And even if I am "forcing my ideals" on the man isn't it necessary to do so? The abortion debate is a matter of whether the fetus is indeed entitled to the rights of a living human. It has nothing to do with a group forcing it's ideas on another and such statements are only used to unjustly vilify the pro-life movement.
