Red, green, and blue (RGB) are the primary colors for light (i.e., additive color). In this case, "black" is the absence of any light, and "white" is 100 of all three colors. Cyan, yellow, and magenta (CYM) are the primary colors for pigment (i.e., substractive color). In this case, "white" is the absence of any pigment, and "black" is 100 of all three pigment colors. Each of these pigments get their color from absorbing one of the primary light colors, and reflecting the other two. Thus cyan is the mix of green and blue (absorbs red), yellow is the mix of red and green (absorbs blue), and magenta is the mix of red and blue (absorbs green). The "K" in CYMK is "black." Printers will often add a separate reservoir of black ink for darker shades of color and for black white printing. EDIT: Bolded some terms and added language for clarity.
