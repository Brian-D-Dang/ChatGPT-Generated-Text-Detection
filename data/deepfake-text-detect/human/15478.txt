I've been going to Tum Nak Thai for over 4 years now, and would not go anywhere else! This place is by far the best Thai food I've ever had. I've taken multiple people here who have not tried Thai food before and they all get turned into Thai fanatics! I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for real authentic Thai food. The food is made fast, taste amazing, and is very well priced!
