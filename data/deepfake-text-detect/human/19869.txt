Genderless January has come to a close, and as promised, we're now looking for feedback from the community. In terms of traffic, it looks like the number of visits dropped a little but not dramatically. Here are the past 4 months: date uniques pageviews January 379,369 1,436,927 December 400,616 1,610,041 November 353,641 1,534,565 October 378,826 1,608,060 The fact that there weren't any particularly debatable happenings in the news probably also contributed. In terms of moderator actions (removing posts or comments, or approving those that have been reported either by users or the automoderator) the data is almost eerily unchanged.

Was it a nice change of pace, or a horrible stifling of views? Should we "rest" other topics as well? Is there a way we could have handled it better? Please, let us know what you think.
