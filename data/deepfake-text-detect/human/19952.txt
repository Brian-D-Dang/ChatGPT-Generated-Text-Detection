I find spending money on clothes to excess, to be something that should be tried to be avoided of. I suppose it's acceptable if one gains from purposeful dress, contentment andor other types of positive emotions, to 'express themselves' - but I think that's all rather narcissistic, to put so much viewable expense on being a walking receipt; (that is unless one didn't have to purchase the worn clothes). For me, all that I gain out of clothes-wearing, is utility, in having myself kept warm and appropriately snug, covering me from rainfall, and just in me having done the bear minimum, to have people not gawk at me, for either being too showy, or cheap-looking. I don't think it's anything reprehensible per se, to try and go about a short cut of having a viewable representation of oneself; but given that clothes shopping in modernwestern culture, has proven itself to be so prevalently time consuming, and wasteful of ones funds, I think it ought to be avoided for that very reason. Yes clothes are refundable, but what then should go in place of the refunded clothes? More impermanent clothes? One can't go without clothes, but can go without a stuck up poster of one's favourite band. It's why I propose that more people should opt for utility, or non-labelled clothing, over latest fashion trends. I'm far less tempted to buy into forever-moving fashion trends, with how I go about the whole business of dressing myself. tl;dr: Utility is best in clothing, as it serves to being cheaper
