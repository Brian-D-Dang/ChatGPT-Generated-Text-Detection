About Chandra 1. I tested the new chandra in Jund midrange in both standard and modern. 2. Aside from some random matchups (aka I cant stop someone from playing AoS) I have a way better match up against control and absolutely murder other midrange decks (especially in mirror matches). 3. I look at the top jund list of recent GP and world championship, and there are people playing underworld connection or bloodgift demon, which gives you what chandra gives you, which is card advantage, except they're almost strictly worse, I dont understand... 4. It's a card that absolutely murders other planeswalkers by the plus ability. 5. Hell I took a bob out in modern jund and play 2 chandra, because late game with the field empty, I top chandra means I just won. while bob at late game means you kill yourself. About the MTG community 1. I am a player and a sorta vendor. mtg players are fickle, so hard! 2. M14 has a bunch of viable good cards, and I heard from the event organizer at the FNM I played at (he's a good player) that M14 is a bad set. I heard this from multiple decent players. 3. People will not jump onto MWS and test a card to see if it's really not good, they would just say it's not good. (I mean I'm slightly guilty of this from time to time) 4. When a pro player top at a big PTQ or GPT or PT or GP, then all of a sudden the price of those cards shoot up insanely, and all of a sudden everyone knew from the start that xyz cards were good to begin with. I swear I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.
