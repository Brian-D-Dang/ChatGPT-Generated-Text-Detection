Meek Mill was mad that Drake didn't tweet his new album, and claimed that Drake used a ghost writer for his new song. Drake responded with a freestyle called "Charged up." Everyone expected Meek Mill to respond that Monday, but his new diss track was delayed. That Thursday Drake dropped "Back to Back," and Meek Mill became Weak Mill. Then Meek Mill dropped his diss track which was weak, and Drake was 6 God. Finally Drake made a mixtape with Future; a rapper who just last year hated Drake. Tl:Dr; 6 God Wrecked Weak Mill's career because of twitter beef.
