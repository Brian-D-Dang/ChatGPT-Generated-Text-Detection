Oh, that poor, oppressed, Christian majority! How dare any JCPenney or Best Buy cashier diminish the birth of Jesus Christ by acknowledging that not everyone is non-secular...or possibly said employees, are just being...you know...polite? I believe it is an entirely manufactured controversy designed to draw ratings to conservative media outlets and stoke fearanger in right-wing Christians who worry they are losing the country to atheists and that Sharia law is creeping into America. CMV. Seriously...
