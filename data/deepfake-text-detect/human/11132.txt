not sure, but I think it's because water particules move fasterare more excited, so it can break the sugar easier. Now someone have to confirm this:),Well, heat just means that the little bits of water are moving faster. The faster the water bits move, called molecules, the faster they latch onto the sugar bits (sugar molecules). Edit: I might have overdone the eli5 level of explanation.
