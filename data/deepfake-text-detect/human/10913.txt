Like you're Five: On the day you get your allowance, you buy a bag of candy. The next day, you want more candy, but you spent your allowance, so you ask your brother if you can borrow his allowance, and pay him back with your next allowance. You buy another bag of candy. The next day you ask your sister if you can borrow her allowance, and promise to pay her back when you get your allowance. You buy another bag of candy. When you finally get your allowance, you realise you're in trouble - you can't pay your brother and your sister. You get so worried about it that you go buy a bag of candy instead. When you get home, you get in a big fight with your brother and sister about it. When your Mom asks what you're fighting about, your brother and sister tell her that you borrowed money and you won't give it back. She asks you why not, and you say that you spent all of the money on candy, and you don't have any money left. She sighs, and makes you give all the candy you have left to your brother and sister. They want to know when they get their money back, and she tells them the money is gone, and they need to stop fighting with you and forgive you. They say that that isn't fair, and she says that it really isn't, and that they should remember this the next time you ask them for money.
