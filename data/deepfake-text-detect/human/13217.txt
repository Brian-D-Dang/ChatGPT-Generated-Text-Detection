I thought I was invincible. If Death couldn't take me, then who could? No death-defying challenge was passed by, no game of Russian Roulette refused. I had beaten Death. Nothing could take me. Except, of course, that all ended when I found out something could. Cut to now. I'm running for my life - or perhaps, existence is a better term - the word'life' is pretty much meaningless without the threat of death hanging over my head. I can hear them behind me. They're getting closer now, and I don't think I can escape this one. There won't be any games, any calculated moves, any checkmate that can help me now. The most terrifying part is that I have no idea what will happen to me once they catch me.
