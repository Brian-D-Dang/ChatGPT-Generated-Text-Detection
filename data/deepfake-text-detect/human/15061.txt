These guys are thieves! I accompanied my wife to the store one day to have a headlight bulb installed. I tried but was afraid I'd break something, so we let them do it. The 25 installation charge wasn't the problem; the problem occurred when the service technician approached my wife and told her she needed a new set of tires and her AT fluid flushed, along with an oil change. Our oil is full synthetic and was just changed 2 months prior and only accumulated 3,000 miles since then. The AT has absolutely no issues and shouldn't be flushed so soon; absolutely no reason. The tires had tons of available tread on them, so we went around the corner to discount tires, where they told us we didn't need tires for at least another 20,000 miles! Go figure. Pep Boys Technicians have little honesty.
