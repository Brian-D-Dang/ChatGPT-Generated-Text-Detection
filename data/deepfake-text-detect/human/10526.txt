In 2008 the network began to go downhill with a revamp of shows, creating more reality television and sensationalized stupidity than ever in the past. It could be because the ratings for educational shows versus trashy TV were such that the former was lost in favor of the mass appeal of the latter. As sad as that may be, it wouldn't be a surprising motivation. It's also possible that Discovery Channel had too much of the nature documentary niche for Animal Planet to share, so it was forced to differentiate and snatch up different viewers.
