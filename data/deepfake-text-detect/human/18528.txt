First of all, I think that all drugs should carry the same legality as alcohol does in the US. It seems that there are plenty of people that cite all the potential harms that illicit drugs can have as rationale to keep them illegal, ignoring the harm that prohibition and criminalization causes. However, these same people either support alcohol's legality or are silent on the matter. I don't see any justification for people to simultaneously believe alcohol should be legal while thinking other drugs, such as marijuana, should continue to be illegal.
