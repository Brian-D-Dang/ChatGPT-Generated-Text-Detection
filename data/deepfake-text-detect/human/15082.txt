Love this place, eat here a least once a week. Have brought many of our friends and neighbors, they also love Las Cazuelas, food is great, the margaritas are fabulous and if you tell them on the rocks light ice they do it, also senior discount of 10, service can be slow at times because they are usually packed. I don't understand the negative reviews from some of the other comments. I give it 5 stars. One of our favorites and we eat out a lot.
