It began with the frogs. Hundreds upon hundreds of frogs enveloped the city, ready to devour anything in sight. Thankfully, this heathen city was in Florida, so everyone adopted multiple frogs and solved that mosquitocockroach problem they have going on. Outraged, The Almighty decided to turn all the rivers, lakes, and streams into pure blood!! However, it was winter season in Florida, and all this did was excited tourist to come see something else new and amazing in Florida. Within a week, profits had reached nearly peak season levels and the economy was flourishing. The popularity of the event even had FEMA and the national guard distributing fresh, bottled water all throughout the state. Then came the final plague, the death of every first born child..... Do you know how many men got relieved of child support that day??? Like literally, every man in Florida was on child support until that day. Do you know how much that helped the economy?
