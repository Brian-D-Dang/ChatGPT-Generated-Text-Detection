The Earth is overpopulated, this fact has lead to obvious present day consequences (climate change, pollution, waterfood scarcity,etc.). People, no matter how well environmentally educated they are, will consume resources, take up space, and strain the planet more than if they hadn't existed. I believe that having your own children, rather than adopting or abstaining from parenthood, shows a complete lack of compassion to your fellow man and to future generations of this planet.
