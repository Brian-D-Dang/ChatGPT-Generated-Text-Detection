So, I met this girl on Tinder. I barely remember swiping right, but I got matched with her. We've been chatting for a few weeks and I can honestly say she makes me laugh out loud almost every time we chat. She's smart and funny and we share a lot of similar interests. A couple of days ago, we met at Dunkin' for an espresso and we had a really good time (the location was convenient, don't sue us). The thing is, I can't find her attractive. I know it's shallow, but she's not my type and I would almost feel embarassed to be seen with her in public. I know we can still be good friends, but I can't shake the feeling that we could be a great couple, if her looks were different. I know I'm being shallow, so please CMV? Hello, users of CMV!
