One of the basic principles of physics is that things move in "straight lines" at "constant speed" unless there's a force acting on them. Our best theory of gravity at this time, called the general theory of relativity, states that energy (including mass) "causes spacetime to be curved," which means that what you think of as a "straight line" has to change. For example, a "straight line" on a sphere is a great circle, like the equator or a line of longitude on the earth. So near a mass, like, say a planet, things moving in "straight lines" look like their path is bent.
