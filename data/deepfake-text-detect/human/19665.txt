I'm going to start by saying you should always treat them as they wish, if they want to be called and treated as a certain gender I believe they have the right to ask and I see no reason why not to treat them as they desire. But in my head they will never be the gender they are saying they are, in my mind they will stay their original gender or be somewhere in between. I also feel that this would stop me from being romanticly interested them and I think as long as I am respectful in my rejection there is no reason that I should be ashamed of doing so. I have read similar cmv's in the past but they all seem to deal only with dating with a lot of replys saying that since they are now the other gender it shouldnt matter. But I believe that the view that they are not, as long as there is never any loss of respect, is ok, please cmv. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
