Do not even waste your time coming here. They have a large selection but it is all over priced ESPECIALLY for being a good will. You can honestly find better deals at Walmart. If you do happen to find something you want, make sure it is with it because the line being 45 minutes long was not an exaggeration. This would be a great location if they lowered their prices. It's even 3x more expensive then other goodwill locations.
