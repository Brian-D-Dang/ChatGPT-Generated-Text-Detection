Firstly, this is a discussion with personal taste, musical preference and hairstyle put aside. A 21 year old woman is being roasted alive by the press of the Western world for doing whatever it is she wants to do. To believe that she is doing wrong (general coverage of her performance at the MTV awards and more recently her 'Wrecking Ball' video), is to believe that this woman's life and personal choices should be based entirely on her fan base andor youth who she influences. Naturally these opinions are held mainly by the press, but even Reddit has found it difficult to stay neutral on the matter. My real question is, how is what Miley Cyrus does on stage, different to what Beyonce, Rihanna or Lady Gaga do? Why is Miley Cyrus the recipient of so much controversy and criticism, whilst her contemporaries are, mostly, hailed for similar eventsattributes? She was a child star, she is no longer a child. She is a young woman with her own mind, personality and desires, with her own aims in life. Sexualisation is a widely recognised product of 21st century pop music, so why is the general public in such uproar about this particular case? edit: So it seems a lot of people agree, and many people also see the fact that this topic has even been brought up as a sort of 'feeding of the media machine', and that this was all part of the plan. Maybe, there's almost definitely an element of that, but I'm not sure I'm quite so cynical as to believe that there is nothing more to it at all. Others have also expressed the opinion that it's pathetic that we're even talking about such things - to you I say, current affairs, the way audiences respond to actions, and public opinion deserves analysis, even if all we're talking about is how gullible the general public is with regard to how we should respond in given situations, it can't harm to talk about, and so it seems, many people have something to say on the matter. Thanks for all of your replies.
