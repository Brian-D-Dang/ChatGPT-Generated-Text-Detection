For those of you who don't know him Rob Walling is an OG internet small business entrepreneur, cohost of the Startups for the Rest of Us, and cofounder of Microconf. He's now starting his own accelerator Tinyseed, which will give you a year's worth of runway so you can work on your startup full-time. Definitely worth checking out if you're currently running a side project, I've been listening to his podcast for a long time and he's a really smart guy with tons of good advice.
