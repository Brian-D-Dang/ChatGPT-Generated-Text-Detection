If you think that using contraceptives like condoms, the pill, or inserts are not natural and therefore should not be used, then you should also think that infertility treatments should not be used either. If you don't want the benefit of science to help you not have children, why would you want it to help you have children? Both cases are unnatural and all I see is a hypocrite. If you have a valid reason to not use contraceptives, then thats fine, I would not call you a hypocrite. Only to the people that use the "Its not natural" argument.
