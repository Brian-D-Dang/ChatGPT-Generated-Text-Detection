I don't watch shows like these, but I feel as though shows like Dr. Phil is consisted of people who just want the fifteen minutes of fame. I can't understand how anyone would be pretentious enough to think that people care enough about their life problems to be watching it on national television, and I believe that if they actually had issues, they wouldn't want to broadcast it to the public. I'm not trying to patronize Dr. Phil's work, but I feel like families with problems should just go to a doctor who can work with them over a series of meetings.
