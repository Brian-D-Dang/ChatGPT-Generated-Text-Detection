Those who feast on boned wings are either motivated by a habit they developed at an earlier age, or out of some deeper inclination to prove their hardiness. The bone-in wing is simply an inefficient method of chicken intake. Why would you, a reasonable person, want to rip about the sinews and tongue through the bones that remind you of the sentient being that was unduly slaughtered in the name of your unnecessarily morbid diet? I don't need an existential crisis every time i'm hungry. That's not even the most disgusting aspect of the bone-in wing. It's the quasi-chicken carcass that's left over when your done eating. The discolored remnants of heterogenous chicken biology that could entice only a starving hyena. Boneless wings? Emmaculate white interior and no mess later. The meager amount of flesh evolution has granted the chicken's wing surely isn't the optimal serving size for human consumption. The effort to reward ratio per wing is extremely low. The world is yours with boneless wings. you can pack together as much meat as gravity will permit you. That's huge. Customizability. You can make your boneless wing shaped like a fucking starfish if you want, or even a boned wing. But best of all, they're [cheaper] . Please, CMV so I can stop justifying my lack of masculinity.
