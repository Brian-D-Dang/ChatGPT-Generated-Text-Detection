For every song with a positive message like 'Keep ya head up' or 'Changes', he's got 10 more that glorify gang violence and shootings. The idea that he was non-violent is totally at odds with the music he actually made. A brief glance at his [wikipedia page] will also show you that he was an exceptionally violent person: He assaulted another rapper with a baseball bat in 1993, and assaulted a film director in 1994. In both cases he plead guilty. He was also found guilty of gang raping a woman in a hotel, a crime for which he was sent to prison. With anybody else, those three crimes would be enough to judge someone as an extremely violent and unsafe person highly unsuited to be a role model for anybody, but for some reason he's earned a reputation for being some kinda hip-hop gandhi. There are plenty of legendary rappers like Mos Def, Nas and Andre 3000 whose positive messages are overlooked in favour of Tupac, despite managing to avoid assaulting or raping people. The fact that Tupac garners as much respect as he does is symptomatic of massive immaturity in certain parts of the hip-hop community.
