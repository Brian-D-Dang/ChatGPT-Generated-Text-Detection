I recently discovered rAnglish. Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots. The result is a language that not only sounds beautiful, but is much more intuitive to learn new vocabulary. Take, for example, this [list of lores] . Rather than using Greek-derived names for the sciences, which are completely meaningless to the average learner of English until they learn the name of that particular science, Anglish uses simple compounds from common, everyday words that language learners would already be familiar with. Many languages do this as well. The result of incorporating all these foreign words is that English no consistency of grammar, spelling, pronunciation, or anything. This makes it more confusing and burdensome to learn. I should specify that I'm speaking of a regulator with the goal of keeping English clear, consistent, and true to its roots. Obviously, a language regulator that pushed for the inclusion of these foreign words would be no help. It may be too late now, given the use of English as an international language, but I think it is a shame and a detriment to international communication that English wasn't standardized this way a long time ago.
