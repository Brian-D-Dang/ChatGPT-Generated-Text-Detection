The US Firearms are very popular in the US. Many people own them and you can even buy them at the supermarket. The right to own them is protected in the constitution and people fiercely protect this right. Banning them will be a very tough struggle. Passing the law will be very hard, and enforcing them might be even harder. We've seen how successful the War on Drugs was (n't). A huge black market will keep existing for a long time. Law abiding citizens might hand in their weapons, but they were never the problem. Criminals won't have a problem acquiring guns. If banning firearms has benefits for the US, they'll only appear on the very long term. On the short term, it will cost a whole lot of money and effort and it'll cause a lot of resentment. So if we ban weapons, w'll do it for the benefit of our grandchildren. But will it have much of an impact on our grandchildren? 3D-printing weapons might be very easy then. Or maybe the police uses new and incredibly efficient methods to deal with crime. Sword bans were once very important in certain countries, now nobody cares about them anymore. The UK Firearms are scarce in the UK. Barely anybody owns guns and gun crime is very low. Being a relatively small island, the UK can more easily prevent the influx of firearms. It makes sense for them not to change this, and to keep firearms restricted. Comparison It's silly to demand UK laws in the US, or US laws in the UK. There are too many differences between the nations. It makes sense for countries without guns to keep them restricted, but it also makes sense to keep guns legal if they're already very popular.
