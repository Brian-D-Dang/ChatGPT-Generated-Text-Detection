I'm not talking about the karma of a post or a comment, I'm talking about the "karmapoints" that are displayed when you visit someones profile. Karma should be a tool for visibility, but it has become the main reason for posting content, especially in the larger subreddits like adviceanimals, f7u12, pics, funny, etc. It has become the reason why jokes become old so easily, because everybody is overusing it (karmawhoring jumping on the karmatrain) to receive Karma. It also promotes reposting. It is the reason why I have left the major subreddits, the content has turned to complete shit, because of above reasons. The same goes for comments. People make witty commentsjokes (to an excesive extent) because those get upvoted the most, instead of contributing to the discussion. It is similar to money (except it makes less sense). It should be a tool, but it is controlling the way people act. In my opinion, reddits content would drastically improve if we stopped keeping score of Karma and would leave it to only have the purpose of visibility. Change my view reddit.
