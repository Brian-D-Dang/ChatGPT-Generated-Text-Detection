I have been an avid Starbucks customer for many many years now, and I have traveled to Starbucks locations all across the country on business. As this location is close to where I work, I am forced to frequent it often. It has consistently been slow and the customer service is often as ghetto as the neighborhoods which surround it. This morning, I waited 20 minutes in line and found out that this is the ONLY Starbucks in the country that won't grind a bag of coffee beans because it is not Starbucks coffee. Well Starbucks, you've lost one more customer. I won't be visiting this location again.
