Halloween is becoming a real hassle for schools. There are more and more guidelines to how kids can dress up, some have disallowed it all together. When I was a kid, the one in seven years that Halloween fell on a Saturday was basically the best day of your life. All day trick or treating, enough time to go to parades or parties. The candy lasted until Easter. As an adult it makes going to bars easier. If Halloween falls on a Wednesday do you go out to see the slutty cops and ninjas the Saturday before or after actual Halloween? I know Halloween is All Hallows Eve and is supposed to be the day before All Saint's Day. But it is nowhere close to a religious holiday anymore. Now it's just a day for fun, candy and slutty Catwomen, it belongs on a Saturday. CMV.
