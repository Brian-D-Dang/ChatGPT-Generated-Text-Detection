This comes from a person who has seen family members kill themselves, and try to kill themselves. I was also clinically depressed as a teen due to a medical diagnosis. From what I can tell of the issue; suicide is a decision a person makes when they give up. I realize that is a HUGE oversimplification of a very very complicated issue, but let me clarify my point. Suicide is related to mental illness yes, but I understand it is a choice. Mentally Ill people have chemical imbalances in their brain, but I don't think that makes them incapable of free will. They still actively chose to kill themselves in a specific way or fashion with all factors considered. A way I see it is; a drunk person is still liable for any crimes they did while drunk, even though there is an imbalance of chemicals in their brain. (Although I am unsure if that is because a person chooses to get inebriated, while a mentally Ill person is born with it) Since they have chosen to kill themselves, why don't they choose to actively improve their situation? Call me an optimist but I sincerely believe that if a person tries with the best of their ability, they can improve how they live. Now a mentally ill person may not think like that at all. But that doesn't change that they chose to die over choosing to strive for a better life. Suicide is weakness in my mind, because it is a choice. And when you have a choice between turning everything off, or 'beating the game', and you consciously choose to die, you are a quitter and that is weak. Change my view? -Edited for grammar
