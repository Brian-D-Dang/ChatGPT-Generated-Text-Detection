There's been a recent flareup about the debate over [corporate personhood] , largely based on some corporations such as Hobby Lobby claiming first amendment rights to prevent them from providing birth control as part of Obamacare-mandated health insurance. I think that while it can be useful to treat corporations as persons for tax and contract purposes, in many other respects corporate personhood is harmful. Mainly, I don't believe first amendment rights should apply to corporations (though they should apply to people within their corporations). A secular corporation cannot have a specific religion, and claiming religious protection harms people within the corporation who do not share that religion - see the Hobby Lobby case above. As well, according to Citizens United vs Federal Elections Commision, the first amendment prevents the government from limiting corporate donations to candidates. I believe this is extremely harmful because it allows corporations to influence politics to an absurd degree (in fact, I think it actually hurts the free market by allowing corporations to set up political barriers to entry). I believe corporations should have rights that are a separate category from human rights. This way, we can keep the useful taxation and contract rights and restrictions for corporations, but not afford them rights such as the above rights which ultimately hurt both people within the corporations and the economy as a whole.
