Do you think porn makes people violent, sexually estranged from reality, or degrades women? I think aggressive violent porn may contribute to violent crimes against women - but this is a small part of the industry. I would really like to hear arguments against this, I have heard some feminist arguments but I don't find their evidence supports widespread bans. I would love to be swayed on this point if there is genuine concern over its effect.
