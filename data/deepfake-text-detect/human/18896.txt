I apologise for my english, i tried my best to fix errors. The fact that you are alive means that you are capable of surviving till this moment in your given environment, if you would die the next moment that means you are not capable of surviving any more. When I say you i don't mean just what most people think they are, like their political views or religious beliefs, you are much more then that.You are a machine, hardware and software. If something goes wrong with either you can die (software: depression or suicidal thoughts, bad habits, you're not careful enough and so on, hardware: your body isn't capable of defending from diseases). Then there is one more thing your environment (where you were born,your status, economic stability and so on) on these things you don't have much control. If you adapt to your environment you will survive, if you fail you will die. Life isn't a fair game, i can survive in my environment till this moment, that doesn't mean that i will be able to survive till the next moment or in some other environment (in countries where it's harder to survive). People often think that just because someone is "bad" they deserve to die, and if someone is good they will live a long life.Nature doesn't care about concepts of good and evil, those are our concepts, we invented them to create a civilized society, they serve us.People survive because they are capable of surviving not because they are good, and they die because they aren't capable of surviving.Also we gamble a lot.We estimate treat levels all the time.When we get on the plane we know there is a chance that plane will crush or that terrorists will abduct the plane and kill all the passengers, even do it's very unlikely it could happen,we accept that risk and fly, we could be wrong then we die.
