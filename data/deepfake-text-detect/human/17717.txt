So I am a gay guy and I am starting to distance myself from the wider LGBTQ community especially from the politics of it . I used to be very active in it locally but the attitude of others has completely made me question the relevance of the movement now in the era of Same Sex marriage and stuff. I have a partner of 4 years and I was asked when we would be getting married and being disinterested in marriage I replied "never" and then would up with an internet post calling me a traitor because I don't want to be married. Recently I have noticed groups shunning people with different views from the main, like this one guy I knew who didn't want to march in pride in protest to the big sponsors and the fact they now charge for the street party Recently at least from what I have seen they seem to get all hot and bothered by UKIPPERS etc. and focus on them and then don't pay much attention to the Russia problem or the murdering of gays by ISIS etc. I honestly think the movement is dying to be honest.
