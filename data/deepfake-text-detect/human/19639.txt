I have done my research. I think that Japan's war crimes are just as horrific as Germany's. I'm an American, and culturally Jewish, religiously atheist. I think that if the Holocaust is going to be taught in public schools, then so should Japanese war crimes, because although they were a little further from home for us Americans, a select few neutral articles were enough to persuade me that they were horrible during WWII.
