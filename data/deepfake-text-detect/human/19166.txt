Hi all, this has been on my mind for a long time: I believe that even non-radical Islam is fundamentally more dangerous to Western society (i.e. its organizational principles based on Enlightenment thinking) than other religions. I believe this because the Islamic prophet Muhammad was a powerful tribal political leader and warlord, as opposed to e.g. Jesus who was more of an ascetic thinkerhermit. For this reason, Muhammad had to deal with the more practical problems of establishing and ruling an empire (caliphate). This caused him to venture far into the area of politics, in an age where the sciences and society in general were still in a more primitive state compared to the current day. Because most of Muhammad's actions throughout his life were recorded in the Quran, and because Muhammad is considered the direct messenger of God, Islam contains a very strong political component which you are forced to accept if you consider yourself a Muslim. I believe this constitutes a threat to Enlightenment thinking and politics in the West, since many Muslim political ideas are directly rooted in their belief in God (hence, they are not up for debate). Moreover, I believe that this political component is stronger than in other religions (e.g. Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism) given the nature of the main figureprophet. Please CMV.
