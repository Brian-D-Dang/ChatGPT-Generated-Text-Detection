As a straight man who got married about a year and a half ago, I think it's ridiculous how many hoops the gov't (U.S.) makes you jump through to get married. I commonly hear gay marriage advocates saying "get gov't out of our bedroom." I think this is looking at the problem backwards. Legalizing gay marriage doesn't take gov't out of their bedrooms. It does the complete opposite. I believe we need to remove the gov't from regulating marriage. Then the state will be out of all our bedrooms. Change my view.
