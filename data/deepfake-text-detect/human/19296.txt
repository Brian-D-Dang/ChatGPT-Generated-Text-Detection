Disclaimer: I'm sorry if this CMV is juvenile to you, and in some way a regurgitation of your philosophy textbook. I am a minor, and my views about the world are still forming. There are two cases involving drink driving. In case 1, the driver disobeys the societal imperative concerning drink driving and crashes into an empty bus stand, damaging his car and the bus stand. In case 2, the same driver disobeys the societal imperative also, except this time crashing into a bus stand and killing the pregnant young mother hidden inside. Legally, the man in case 1 would be charged of drink driving and damage of public property, either a fine or a short prison stay depending on the locality. The man in case 2 would be charged with manslaughter and be issued a significantly longer prison sentence. Do we just accept the utilitarian legal system in this case? There was absolutely no difference in the actions of the two men, apart from the context of their actions which they have no influence upon. Then again, it's not morally right to issue a manslaughter charge to the man in case 1 either, as punishing someone for the scope of outcomes is highly assumptive. My view is that the penalties for manslaughter should consider the commitor's adherence to duty in the initial frame of misdeed (deontological ethics). Hello, users of CMV!
