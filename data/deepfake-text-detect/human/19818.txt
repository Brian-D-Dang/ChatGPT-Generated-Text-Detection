note: modern vehicles in good working order, normal conditions. I mean apply for normal parking, not parking on a hill or with a vehicle that has special properties. I am sure a manual "emergency" break is a good thing to have, and I am not saying it is useless (though i cant help think of the Mitch Heidelburg quote "its not an emegency break but an emergency make your car smell funny So in fact I think that applying it in a vehicle used by other people is probably bad form as it is more likely to be driven with it on and thus reduce its effectiveness when needed and damage the vehicle. The only reason people are anal about it is because they are clinging to outdated info they got in drivers ed. CMV
