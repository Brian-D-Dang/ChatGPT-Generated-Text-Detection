Sorry for being as convoluted as that, but conciseness is a skill I'm currently working at. Being that we're so hooked into each others personal lives. As in, we can take in someone, in depth, in person or electronically, where we want, taking as much time as we so please with it. And with that said, I feel we've gained (since technologies' gained prominence I'd say, circa 2006) hypersensitivity to the the everlasting scrutiny of others. Beyond following trends, trendy people or trend-followers as it were, have to keep in mind, before following, to not appear to be insincere and forced in their arrival to a new fashion. In other words, to not be doing it because they're insecure and just wanting to fit in; but doing it in the name for fashion (indifference to society's cares). Yes, I'm not saying the hypersensitivity leads to anything too far off of mindlessness, but I believe there's still a enough conscious thought with involvement with conformity of dress for example, for it to still be tiring. (Sorry for not going into a great deal of depth, aside from my own viewpoint. Maybe all of you reading could help?)
