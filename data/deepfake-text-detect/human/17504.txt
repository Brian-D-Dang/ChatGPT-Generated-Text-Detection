"In an abstract sense [charity] is better than nothing" I'm currently in a class discussing corporate social responsibility and during our discussion today, we watching this video by Slavoj Zizek where he argued that charity is like morphine for pain or a bandaid on a gaping wound, it may alleviate issues in the short run but it doesn't solve anything in the long run. In fact, charity gives people the semblance that they are doing good when they are doing next to nothing. If you give a poor child a pair of shoes, it doesn't change the fact they still live in poverty albeit now with a pair of shoes. He quotes Oscar Wilde "The worst slave owners were those that were kind to their slaves" because it softened people's view of the problem while never resolving the problem of slavery. "It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property." Now God knows I'm not a socialist but Zizek and Wilde's words ring true, charity is using one hand to build up what you destroyed with the other hand, it's a zero sum game in its most basic form. I don't disagree with charity because I have a solution to poverty, which I don't and if I did I wouldn't be here, but I disagree because it doesn't solve issues, it just keeps the dying patient on life support.
