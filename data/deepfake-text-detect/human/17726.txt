My opinion: The most prestigious universities in the United States (Ivy League and other schools of similar prestige) are doing more harm than good at this point for brilliant students. The fact that there are schools that take less than 10 is insane and puts excessive levels of stress and pressure on kids who are still growing up. Students will always associate the acceptance rate with academic quality and generally do not want to go to schools with normal acceptance rates, even if that is a better atmospherefit for them. I think if the US radically shifted to an education system that did either of the following, students would have a much better process in finding the right college for them. (a) limited the of applications one student can apply to (e.g. Any one kid can only apply to five institutions per school year) (b) have the most reputable colleges (let's use Harvard as the example) build similar schools, in the same name, with the same admissions. Unlike how some state schools do this though, the focus would be to maintain the same exact level of academic rigorlearning as the parent college. That means half the professors go there, they can hire 2x as many brilliant minds to produce more research, and they can admit 2x the brilliant kids. Less stress as the application rate should, assuming no gigantic increase in applicants, double. Who loses? So, there you have it. CMV
