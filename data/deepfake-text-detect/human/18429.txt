I believe that certain people use their mental disorders as an excuse not to work, live and function just as the rest of society. There are people that choose not to be on their medications, talk to their therapists and quit their job, choosing to live off of disability handouts that the government gives them. There are people that are constantly favoring a sedentary life that lets other people pay for their lack of willingness to fix their condition, just so they don't have to do any work and everything is done for them. I understand that there are irreversible conditions where no medicine, psychological therapy or physical therapy can help, and I support them getting disability so they can have a standard of life that doesn't hurt them further. But, I believe that the government should assign case workers, just as they do for Child Protective Services, consistently checking up on the people for both surprise and scheduled visits. Why should my money, that I work hard for, go towards someone that can work hard and earn their own money, but chooses not to and blames their incapacities? Why is it my responsibility to pay for the government giving people money, but not checking what they are using that money for? I don't think it is. CMV. Editing to add another point: By creating a system that checks up on people with disabilities and assuring that they need the money, and that the money is going towards a standard of living that aids their disabilities, aren't jobs being created? By creating jobs we are helping the economy, thus killing two birds with one stone. By not giving out money to people that don't need it, we can tax people less or put their money towards other things that require attention, like homelessness. By creating that system that checks up on people we are saving people money, or putting them towards better causes, and creating jobs.
