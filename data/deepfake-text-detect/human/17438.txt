Basically, currencies are a method to exchange and store wealth. Most (if not all) currencies operate with a central bank that tries to maintain a target rate of inflation. Since the 80s, US inflation has hovered around 2, depending on the needs of the economy. It is now seen as one of the most stable places to store ones wealth, in the world. As world markets shook, everyone bought US dollars. While bitcoin may be able to send money anywhere in the world, it has no central authority to guide its inflation. It's price most recently has been trending upward, but even when it hits what may be considered a stable level, it will inevitably have major price variations that I don't believe anyone looking to protect their wealth will be able to stomach. If you disagree, please show me a publicly traded asset that has maintained a more stable growth rate than the USD. And like all publicly traded commodities, bitcoin will be subject to the same speculative bubbles as the rest. If there's something I'm not seeing, change my view. But I bet I'd be safer burying my money in a bunch of black barrels in the deserts of New Mexico. Edit: for clarity, I'm equating currency inflation with market price. I am aware there are a set number of bitcoins.
