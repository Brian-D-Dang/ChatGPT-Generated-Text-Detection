If you've been living under a rock for the past few weeks, here's some background. Edward Snowden was a contractor who worked for the NSA, the United State's security agency. He then leaked government information to the press, causing massive uproars by the people. Now, people all over the world hold him in high light and see him as a hero. However, I believe that this viewpoint is mistaken. Here are a couple reasons: 1. What he did must have been illegal in every way, considering the contracts and confidentiality forms he would have had to sign to get the job. He did, in every way, deserve to be convicted for espionage. 2. What he did was already done in a 60 minutes episode. He did nothing more than re-reveal what the public already knew. 3. There is nothing wrong with what the government is doing right now. The job of a government is to protect its citizens, and if ours must keep surveillance on us to maintain our safety, that's what it needs to do. This was clearly stated in the Patriot Act, so US citizens should not be complaining about anything new right now. Americans have been living too good for too long, we are taking everything for granted. There is no place in the Constitution that directly states privacy is protected (no, not even in the 4th amendment). What Edward Snowden did was wrong, and he deserves to be punished for it.
