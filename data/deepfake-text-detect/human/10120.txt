Hello, I'm Luke and for the longest time a small dream of mine has been to move to a Scandinavian country such as Norway, Sweden, or Denmark. From what I've heard of them they're all great countries to live in. The big thing for me is the weather and the scenery, I love cold weather and I've seen so many beautiful pictures of the forests and towns there. I'm wondering if I'm being stupid and I should just give this up because Scandinavia isn't all flowers and smiles like I think it is. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
