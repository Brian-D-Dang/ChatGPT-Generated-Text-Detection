Hello CMV I believe posts on the deceased's wall (often in the form of an image of the poster and the deceased together captioned with "R.I.P" etc.) are crude and attention seeking. They are not to deal with the loss but rather an attempt to garner sympathy from those who might read the post. I feel even more strongly about messages of condolences posted on the walls of friends and family of the deceased. This is a watered down Munchausen by proxy, I am cynical of their intentions, especially if they contain phrases such as "let me know if I can help in anyway." True mourning is not something that is so easily displayed in a public forum. Real condolences are private and are delivered in person or over a phone call, even a text message is acceptable. I want to make it clear that I think "let me know if I can help in anyway" is a beautiful thing to say to someone in mourning. To post it on a mourner's facebook wall, however, is like shouting it across the room as you make ready to leave after the funeral. edit: I remembered what "Munchausen by proxy" was. edit 2: I have changed my view on displays of mourning on Facebook walls of the deceased but not the public displays of condolences. (I also wish I could edit titles now) edit 3: I have removed the reference to Munchausen by proxy. I intended to convey some cynicism, which I still hold, but this is not the right term for it.
