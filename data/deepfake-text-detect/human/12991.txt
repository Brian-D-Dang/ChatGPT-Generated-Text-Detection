"Dahlia you will be fine. Don't worry. Our baby will be okay. He will be healthy and will be as beautiful as you." Dahlia's husband Todd said as she was being rushed into the hospital. "But honey, the limit. He-he might not make it!" She struggled to say while going the the hospital doors. "Don't you worry. It will be okay." About 15 minutes later Todd came into the room to see his wife in pain. He clutched her hand and repeated that he loved her. A nurse looked up. "The limit is still at max. Mr. James, I'm sorry to say but if someone somewhere does not pass, either your wife or your baby or both of them will die. This doesn't look good." "No. That can't be. No. Honey," Todd said to Dahlia, "I will fix this." He ran out of the room. "Wait sir-," the nurse tried to say. "Oh no, what is he doing? Todd!" Dahlia yelled out. Another 15 minutes later. Dahlia had given birth but passed out during the procedure. She had now woken up. The doctor came into the room looking very sad. "Mrs. James. I have bad news. It seems your baby didn't make it. I'm very sorry. We did everything we could." He walked out. Dahlia was shocked. She started to cry. Then a police officer walked into her room. "Mrs. James, I have bad news. It seems that your husband, in order to allow your child to live, jumped off the roof of the building. He was found only 10 minutes ago. I'm very sorry, I do hope you and your child can cope." Dahlia was not crying. She just sat there in disbelief. She had lost her not even 5 minute old child, but her husband too. This had to be a dream. And why her? suddenly she heard two nurses outside. She heard what they were saying. "Yes it's a miracle. I didn't believe it until I saw!" Said the first. "Yes, I thought they weren't going to make it." Said the second. "What's the excitement about?" Said another nurse who butted in. "It's amazing!" Said the first. "Mrs. Callahan just gave birth to two healthy twins. It was perfect timing!" Said the second.
