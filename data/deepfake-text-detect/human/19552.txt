I had an unexpected medical problem that caused me to spend a few days on my ass. I spent it watching a Netflix marathon of shows like Preppers, Doomsday Bunkers, etc. I realize these shows are entertainment and sensationalist but I think most of these people have lost touch with reality. I have no problem with people spending their own money on whatever shit they want, but most of these people have kids who are being trained at seven or eight in combat tactics (I also support the second amendment). They are also being taught to sew wounds on severed pig arms, and having the shit frightened out of them by the people who they trust the most describing the most wild eyed ridiculous ideas of civilization definitely collapsing in the near future that its hard for me to believe they are not somehow being negatively psychologically impacted. I prepare for a tornado, or a loss of electricity for a few days but bunkers with flamethrowers, spikes and ten years of food seem nuts to me. Especially when people have shitty houses and no vacations so they can pay for this crap. Change my view!
