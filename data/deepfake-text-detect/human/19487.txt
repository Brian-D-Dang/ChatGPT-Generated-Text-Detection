When attempting to generate creative solutions, it's best to keep all ideas in mind, even when one begins to judge them (one should keep them in mind and only qualify them to varying degrees). Entirely rejecting ideas or the weaker associations between different ideas, while seemingly pragmatic, only serves to stifle the creative process. Thus, I believe that overinclusiveness is one of the most necessary conditions for the creative process to occur effectively. Do you agree or disagree, and why?
