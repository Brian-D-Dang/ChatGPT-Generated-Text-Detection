I'm excluding brands like Crystal Palace, Dark Eyes etc., but even those are not THAT much worse tasting than brands like Smirnoff or Stoli. I also want to add that I think marketing is the main driver in people's perception of what is a "good" vodka versus what is "bad." Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
