Nationalism in general is harmful distinction amongst people serving only to encourage people to believe that (not necessarily even) the country they were born makes them more important better than others from different countires. This further highlights physical and cultural differences keeping race, creed and skin colour at the forefront of discrimination. Your land mass of preference is nothing more than a matter of circumstance and the nationals of your country are just as much of a burden on the planet as the foreigners these rituals imply are second rate. Edit: This has necessarily expanded into a discussion on - Social economics - Patriotism vs nationalism In terms of economics: Please assume any reference to this is intended to express public (and occasionally at a push, social) benefits. The reasoning for doing so is to hopefully highlight how national identity can be a) relative to your perceptions of "lesser countries." b) a productive of abusing of nations collections of nations. e.g, DDT ban once the rest of the world no longer needed America for its production.
