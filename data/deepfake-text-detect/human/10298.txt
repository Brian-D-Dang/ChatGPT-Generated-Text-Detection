A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was entirely removed. A good sniper has no real counter apart from another sniper, making them frustrating to play against. A majority of the other weapons have damage fall-off to discourage long-range play, further separating the sniper as a class. As far as I can tell, snipers mainly exist to pick off slow moving or high value targets, which the spy already does and does in a more interesting (to play as and against) way. I can't see any way the sniper, sitting at the back of the map away from the action, adds to the game (as a side note, I also think the removal of sniper would do nothing but good for the class diversity on pubs).
