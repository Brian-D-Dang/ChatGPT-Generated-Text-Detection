I'll start with an anecdote. An employer and employee both agree that a certain job should be paid at the wage of some amount of money lower than minimum wage. The employee agrees to accept this payment for the work being done, as does the employer. Why should the government be able to tell them that is wrong? Furthermore, the free market is able to govern itself to determine for itself what is a fare wage by what people will and won't work for. If an employer sets a wage for a certain job at an absurdly low rate, then no one will accept the job, and thus he will be forced to raise it until it someone agrees to be paid that amount. Not to mention the fact that it drives up inflation by causing the government to have to circulate an increasing amount of bills with decreased values. I just can't find a reason we shouldn't be allowed to decide for ourselves what is fair and what is not, instead of having the bureaucracy do it for us.
