N.B. I'm coming at this from a UK perspective, so we have a social safety net and the NHS. Which is great! But obesity is a preventable disease, caused in most people (I accept an extremely small proportion have medical conditions) by eating too much and exercising too little. Since on average, paying for triple bypass surgeries is far more expensive than patching someone up after an accident playing sports, I believe people should be forced to undergo supervised weight loss, or not receive treatment and benefits.
