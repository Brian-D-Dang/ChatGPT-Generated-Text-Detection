I believe in freedom. I believe that if one wants to go out and ride a bike without a helmet [ (see this post) ] , or commit suicide, or drive without a seatbelt, it is their choice. What happens to them is purely on their own accord. If I don't wear my seatbelt, I'm not going to kill anybody. If I don't wear my helmet, I will not spiral out of control. I see this legislation as burdensome and as an infringement to my rights to live as I please. As it is written, people are guaranteed life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The government should not bar people from doing with their lives as they please. The government should not bar people from doing with their liberty as they please. And the government shall not bar people from pursuing what makes them happy. CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
