Here's the situation: At a cafeteria, catered event, etc., there will often be a self-serve dessert tray with cookies. These trays always include a small spatula to pick up the cookies with. [Example] This spatula serves no useful purpose. In fact, it makes the whole situation less sanitary. Whenever I ask why the spatula is there, peoples' first response is to say that it's more sanitary to have a spatula, so that bare hands don't touch the cookies. Everyone touches the spatula handle, so by using the spatula, you are guaranteeing exposure to everyone's hand germs. If everyone just picked the cookies up by hand, germ exposure would be reduced significantly. Even if some people touch more than one cookie by hand, that's still way better than the spatula (which is the equivalent of everyone touching every cookie). No one has been able to explain the purpose of the spatula to me in a satisfactory way. Please, change my view. For years, I have not understood this. Edit: To clarify my view: I'm not advocating for grabbing cookies by hand because I am paranoid about germs. I am advocating for a simpler, more pragmatic approach. The spatula confers no benefit, so it should not be a part of the cookie tray at dorm cafeterias, catered events, etc. The fact that the same germ exposure you get from the spatula happens in our everyday lives does not change the fact that the spatula has no benefit.
