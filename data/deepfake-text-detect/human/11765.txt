Researchers at MIT have observed electron whirlpools for the first time in crystals of tungsten ditelluride. Electricity is made up of discrete particles, and it can flow with the viscosity of honey under the right conditions. Tungsten ditelluride is a new quantum material that allows electrons to strongly interact and behave as quantum waves rather than particles. The study confirmed a long-standing prediction and it could lead to more efficient electronics designs.
