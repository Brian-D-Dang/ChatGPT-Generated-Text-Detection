I was born in SA, but I moved to the UK when I was nearly 2 years old. From what I have seen, if you look at murder rates, HIV rates, poverty rates and rape rates they are higher now then they were under Apartheid. For example if we look at inter-racial violence a mere 518 black people died from the White Apartheid government but 70,000 whites have died since 1994, which is an enormous amount. Due to things such as Affirmative Action, many skilled people have left the country which hurts the country as a whole as it leads to a Brain Drain. Even people who were born after Apartheid ended are still finding it difficult to get jobs because of it! In honesty, I feel that many people (especially the poor black population) are either the same or worse off then they were under Apartheid, despite the fact that it has been 20 years since it has ended and the way the government still blames apartheid for it's problems is little more then a excuse.
