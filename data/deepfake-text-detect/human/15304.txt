Congratulations to the Democratic party for being so divided that they can't even agree on a candidate to be considered for the general election. Nice job fellas. You're pushing a candidate who didn't even get a clear majority of YOUR party's votes lol. What's one half of one half? A quarter of the whole? Why don't you just give McCain the keys to the White House already.
