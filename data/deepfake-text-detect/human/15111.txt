Came here for my birthday with a friend. Parking is a pain, it is REALLY dark and the service was ok. Lots of reviews mention it's in a bad part of town. I would say an older part of town but not bad. Price wise, a little high for the area but this is Vegas. Service was an little lacking. She was helpful but super busy and didn't check back enough for my standards. I hate having an empty drink glass!! And I also hate when water is poured all over the table while refilling glasses and not cleaned up!! Food was amazing!! We had the bone-in strip and a filet, the broccoli with cheddar, mashed potatoes, and truffle mac and cheese. All delicious. Tried three cocktails, all delicious. Make sure you ask about flavors if you're not familiar with the the ingredients. Some are very strange!!
