This is your standard Chick-Fil-A - consistently good food with friendly staff. This Chick is located off of South Blvd in the same shopping center as a movie theater, Target, Old Navy, Bed Bath Beyond, Kohl's, Michaels and a bunch of other stuff. The traffic pattern in the center can be a bit of a cluster, but isn't that true of most shopping centers? Coming through a little before 11:30 am on a Thursday, I drove straight up to the call box, ordered my 1, quickly paid and was on my way. The condiments I requested were in the bag, the lack of pickles that I requested was honored and my tea was perfectly sweet. Eat mor chikin!
