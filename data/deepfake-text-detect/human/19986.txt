I feel very strongly that the main motivation for these killers isn't the pleasure they get from murdering kids, but the shock and disgust they subject the public to. They are psychopathic and horribly depressed, and instead of killing themselves outright they want to release some of the pain they have felt onto the world. So far, the media has played along exactly as these people want. They turn these people into celebrities, and for months after every shooting every media outlet talks about the shooting non stop. Edgy people on the Internet spread the person's picture around as part of some ironic joke, all the churches across the country hold daily prayer services or whatever. The whole country gets completely worked up and panicky and this is exactly what the shooter wants. The part that makes me the most angry is that a news station or magazine directly profits from publishing every single scrap of information they can get their hands on. You'll see pictures of the shooter from years before the event took place. These tragedies result in a profit for whatever news organization can deliver the most info to the "grieving" public, perpetuating the state of panic for longer and fulfilling these sick murderer's fantasies. It might sound drastic, but if a law was passed that treated these people like terrorists and forbid the media to give into their demands, I feel that the amount of shootings would go down. CMV, or at least tell my why making a law about it would be a bad idea.
