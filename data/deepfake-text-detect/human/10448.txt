A company called Nielsen produces the most widely accepted statistics. To generate those statistics, Nielsen has a panel of households that are selected to mirror the average household for many kinds of demographic slices, and the viewing habits of those households (who watches what, when) are carefully tracked (they used to use written diaries but it's a bit more automated now). The number of such households is deemed statistically significant (meaning that adding more housholds would not likely influence the analysis much). There are also other things that can be done. A lot of large networks run their own panels of viewers to double-check Nielsen's data. The cable companies know what station their cable boxes were tuned to (but they don't know if the TV was on or who was watching). TiVo famously knew how many households rewound the Superbowl halftime show to see Janet Jackson's nipple again - but when they made a press release about it, people freaked out because they didn't know TiVo was keeping track of that kind of data.," "They don't. They hire an outside firm, called Nielsen, that calculates these numbers by a scientific survey of the viewing audience. This can take the form of written diaries, set-top boxes or an audit of DVR records.
