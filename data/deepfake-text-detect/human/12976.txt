"Janice, I've decided to commit suicide." "But Clarence, you can't! You are wealthy, have the love of friends and family, and the love of a nation! And what's more important, I love you!" "I know Janice, but I really, really want to know if there's an afterlife, and I just don't want to wait any longer. Besides, the nation whose love I have is North Korea, and that kinda weirds me out." "Oh Clarence! BOOHOOHOOHOO..... so anyway, sniff how are you going to kill yourself?" "I've decided to to tip over a vending machine to try and get free product, and have it fall over and crush me. My stupid death will provide countless millions of people with a mild sense of superiority, not to mention joke fodder." "Oh Clarence! You're so selfless, even in death! That must be why they love you so in North Korea!" "No, I'm pretty sure it's because I look like Kim Jong Il, Janice." THE END CAREFUL WHEN TIPPING VENDING MACHINES KIDS
