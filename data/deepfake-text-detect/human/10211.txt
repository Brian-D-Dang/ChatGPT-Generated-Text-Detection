Ok, view changed. I guess I meant that there was an arbitrary double standard between alcohol and pot in the workplace, as opposed to saying employers don't have a basis to drug test. In my view, if a person is doing good work (on drugs or not), then they should be kept working. If they're doing a bad job (as a result of doing drugs or not), they should be fired. It seems like pinning bad workplace behavior on what well could be, for example, responsible legal pot smoking is lazy and pointless. To this point: I could show up drunk to work in the morning. This wouldn't show up on a drug test, yet it could carry negative consequences for the company. I could be caught and fired for this. Same as if I showed up high. Note that none of these instances of being caught involve a drug test. What does drug testing white collar workers accomplish? We have consistently seen similar'zero-tolerance' policies fail spectacularly in schools and elsewhere. It is crazy to assume that workers will be responsible adults unless they prove otherwise? Also curious about your thoughts on jobs involving heavy machinery. Maybe those jobs shouldn't drug test either? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
