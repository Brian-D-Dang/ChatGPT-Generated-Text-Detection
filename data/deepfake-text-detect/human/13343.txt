O' celebrate! Luna, Diana. Our most wise and clever ladies. They Led us to the hidden land, on the only moon of terra firma. nbsp; Mica, mica parva stella. Return, we shall! When. We. Are ready. nbsp; Through a sky chariot we fled, away from those gluttonous Goths. For the best we said, and built a new Pax Romana. nbsp; We toiled in our hidden place. We tilled the soil by the grace of Ceres. So sweet our crop, we forgot our bland Earth mace. nbsp; We built our temples from moon dust and cosmic dreams, glorious structures to our unfailing gods. They deserved what we made, and rewarded us in spades. nbsp; Mica, mica parva stella. Return, we shall! When. We. Are ready. nbsp; No wars were raged, No child hungry. Up and out our terra nova ballooned. nbsp; In a curious way, we were bored by our own success, and yearned for the good and the bad of the days now just in memory. nbsp; It is time for a new frontier. Tempus fugit, carpe diem! Let slip our new dogs of war. nbsp; Mica, mica parva stella. Return, we shall! Now. We. Are ready.
