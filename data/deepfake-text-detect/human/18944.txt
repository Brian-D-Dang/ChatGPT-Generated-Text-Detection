We are stuck with a perpetual cycle of us vs them. We are forced to pigeon hole ourselves into one of two mindsets with very few exceptions. People get so caught up in cheering for the "home team" that they lose sight of what the issues actually are. I can't bring myself to vote either Republican or Democrat except on select candidates that I support.
