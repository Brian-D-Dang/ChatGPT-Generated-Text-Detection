Review of the Casino Only! My friends and I had the most wicked fun time gambling at this place. I can't imagine a better group of people I would rather lose my money to! We played craps and blackjack mostly so the drinks were free flowing. Darina, our cocktail waitress, was so sweet! Marie, our blackjack dealer in the Champagne Pit, had us singing and high-five'ing everyone at our table. The craps dudes were all fun, gave good advice and were all around fun (well, except Glen...he was a bit of a hardass.) I really had an awesome time here. I won't be staying at the hotel anytime soon after reading the other yelp reviews tho I highly recommend going to throw your money down at the casino.
