Let me preface this by saying that this is simply a question of logical implication; I am not advocating that society should actually be embracing of religion. Let me also clarify that by "embraced," I mean more than just "tolerated." I'm talking about a society where religion and religious practices are celebrated and possibly even encouraged. Most religions state that an individual's duty to their god comes before all else. So, if a religion claims that something is a divine command, a true follower of the religion would act according to that command regardless of its legality. To me, in a society where religion is embraced, one should not be punished for doing whatever it takes to accomplish their duty to god. It is, after all, their greatest duty. If anything, relentlessly pursuing that duty would be seen as a sign of virtue. It seems absurd to celebrate a religion but punish an individual for acting in accordance with it. CMV. EDIT: The point of this post is to show that such a society does not exist and is not obviously desirable, despite what some people claim (e.g. "America is a land where all religions are celebrated" or "An ideal society embraces all religions completely.
