So, firstly I want to say that starting from Marx's analysis of the commodity, I think that that displays in stunning clarity why capitalism tends to cause suckishness. I also think that when it costs millions and millions to run an election campaign, and if the flow of money is part of the problem, then anyone who has effective solutions will not be funded. With the amount of people saying any amount of things, juuuust the exact right puppet can be funded. And, finally, I think that having 1300 people own 94 of the planet's wealth and resources, having 10 people be able to feed a billion hungry for 2.5 centuries, and living in a society that spends as much on pet food and alcohol as it would take to fix global malnutrition and poverty, takes a very weird sense of morality. (all these are real facts, I got more if ya want 'em) I want to finish off with a moral argument, a thought experiment. You're walking down the street, and see the only homeless person on the planet. They ask you for 5 cents, and that will provide education, food, water, shelter, clothing, etc. Are you morally compelled to? What if there were thousands of homeless people, and still 5 cents total was still all it took, would you be compelled then? What if you had 4 friends with you, and each of you had to give 1 cent? Are you compelled to band together and each give one single cent? I would argue yes, definitely to these. I have one more twist. What if someone stole the five cents from you? What if they asked you or asked you and your friends to contribute 1 cent each to either the single homeless person (or it would every one of the thousands) and you denied, and someone stole it? Instead of taking out one of the 100 bills in your wallet and keeping 99.95 for themselves, simply took a nickel? Are they in the wrong? A parable, for revolution.
