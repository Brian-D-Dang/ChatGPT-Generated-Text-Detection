You waste your own time if you are unattractive as well as the time of those who you flirt with. For Men: Short height is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. If we isolate genetics as a cause then malnourishment and poor health would be reflected in a person's height. Poor health is not generally considered attractive based on most models of interpersonal attraction. This trait is often selected against when women choose their partners. This bias is so common and accepted that women do not hesitate to state this preference openly. Whether amongst friends or amongst partners, women when asked do not hesitate to state their preference on height. For MenWomen: Healthy weight is another item that seems to have a consistent pattern. Men when asked what weight is preferable consistently selected against body fat percentages above 30 and more often chose body fats within the range of 19 - 25 with favorability decreasing as BF goes up. For women, most preferred body fats within the 11-15 percent ideal range as well, with anything above 20 being selected against greatly with favorability decreasing as BF goes up. Women had a lot more variability in their results, with a more even spread of favorability in the average and ideal spectrum. Now this is a purely physical take on attraction, a lot is not addressed. Men rely a lot on their status and wealth to convey value above that of their physical attractiveness. Women can leverage their attractiveness on their ability to socialize and selectively promote their assets that are considered attractive in a socially acceptable manner. So I conclude, being unfit is a completely unattractive trait. Despite what people say to the contrary, personality doesn't not matter if you are not even considered average looks wise. I know a few of these are referencing trends and data; unfortunately I can't seem to find where I read them. I can take some time to search for the data if needed. CMV
