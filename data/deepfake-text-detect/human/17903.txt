I'm referring to this from the Reddit FAQ: A submission's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the submission and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not "real" numbers, they have been "fuzzed" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvotedownvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are "fuzzed." To use their example, I don't see a scenario where the system is any less vulnerable to "spam bots etc" by having a submission show a score of 23-21 as opposed to 12-10. It seems like they're just obfuscating the count for the sake of doing it. In doing so, they're also taking away our ability to see the ratio of upvotes to downvotes: a statistic that would be just as interesting as the difference between the two.
