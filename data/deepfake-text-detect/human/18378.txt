Then we can be correct in usage, work toward everyone in the world using the same words for the same places thus facilitating communication worldwide, learn something about that country's language's phonology, and not cause confusion like Dutch, Deutsche, etc. Implementation would be simple. Starting with the names English speakers can pronounce perfectly, new maps and textbooks in US public schools will have both names written on them until after a few decades the old names can be phased out and look as weird as "kamchatka" or calling France "Gaul." After that, the other countries will receive the closest approximation possible, until all countries are learned with their proper names. I'm convinced that with the majority of countries in the world (like Uzbekistan or Lesotho) that English speakers never talk about, the transition would easily happen in one generation.
