To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. Currently, the migrant crisis is one of the biggest items of concern for Europeans. Most Europeans say, with much accuracy, that the migrant stream has to be shut off because a) immigrants are a weight on the economy, and b) most migrants refuse to assimilate, creating a lot of social problems. However, I still feel like they have to own up to that problem. Western societies historically engaged in colonialism and imperialism and profited over it so much, that they achieved wealth that continues to earn their country the status of "developedfirst-world." Often times when they did this, they ended up creating conditions in the colonized country that would be unfavorable to their future development. I know most EuropeansAmericans would respond to this by saying "I had nothing to do with this, why should I take responsibility over the past?" but I find that to be a really weak argument. If my grandfather robbed somebody of something, died, and passed the stolen goodsmoney down to me, don't I have a moral obligation to return the stolen items, even if I had nothing to do with the crime? I think I would. Maybe the main problem with my view is that it is purely moral, and not legalpractical. But letting poor people work out the problems that are partly as a result of your people's past seems very selfish to me. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
