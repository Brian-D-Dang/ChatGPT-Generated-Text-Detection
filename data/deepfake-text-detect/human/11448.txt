Uber plans to add trains, buses, planes, and car rentals to its UK app this year. It will expand these services to other countries if the test goes well. The company is aiming to become a one-stop shop for all travel needs. It plans to add hotel bookings in the future. Uber recently secured a 30-month license to continue operating in London after a battle with city regulators over its ride-hailing app.
