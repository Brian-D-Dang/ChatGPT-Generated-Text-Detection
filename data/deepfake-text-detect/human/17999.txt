The idea of someone believing a book is literally a message from an omnipotent being intended for them and not even bothering to read it is just too fucking difficult to wrap my head around. If I believed such a message existed I would be reading it every day and attempting to learn as much as I could about it at the highest level possible. What can possibly explain these incongruent supposed beliefs and actual behavior?
