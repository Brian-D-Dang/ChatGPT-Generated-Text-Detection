RA sushi is so-so for sushi. It's not spectacular, but usually not terrible either. A group of us (7) came on a Saturday night and while we expected a wait for food and such because it was a weekend night, the service was much too slow. We had to remind our server to refill our drinks when they stood empty for 10 minutes because we didn't know where our server went. A few of us ordered the same alcoholic drinks, but they were prepared differently. I don't know what was going at the bar. The food must have taken 30-45 minutes to come out. Overall, a so-so experience.
