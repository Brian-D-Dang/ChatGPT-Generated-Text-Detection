The enamel in your teeth contains a mineral called Hydroxyapatite. Fluoride ions react with Hydroxyapatite to form Fluoroapatite. Bacteria weaken your teeth because their waste products in your saliva make it slightly acidic. Hydroxyapatite can dissolve in that weak acid, Fluoroapatite does not. Edit: this does make your teeth less flexible, making them a little more brittle. Given that the modern diet involves very little chewing on gristlecracking bones open to get marrow, this is generally not a concern.
