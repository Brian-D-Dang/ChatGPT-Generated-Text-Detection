By criminal behaviour, I'm referring to major crimes such as assault, murder, rape, drug trafficking, paedophilia, and not petty crimes such as speeding or recreational drug use. Currently when someone commits a crime such as a violent robbery, society fails to understand the conditions that led to this individual developing the motivation and the mindset to engage in this type of behaviour. This is displayed by the ongoing failure of society to not alter the conditions leading to this behaviour, and the failure to therapeutically and supportively help individuals who develop it. Instead they are punished, and the likelihood of them committing further criminal behaviours is not significantly reduced. Overwhelmingly, like most diseases, criminal behaviour occurs mostly in areas with poor socio-economic statuses. Despite the growing societal trend for treatment of mental illnesses; aggression, social conduct disorder, addiction and other mental illnesses that result in individuals commiting major crimes, are still mostly untreated. Instead, similarly to the way we treated individuals with diseases and deformities historically, we lock them up in cages and attribute their diseases to them being bad people (historically we would say they were possessed). Additionally, as a result of seeing many "bad apples" come from certain social groups in society, individuals justify this by developing a view of certain social groups in society as being defective or of less value then others. We continue to reinforce this by punishing these populations over and over again.
