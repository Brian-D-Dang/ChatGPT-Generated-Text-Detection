With the United States 2016 presidential election coming up, the contenders have spent a lot of time already in Iowa and New Hampshire, which are the first 2 states to hold primaries. The candidates often spend more time there than anywhere else in the country, and I feel that people living in those states have a disproportionate influence in selecting their party's nominee compared to everywhere else. In my state of Arizona, which was the 11th state to hold the Republican primary in 2012, the news media had already selected the "winner" and most candidates had dropped out or stopped campaigning by then. Arizona will be the 28th state to hold a primary in 2016 according to Wikipedia (some states are still undetermined). Why bother voting in the primary if everyone has already agreed to the de-facto nominee? My proposal is to randomize the order of states to hold a primary or caucus. The dates can be more or less the same, but which states get to hold it would be different every election cycle. Better still, the order of states could remain undecided until a month or so before the primaries actually begin. That way, any candidates who have the time and money to campaign months ahead of schedule will have to allocate their time to as many people as possible instead of to targeted states.
