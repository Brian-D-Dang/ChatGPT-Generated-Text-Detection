We've tried this before and it hasn't worked but I suppose you knew that when you signed up for this" "I did sir" "Cut the sir crap out agent this isn't the academy anymore boy, this is real life. Now we need you to infiltrate their operation. Find the celebrities they've taken hostage but most importantly we need you to find and gather information on their leader Elmo.
