I'm about to go into college from a decent University and plan on Co-Majoring Finance and International Business. I'm thinking of taking out about 10,000-20,000 over the next 4 years but I see no serious problem in that. Once I graduate from Uni (With no kids or anything to hold me back hopefully), I'm expecting to make anywhere between 40,000-60,000 a year. Assuming the the former, and paying anywhere from 500-1000 a month. I should be done paying it off within 1-2 years. I'm not planning on making any large purchases my first few years out of college such as a Car or a New home. (I'm thinking a reasonably priced apartment with maybe a bro or 2). I feel like as long as you play your cards right (not getting a chick pregnant or getting yourself into any additional debt), It shouldn't be that big of a deal. Hello, users of CMV!
