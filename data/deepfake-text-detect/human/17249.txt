I was one of the top students in the humanities, graduating in 3 years, winning an internationally-recognized student excellence award, earning a scholarship for a year, and double-majoring (English literature and religious studies). Four years later, my life is basically in ruin. Everyone said that the communication, writing, and rhetorical skills I demonstrated were universally valued, and that companies would offer training specific to the position. This was incredibly false. No company wants to, or needs to, offer on-the-job training, because of the hideous state of labour relationships. My friends in the humanities and I have held positions as cashiers, hotel clerks, fast food preps, and struggled with unemployment since graduating. Many of us feel like we were very misled and that our lives were wrecked by the promise of our "skills" (which apparently no one values, so are they REALLY skills?) leading to employment. Otherwise, we might have settled for the Bs we might've received in sciences, or gone to trade school, but we bought into the rhetoric of how versatile, life-affirming, eye-opening a humanities degree is, and have suffered for YEARS and years to come for it. Change my view? Or you know, give me a job that uses the "skills" at which I supposedly "excel" so much?
