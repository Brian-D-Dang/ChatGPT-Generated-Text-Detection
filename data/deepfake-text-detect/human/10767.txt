Also lots of general hospitals.... which treat men. Men need the least specialized care of the three groups. We don't deal with child birth as an example, nor do we need the specialized care that children need (or the awesome toys which is bullshit by the way). So we don't get specialized hospitals. We don't need them, the general hospitals cover us.," "Because Women and Children hospitals are usually for mothers of younger children (ages 0 months to about 15 years), and children ages 0 months - 15 years can't be worked with by non-pediatric doctors unless it's for mental health issues. Therefore these children's hospitals were made specifically for that. And Women's hospitals are needed for things like Pap Smears, and other women based treatments.
