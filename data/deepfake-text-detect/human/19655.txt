When I listen to Bob Dylan, I feel what Dylan wanted me to feel, I learn to think about things in different ways, and I am challenged by the music (tempo changes, the use of shrill sounds to produce beauty, intentional flat notes). I don't see anything else in Classical other than that it might be harder for the artist to make. If that's what makes it better, cutting a tree down with a herring would be the greatest piece of art ever.
