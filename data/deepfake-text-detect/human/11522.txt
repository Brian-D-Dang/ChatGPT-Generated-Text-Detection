BuildXL is a build engine that runs over 30,000 builds per day internally at Microsoft. Thousands of developers use BuildXL on their desktops for fast builds with mega-sized codebases. BuildXL runs its builds over thousands of datacenter machines. There are no plans to integrate it into Visual Studio. The technology may be useful if developers run into issues with scaling development.
