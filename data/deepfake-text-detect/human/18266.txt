I see no reason why police should carry a weapon that has the express purpose of killing (or seriously injuring) others at all times. I don't believe that the threat of being killed should be the incentive for criminals to halt their activity, and I believe the harm that can be inflicted by rubber bullets is more than enough to stop criminals from doing whatever their doing. Especially when you consider that the most of the criminals police deal with do not have guns themselves, so the threat of mutual harm is not necessary. The British police get by fine without guns at all Why should they carrie guns and ammo with them at all times?
