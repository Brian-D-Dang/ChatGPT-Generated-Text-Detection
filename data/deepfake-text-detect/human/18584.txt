... from the limited amount of knowledge I have of it. I intend to research more about it but I love the discussions that come out of this subreddit so I thought I'd put it to you guys. It's my opinion right now that in order to prevent a market from becoming a total monopoly, open to the abuses which come from said position, regulations need to exist. In an ideal world we would have a creatively open-minded, patient, uncommonly rational and objective community of businesses that would play fair with each other or a similarly-minded government, but what we actually have is corporations and a government that are comprised of human beings. Quite frankly, I want the people who are in control of the market to be the ones that the rest of the country are capable of voting out. Free market economics gives complete power over to corporations and that's a concept that terrifies me. Educate me, my friends. I'm aware that I have a simplified view here so I'd welcome opinions from either side of this.
