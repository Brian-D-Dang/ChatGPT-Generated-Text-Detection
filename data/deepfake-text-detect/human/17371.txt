There are many things you are taught in school, a lot of it is useless. There are so many things that you never use outside of that class. Why do I need to learn about things that won't ever come up again except in that one class? Why do I need to waste my time remembering exact dates of certain events, or the name of the guy that did it? Why would anyone need to memorize every part of a sentence, or knowing every part of multiple organisms. There is too much wasted time in school. So why are these things required to learn?
