North Korea refuses to co-operate with any foreign power and China will not comply with UN sanctions imposed under Resolution 1718 e.t.c and continues trade with North Korea making up 70 of its total trade. Therefore with China not complying and North Korea going back on agreements such as the Agreed Framework and not paying heed to sanctions, the Norths nuclear program can not be dealt with peacefully. Further sanctions can not be levied on the North because China will veto them in the Security Council and thus make them ineffective.
