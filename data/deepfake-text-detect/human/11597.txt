SpaceX is starting a program to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into rocket fuel. The technology will be important on Mars, as fuel could be created from the planet's CO2-rich atmosphere. Technologies already exist for capturing carbon from the atmosphere, but SpaceX will still need to find a way to do this at scale. If successful, space tourism could change from an environmentally dubious activity into an inherently eco-friendly act.
