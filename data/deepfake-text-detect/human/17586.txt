Please don't get me wrong here, I am not homophobic and I'm not just saying that to make myself appear less offensive. I attend gay pride every year to support my many homosexual friends. However, when I go to gay pride, I notice the whole thing is very sexual with lewd performances and so on. It's not just gay pride that I see this, I see promiscuity highly promoted within the gay community. My friend has an account on Grindr, he often gets people popping up and straight asking him for sex with no flirting or dating. It's often like there isn't that middle stage. This view is probably linked to my rather modest and strict view of sex in general. I believe promiscuity is a bad thing and that sex should be linked to love. Hello, users of CMV!
