In many businesses costs are sticky, at least in the near future. For example, a factory building, leased equipment, interest on debt, do not change if revenue declines without incurring some costs. For businesses that are valued primarily for growing, it's expected that their costs are relatively fixed and at some point in the future, the additional revenue will contribute to substantial profit growth, as well. You talk quite a bit about cash flow, which in business terms is different from profit and revenue. Some types of businesses produce substantial cash flow without earning profits for tax purposes.
