As the title says, one of my coworkers thinks she's the greatest parent in the world because her child is doing straight-As in school, the child is happy with their hobbies, and the child doesn't complain in the slightest. On the other hand, the child is thirteen years old, roughly 5'3" tall, and their BMI calculates to around 32 or so. They're so out of shape and, frankly, obese that they huff and puff for breath after walking up a single flight of stairs. I almost feel like it's child abuse, because allowing a child to get to that point requires months of neglect. Am I wrong? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
