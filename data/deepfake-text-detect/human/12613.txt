Samuel Walker was fatally injured in a hit-and-run as he crossed a road in Chorlton, Manchester, in February 2003. Joyrider Nawnee Mackin, 35, was jailed for nine years in November for causing death by dangerous driving. Car owner Craig Chevelleau, 33, was jailed for 23 months after being convicted of perverting the course of justice at Manchester Crown Court. Chevelleau, who was sentenced on Wednesday, was described as Mackin's "criminal associate" by police. He claimed the vehicle was stolen by a stranger while he was using a phone box. Chevelleau said he saw his car being driven off by an unknown person but thought it was a prank by a friend, so did not report it to police until three hours later. The vehicle was later found abandoned by police. Sgt Lee Westhead said his "web of lies" had helped Samuel's killer escape justice for 12 years. Ambulance staff attempted to revive Samuel at the scene before he was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He would have celebrated his 18th birthday in March.
