I'm not sure at what point people stopped thinking about the ramifications of their actions and became so head strong that they believed they were invincible, that officers judgements were infallible, that their rights would keep the blood inside their body. I have practiced civil disobedience in my life. I have been arrested more than once. But I'll tell you one thing, I have never failed to comply with an officers orders. I nearly ever incident of a person involved in a police shooting, they have one problem. They are not being compliant. The United States offers you rights, but your rights can't keep you alive. This often turns into a matter of "you're victim blaming." I'm simply saying that right or wrong, the behavior of these victims can most often be described as "exercising outrageously poor judgement." For one simple reason, I value my life. It's not a matter of principle, it's a matter of practicality. I don't want to die. And I don't feel sorry for anyone whose ego is bigger than their brain, whether or not their shooting was justified. CMV
