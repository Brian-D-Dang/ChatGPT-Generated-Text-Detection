I believe in the free market. In a capitalist society, people have the right to choose the product and service providers they view as best and to be free of cronyism and such. People who work in a capitalist society have the right to band together and tell the customers who purchase the products and service created by their labor that something isn't right. If you make the decision to walk through a picket line, especially for such a destructive industry as fast food, you're doing one of the worst things you can do to the free market: telling businesses that they can be successful even if they abuse the help. I live in NY, USA. edit: If this is important, I have never worked in fast food nor have I ever been on a work strike. I work in software and digital ops. I'm mostly vegetarian and eat fast food prolly 1-2 times per year at a highway rest stop or something.
