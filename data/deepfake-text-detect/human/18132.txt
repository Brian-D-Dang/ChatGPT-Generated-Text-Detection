I've heard gun control advocates argue that it is barbaric for the average person to have a lethal weapon in their possession. Many of them go on to say that only police officers should have guns. I don't see a significant difference between using a gun yourself and calling someone to come and use one on your behalf. If it is wrong for me to defend myself with a gun, why isn't it wrong to have a police officer come and defend me with a gun? Note that I see little practical difference between an armed and an unarmed police officer, since every unarmed police officer, if they think the situation warrants, can summon armed police officers.
