I have an extremely hard time believing that the actions of these organizations are justified without being allowed access to any kind of reliable quantitative data. Saying "we haven't seen many terrorist attacks" isn't valid because we have no way of saying how many terrorist attacks would have otherwise happened. It's like saying "I was sick, then I drank orange juice, then I got better." You don't know that you wouldn't have gotten better anyway. It's anecdotal evidence. Even pointing to trends in terrorist attacks over time is problematic due to the multitude of confounds. In order to actually make any kind of in-depth analysis, we would need access to classified information. I find this incredibly disturbing because it means that citizens are prevented from making informed decisions about their nation's military actions and curbing of freedoms. I don't want my taxes to pay for killing unless I have a say in it.
