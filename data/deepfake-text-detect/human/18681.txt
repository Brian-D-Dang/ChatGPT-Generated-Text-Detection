In contrast to the US' early ideals of friendship without sworn alliances and anti-imperialism, the US has become the world's 1 military power and currently has boots on the ground on every continent. In my opinion, this is an unwise policy as it discourages Afro-Eurasian countries from resolving their own problems (peacefully, ideally), creates an incentive for the US to behave recklessly and violently, transforms the US into a scapegoat for political conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere, and has led the US to become an aggressor in the eyes of much of the world. Adopting a principle of pacifism or disarmament, similar to Costa Rica, would encourage the "Old World" to grow up and would significantly improve the US' standing in the global order while freeing up more resources to spend on true universal healthcare, education, andor tax cuts (depending on your ideology) at home.
