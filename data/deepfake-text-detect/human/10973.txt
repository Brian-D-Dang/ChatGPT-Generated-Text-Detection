Electricity stems from a property of matter called charge. Electric charges exert forces on other electric charges through what is known as an electric field. There are positive and negative charges that can be found independently. Magnetism is pretty analogous to electricity. It is governed by very similar equations and stems from magnetic charges. However, magnetic charges are only found in pairs of north and south, never alone. These dipoles exert forces on other dipoles through magnetic fields. Together, electricity and magnetism are governed by a set of four equations called the Maxwell Equations. Changing an electric field actually creates a magnetic field, even in the absence of magnetic charges. Changing a magnetic field creates an electric field, even in the absence of electric charge. Wiggle a single electric charge back and forth and you create a changing electric field. This changing electric field creates and changing magnetic field. You can create continuously oscillating, coupled electric and magnetic fields. These are known as electromagnetic waves. They travel the speed of light and, in fact, are light. Depending on the frequency that the electric and magnetic field oscillate (wiggle), the light may be a microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, xray, etc. This is the electromagnetic spectrum.
