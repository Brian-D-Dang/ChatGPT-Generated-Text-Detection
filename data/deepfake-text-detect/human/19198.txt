The kids in my school all seem to have the opinion that black people are living like slaves in America today. They say that politicians dont care about black people and that "modern colonialism" rules america, so black people are forced to be poor and in prison. Im not convinced. I think African Americans are pretty fairly represented in politics and that all inner city black people have to do is work hard and persevere to succeed. Maybe I just dont know enough to think the opposite but I think its pretty fair overall.
