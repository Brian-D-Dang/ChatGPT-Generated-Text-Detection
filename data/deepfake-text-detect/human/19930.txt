Keep in mind that I am not a movie critic, I'm a casual movie-goer who occasionally watches movies (maybe once a week). I've been working my way through the IMDB top 250 films just for the hell of it and i've been putting off Godfather for a long time. I decided to finally watch it a few weeks ago and I was, to say the least, disappointed. The movie is quite long but at the time it didn't really feel it was dragging on (I guess that is a positive), I just feel like nothing much really happened, it was quite boring. I really do want to be convinced otherwise because I feel like i'm not fully understanding the movie and revelling in all its supposed glory.
