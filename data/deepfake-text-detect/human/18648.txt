I believe humans only act in self interest. Often our self interest is also the interest of others which results in "good actions." For example, buying someone a birthday present. It's for them, but you do it out of your own self interest of wanting to be perceived as a good friend or the other person's happiness making you happy. In the end you are still seeking happiness for yourself and therefore not being selfless. I don't think anyone can be selfless. Even someone who sacrifices their own life for their child, is doing so because it is in their own self interest (they feel they'll be better off dead than having to live alive with their child dead).
