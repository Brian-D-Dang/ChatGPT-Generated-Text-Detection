This obligation in my opinion could seriously damage relationships for the officer. I feel as though they shouldn't be constantly expected to report on any tiny offense. For example, if an officer goes to a party on a Saturday night that he is rostered off, he might see a few guys smoking weed. If the officer reports on this, he might very well lose friends. And if the party and the offending users were caught, the police officer might be in strife with his department for not reporting on it. I believe it often stops people from being free, or they would be living in fear or guilt of not reporting on these offences. CMV
