I had a buy 1 get 1 coupon so my fiance and I decided to check this show out because of Holly. I knew it was going to be bad right from the start when the show started 15 minutes late. I have NEVER been to a Vegas show that started late! And it only lasted about 75 minutes long. There is really not much to say about the show. The singing was not bad but the songs were. The dancing was not bad, but it got boring very quickly. You'd think there was a theme to the show (LIttle Bo Peep), but there really wasn't. And if you think Holly was the STAR, you'd be greatly disappointed. She was barely there for the first 34 of the show. She would come out stood there and then faded away. Holly finally was on the stage in the last 15 minutes or so but poor girl CAN NOT dance nor act!!! She pranced around and finally removed her top showing her ginormous boobs! Unless you really want to see Holly 12 naked, otherwise, pick a nice strip club to go instead. You'll get more for your bucks there.
