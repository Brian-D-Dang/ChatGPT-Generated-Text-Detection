A government likes to keep taxing people off in SO many ways. corporate tax, income tax and VAT, import tax and gift tax and what not tax? Yes. Why are they like that? The government needs to get its income from somewhere. Just corporate tax and income tax should be enough? Theoretically you could raise them and remove all other taxes I suppose. Why ask all other kinds and tax people to no end? To provide various incentives for things the government wants and disincentives for things they do not. If there's a large import tax on some goods you're more likely to buy a domestic product. If there are various luxury taxes it lets the government somewhat disincentive trivial spending, or at force the wealthier folks that can afford such luxuries to provide a bigger share of the tax required for the government to operate. And'the government' isn't really one thing, either. The municipality is operating on its own usually, and the municipality needs its taxes to raise its funds to operate as well. Often the only real asset a municipality has that allows it to impose a real tax is property, and so you're taxed for the amount of property you hold in the municipality. The land-transfer tax offsets costs involved in keeping records and will affect people that are burdening the records department far more than people that just purchase a house once or twice in their life.
