Our moral emotions have evolved to aid in our survival and reproduction. But morals have no objective truth nor can they be compared with one judged better than another. While moral systems can be evaluated as to whether they will lead to a desired goals, these goals are subjective opinion. For example, rape and slavery are judged by most current moral systems to be immoral acts. But there is nothing objectively immoral about these acts and the opposition to them are just subjective emotions. One common moral system is utilitarianism which judges acts based on their consequences with the goal to be maximum happiness or satisfaction of individual preferences. If you value these goals then utilitarianism will help you archive them. but their is no objective truth in these goals as they are simply preferences. While food can be evaluated based on health effects their is no objective reason to prefer good health over good food.
