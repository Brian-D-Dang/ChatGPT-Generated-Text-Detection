Studies have shown that humans are natural herbivores, and that any form of meat or animal by-product consumption is bad for the body. Animal protein leeches calcium from the bones, and one of the biggest fallacies in the world is that milk builds strong bones, when in fact the top 5 countries with the highest milk consumption also have the highest rates of osteoporosis. A vegan diet completely rids the body of added cholesterol, and lowers the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Being a vegan myself, I do have many arguments with people whose opinions differ from mine, and I am totally open to listening to them, for I am sure that there are great and worthy opinions out there.
