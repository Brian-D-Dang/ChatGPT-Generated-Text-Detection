Whether it's a misconception or not, there's a common idea that for men (perhaps for women as well, but moreso for men), sex and love are rewards for being a good person. It's everywhere in our culture, from the hero who "gets the girl," to the sitcom husband who has to sleep on the couch when he's naughty, and gets to share a bed again when he's good. The common advice given by women to be more attractive overlaps with "be a better person," and even redpill ideology is about being "high value." The converse of this is when sex is had, a person often thinks they've done something good to earn it. What does it therefore say when a "bad" person has sex or a loving wife? It's a validation of the person's behaviour. Sometimes it can even be directly linked; see the stereotype of mafiosos having beautiful wives and affairs with even more beautiful women, or the idea that power, confidence and "bad boys" are considered sexy in many contexts and by many people. A person never exists in a vacuum, and while they ultimately hold responsibility for their own actions, the factors that lead to those actions must also be taken into account. Much like bad parenting is scrutinized, or children are told to avoid other children for being "bad influences," a woman who knowingly validates a man's criminal lifestyle is a bad influence and it's ok, and not at all bigoted. Also, the saying of "those who don't stop bullies are as bad as them" rings true here. The women who have sex with and love a man are independent, free thinking people in their lives who have opportunities to observe and judge someone's behaviour. Failure to do so is negligent.
