It's perfectly acceptable by societal standards for Jews to wear strings hanging from their pants. Sure, non-believers might think it's ridiculous, but hey it's not hurting anyone, so live and let live right? You Catholics think that you're literally eating Jesus Christ when you have communion? That's a little weird, but go right ahead. You believe that God sent an angel (who is also God) down to the desert to impregnate a married virgin that will eventually have a baby (who is also God)? Awesome, you sound just like all of our presidents! Yet we get all shocked when this same type of senseless, reason-less faith causes people to fly planes into buildings or bomb abortion clinics or burn people at the stake for witchcraft. If we are taught as a society that belief in something as objectively crazy as Adam and Eve and the talking snake is not only valid, but realistically above criticism, what credibility can we possibly have against those that think God has asked them to do things we might find atrocious?
