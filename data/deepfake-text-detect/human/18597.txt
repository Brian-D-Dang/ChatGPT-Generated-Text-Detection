Meat is certainly bad for the environment, and in the amounts that western people eat it, probably unhealthy. We tax cigarettes and alcohol because they are unhealthy and therefore amount to extra costs for the state in healthcare. We tax fuel because it is bad for the environment. Meat causes a lot of water and soil pollution, and emits large amounts of greenhouse gasses. Why don't we tax meat in the same way we tax gasoline? I am from the Netherlands and we pay heavy taxes over car fuel, alcohol and tabacco. I am very much in favor of taxes like these. They are in line with a principle we like in the Netherlands; 'the polluter pays'. Right now meat is taxed with 6, which is standard for essential products like food. Luxury items, which is pretty much everything else is taxed by 21. For alcohol and cigarettes we pay even more taxes, I think it's over 100. In my opinion 21 would be an appropriate amount for meat.
