All my life I have been told to get good grades, just so I can make it to the next grade, and so on, eventually leading to doing well in high school so that I can go to college, earn a degree, and get a good job. More often than not, I see and hear people talking about how they do not have a job pertaining to their degree, yet everyone seems to be pushing college on their children. What is the point of spending thousands of dollars and building up debt just so that I can get a job in a field that doesn't require my degree? To go further than that, it seems to be the norm in America to get a job and work 8 hours a day just so that you can have money to live comfortably andor buy things to enjoy in the time you are not working. Seeing as you are asleep for roughly 8 hours, that leaves 16 hours that you are awake per day. If you are working the 8 hours mentioned earlier, then you are left with just 8 hours for free time. The only thing is, your only duties are not your job, so you have to spend time taking care of your house and children if you have them. It's important to know that I make music. That is what I enjoy doing, performing music. I can get gigs, and they will probably only ever cover my rent and living costs, but I get to spend all of my working time doing what I love, as opposed to some random job. I would much rather skip college and just live with my band, splitting rent and living off of what we love to do. Why should I pursue anything else?
