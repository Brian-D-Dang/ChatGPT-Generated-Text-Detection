This is based on my belief that every person is the owner of their own body, and should therefore be able to do whatever they want with their body so long as they are not harming anyone else in the process. Also, I believe that doing this will dismantle these untaxed, unregulated black markets and sharply reduce crime. Gangs won't have a reason to kill each other for territory to sell illegal drugs and addicts won't have reasons to steal to fund their addiction. I do, however, believe that people shouldn't use harmful strongly addictive drugs, but I believe that people who want to use strong drugs WILL use strong drugs legally or otherwise. Better that they get the drug that is regulated, healthier, purer, and cheaper than one that is unregulated, could have anything in it, and is completely untaxed. I'm here to see if my views are justified, or if any alternative views are better.
