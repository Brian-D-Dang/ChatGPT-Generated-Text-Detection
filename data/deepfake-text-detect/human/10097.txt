I was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our debt is like a room full of shit: if it's up to your neck, you don't raise the ceiling, you slow the rate of filling to actually deal with the problem). Socialism was always something my parents believed was for excessively liberal areas, like Canada and Cali; though they were very forward-thinking regarding social issues, such as homosexuality, recreational drug use, and foreign disputes. I love Sanders' social policy, but I can't see his economics winning many republicans or libertarians over. CMV?
