My husband and I have been here several times already and like this place. We have always been greeted promptly at the door seated quickly. We have had Kaitlin several times as our server and has always been on top of things. The food has been pretty good too! This last time we ordered and shared a house salad, the blackened chicken quesadilla and the venison chili burger. The favorites for me were the fresh crisp house salad and the quesadilla. The venison burger was good but I wasn't a fan of the chili on top of it. In the past we've had the meaty wings, the Philly cheesesteak, Poblano Chicken as entrees. We've also had a large group here where we passed appetizers. The fried pickles, pork sliders mozzarella sticks were all a big hit. One of these times I'm going to get Mom's Pot Roast. The smell alone makes your mouth water. As far as beverages, you can go wrong with a frozen mug of beer. My personal favorite is the Knotty Brunette. A great amber beer which you can get lady or man size. Being this location has had the hardest time keeping occupants I'm glad to see something here that will stay for quite some time.
