I feel that a lot of people believe that democracy is something that non-democratic countries should work towards in order to better themselves as a nation. I think democracy is associated with liberty and the people being happy and better off. When I was younger I used to believe this myself because that was the impression I got from everyone else around me. Now I've grown more cynical. I think in theory this is a great idea but in practice it doesn't work because it just gets hijacked by lobbyists, political idealism, politicians not fulfilling their promises, and the lack of people voting. So much so that at the end of the day your government may as well be run by non-elected officials. I don't think it empowers citizens any more than those in Saudi Arabia who can go directly to their prince and make requests about something. In the US Obama promised to close Guantanamo bay, and a lot of people supported him because of it, but now it seems as if he's powerless to do it. I've voted before, and in that election the guy I voted for did the opposite of what I'd want him to do. In recent elections less than 20 of people turned up because it was about something mundane (electing police commissioners), but when we went to war with Iraq 3 million people marched on London and yet no referendum was called. It seems that politicians can pick out what things they want to be democratic about, and what they would rather choose for themselves. Even when stuff is put to a vote, like Prop 8 in California your opponent can just out-money you, campaign harder and win more votes - which seems more like "whose got the most money?" rather than "what do the people want?." Am I missing anything significant which makes democracy something worth encouraging in non-democratic countries? (sorry if this is too political for CMV, my first post here)
