"Hello, Mr Lee. I can see by the look on your face that you are very confused. I'll explain everything in a little bit, but first I have two questions for you." Where the hell was I? The last thing I remember was the storm. My boat was breaking apart, I set the EPIRB and my PLB, tucked myself into a corner and cried. I had sold everything I had to buy this boat. This trip around the world was supposed to help me find solace. If I hadn't stayed late at the office that night, she wouldn't have had to pick up the kids. She wouldn't have had to rush home to get dinner ready and homework done. She wouldn't have rounded that corner where the black ice was and she wouldn't have rolled the car killing all of them. Because I had a fucking client call I had to take, I had to bury my beautiful girls. "Mr. Lee" I snapped back into focus. "Yes?" "Question 1: Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?" Star Trek!? She's quoting me Star Trek? What the fuck is going on? "Mr. Lee, your answer?" "Yes, of course" "Question 2: Do the ends justify the means?" "They do"
