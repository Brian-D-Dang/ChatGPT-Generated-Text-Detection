In honor of my first cakeday, here is a CMV. Moral character is the only, or at least by far the most heavily-weighted aspect by which I judge other individuals. It seems that people are often judged by their wealth, fame, or success, but those things pale in comparison to moral capacity in my opinion. It is difficult to respect people who are selfish, sociopathic, callous, or just evil, no matter how successful their other accomplishments are. IANAPhilospher, but this might be related to the question of deontology vs consequentialism. Basically, even if they "better other people's lives," however that manifests, through immoral means or intentions, they are immoral. This is also related to the legal concept of mens rea. Although I bring these up as related, hopefully discussions won't evolve completely into conversation about these concepts. Inversely (I think), it is easy to respect people who are demonstrably moral, but not conventionally successful. Even if they are not famous, or wealthy, or productive in a career, as long as they are moralethical, they deserve and earn my respect. I invite you to discuss and CMV! Hello, users of CMV!
