Okay look. We all know that you don't actually mean all trees are made of wood. Every definitive statement is a colloquialism, and not a tautology. Except there's always some random jerk who will chime in and correct you when you use words like "never" or "always." They're never helpful either. It's a plague on CMV too. Someone makes a statement like "CMV: Cops are corrupt." And it never fails that someone points out that they met a guy whose cousin was a cop who pulled over another cop for blowing a red light. And it's always tedious to have to qualify every definitive statement you ever make. Yes, we all get it that definitive statements are always inherently false. We all understand that they're rules of thumb instead of laws. I mean, without the sarcastic italics, all of these definitive statements, if taken as generalizations and hyperbole, would be fine. You're about as helpful as a grammar Nazi. CMV: You're not enriching a conversation by correcting a definitive statement.
