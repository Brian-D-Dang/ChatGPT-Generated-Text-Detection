It's quite a common thing on reddit for people to whine whenever someone says that they "literally" did something or that they "have OCD." obviously these are just examples of hyperbole but the thing that really pisses me off is when people go ahead and say "you're not actually ocd" or "you didn't literally do it, you figuratively did it." Well, nobody gives a shit if you think those words haven't been used for their official meaning, that's how language works. When people say "I'm fucked" it doesn't literally mean that they are engaging in sexual acts and everyone knows this. But when it comes to a condition like OCD people start whining and claiming that it's not being used correctly and it's insulting to people who actually have OCD. But people still describe others as "giants" or "dwarves" even if they don't have giantism or dwarfism and you don't see anyone whining about it. You can still call me a faggot and everyone will know it's just in the context that I'm OP. I don't see why reddit can't accept the usage of OCD as a hyperbole, when terms like megalomaniac are regularly being used for bosses, and psychopath for exes. People need to stop being so nitpicky. You're wasting your time in correcting others and everyone already knows what he means. You can't just control language and tell people their usage of words is wrong, when you can already understand it as a recurring figure of speech.
