So this argument came up between me and some of my friends when I told them I wasn't terribly impressed with Krayzie Bone's response to Rap God, Clash of The Titans. I think it's an impressive technical skill but among rap fans it's incredibly overrated. I think cadence (or flow), tone (and tonal shifts), and lyrics are WAY more important than speed. That's why guys like Twista will never be as big or considered as good as a guy like Tech N9ne. Now I am NOT a Tech fan but I defend the hell out of the guy because he's so talented, His timing, lyricism, but most of all his ability to work within the beat and adjust to the demands of each track are what sets him apart from other speed rappers. So going back to my original comparison, Rap God is a profoundly better track because it's an exhibition of skills beyond just speed, whereas Bone focused straight speed. Drake, Raekwon, Kanye, Kendrick Lamar, Biggie, etc. are all examples of rappers who set themselves apart with things other than speed. Kendrick in my mind is the best example of this because he actually can and occasionally does spit fast, but it's appropriate, and not really his standout quality. The Control verse and BET cypher set the game on fire, not because of the speed he did them, but because of other factors like his lyrical prowess. OK I'm starting to repeat myself but, in conclusion, speed rapping, while impressive and occasionally fitting, is an overrated skill when compared to flow and lyricism.
