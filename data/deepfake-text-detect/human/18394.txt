Ok, first I want to state that I am in no way against gay marriage or homosexuality in anyway. As far as I'm concerned, it's none of my business what two (or however many) people want to do with each other. If two people (or however many) decide to get married, then let them. I want to make it clear, I'm not saying it should be illegal, I think it should be legal. I do not, however, think it is a human rights issue. It's not like gay people are being round up and shot or are forced into ghettos. I mean, it's only marriage. As far as I'm aware, there is no universal declaration of the right to marry. To put it another way, polygamy is also illegal in America. I've yet to hear someone say that this is a violation of human rights and yet what's so fundamentally different between this and gay marriage? (morally, not technically) I personally don't care if polygamy were legal, but I certainly don't consider it a rights issue. TL:DR Basically my view is this: gay marriage is just as much of a humans rights issue as polygamy is and think the current rhetoric surrounding the issue is way too hyperbolic. Also, I don't see the difference between the two from a moral perspective. (I'm not saying either is immoral.) Edit: a word
