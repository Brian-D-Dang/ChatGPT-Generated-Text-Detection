Think of "funny" as something that happens on multiple levels. At level one a man being hit in the face with a pie is funny. That's it, that's the joke. "Haha, that man was hit with a pie." At level two the joke becomes a point of reference. The joke itself isn't really what's funny at the moment, but we recognize it as being funny earlier so other things become compared to it. "Haha, that shirt is as funny as a man being hit in the face with a pie." At level three we start entering true meta territory and things get harder to grasp without the right mindset. The original joke isn't what's funny anymore, it's the reaction others have to the joke. This can be positive, "Haha, I love the look on people's faces when they see videos of guys being hit in the face with pies," or negative, "Haha, pie in the face videos are so old only an idiot would laugh at them." At level four we begin making jokes about making jokes, often in character. Sarcasm lives here. We say "Haha pie in the face" but actually mean "Not funny." At level five the meta meta level begins. Now we're making a joke about the people who are making a joke about the people making a joke. "Haha, pie in the face is hilarious in its simplicity but you're too blinded by ignorance to see past your MTV that says pie in the face is only for old people." And so forth and so on into infinity. What's this got to do with pickles and bananas? Well basically, if you don't get it no one can explain it to you because to get it you just have to get it.','CAN THERE BE A JOKE ON REDDIT WITHOUT IT BEING EXPLAINED?
