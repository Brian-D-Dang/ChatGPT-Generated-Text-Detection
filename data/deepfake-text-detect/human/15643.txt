We just had to come back cause the original experience was so good. We both did the Saturday Build A Burger. Hubby got green chilies, I got green chilies with cheddar cheese. Both yummy, but ya know what, these burgers are sooooooo good they stand alone!!! No need for any garnish, just perfect plain. Most of the time, I order garnish on the side because the burgers are just not that great and I need the add ons. But, boy, these burgers are big, juicy, seared on outside and perfect best word for them perfect. Ordered the sweet potato fries cause of all the Yelp recommendations. Boy, am I ever glad!!! Great dusting of salt with chili powder for a subtle bite, but pair that with the Thai Sweet Chili sauce and WOW!!! Best ever!!! We're going for the Bread Pudding for dessert, so hold on for that review... Well, now, that is bread pudding!! Hubby just remarked, Oh, wow, probably the best I have had There ya go.... another GREAT experience at Thirteen North!!!
