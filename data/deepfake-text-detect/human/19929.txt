Maybe it's just me who's noticed this in my group of friends and in society in general; when one of us achieves something after working for so long (like getting into a professional school, or getting a promotion, as examples) after experiencing the initial bliss and gratification of what you've done, you'll once again fall into the groove of becoming just "satisfied," or wanting more. I feel that almost every one now, because of the demanding and status-based society we live in, will never be happy with what we have or what we've achieved. We'll continually strive for more-but what is the threshold? When is "more" enough? Will we ever be content with what we've been able to do? I don't think we ever will be, and we'll die trying to make ourselves happy. Please CMV.
