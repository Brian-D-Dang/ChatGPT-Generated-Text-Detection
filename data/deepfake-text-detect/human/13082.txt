You know, one thing that always interested me was painting. The first time I picked up the brush, I was able to evoke emotions with colors. It was a sort of synesthesia. However, when I started to become more involved in the business, I noticed that a lot of paintings weren't very evil. I thought that evil didn't receive a fair amount of attention from the art community, so I decided to bring this much-needed evil to the table. My first piece with regard to this endeavor was a rather abstract one, titled, "The Swastika." Though description of abstract work may seem crude, this painting features a small, black design in its center (i.e, the "swastika and a white background. I really wanted to portray the contrast between inherently inferior black people and inherently superior white people. If racism's not evil, I don't know what is (laughs).
