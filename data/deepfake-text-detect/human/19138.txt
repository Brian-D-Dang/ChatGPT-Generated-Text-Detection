Computers are in everything in this day and age, they're more integrated in our lives than nearly any other invention before and they're only going to even more part of our lives in the future. That said I find it somewhat contemptible that so many people have barely a clue about how their computers work and refuse to learn. I feel that most people have some responsibility to know at least the basics of how their computers work and more importantly how to educate themselves about their computers if they encounter a problem. Computers are more than just tools or utilities for enthusiasts, they're becoming a vital part of how we live and work, both socially and professionally. Anything that is such a front and centre and part of our every waking day is something we should have a decent understanding of.
