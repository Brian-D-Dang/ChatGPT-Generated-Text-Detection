TERRIBLE Horrible service. Literally had to get my own water and silverware. Food was so-so. Showed some nasty pieces of celery on my plate of hot wings to the manager...he just said Hmm then walked away. Waited over 15 minutes just for someone to say hello. The two waitresses on duty were much more intent on talking to their friends in the casino than helping customers. Have eaten here twice now over a 2 year period, both times with a restaurant.com coupon. Trust me, no matter what type of coupon I have in the future, I will not eat here again. If this wasn't in the middle of a casino it would be completely empty and bankrupt within a month. TERRIBLE!!
