1. I believe all suspects should receive a fair trial before a jury of at least twelve members, convicted only on unanimous verdict. I also believe suspects in death penalty cases should receive additional counsel (i.e., a special branch of the public defender's office that only handles death penalty trials and appeals). 2. That said, I'm willing to accept that occasionally innocents will be executed. That's regrettable, but the doctrine of double effect, in my view, applies to this and other similar cases (e.g., unintended but foreseeable killing of civilians in wartime). 3. I believe murder is a necessary but not sufficient condition for execution. Not all murderers should be executed (there may be mitigating circumstances), but only murderers should be executed. It should be reserved for a special class of killers. 4. I oppose lethal injection. It's too much like a medical procedure. I don't think there should be any question about what's happening: the State is taking revenge.
