Firstly, let me get something straight. The USA is technically a democracy, in the strict sense that the legislative organs and government is directly and indirectly elected by the people. But, by the same definition, [China is also a Democracy] - the local People's Congresses are directly elected, who in turn elect their representatives for the National people's congress. Clearly, simply having elected representatives does not qualify you as a democracy, and I would assume most people are not willing to call China a democratic state. Instead, I would argue that what most people mean by Democratic state is one where all commonly held opinions and ideas held by the populous are represented in the legislative process, and that all ideas and ideologies have equal opportunity to gain representation. By such a definition, China falls short, since only opinions within the Communist party's ideology are represented in the NPC. But so does the United States, given the plural, two party system it upholds. After all, if we look the parliaments of states usually considered to be democratic, we find a huge range of views and ideologies represented. Everything from the usually marginal Green, SocialistCommunist, Libertarian and Nationalist range of parties, to the usually more dominant Social democrat, Liberal and Conservative parties have representatives in parliament. This is not the case in the US nor in China, where the system itself prevents any ideologies not part of the political establishment from gaining representation (regardless of popular support). I would assume that this view is rather unique, so Change My View!
