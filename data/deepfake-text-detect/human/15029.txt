Wow. Unexpected, incredible surprise. Food was amazing, every course absolutely perfect with diverse tastes and vibrant flavors. I have a spoiled palette and I will have trouble going anywhere else in Las Vegas. Foodies, try Sage, stat! Also, our waiter, Bond, Julian Bond was awesome and very fun. If you are lucky enough to get him, let him order for you. We were blown away.
