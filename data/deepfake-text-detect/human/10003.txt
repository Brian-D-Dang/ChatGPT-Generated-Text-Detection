Take three people, Persons A, B, and C. They live in the US. Person A was born here and is a citizen. They happen to be a huge idiot and don't even know what the president DOES. They have the right to vote with literally no requirements other than surviving for 18 years and registering. They can vote. Person B is basically Albert freaking Einstein. They have the highest known IQ in the world. They know every position of all the candidates and can vote with the utmost qualification. Before they do this, they must pass a citizenship test. They do, and they can vote. Person C is just as dumb as Person A. They're not sure why people speak French in Montreal despite having lived in Canada their entire life. They moved to the US and are unable to pass a citizenship test after living in the US for the requisite time. They cannot vote. Only Person B is qualified to vote, yet Persons A and B can both do so. Why not have Person A take the same test as Persons B and C before they can vote? EDIT: People below have already changed my view. (If you have something new to say, though, say it! I'm interested in what people think.) Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
