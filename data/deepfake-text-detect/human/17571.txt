People that I have talked to discuss about how banning abortion won't stop it and it will drive people to do more unhealthy illegal abortions that are more detrimental to the health of society than regulated legal abortions. While this point is valid, I cannot get over the way I perceive abortion as simple murder. In my view, although dependent on the body of the mother, when a sperm meets an egg that fetus has the mechanism to become human. This "potential" is not met by sperm or the egg because by themselves they cannot form a human being. Just like any murder, we have a moral obligation to stop it, even if it is rampant. Tossing any religion views aside, for me it comes down to murder, and I see no way around it. If many people were murdering fully developed humans for benefit to their lives, I believe that we still have the obligation to stop it, even if it is the norm. For me, the same logic applies to abortion.
