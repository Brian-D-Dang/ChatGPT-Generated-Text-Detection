I may be a bit biased due to how sluts are viewed in the town I grow up in, but I've really only had close friends that are sluts. To me and most people I know, being a slut is about seeing what you want and putting out to get it, regardless of what old world religious morals say you should do. It's about pleasing yourself and others, and just having fun. Virgins and monogamous people aren't being true to their primal desires, and it's sad that they're suppressing something that would make them happy. CMV. Hello, users of CMV!
