I'm not saying that George Washington was necessarily bad and I'm not saying that he was a bad general. His military skill was impressive, but I don't really understand why people revere him so much as a President. Sure, he didn't actively destroy the new country, but as a politician, he was kind of an idiot. All of the important policies in his presidency were actually thought up by Alexander Hamilton and it seems to me that the only reason people think of him as a great President is because he was first.
