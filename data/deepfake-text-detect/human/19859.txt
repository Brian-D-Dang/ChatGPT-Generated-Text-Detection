Hi, I'm a mtf transgender person, and my lack of understanding of the female experience is making feel disgusted with myself and want to die. I have all kinds of horrific misogyny and feel like a fraud for being trans. I posted to raskwomen but they pointed me here. Please help! Um, some of my horrible views: I'm not sure what the problem with guys staring is. I can see that it's a problem. A lot of people say it's objectification, but isn't that viewing someone as non-human? Isn't it more sexualisation? Is it just creepy? What is it? I feel like both women and men are at risk from violence. Although women are at far more risk for rape, and that's much worse emotionally. I think that male victims of rape and domestic abuse are taken less seriously and have fewer available resources. I'm not sure what the exact problem is with sexualised imagery. What is it? And isn't a problem for both men and women? I think the gender pay gap is partially caused by difference in occcupations and the tendency for women to spend more time on childcare. I can definitely see a lack of respect for women in the workplace, but I don't think it's the entire cause. And I probably have all kinds of other disgusting misogynistic misconceptions. Please, women of CMV, help me understand the female perspective before I invalidate myself and commit suicide over this. I really need your help. Hello, users of CMV!
