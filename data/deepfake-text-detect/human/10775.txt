The difference between the runs they have scored and the runs they have allowed. For example if Oakland has scored 300 runs and allowed 288 they would have a 12 run differential. Some people put a big emphasis on run differential to help determine if a team's win loss record is a fluke. If a team has a winning record but has been outscored by 30 runs, the thought is that things have "fallen into place" for them just perfect and they will probably regress. This is obviously true the other way around as well (a team with poor win loss record but good run differential).
