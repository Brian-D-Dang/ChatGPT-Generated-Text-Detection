This has been on my mind lately thanks to the porn star at Duke who's been all over Redditthe news. I have no problem with people doing porn if that's their chosen career. I also recognize that lots of people have no way to pay for college. However, universities should prohibit their students from using porn to fund their tuition. When one student does porn to pay for school, it gradually becomes a socially acceptable choice. Then society (mostly unconsciously) pressures other women to make the same choice; a woman who wants to go to college but has no money will essentially be told "go do porn to get what you want." Many young women who otherwise would never consider porn will decide it's a good option. The whole reason to go to university is to avoid having to go into jobs like porn. Obviously lots of people work shitty jobs (fast food, janitor, etc) while they are at school, and this is fine because society respects people who work hard to get ahead. Unfortunately, porn carries with it a stigma that makes it more difficult to go into another career. I'm sorry, but you cannot change the fact that a significant portion of society will always shun porn stars. I feel bad for saying these things, because I personally don't have any problem with people doing porn. But pretending it's anything less than taboo will only force people into making bad choices.
