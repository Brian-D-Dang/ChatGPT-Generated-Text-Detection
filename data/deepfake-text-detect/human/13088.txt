Prince Horace raised an eyebrow at his aging father. "Your Highness, that's..... that's your servant. Timothy and I stand before you; why did you go to such great lengths to crown a mere commoner?" "Silence," King Jerry croaked. "I have crowned the rightful heir!" "But I'm the eldest," Prince Timothy protested. "If you're going by inheritance, I would be the king." "And," Horace added, "if you were to go by competence, it would be Sir Kendrick. He has, by far, proved himself to be a wonderfully skilled knight, with the might and intelligence to match even the greatest kings. If you do not wish to pass on the crown to your sons, I suppose I understand that, but..... why Ian?" "Silence!" the king roared. "Ian shall rule after me!" "Father, he can't walk two steps without tripping on his own feet," Timothy said. "And he does nothing but gossip all day," Horace exclaimed. "And he scares the chickens," one of the maids screeched. The king stamped his foot. "Are none of you listening?! Ian is the rightful heir! He's my son!" The court gasped in unison. Sir Beritan, a particularly effeminate nobleman, stuck his nose in the air and scoffed, "Even our dear king isn't above fathering bastards!" King Jerry waved his hand dismissively. "Not like that, you presumptuous pansy. You see, once upon a time, I was convinced that I was..... er..... impotent, if you catch my drift." "Catch your..... Father, why are you using anachronistic language?" "Silence! So, I became concerned that I wouldn't have any children. Thus, I grabbed Ian and told him that when I died, he would be my heir. I am going to keep that promise and make Ian king!" Twelve days later, the kingdom was burnt to the ground.
