As a South Korean, I have learned that North Koreans and South Koreans should be united back again as it was one country just few decades ago. I do agree to some extent that it is important to unite back Korea as a whole. Education has told me so and it is one of the strongest desires that South Koreans have. However, one day I came to an idea that the difference between North Korea and South Korea (economically and socially, rather than politically) is too great and that true unity will not happen. With North Korea being underdeveloped in so many ways, it would be hard for them to keep up with the more modernized life that South Koreans have. Will North Koreans keep up with the lives of South Koreans and vice versa if the two countries are united?
