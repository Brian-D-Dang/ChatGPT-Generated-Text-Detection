I realise that this is a meme one itself nowadays, but as a black man I have absolutely no sympathy for any redditor who was on coontown. These people hate me, and I hate them, plain and simple, and I am happy it made their lives even slightly worse. However, the main response to it from neutral people has been that it sets a bad precedent. But again, I don't care if all hate subreddits are banned. People have said that it is the issue of how to define what a hate subreddit is, but I just think that this is a diversionary argument of semantics. The difference between, say Coontown, and Shitredditsays is light and day, and anyone who says different needs to walk a mile in other peoples shoes. The final argument against seems to be that the banning of coontown was for reasons of brigading, and that this was wrong. If this is the case, then Shitredditsays should be banned too, and I certainly wouldn't miss it, but I really wouldn't argue that Coontown should be brought back. For obvious reasons. So reddit, what am I missing? Change my view!
