If we want to actually be non-discriminatory, race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation should not be included in college applications or considered during admission reviews. Getting into college should be based on the applicant's academic achievements, not how they are viewed in society. The most prevalent example of this is affirmative action, which gives African Americans a greater chance of getting into college than someone with equal or slightly better attributes in other areas. Instead of giving the minority an upper hand, colleges should exclude any information that would define a person as a minority and give everyone an equal chance. Edit: I guess I didn't exactly explain my reasoning. I do believe that we are inherently a racist society, whether we are individually racist or not. Everyone benefits or is hindered by race. While I am not opposing Affirmative Action or trying to eradicate race from the admittance process, I am suggesting we take out race, as well as religion, gender, and sexual orientation from the application. There will still be race and other defining qualities imbedded in the application through essays, jobs, clubs, etc. Why does the applicant need to be labeled as "black" or "gay" or "muslim" from the start?
