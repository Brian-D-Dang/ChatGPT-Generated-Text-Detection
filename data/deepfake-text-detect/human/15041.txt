Food is great but the hookah was very disappointing. I have been here a few times and enjoyed the place a lot. After bragging about it to my friends we all decided to go and we were extremely disappointed. The waiter came back maybe 10 times to fix our hookah and every time was worse. We always get the same flavor but this time it was way too strong and sometimes way too lite after just a few min. Of smoking it. It gave us all stomach aches too. Again the food was amazing but not so much the hookah.
