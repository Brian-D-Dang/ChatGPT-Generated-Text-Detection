Here in San Diego, I just got a call from UCSD Hospitals warning me that my November 20 doctors appointment was likely to be delayed as a result of a pending hospital strike. The message also discouraged walk-in medical care during the strike. I did some research and apparently, hospital union strikes aren't that rare. These strikes are the result of a actions taken by the same labor unions that lobbied on behalf of Obamacare under the argument that health care is a fundamental human right. If they are right, and health care is in fact a right, then health care providers should not be allowed to strike (no different from other essential service providers like police and fire fighters). If health care is a human right, than any action to reduce health care access (like going on strike) is, by definition, an abridgement of human rights. You will not CMV by arguing that health care is not a right. That's not the question I'm posing. Instead, I'm interested in intellectual honesty on the part of labor unions. To CMV, you must show me why allowing any preventable denial of health care is permissible in a system that recognizes health care as a fundamental right.
