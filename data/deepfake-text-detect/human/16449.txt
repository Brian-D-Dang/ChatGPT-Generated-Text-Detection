Lloyd's k -means algorithm is one of the most classical clustering method, which is widely used in data mining or as a data pre-processing procedure. However, due to the thin-tailed property of the Gaussian distribution, k -means suffers from relatively poor performance on the heavy-tailed data or outliers. In addition, k -means have a relatively weak stability, i. e. its result has a large variance, which reduces the credibility of the model. In this paper, we propose a robust and stable k -means variant, the t - k -means, as well as its fast version in solving the flat clustering problem. Theoretically, we detail the derivations of t - k -means and analyze its robustness and stability from the aspect of loss function, influence function and the expression of clustering center. A large number of experiments are conducted, which empirically demonstrates that our method has empirical soundness while preserving running efficiency.
