Every now and then I see 'amazing' art made only with MS Paint and no expensive software, [such as this] , or [this] . Yes it looks good, but just because you used MS Paint doesn't make the art any better. It shouldn't matter if an artist learnt to point with his feet instead of his hands, its the product that matters. I can understand in some cases MS Paint would have been one of the first digital mediums for artists and so some may have mastered it, but I see no reason for anybody today to say " I'm going to learn MS Paint! " . If the same time was spent learning Photoshop or Illustrator much better content could have been produced. [For example this] . Before anybody brings up the price of the software, have [a look at GIMP] essentially a free Photoshop. Learning MS Paint is a waste of time and could be better spent on other digital art software.
