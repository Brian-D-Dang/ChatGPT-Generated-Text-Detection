I already thought it was very likely in the near term and even long term George W Bush was going to go down as the worst president in history, but now after we are seeing Iraq unravel, I'm sure of it. Lets review all of his failures: 1. Asleep at the wheelignoring all the warnings for 911 2. Completely falsemade up pretext for the war in Iraq (WMDs), completely destabilizing the region (as we are seeing now) for decades. 3. After starting two wars in the middle east, engaged in doomed attempt at nation buildingbringing democracy in order to enrich the military industrial complex and oil buddies. 4. Asleep at the wheel during the housingfinance bust, presiding over the worst recession since the great depression. 5. Cut taxes for the rich bringing us the biggest deficit and debt in history, resulting in MASSIVE spending cuts on social services during the great recession. And probably many more I'm leaving out, but I think this is enough to get this conversation started.
