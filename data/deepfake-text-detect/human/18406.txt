I decided to look up the history of bank runs and was very surprised. I was taught that federal insurance was designed to prevent banks runs, yet not only did these bank runs not happen before, they still happened afterward. On the other hand FDIC provides a clear distortion by providing what is essentially 0 risk bonds to consumers who end up putting their money in banks and demanding NO ACCOUNTABILITY from the banks themselves effectively making the taxpayer subsidize the "irresponsible" investor.
