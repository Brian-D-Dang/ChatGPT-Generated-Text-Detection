I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think scientists would respond if something did happen that disproved the uniformity of nature. I believe if something suddenly changed, scientists would acknowledge this change and attempt further investigation into why this change was possible. I do not believe that scientists would simply outright deny that a change has happened, which is what I think they would do if they simply assumed the uniformity of nature. Hello, users of CMV!
