When I see a guy who is fat, I am appalled he allowed himself to get there. I am a big guy myself, (over 300 pounds currently, probably the fattest I've been in my life) but also capable of performing physical feats that a lot of in-shape people cannot do. (Such as cartwheels, diving rolls, ect.) Where am I wrong in judging these people? I understand the concept that some people have no control over it, because it's a medical problem, but that isn't the case for most of them. Why are they unable to perform physical feats that anybody with a nominal level of agility can perform? Please change my view, because right now, I see a fat guy who gets tired walking up stairs and I think, "This guy deserves to be unhappy." I should point out... I think I'm spectacular. This is not a pity party for me. I merely dislike OTHER fat people. I know this is after you all replied and I'm sorry but... Edit: I should clarify that I've been a fat guy my whole life, and I don't mean every fat person. I put it in the title but forgot to put it in the actual post. MOST fat people. I think it's a thing of confidence. I see a guy who just slouches and he's fat, and I immediately dislike him.
