I've noticed that in a lot of shipwreck movies, the fate of being marooned on a tropical island is portrayed as a dreadful thing. In Pirates of the Caribbean, for example, Johnny Depp is horrified at the thought of being abandoned on a perfectly lush island. In Cast Away, Tom Hanks is determined to escape, to the point of suicidal despair. The 1961 movie Mysterious Island also features this idea of poor stranded souls sinking into utter depravity and torment. But when I think about it, it doesn't seem all that bad to me. I think it would be a fun adventure and that I could mentally manage the solitude. In some ways, it even seems preferable to the peculiar anxieties of modern urban living. This is all presupposing, of course, that I had a reliable source of drinkable water, and a bare-minimum supply of food. As far as I can tell, coconut palms could provide both of these plus plenty of shade. I'm imagining an island that's at least 1,000 acres in area (so not like a Far Side cartoon) and for the sake of make-believe, I would have the place all to myself except for birds. After an adjustment period of maybe six months or so, it would be a peaceful, monastic life. I could exercise, teach myself astronomy at night, and make a little cove area to farm oysters and the like. So what's wrong with my fantasy? What am I missing? Change my view!
