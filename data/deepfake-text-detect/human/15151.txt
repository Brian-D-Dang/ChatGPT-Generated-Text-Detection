We've been to Bacon Bar several times, and the food has always been very good and very consistent. My favorite item is the Bacon Burger; it's literally the BEST burger I've ever had! In fact, I love it so much, I can't seem to order anything else for my entree! Lol My husband had the Bacon Sloppy Joe and said it was very good. Must've been, since he ate the whole thing in about 5 minutes flat and he never eats much. The Man Candy is decadent, as it's served with Crown Royal Maple infused syrup. YUM!! I like that they have a lot of items on the menu other than bacon. I looooove bacon, so I'm in heaven when we eat there, but my daughter likes other things, so there's a good selection for her to choose from. The service is good to very good and the servers have always been friendly. We always sit at the bar so we can play the machines. We've never won anything significant so the machines seem to be a little tight, but each time our drinksbeers were comped. We would go to Bacon Bar more, but it's about a 25 minute drive from our house.
