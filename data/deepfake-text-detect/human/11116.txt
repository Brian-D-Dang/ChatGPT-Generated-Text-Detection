Modern CPUs have a lot of things built into the chip. You've got memory controllers, PCI Express controllers, USB controllers, graphics chips and all sorts of other things. Motherboards need to be designed to interface with all of these things properly. If the chip changes, you need to redesign motherboards having different pinouts makes sure there's no confusion. In years past, when a CPU was just a CPU the motherboard chipset handled all those other features, it was much easier to share a CPU socket between generations of processors. Back in the Pentium 2Pentium 3 era, there were several major revisions of the CPU that could all work with the chipsets on Slot 1 boards and, even after Intel upgraded to Socket 370, they were still logically identical so a Socket 370 CPU could be put into an adapter board and run in a Slot 1 motherboard without a problem.," "Consumer friendly design means that if it fits mechanically, it should work electrically. There are a few technology improvements between the two devices you mention. The most obvious example: LGA1151 devices support DDR4 memory, while LGA1150 devices do not. Many LGA1151 motherboards only have DDR4 slots. If they allowed LGA1150 devices to fit into a DDR4-only motherboard, a lot of people would end up with a CPU that can't work with their memory and they'll be cursing intel for it.," "New CPUs may support new features that older motherboards don't (e.g., DDR4 vs DDR3). If they make it so that the new CPU doesn't fit in the old motherboard, you're forced to get a motherboard for your new CPU. It ensures compatibility.
