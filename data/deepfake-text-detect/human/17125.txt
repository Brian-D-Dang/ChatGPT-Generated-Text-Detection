Communication services with heterogeneous performance requirements are emerging as key use cases for 5G and beyond. This paper deals with the coexistence of two service classes, i.e., critical service (CS) and non-critical service (NCS) on a grant-free channel consisting of the radio access and backhaul segments. On the radio access segment, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices send packets to a set of non-cooperative access points (APs) using slotted ALOHA (SA). The APs then forward correctly received messages to a base station over a shared wireless backhaul segment adopting SA. The APs hence play the role of low-complexity relays that improve space diversity and reduce performance losses caused by interference on the access segment. We study first a simplified erasure channel model, which is well suited for non-terrestrial applications. Then, in order to account for terrestrial scenarios, the impact of fading is considered. Throughput and packet success rate metrics are derived, and numerical results are provided to assess the performance trade-offs between CS and NCS. Among the main conclusions, we show that orthogonal inter-service resource allocation is generally preferred for NCS devices, while non-orthogonal protocols can improve the throughput and packet success rate of CS devices for both terrestrial and non-terrestrial scenarios.
