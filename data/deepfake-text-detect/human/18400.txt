Let me preface this by saying that I will not have ANY children. However, I think that there is really no reason for anyone to have more than two children. The environmental footprint and pollution caused by large families will continue to rise, and these children will be growing old on a much more overcrowded planet than we even experience today. I do not believe the government should regulate family size, but I think smart and educated people should realize that they're being jackasses when they decide to have more than two kids. CMV so I can stop being such a cynical young lady. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
