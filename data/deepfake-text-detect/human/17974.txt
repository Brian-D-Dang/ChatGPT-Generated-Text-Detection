I'm mostly talking about majors. For a person like me who is going into undergrad and choosing a major, a foreign language major has better career prospects than a mathematics major. Outside of actuarial science, which has very saturated entry-level prospects, there is little that directly relates to a mathematics degree. A foreign language degree, however, provides a path into translation, which has one of the highest growth rate of any occupation and is more open to self-employment. And I realize that there are incomepay discrepancies, but that's not my focus really. My focus is more on employment (ie not being unemployed or underemployed) and on America. I know, I know, "STEM is good," but I really think translation is an under-promoted career (so there's a good side to America's poor foreign language education) CMV:D Hello, users of CMV!
