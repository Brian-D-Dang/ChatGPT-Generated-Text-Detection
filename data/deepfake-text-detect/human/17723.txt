After watching Marco Rubio's interview on The Daily Show, I see his plan to expand the EITC as a way to subsidize low wages so that the profit margins of businesses are not impacted by being forced to pay all costs for their employees. This is another plan to socialize the losses and privatize the profits for business in America. How is this not giving companies even more leverage to lower wages even further or simply to not increase wages as necessary, thereby causing the taxpayer to subsidize the profit margins that a company would normally have to cut in order to maintain employees? He goes on to claim that this subsidization will allow companies to put off the (eventual) automation of the business. Why should we put that time off to the future and pay the costs in the meantime? If a company cannot stay in business without being subsidized then is it really a business or just an arm of the government that is being manipulated to pay the executives a higher wage? Should McDonalds be absorbed as a function of the government? I don't think so, but it seems as though some think it should be supported like it's a part of our national economic security. Please change my view, because I'm kinda confused about these types of "solutions."
