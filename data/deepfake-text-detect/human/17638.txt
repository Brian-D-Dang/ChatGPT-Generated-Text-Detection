So currently a lot of government benefits in the US are given as "in kind" transfers, where the government gives you a voucher to buy a specific sort of thing. In particular, food stamps give people a debit card with which they can buy non-prepared food from grocery stores and other food retailers. I think the restriction on what can be bought with these benefits should be repealed, and that the recipients should decide for themselves what they want to buy. The restriction on buying only food is paternalistic, and reduces the range of options available to poor families. Changing the benefit to a cash transfer will improve the welfare of poor families, while saving the government money on their administration of the program. The rules requiring purchasing only food seem designed around ideas that poor people are irresponsible and prone to bad decision making, and that the government knows better than them what they need. While some people would make worse decisions with the money, it does not seem fair to greatly reduce the value of these benefits for the large majority of recipients who are conscientious people in extremely difficult circumstances. But these programs became the way they are for a reason, so maybe I'm missing something. Change my view. Edit 1: So far uiserane has gotten furthest along in altering my view, though not fully there yet. But I need to get some sleep here, so will respond to more posts in the morning.
