I have been getting into classical music lately and absolutely loving it. I've been exposing myself to all of the greats sort of in vaguely chronological order Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, and enjoying every step of the way, except Mozart. I haven't heard anything in his works (of which, I admit, I have not heard as much as some others) that is as technically impressive or as powerfully emotional as many other composers. I understand that he was one of the greats for his time and a child prodigy and all, but through modern eyes I really don't think there's anything special about him. If it's relevant, I have about 5 years' experience in piano and have been teaching myself about music theory for the past year or two. And please do include examples if you feel they're necessary.
