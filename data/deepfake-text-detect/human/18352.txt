First of all, let me clarify what I mean by communism. There is a lot of misinformation and a lack of understanding regarding the philosophy. It isn't the totalitarian despotism of Stalin, and it isn't a welfare state where people are paid uniform wages. Communism is anarchic; it is stateless, moneyless and classless. Personally, I consider myself a Marxist - by way of Proletarian revolution, to socialism to communist along with things like the materialist conception of history and the labour theory of value - but only because I see the distinction between Marxists and Anarchists as a total redundancy - as both lead to communism. A communist economy would be decentralised and democratically run by workers operating in a horizontal, free association of workplace - syndicate - federation. People would not get paid, driven by a desire to contribute and a psychological indifference between producers and consumers. People would be given access to a free, communal store of goods for them to take. I do not find any criticisms of communism to be disestablishing. The idea of human nature being incompatible by way of selfishness isn't logical. Selfishness is an expression of a desire to improve one's lot - which is universal. In a society based around free association and cooperation, the expression of this desire would alter to a mutually beneficial state among individuals through economic federations. I hold this rather extreme philosophy because I believe it to be the ultimate destiny of humanity. It is egalitarian, and ultimately free. The word idealist means nothing to me, because if I didn't strive for a better world, I couldn't be able to look myself in the mirror. I am going to stop here, because I can't really think of much else to say. I have only acknowledged one of the 'mainstream' arguments against communism, so I'm not against anyone bringing another up, but I hope this to be productive.
