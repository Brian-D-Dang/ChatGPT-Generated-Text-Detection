The day started off raining and I just finished my morning coffee. A breaking news story of a school shooting was being broadcasted. I panicked, knowing this was my son's University he attended. As I looked down at my phone to call, I see a text that was delivered. "You made me like this, Dad" my heart filled with sadness and regret.
