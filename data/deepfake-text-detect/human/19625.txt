People often use the statement "we are nation of laws, not a nation of men" to justify sentences or rulings that seem unfair. I think this statement is bullshit. We live in a nation of men who interpret ambiguous laws, according to their own biases and prejudices. These men are educated and wealthy - and show a bias against people who aren't like them. [You are more likely to get parole if the judge hearing your case has had lunch] . If we were really a nation of laws, not men - then the laws would be written in computer code. Humans would input the facts of the case - decided by juries - and the computers would process the outcome according to the laws. The system we have now, the judge acts something like this computer, with the lawyers presenting cases to the judge, trying to interpret the law in a way that benefits their client. To pretend that "the law is the law" and it's beyond the judge to change it, throw it out, or modify it at his will, that he is bound by it at all times - is to do everyone an intellectual disservice. In order to get to the 'nation of laws, not of men' state, we need the laws to be written in a formal language - computer code. Juries could still make decisions about matters of fact - and these facts would be put into the computer code, to determine crimes. I'd say this is much more how a 'nation of laws' would operate.
