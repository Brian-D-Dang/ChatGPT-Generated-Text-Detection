Nearby, in Ogrod Saski (the Saxon Garden), the Summer Theatre was in operation from 1870 to 1939, and in the inter-war period, the theatre complex also included Momus, Warsaw's first literary cabaret, and Leon Schiller's musical theatre Melodram. The Wojciech Boguslawski Theatre (1922-26), was the best example of "Polish monumental theatre." From the mid-1930s, the Great Theatre building housed the Upati Institute of Dramatic Arts - the first state-run academy of dramatic art, with an acting department and a stage directing department.
