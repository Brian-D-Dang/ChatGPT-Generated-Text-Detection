Mandatory voting is an objectionable policy. If citizens have the right to vote, they should have the right to abstain from voting. If one has the right to worship as they please, they also have the right to abstain for worshiping entirely, do they not? So why is voting held to a different standard in nations like Australia? One argument I've heard in favor of mandatory voting is that you can choose write-in candidates or "none of the above." This makes the policy less objectionable to me, but does not make it entirely acceptable. Citizens are not required to register (or be in any way affiliated) with atheist or agnostic groups, so once again, why should voting be treated differently? Furthermore, why is the institution of voting entitled to even one second of my time? Why should I be required, under penalty of law, to take time out of my day to vote? Under what grounds do I owe the state my time? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
