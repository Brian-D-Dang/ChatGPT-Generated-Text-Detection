In this paper, we propose a novel image calibration algorithm for a twofold c TIDAC. The algorithm is based on simulated annealing, which is often used in the field of machine learning to solve c DFO problems. The c DAC under consideration is part of a digital transceiver core that contains a high speed c ADC, microcontroller, and digital control via a c SPI. These are used as tools for designing an algorithm which suppresses the interleave image to the noise floor. The algorithm is supported with experimental results in silicon on a 10-bit twofold c TIDAC operating at a sample rate of 50 GSs in 14nm CMOS technology.
