Atheists often claim that a belief must be falsifiable or that it isn't really a belief at all, merely an empty statement. But I have asked various atheists what evidence would make them believe in a God. A few of them said things like God coming down from the clouds and saying hello, or him re-arranging the stars to write a message, stuff like that. But then I say, well if that happened would you believe it was actually God causing that, or the scientists who created the simulation in which we live? And they invariably agree with the latter. My thesis is: there is no evidence that, to an average atheist, points more to the existence of a God and not to the idea that we are in The Matrix or something equivalent. Therefore atheism is not falsifiable.
