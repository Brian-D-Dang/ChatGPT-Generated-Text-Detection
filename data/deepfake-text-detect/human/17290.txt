I believe that the power is still with the people in the United States. There is a lot of talk about how the peoples' views are oppressed by big business. I don't think this is true. The American people ultimately control what happens. Citizens elect officials with similar views as their own and continue to keep them in office because they believe they are doing a good job. Additionally, whenever a bill that many people oppose is introduced, it is quickly struck down. A good example of this is SOPA and the war in the middle east. Even when corporation are involved, they are usually bigger names such as Google, which are only successful because public opinion favors their policies. If such companies are able to grow so large, they must share the same views as common people because it is the people supporting said companies
