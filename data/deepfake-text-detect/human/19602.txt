I feel this to wrong. For starters, I feel the death penalty itself to be wrong, but even more so for the mentally ill. They have no say in their condition, and atrocities made by them are attributed to poor care and treatment for them. They didn't chose to be insane. I think we should just send them to mental hospitals instead of killing them. This would be a more logical choice, as we can account their human rights, and care for them to their specific needs. If we are to do this instead, our society would be less fearing of them, but more accepting and wanting to outreach to them. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
