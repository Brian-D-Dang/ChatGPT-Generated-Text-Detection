(She might even be forbidden from showing them, depending on whether it is hard to fake such recordings (we do not want courts to be able to use failure to produce recordings as evidence against Alice); alternatively, failure to produce recordings would be forbidden to be used as evidence (though we know how well that works in practice "But how would you store all that data?" This is a problem that would solve itself given time, if technology continues to advance as it currently does. But nevertheless, you might transmit recordings to a central storage where terabytes are cheap; you might make the recordings largely poor quality through lossy recording; you might tag the past hour as noninteresting enough to only store the bare minimum of data.
