Depends on the car, older cars, they'd start right up, on more or less all of the newer ones, nothing, and you might set off the car alarm. This is because older cars the ignition was just a switch wired to the starter motor and stuff, picking it would work just fine. On newer ones, the key is usually chipped, and the ignition is switched to the computer on the car with a second chip reader wired to the car. When you turn the ignition the computer runs a scan of the key, if it's an authorized key it starts the engine. If that key isn't there when the computer checks it the engine isn't going to start.
