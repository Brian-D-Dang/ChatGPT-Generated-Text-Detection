The blood was everywhere. There are some things that do not wash out: blood and wine. These thick liquids tarnish the symbol of our elite so easily. Wine though, you usually expect it. You usually see it cascade over the brim of the cup. But blood, blood is unexpected. Today I did not expect it. I did not expect the screams, the shrill feeling of betrayal that reverberated off the walls of the hallowed hall. How could this happen? How could my patron, my pater, be struck down in an act of malice? He was bold, yes. He was strong, of course. But the bigger the giant, the larger the back to be stabbed. When it was done, the silent chaos was filled with words of "Libertas! Libertas!" Like a group of rowdy young men they burst out of the Senate Hall out into the streets. Out to greet the surprised faces of the people. Their togas still sticky with their vile act. No free air that filled my lungs was enough. This air was not free today. This air was dirtied. I went for water. To wash this foulness from my pallet. Blood though, blood from the actors of this scene filled the pool. It spread like a cancer as I tried to wash it off. But I could not. For he was dead. And Rome bled.
