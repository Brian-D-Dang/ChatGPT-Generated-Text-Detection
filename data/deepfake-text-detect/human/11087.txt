Your body really wants to store food as fat, and only builds muscle reluctantly if it is sure it has plenty of calories left over. If you want to be as strong as possible, you make you sure you eat as much as possible, and don't worry if you have fat in additional muscle. If you want to have large appear, well defined muscles like body builders do, you have to strike a balance between low fat and big muscles. This is usually accomplished by having a bulking phase, where eat a lot to gain muscle, and a cutting phase, where you eat little to gain lose fat. In the end, you do not wind up as strong as if you had only concentrated on gaining muscle.," "Strongmen require a metric fuckton of energy (read: calories) to be able to do what they do.
