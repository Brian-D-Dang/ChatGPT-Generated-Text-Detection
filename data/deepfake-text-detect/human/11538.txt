Google is close to finalizing a deal to buy or lease a 1.3 million square foot office building in the West Village. The space is large enough to allow Google to hire an additional 8,500 workers. Google is also planning to expand its Chelsea market property by adding 300,000 square feet, which will allow for another 3,500 workers. It looks like Amazon won't be the only tech giant looking to expand in New York City.
