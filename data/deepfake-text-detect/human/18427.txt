First, a disclaimer: I'm not an economist, and a lot about financial systems confuses me. That said, I think financial markets are infested with capitalist leeches, who make money for doing nothing. My understanding of how an "investment" should work is that you research trends and take an informed guess as to how a company will fair in the future, kind of like political donations; candidates with no chance aren't worth investing in, while in tight races a little investment can push one candidate over the top. You take a little risk and earn a lot of profit when a company succeeds. But this isn't how most professional trading is done. More than half of all trading is [High-frequency trading] . Basically computers watch the market, look for trends and near instantly respond to get a cut of the profit. When a stock goes up, they jump in and buy lots of shares, and then immediately sell when the rise starts to cap. These trades happen within milliseconds, and they're getting faster as infrastructure improves. What value do High frequency trades provide? They are not "investing," they're leeching off other investors. By buying and selling so quickly, they provide no capital for companies to use, as it's gone almost immediately. I always hear about how important Wall Street is to the economy, but how important can it be if it's just a forum for huge companies to suck capital from smaller, legitimate investors? Things can't be as bad as I'm imagining, please CMV. Edit: It seems like HFT is the natural evolution of [Day trading] , which I see as similarly useless and exploitative. I'm not too focused on HFT, more on rapid trading in general that doesn't fit the definition of an "investment," or any other conceptual flaws someone might identify.
