There is not much to argue about this, the reality speaks to itself. Just think of the African or Asian French domains, or of Haiti, or wherever the French colonial domination set its rules. The French governing brought no rules, no civilization but only spoil of their their territories, famine, savagery and violently discriminating laws. Nowadays, the ex French colonies are poor, uneducated and fighting to keep up the pace with the rest of the world, while the British colonies have remained endowed with reasonable political and law systems, promising social dynamics and an acceptable living standard.
