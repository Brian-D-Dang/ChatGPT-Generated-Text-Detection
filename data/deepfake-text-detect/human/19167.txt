I've noticed that often people are too quick to anger. Yesterday on the streets I saw two men headbutting each other after a car accident then immediately started brawling. Or another example is rioting. A few bad apples turning the Ferguson protests into anarchy. It's extremely emotional and irrational and cannot solve this judicialcopracism problem. I understand that frustration is perfectly fine like when someone cuts me off while merging in my lane, but for me to have immediate anger is misguided. It turns the situation into an "us vs. them" dispute. Maybe the driver had loud kids distracting him or her. And had a misjudgment when merging. Maybe he had a powerful sneeze? Lastly nothing consequently good can come from anger. So why do people continue to have this misguided reaction everywhere from outside to Reddit in general?
