I just watched finished watching the Voyager episode, "Prey," where Seven of Nine prevents the ship being destroyed by a race called the Hirogen, and disobeys Janeway's orders in the process. Janeway gets angry with her and punishes her for doing this, at the end of the episode. I know; you're probably going to accuse me of being an autistic geek who needs to get a life, but here is my point. After the end of Star Trek: The Next Generation, a couple of real life generals from the American armed forces, wrote a leadershipself-help book from the perspective of Captain Picard, and actually used several episodes from that show, as examples of the principles that they were discussing. I can't see anyone doing that for Janeway or Voyager; if anything, they could use her as an example of what not to do. The other thing that really bothers me about this, is that whenever I've brought it up in the past, women have always immediately reached for the gender card, and accused me of being a misogynist. The reason why that's annoying, is because this doesn't have anything to do with her being a woman; it has to do with her having been a terrible authority figure. The above episode is one of the worst examples of Janeway's abuse of authority, but I can think of close to half a dozen more. If a man behaved the way she did, I'd accuse him of command immaturity and corruption to exactly the same degree; because that is what it is. I also want to make clear here, as a final point, that this is not intended in any way, as an attack on Kate Mulgrew as an actress. I've seen her in interviews and numerous other places, and she comes across as an extremely positive, vivacious, and charming person. So this is not about the actress at all; it's purely about the character.
