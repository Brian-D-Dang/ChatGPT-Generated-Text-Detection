Scavengers If a fox finds a dead squirrel, he's not gonna sit down by the side of the road and feast right then and there. He's going to drag it back to his den so a larger scavenger (like a coyote) doesn't take it from him. And thus the bones do wind up hidden.," "Although some do hide before death, I think the main reasons are that people throw away the animal's bodies that end up in their areas (don't want to run over a dead bird) and that most animal bodies degrade over time.,carnivores like dogs can easily crush bone with their teeth; even from large animals like pigs','The bones are taken away by small critters...often to their underground dens or scattered where they are never seen again. Any place with trees will bury the scatteredleft over bones in tree litter that then turns to dirt...effectively burying them. So that means they are all buried one way or the other very quickly.','Former seismic surveyor here. While working I would encounter animal bones and decomposing bodies on a regular basis. Usually in unpopulated areas.', "There's a whole bunch of other critters out there who live off of dead things. Add in weather and you would be amazed how quickly remains can disappear.
