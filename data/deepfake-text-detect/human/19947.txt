EDIT: My V has been C'd. Continue posting points if you'd like, any new and compelling ones will be responded too. So far, the major points have been: Children cannot give consent. (usubnaree, u-GiftHorse-, ujerry121212, uhowbigis1gb) I'm still wavering on that one but I'm leaning towards it now. Obviously it is the most unanimous argument. The legal system prohibits it. (uhowbigis1gb) Whether or not one agrees with the legal system's approach to statutory rape would change the argument but I agree with this point A relationship between an adult and a child is not equal. (u-GiftHorse This had never occurred to me before. Thanks much! NOTE I understand this opinion may very well be offensive. Please do not downvote me. I came to have my opinion changed. NAMbLA, as a whole, simply supports the rights of those in consensual relationships between a man and a young boy. I don't understand why their sexuality should be demonized while others are lauded as being equal and fair (I'm bisexual by the way and fully support LGBT rights). Why do we imprison those who simply try to be sexually fulfilled without committing rape? Why do we have to shame pedophiles for expressing their sexuality in healthy relationships? Or are they not healthy? Why? Are they not truly consensual? I'm not sure myself.
