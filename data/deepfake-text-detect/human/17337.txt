Inspired by [this AdviceAnimals thread] . I'm at an age where a few of my peers (people I went to school with, co-workers, etc.) are single parents. Well, single mothers, mostly, I guess. Either they're divorced, or they had a child out of wedlock and the other parent didn't stick around. They're otherwise good people, and I'm sure they're good parents as well. But I usually find out about this part of their lives when they say something to the effect of...that the other parent wasn't ready to be a parent, or was abusive, or abandoned them, or was a bad person in some way. At that point, I find myself almost reflexively thinking less of the single parent. I guess I feel like they made a bad decision to have a child with this other person, and having a child is a really important decision. These are people who I interact with in my day-to-day life, and I don't want to be a jerk by looking down on them. Some notes on where I'm coming from, to narrow things down: I think my problem isn't with splitting up with a bad SO, it's with choosing to have a kid with a bad co-parent in the first place (or being unable to see that they wouldn't be a good co-parent). I don't think my view is based on religious beliefs. I don't have any problem with a modern, empowered woman choosing from the outset to be single parent, using a sperm donor or whatever, if she has the resources and maturity to handle that. I know that in some cases there were unavoidable circumstances, like if the other parent died or something. In the abstract, I don't support politics or public policy which treats single parents harshly. For this post, I'm more interested in single parents whom I know personally. Fellow Redditors, I want to change my view. Help me do it.
