Our group decided to go to Surrender since we were able to get on the guest list. We came here just before they closed the guest list, so we were able to get in without having to pay much. You would think on a Saturday night this club would be poppin but I guess not. There wasn't much people there and the DJ was just really bad that night. First time here and probably going to be the last. The dance floor was super small, and the DJ was bad. Drinks were the usual price of 10-15 dollars each. There is only one restroom on the outside as well. Nothing seemed to impress me here.
