Here's the thing, I need an heir to the throne but my damn wife can't pop out a son for the life of her. Women right? Well I want to get rid of her so I can marry a woman that will actually be able to give me a son but the damn Pope won't let me. Something about the "sanctity of marriage" and "devotion to God." I'm thinking it's more trouble being a Catholic than it's worth. If I don't have a son by the time I die then my line dies and there will probably be a huge fight over the throne. Who will remember me then? I think if my wife can't give me a son I should be able to find a woman who can. Am I wrong? Hello, people of the past. This is a footnote from the moderators of this 'internet forum'. I'm afraid to say that some wannabe scientist, while looking into time travel, has caused a temporal distortion field. It should dissipate in the next 24 hours. In the mean time, feel free to [message us] about a view you hold while you're visiting the present, and remember to have a look through [our rules] .
