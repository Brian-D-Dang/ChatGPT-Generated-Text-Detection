Mainly people who are connected to the distribution of the product such as the people who press the CD's, people who work at the recording studio. Movies are usually leaked by people who see the early screeners.," "A fairly large number of people have access to albums. If they're being distributed physically, then everyone from the mastering engineer and his staff to the CD and record pressing plant staff, warehouse workers, etc have access. These people aren't supposed to be making copies and leaking them on the internet, but sometimes they do. This is all assuming of course that the band didn't leak it intentionally for publicity purposes, which I understand has happened a couple times.
