Probably not very far. It depends on a property of all insulators (which water is) called the breakdown voltage, which is the voltage at which an insulator stops being an insulator and starts being a conductor. The breakdown voltage of water is very dependent on the purity of the water (and thus difficult to calculate) - the most pure water can have an extremely high resistance, somewhere on the order of 20 megohms, which gives a correspondingly high breakdown voltage. The breakdown voltage of distilled water is somewhere around 60 megavolts per meter. Of course lake water is going to be lower than this, and ocean water is a pretty good conductor.','This is a very real problem at marinas. Shore power cord gets kicked in the water. If you have to get in the water check first by sticking your hand in. People have died from jumping in the water close to the cord and losing control of their bodies and sinking to the bottom, could not even yell for help.','Given that seawater has a resistivity of 0.2 Om, and a standard US 120V outlet, a standard 15 amp household fuse, and Ohm's Law (Voltage CurrentResistance)... You're looking at 40 meters. Note, this assumes a narrow "rod" of water 40m long in the actual sea the current would spread in all directions and the apparent distance would drop.
