I believe that the United States is to heavily dependent on fossil fuel technologies (Coal, Oil, and Gas) It is a heavy burden to our economy and environment to subsidize fossil-fuel companies. By removing the subsidies given to fossil-fuel companies and re-distributing that money, we would create more revenue for the economy and create more incentives and jobs to focus on renewable energy and alternative sources. Current subsidies range up to 52 billion in just the production and finding fossil fuels. According to the National Research Council when evaluating air pollution and health impacts, It adds a staggering estimate of 120 billion that's collected from subsidies,loans, and grants. Removing these subsidies will balance the power that Major Oil and Coal mining companies have. There are tons of benefits to doing this which include Cleaner Energy More Incentives to research cleaner energy More Money for the government Less chances of exploitation by companies seeking these subsidies and cuts. We need to phase out of fossil fuel production and consumption, and in order to do that, we need to stop subsidizing the production of fossil fuels. Hello, users of CMV!
