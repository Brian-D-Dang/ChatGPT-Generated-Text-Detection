21 feature films from Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli will be added to Netflix's library for all regions outside the US, Canada, and Japan starting next month. WarnerMedia obtained the US streaming rights for its upcoming launch of HBO Max. The movies will be subtitled in 28 languages and Netflix will be providing new dubs for up to 20 languages. The release will be staggered over the next few months. It will not include Grave of the Fireflies since Studio Ghibli doesn't hold the publishing rights for the movie.
