I thought that Viva Elvis was the worst Cirque show I'd ever see until I saw this confusing, convoluted mishmash of boring drivel. Honestly, I'm CANADIAN and I love Cirque du Soleil. I've been watching them perform beautifully for over a decade. What was this? I still don't know what hit me, but I do know that I regret purchasing 4 tickets to this abomination posing as entertainment. Case and point, my guest of honor fell asleep next to me and I didn't have the heart to wake him up. I get that the staging and the feats are difficult and impressive, but they were monotonous and boring to watch. It's amazing how we all see different things though - I respect that other people loved the show. But in my opinion, there are 100 better things to see in Vegas.
