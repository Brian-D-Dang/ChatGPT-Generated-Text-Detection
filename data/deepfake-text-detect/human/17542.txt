I believe that in general, the right to free speech is the cornerstone for any just society. Freedom of speech is what guarantees us pretty much every other right that we have. Limitations on free speech to fit society's standards, such as censorship, are a slippery slope and should not exist. Speech that may seem unfit for public consumption is often the type that is needed the most for cultural development. Think about pre-Civil war United States or the Civil Rights movement. What seemed shocking or offensive in those days is now the social norm. Had that type of speech been limited, who knows where our society would be currently? Hello, users of CMV!
