I'm an EMT in training, was at a clinical speaking with a classmate of mine today and the topic popped up. Homeless people come to the ER all the time dirty as hell. Why don't we provide shower facilities for the homeless? I don't think they would be incredibly hard to put up and maintain. Measures could be taken to ensure the safety of individuals, say having a security guard to check them in. I think it would be a great service to many homeless people and society in general. Cleaner people happier people, both for the homeless, and those with homes.
