"Look, Terrance, I'm glad you can speak with me now and all. Good for you. But is there any way, I don't know, you could maybe find another stone that could get you to shut the hell up?" Mr. Sprinkles looked up at me, his tongue sticking out of his mouth. "Seriously. What the heck is it with all the baby talk? I'm ten human years old, I've got one..... maybe two years left in the tank, and you can't show me any dignity? You even have them give me a goddamn fluffy haircut and these little costumes. Why does a dog need a costume? We have fur. You and Karen should really look into getting a human baby, this kind of thing is unhealthy, man." "Sprink, I don't know that I appreciate that tone." "If you wanted a loyal goober, you really should've gone Labrador, Terrance. Seriously. At least those guys got to stay normal dog size. You and your kind created us abominations. I mean seriously, have you ever seen a paw this small?" He lifted a small white paw, slowly placing it back on the ground. "My ancestors were goddamn snow wolves. I'm telling you, being a Pomeranian is the worst." "Geez, Sprink, if I had known..." "THE NAME. That's another thing. Mr. Sprinkles? Seriously. Why not something simple and benign like'Glen' or'William'? It's one thing that you took my balls away, which I haven't forgiven you for by the way, but you then had to spit on me with a name like Mr. Sprinkles?!" I paused, taking a moment to come to terms with the fact I was getting a verbal beatdown from my dog. "Let's just make it clear now. Nice and easy. Now you can talk to animals, again, good for you. There's a pug down the street who's got some strong feelings about trees you might vibe with. But so long as your home, lets stick to sharing some meals together, I might use your lap for warmth here and there, and make sure you get a chew toy or two here and there and cut the chatter. Feel me?"
