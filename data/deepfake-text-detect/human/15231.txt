Crab cakes outshined the steaks, but not to take away from the steaks because they were very good. We came in with a large part of 13 or so and they sat us in our own sectioned off room which oddly had some TV's in the corners. The service was excellent, we had a few issues with overcooked fish and a tuna tare tare coming out instead of a steak one we requested. This is a fine steakhouse with great service which is well worth the short drive off the strip to come to. They did a great job with such a large group of rowdy guys.
