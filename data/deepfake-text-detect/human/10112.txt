So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But I think that if we were to put a place a law mandating employers to give paid maternity leave, it would result in unfair hiring biases against women. Some employers would develop a preference for hiring men over women because, if you are purely concerned with profit as lots of employers are, why take the risk of hiring a lady who might take a lot of time from work while you can just not risk it and hire a man? There are already a lot of stereotypes about women being less dedicated to their jobs than men because they are "more focused on kids." Wouldn't a mandatory maternity leave just make this worse? It's particularly unfair to women who aren't planning on having kids because employers could be biased against them for expecting them to use something they won't ever even need in the first place! If paternity leave were also mandated, then this would be less of a problem because men would be as likely (or nearly as likely) to take leave as well, making the "expected value" of a man's labor to an employer the same as a woman's, and hopefully eliminating the bias.
