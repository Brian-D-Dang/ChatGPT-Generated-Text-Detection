IMO, whenever they're used it's mostly just confusing especially to younger readers. Why say "preposterous" when you can just say crazy or insane and have it make sense to more people? Do you need to sound smart with fancy language? Of course there are some exceptions for things that can't be described any other way, like names of diseases and other "domain-specific" words. A lot of times, teachers will encourage writing with fancy words for elaboration, and not just in persuasive or story-telling writings. Why would you try to explain something to as many people as possible, but use words that would exclude some of your readers? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from Obama.
