Woven Planet Holdings, a subsidiary of Toyota, is buying Lyft's self-driving division for 550 million in cash paid over five years. Lyft will see an annual savings of 100 million a year, putting it in a better position to earn a profit. Toyota will use Lyft's fleet data and platform for any commercial service it might launch under Woven Planet. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter this year.
