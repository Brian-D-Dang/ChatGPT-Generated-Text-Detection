First of all, I don't claim that money and prices completely useless in acquiring information. In fact, they are pretty damn good at it, if you know how to look at it. Let's imagine a matter replicator is invented, paired with nuclear fusion (so plenty of energy is available in the grid). Let's omit that it can replicate other things and focus on food for the sake of the argument. We have technically solved world hunger, and in the process, ruined many stores and producers, who can't afford the energy to power a replicator at all. To them, the replicator is a net loss. Expand the capabilities of the replicator as much as you want to ruin other sectors. Now that I've presented a hypothetical exaggeration, let's go for a real life example: piracy. I see piracy as a legitimate (even where illegal) call of attention to distributors and method to acquire media. It's a call of attention to say "hey, stop selling me those DVDs full of copy restriction, I want my media wherever I want, whenever I want (i.e.: downloadable online and with non-obstructive DRM, if at all) ." There's also the problem that we simply don't have jobs for everyone, at least if most people have to work at the very least 40 hours. And in fact, jobs have been made up [just to make people stay busy] . The problem is not that people are "unwilling to work," or "the minimum wage prevents employment" (employed poverty is a thing in Germany). Even if you think there's no better fundamental economic system (i.e.: agree on reforms, but not radical changes), deciding upon the expected variations of those as the main factor is a terrible idea.
