Needing to find a new job now and there are wayyy too many people that have been fired for little to no reason. People are losing their jobs consistently because maybe they have a particular opinion that is different from an employers' opinion, or someone doesn't like their personality. The employer can simply fire them and claim it's for some other basis because "at will" employment allows them to terminate employment whenever they see fit. Not only are they allowed to terminate individuals for no reason, but I feel that "at will" employment only encourages corrupt employers to try and find ways to get rid of those they don't like, because they know that they can. And lastly it's really discouraging to individuals knowing that at any point, in any job, if you say, do, suggest, make, etc the wrong thing then you could be fired. This prevents company growth, job growth, and also pretty much takes away job security. CMV reddit! Edit 1: I'm getting a lot of responses about the benefits of at will employment that don't actually happen. Issues that seem like they would happen on paper, however, if you look at other countries without at will employment those issues are nonexistent. Countries that do not have at will employment do not have problems like spending too much money hiring people, not being able to fire those that aren't doing their job correctly, finding people to work for them or even low unemployment rates.
