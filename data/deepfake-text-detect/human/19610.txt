I was reading an article on conscientious objectors in the IDF during the 1982 Lebanon War for a class on the Arab-Israeli conflict, and in it they interviewed Israeli veterans of the '48 War, Six-Day War, and Yom Kippur War, all of whom felt that the increasing individualism in Israeli society is detrimental to the State's very existence as the homeland of the Jewish people. Since then I've come to disagree with what America stands for: a society that ironically promotes individualism to further itself. From what I've observed, obtain a large enough group of people and eventually they'll start demanding greater freedoms (example: the movement to legalize same-sex marriage). I feel this kind of mentality of me, myself, and I and "Such-and-such is a human right!" is the greatest threat to the integrity and survival of any given society. Anyway, change my view.
