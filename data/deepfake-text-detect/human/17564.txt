In Michigan we have 10 returns for every plastic and metal carbonated beverage container. You pay this extra money for each can when you buy them so if you don't return them you loose money. It acts as an incentive to recycle because you feel like you are getting money back. Michigan ha s the highest recycling rate for pop cans out of all the 50 States. From had a 97 return rate. If this same process would be used for the billions of water bottles used each year it could greatly reduce our environmental impact. From 29 billion bottles per year globally to 870 million. CMV
