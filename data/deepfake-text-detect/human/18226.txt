Wages are the amount of money you take home every pay period. Total compensation is wages the monetary value of all benefits (health care, retirement, sick leave, ect.) To an employer, all that matters to them is your total cost to the company, which is your total compensation. In every western country, with the exception of the US, paid maternity leave is required by businesses. Even in the US, many businesses give maternity leave anyway due to free market competition for workers. Since maternity leave is something only given to women, this is the only benefit that one gender receives but the other does not. Therefore, if men and women make equal wages, women would have a higher total compensation than men. I thereby deduce that, in terms of equality, women's wages (or other benefits), should be reduced by the monetary value of maternity leave.
