If young people voted in similar numbers to old people, things would be very different. The only place I've EVER seen young people discuss politics is online. Not just that, they know WAY MORE than the people I interact with that LOVE to talk politicsfollow the newsetc. It goes MUCH deeper than this, however. The internet's 24-hr "New" cycle that rewards the "zingiest" responses, instead of the most well-thought out ones. In the rare instance that the good responses float to the top, it's quickly forgotten when someone asks the same thing the next day, and the person who cared enough to legitimately respond is gone. Someone is always waiting in the wings to score "big points" by parroting the same tired-old "nothing's gonna change" line or something close to it. The combination of joking and cynicism leads to a climate where no one gives a damn, and those that DO are openly ridiculed.
