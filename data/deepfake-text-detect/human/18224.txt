I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info: ) Now, while I agree that pay gaps are a problem in general some fields, sports is a different ballgame (no pun intended). As such, the success of a franchise is dependent on the supporters who pay money for tickets, gear, etc. If we were to look at attendance figures for the National Woman's Soccer League (NWSL) for 2014 compared to Major League Soccer (MLS), we see a huge disparity in people attending games. Of course, this translates over to other leagues. The NBA draws more people than the WNBA, both live and TV ratings. The revenue of the NFL is exponentially greater than the Independent Woman's Football League. I'm not here to provide solutions to this, or look into why the mentality of America draws more into guy sports. Yes, I think that ladies should be paid equally. I also think ladies have the ability to play all sports as good as men do, if not better. And of course, ladies have as much of a right to play in any sport and play it professionally. But (and yes here comes a South Park reference) ..."you can't expect people to watch." My conclusion: the pay gap in sports is a consequence of economic revenue, rather than social injustice. Open to any replies and criticism. EDIT: This is awesome and I thank you all for your input. You all taught me that there is a physical difference in athleticism between men and women. And that the pay gap is exaggerated.
