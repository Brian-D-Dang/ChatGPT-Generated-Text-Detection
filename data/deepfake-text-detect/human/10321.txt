I'm very confused and bothered by the amount of ads for prescription medications that run on television and in magazines. In my mind, the reason that these medications can only be used when prescribed by a doctor, is because they are volatile substances, and only medical expert is qualified to determine which patients really need them. I can't imagine what good these ads do. If someone is sick, she should go to her doctor, who will decide what medications will best treat her, if any. Prescription dug ads simply cause patients to think they need a drug they perhaps do not, and it puts doctors in a difficult position when their patients request a specific drug that the doctor doesn't feel they need. So, in light of this, why are advertisements for prescriptions medications allowed?
