I find it ridiculous one must be 18 to simply buy a scratch ticket. For one, buying a scratch ticket will not directly cause one physical harm. I can see how something, such as cigarettes are illegal for minors, since they make the smoker a massive candidate for cancer, but I don't see the same thing happening for scratch tickets or bingo. Also, many argue that since gambling is addictive, only adults should be able to gamble. While I agree that gambling is addictive, not everybody who gambling becomes an addict. It would also be better to desensitize teens to gamble by giving them this right when they do not have to worry about bills, college tuition, etc. Hello, users of CMV!
