Having an educated citizenship is important, so we have public schools. Having a healthy citizenship is also important, so we should have public healthcare. What public healthcare should be is a topic for another day; right now, I'm just arguing that it's comparable to public education and so should be accepted similarly. Public education gives us a competent voter base, competitive workforce, and aids economic mobility. Public heathcare is important for most of the same reasons. Public healthcare doesn't have a direct connection to the voting booth, like education, but it does have direct connections to the economy, with healthy people being more able to work, with people not needing employer subsidized insurance being more able to start new businesses, and people paying less for healthcare having more money to spend on other things.
