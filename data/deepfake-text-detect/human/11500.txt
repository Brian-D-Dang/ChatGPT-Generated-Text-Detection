Physicists from the University of Iowa have discovered a new type of aurora in a nearly two-decade-old video. Diffuse auroral erasers are a part of the background-like glow of auroras that sometimes go dark and suddenly reappear. It is unknown whether they are rare, as they have just been noticed and scientists haven't started looking for them yet. A 20-second video showing diffuse auroral erasers is available in the article.
