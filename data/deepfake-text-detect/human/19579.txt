I don't understand how you can encourage a C, or even B average student with an average sat score that he should go to college. Why do we as a country shove this idea down our childrens throats that they must go to college? Most college graduates end up working a job they could of done out of highschool, with toms of debt. Going to a trade school is actually more profitable for most people. I believe college should be reserved for people who do exceptionally well in school, and score high on standerdized tests. It's disheartening to me to see someone who doesnt excel in school be told by school teachers and counselors that going to college would be best for them. Some people are meant to work with there hands, an electrician, plumber, or mechanic. Its a comfortable living, and you have no debt from college. Cmv
