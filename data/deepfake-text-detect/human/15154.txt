Frankly, I am astounded this place has gotten the reviews it has. I guess, overall, its not an entirely hateful place. I was able to get in immediately with a ladies VIP pass despite there being a huge crowd outside, and the music wasn't totally ridiculous. I had a couple of drinks that were reasonably mixed and weren't too overpriced. Um......... I think that's about it for the good things On to the bad things - this place is freakin small man. like ridiculous for a place calling itself a nightclub. maybe it was the night I was there, about a week after their grand opening and on a Sunday, but it was so packed I don't think I even got on the actual dance floor till after 1am. there was a stupid amount of females in there compared to males. like other people have mentioned, the dress code was totally random. I saw a lady, not a girl, a grown ass lady in there with some dirty aerobic walking shoes like she had been to every point on the strip that day. craziness. the bathroom is outside of the club, so not only did I put off going until the very last moment, but once I got there I had to force myself to go back into the club - the damn casino, with its free drinks, was right there calling. and finally, maybe it's just me, but I never located this alleged patio outside area. and no I don't drink that much, its just extremely dark in there and they had one security guy in particular I didn't feel like going near. maybe that was the door outside, who knows. anyway, this would be a good place to start off a night, provided you were already in TI. I guess if you had bottle service this joint wouldn't be so bad, those areas looked pretty decent and are not like right on top of the dance floor so you can enjoy yourselves. I personally wouldn't make a special trip here though, even for free admission.
