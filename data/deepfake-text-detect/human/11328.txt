Solid is a new decentralized internet designed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the original internet. As far as I can tell (I am very dumb, so please take a look for yourself if you're interested), the goal here is to create a new set of internet protocols that allows users to remain in control of their own data. For example, if you had a note taking app today that needed to sync data across multiple devices, a service like Google Docs or Evernote or whatever would run a central server in the cloud, and all of your devices would request data from and send data to the central cloud server when you wanted to take notes. In this new internet, you would run your own Solid POD (basically just a server I think?) and Solid would define a set of protocols for you to grant readwrite access to your Solid POD to all of these third party applications. Thus, if you wanted to write a Google DocsEvernote for this new internet, you would essentially only write front end code that interacted with each individual's Solid POD as a backend (instead of having your backend servers) through the Solid POD APIs. Solid PODs can also be used for authentication, and you can have multiple PODs to prevent data loss.
