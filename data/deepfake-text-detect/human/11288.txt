Google Cloud has made its first major acquisition under its new CEO, Thomas Kurian. Kurian, a former executive at Oracle, joined Google in November and had announced plans to expand the business significantly. In a move to gain market share from Amazon Web Services, Google has purchased Looker, a data analytics platform, for 2.6 billion in cash. The purchase of Looker will add new analytics tools for Google Cloud customers. Looker will continue to work with other products, such as Amazon Web Services' Redshift and Microsoft's Azure SQL Server. Google has recently announced its Anthos product, which allows businesses to run computing workloads on multiple clouds.
