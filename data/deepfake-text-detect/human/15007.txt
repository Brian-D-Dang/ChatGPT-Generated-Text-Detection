I moved here from NY about three years ago and could not find a decent slice of pizza to save my life...until....I found Nicks! OMG! The best tasting and closest I can find to what I've been used to. I ordered a pie to go and as soon as I got the box in the car, I dove in and ate a slice on the drive home. Delicious! When I got to the pizzeria, my order wasn't ready right away and I had such a nice conversation with the man working behind the counter (wasn't sure if it was the Nick). He apologized for making me wait (I honestly think I was early) and he was very friendly. The area to sit and eat-in in really teeny-tiny - maybe 5 4-seat tables so that could be a problem during the lunch rush. I will most definately be back. YUMMO!!!
