Having grown up in the States, and living abroad in Asia for a couple years, I have noticed that America has far too many liability laws that remove responsibility from the consumer, and instead hold the provider responsible. I appreciate the fact that liability has it's advantages, and when something goes wrong that shouldn't have (i.e. your parachute doesn't deploy, or the toy you bought is broken), you are covered and reimbursed (if possible). On the other hand, it has a reached a point where people don't assume liability for their own decisions. If you choose to engage in a sport such as Scuba Diving, Parachuting, or even Mountain HikingClimbing, I believe you make a decision as a human being to engage in this activity. All the liability laws are OVER-protective and don't force people to think about or take responsibility for their own actions. It creates a mindset, "Well, if it isn't against the law, and they are liable, what could go wrong?." I think this is detrimental to society, and creating a society that aids the spread of stupid decision making. Change my view.
