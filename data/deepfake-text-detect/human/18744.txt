I think this because while I've been abroad I've known people to apply for US visas. The process is very difficult for citizens of countries that require a US visa (not the UK, etc.). It requires a lot of paperwork and even a required in-person interview at a consulate just to get a freakin' tourist visa. I definitely have my share of tourist visas in my passport, and I couldn't imagine jumping though the hoops my country requires for a visa. I haven't heard of any other country that requires an interview for most tourist visa applications. I have heard that Israel can be pretty strict going in, but I've entered Israel 3 times without being stopped for an interview (leaving, however, was strangely a problem). I want to make the argument to my dad (who works in US politics) that the US visa system is insane compared to most countries, but I want to vet my perspective before I give it to him. So, CMV! Thanks! EDIT 1: I would really like to know if there are other countries besides Russia and the US that require an interview for tourist visas.
