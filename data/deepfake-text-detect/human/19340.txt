The feminists I have met want equality for everyone. The word for that is 'egalitarian', and that term also benefits because it loses the whole stigma around radical feminists (though few really exist - ideas of radfems seem to be perpetuated by people misunderstanding regular feminists). I feel the word 'feminism' implies tackling equality issues that adversely affect women - and this has some historical truth, but modern feminists take pains to distance themselves from this. Women in the past had to fight against severe, one-sided inequalities. Gender inequalities today are more complex than 40 years ago, and require improvements for both men and women. Feminism has evolved, to become synonymous with 'egalitarianism', and I feel this also cheapens the battles fought earlier in history as the word is diluted. I am concerned that the word 'feminism' alienates people who would otherwise be supportive of egalitarian principles, if only they understood that's what feminism is supposed to mean nowadays. The historic baggage is heavy, and the name is tarnished by supposed radical feminists. I do not believe feminism in the Western world is a cause unique enough to justify its continued existence alongside the egalitarian movement. CMV.
