We sat on the patio for dinner, the view is the main reason this place gets two stars. There is a gorgeous view of the strip. This is mainly a review of the food. I had a burger, it was ok. It was a burger, like one I could have gotten from in n out for 14 the price. I cant even remember what my friend got, I even tried it, but I cant remember for the life of me what it was. We split a Nutella crepe for dessert- pass. The crepe was soggy. The waitress lost my credit card and did not tell me, she had the hostess distracting me while she looked around our table for the card. This went on for about 10 minutes before I pointed it out on the floor. I would never go back to this place, there are 100s of amazing restaurants in Vegas, dont settle.
