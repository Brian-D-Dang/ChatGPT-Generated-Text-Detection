I hold this view for most multi level marketing corporations, but for this CMV I will stick with using Amway as an example. I hold this view because of anecdotal evidence from people I know who have been offered "jobs" there, and from research I have done. Basically, I hold this view because while they do actually make products, I have found no evidence of any end consumer for them, or any attempts to distribute the products to an end consumer, on any level of their multi level marketing. The distributors are required to buy a certain amount of the product in order to keep their bonuses. And the only real way to make money is to recruit distributors under you to buy the products. Doing this gets you higher bonuses. Directly selling the products earns practically nothing compared with recruiting. Side note. I really appreciate this subreddit. It's one of my favorites
