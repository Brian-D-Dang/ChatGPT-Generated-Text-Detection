I believe ambulances should have forward facing cameras that are fed into a system that identifies motorists who forced an ambulance to slow down, and fine them. As I was commuting today I witnessed 3 separate instances where a driver had significant amount of time to pull over and let an ambulance pass at full speed. Instead each time the driver chose to wait until the ambulance was directly behind them to pull over. To pull over they had to slow down, which forced the ambulance operator to slow down. Had they reacted when there was enough distance for them to safely slow down and pull over, instead of waiting until the ambulance was right on top of them, the ambulance could have proceeded at full speed. One instance the ambulance even had a police escort, which was following a car for at least quarter mile at very close proximity, WITH HIS LIGHTS AND SIREN ON. The motorist still did not pull over, slowing both the police escort and ambulance down. They were going in the direction on a long straight stretch, and I could see the car, the cop, and the ambulance all right on top of each other as the motorist entered a part of the highway where they could not even pull over. Even after going past a stretch of at least a quarter mile where it was safe to do so. This inattention, or inconsideration, or whatever it is, for the person in the ambulance is just awful. At least, that's what I think.
