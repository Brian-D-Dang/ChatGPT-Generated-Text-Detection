I used Complete Medical Consultants for the 1st time last week. I called in the afternoon and Scott called me back within 10 minutes. We discussed my son's health and determined he needed to be seen. I received a next day appointment. The visit took 20 minutes and only cost 40!! No deductibles - No insurance forms...No waiting 2 weeks to see the Doctor. Office is very clean with prompt and helpful attention to the patient.
