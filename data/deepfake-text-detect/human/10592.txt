Very simply put, phones use solid state memory. It deletes data differently. A disk drive as is in a computer just changes the pointer. Its like telling your debt collectors that you dont live at a house anymore by changing the mailing address. Its still there but all the people mailing you would get their mail sent back to them. For solid state drives, its like destroying the mailbox with a wrecking ball, you will probably destroy some of the house in the process. More detailed is that disk drive can edit data a few bytes at a time whereas a solid state drive has to edit whole sectors of data sometimes several several kilobytes (or even megabytes) at a time. In this case changing 1 byte takes just as much time and energy as changing the whole sector, so that's usually what they do.
