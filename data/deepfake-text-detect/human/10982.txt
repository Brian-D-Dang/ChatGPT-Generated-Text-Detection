The airwaves belong to the public. We allow private businesses to use the public property if they follow certain rules and get the right license. Those rules are enforced on behalf of the public through the FCC. The idea is that the public should benefit from our property being used. I know that's not really eli5, so if I'm not being clear let me know and I'll try to be more clear.," "It's worth noting that only the airwaves are handled by the FCC. The vast majority of the shows you probably watch are censored only by the networks that produce them for the advertisers that support them, it's not a government thing.," "The airwaves are considered a public asset, so the public, meaning gov't, has the right to regulate their content. It is basically the same reason you can't run around naked in a part. Also, the first amendment guarantees the right to free speech, it does not guarantee the right to a giant electronic megaphone.
