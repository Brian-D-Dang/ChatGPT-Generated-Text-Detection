In an effort to combat preventable diseases, 23andMe will start testing customers for diabetes and other health conditions with their Health and Ancestry Service test. The test will not indicate whether a person has diabetes or whether they will definitely get it, but it will indicate whether the person is at risk of developing the disease. Even if a person carries a high risk of developing diabetes, it can be prevented or managed with a healthy lifestyle, especially if the risk is detected early. The 23andMe test results will include information and tips on how to prevent the condition and improve wellness.
