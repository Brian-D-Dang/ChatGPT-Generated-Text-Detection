I have only been here on New Year's Eve. The bar and owner are simply amazing! The energy and friendliness you will find in this bar makes you feel like you are hanging out with your best friends in their super cool basement. The drink prices are lower than what you would find in neighboring bars. If you are looking for a laid back time with great friends then check out this place. If it's not you're style you can easily walk to the many other places the Southside of Pittsburgh as to offer.
