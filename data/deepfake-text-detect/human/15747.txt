PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Once they have your credit card and deposit, they will ignore you and not return your call. I left over 10 messages and emails because they were late to pick up my car 1 week. I had to pay storage fees of over 200. Maria (the owner) answers the phone and pretends she is not Maria. Several times she did this and did not forward my messages. After calling maria with a blocked caller id, she picks up the phone and plays dumb about being late. When you confront her, she will curse and go crazy. She is the biggest liar I have dealt with and not very stable. If you want to save yourself time, the headache and stress, please use a different company.
