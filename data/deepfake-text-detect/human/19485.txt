This podcast is like a smaller version of the OJ Simpson trial, with all the same sensationalization and vitriol around it. People take sides and are quick to drag the names of real people through the mud, innocent and not. In the meantime, the fact that someone died is downplayed as a plot point, the star of the show is now the convicted murderer, the story has turned from a tragedy into a thriller. On top of that, it seems that most of the people who criticize things like the OJ trial and the media glorification of murderers, the smart, critical-thinking folks, see this entire thing as ok because TAL produces it. On paper, Sarah K and the producers deny any editorializing or yellow-journalism tactics, but all of the above has happened regardless.
