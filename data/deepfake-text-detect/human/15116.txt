Love love LOVE this bar that is in the back of a shopping center off the Freemont street promenade. It's right behind the heart attack grill. I took my MOTHER there.... haha. It's a gay bar where there's a ton of drag queens, a bowling alley, and a pretty dope dance floor. Bathrooms are very clean, and the drinks are reasonably priced. A nice change from the other gay bars in town, this bar is cool, low key, has GREAT music, and if you feel like being a tourist again, all you have to do is go down the escalator and walk around Freemont. They have a coreographed drag show every half hour on fridays. It was awesome.... but my mother made a comment that made me laugh:, I would hate to be the coreographer of that group.... you know, cuz they're all Divas. You would tell them,'left, right, hip' and one of them would say,'o no, coco does not do that'. Please go.... this place is really fantastic!
