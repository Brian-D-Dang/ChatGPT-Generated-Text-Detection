I think the majority of criminals are criminals because of circumstance or mental illness and i believe that if given the proper help and resources they can be reintegrated into society. I especially think this is true in cases of drug related crime (mainly drug possession), and i think mandatory minimum sentences do more harm then good. if it helps i live in Canada.
