I saw [this] post in rmapporn and it got me thinking. So I came to the conclusion that I believe that polygamy should be fully legalized in terms of law and also that this sort of lifestyle should be socially accepted. First of all I think that a man or a woman can be able to equally love two or more people simultaneously. I also assume that the key to a successfull marriage is loving each other. So I think that a polygamous relationship can work in the long terms. I think the government is not justified to forbid such a marriage or rather disprove of it and not make you lawfully equal. I think that according to law all members of the relationship should be seen equally to the members of a monogamous relationship. This is especially important for taxes. I feel that there is a strong animosity against such a lifestyle in western society. I think it origins in the belief that polygamy is only a thing with one man and many women like it is practiced in some religions and sects where the female part is heavily suppressed. But that is NOT the sort of relationship I am talking about. Of course some similar things could happen but there are also abusive monogamous relationships. I hope I made my point clear. If it helps you with answering I come from Germany where polygamous marriage under the law is illegal but you are allowed to live in a pollygamous relationship.
