Why would they gain by handing over data voluntarily? No one's gonna give them tax breaks for giving user data. They aren't gonna be able to "buddy-up" with congressmen by giving the NSA data. Conversely, there has been a long documented history of the FBI and NSA doing wiretaps and submitting all kinds of requests for information. Google has publicly announced their displeasure at this for at least 10 years. Finally, it's still not clear whether big tech companies knew of the scale of PRISM or that it even existed. I don't believe that they had true "backdoor" access. They were probably handed secondary encryption keys, but only through a request system.
