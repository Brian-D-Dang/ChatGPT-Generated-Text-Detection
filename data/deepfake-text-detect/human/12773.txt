It's her. That bastard tried to keep her away from me, but I know my daughter. Even though I haven't seen her in years. Thousands of dollars spent hunting her down after the police wouldn't listen, then weeks of following her around, peering into windows and hiding corners, just to make sure it's her. And now I'm sure. Of course I've seen shit that made me physically sick. The things he makes her do, and he's been forcing himself on her since he took her. It's just horrible. But I had to watch all the tapes and videos. All the cameras I planted in their apartment finally paid off. I saw the scar on her inner thigh from when she fell when I was teaching her how to ride a two wheeler. I keep telling myself that it's almost over. No more hiding and creeping around. Tonight when they get home, I'll be waiting for them. And then it ends.
