Zoox recently published a video showing its autonomous system driving for an hour in downtown San Francisco. The video is available in the article. A safety driver was behind the wheel of the retrofitted Toyota Highlander. The video shows the car performing a range of complex maneuvers in heavy, multi-lane vehicle traffic and dense pedestrian crowds. Zoox's perception system can distinguish traffic lights, trams, construction vehicles, lane dividers, and more. It also tracks pedestrian attributes such as whether they are looking at a phone. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Zoox appeared to be making progress towards a commercial launch, but live tests of its level 3 vehicles have been canceled. Zoox has plans to deploy autonomous Highlanders in Las Vegas to transport passengers autonomously.
