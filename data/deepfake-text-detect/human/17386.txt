[Sherman's interview for context.] Many people are up in arms and borderline disgusted that a player would act this way. I honestly don't see why it is a big deal. These people are paid to destroy each other on the field. Every other player gives the same boring interview after every game thanking coaches, god, players, etc. I find it way more entertaining that some guy stepped out of the norm. I personally believe that if you were offended by what he did, you take the NFL too seriously.
