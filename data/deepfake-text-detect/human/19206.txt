Some art has a deeper meaning than others, than transcends art and actually is part of our culture. Music about "going to the clubs and having sex" is shallow and doesn't relate to anything deeper than the "art" itself. Some music takes more talent to make, lyricism is better, etc etc. The White Stripes are better than Justin Bieber, it takes more objective skill and innovation to make music like the White Stripes did, Bieber hasn't impacted the music industry at all, at least not for the better. Without vocal effects, Bieber has been proven not to be able to reach the same notes as the white stripes have. I'm not saying someone can't like Bieber more, I'm saying that The White Stripes are undisputedly better. And that's just one example. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
