There are tons of examples, so here are a few: 1. We're showing courtroom drawings on HDTVs in news shows. 2. Underage human beings can be arrested for child pornography for possessing photos of themselves. 3. You can be arrested for posting sarcastic comments on Facebook. 4. A co-founder of reddit and many other people have been singled out for filesharing, and face charges that are outrageous because they don't in any way match the crime. 5. The NSA is allowed to 'access' private companies databases and collect from servers in the world into a database they supposedly can't 'access' without a warrant meaning it should be legal, but how can the legal definition for the word access be different for those two cases? 6. We have no consumer protection laws regarding owning our data that is on cloud services, which then gets collected anonymously and sold as statistics and other consumer information packages without our consent if we sign EULAs, as though that is in any way a consumer protection. And unrelated to the view, but related to the culture: Twitter and Facebook are used more than Wikipedia. People want to waste time using these incredible pieces of technology, rather than learn something. I want to think there's a reasonable justification for all of this other than that reform is slow to catch up to the times or culture is slow to catch up to recognizing accurate definitions and context of the times, or some combination of this, so please CMV.
