I think that they are not designed to find the best applicant for the job, rather they are designed to find the most docile persons so that they can be exploited harder without any resistance. Consistent questions asking about if you feel that "Rules are meant to be broken" and so forth are not there to see if you are able to reason, rather to see if you are a candidate for total subordination. This means that people that are best suited for the job are less likely to have a chance at that job, and it only encourages people to lie to get a job. Also they are simply intrusive into the personal live of the applicant, which is where they go from simply despicable to needing to be regulated. They ask personal questions that will be kept on file regardless if the company will hire the applicant and could be used against that person in a later time possibly. The right to privacy to the individual is needed to be protected at this point. I also think the argument of " well simply don't apply to those places" is false. The large corporations that have implemented these programs have also used there lobbyist to create laws that have given them massive advantages. Those few company's control so many jobs that large populations areas are many times left with those jobs being the only ones available. So it is in fact cohesion, and they have all acted as a trust to implement such things and insure there is no job competition that would not be doing the same.
