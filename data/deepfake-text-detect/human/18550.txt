My context for this issue is the fact that in Film Theory, people like Sergei Eisenstein would come up with a theory of montage; an image of an eye, then cutaway to a waterfall conveys tears. Or even in Jungian psychology. In his book "The Undiscovered Self" he says that you must throw away scientific fact to know about the individual, because the individual is a byproduct of irregularities, and the 'ideal average' human will never exist. While all that sounds very interesting, and probably could be true, it hasn't been proven in the sense that the theorem of logarithms has been proven. The existence of the "Higgs" Boson has been proven. I don't have any questions on a philosophical or metaphysical level; if you think about it purely abstract, of course we can even make an argument for the fact that science and maths is as unproven as Jungian theories or Film theories. I guess the underlying question behind all this is will the age of hyper rationalism lead us to a better society, or is there room for unproven or extremely difficultnear impossible to prove theories such as those of Jung or Freud or Eisenstein? Is one harmful, is the other not? I think allowing these unproven theories to go unproven is harmful; we should find a way to test them or let them be, as a society. CMV please. Hello, users of CMV!
