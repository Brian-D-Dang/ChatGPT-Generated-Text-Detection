Currently, as I understand it, any income from any sort of investment is taxed at the capital gains tax rate, which is roughly equivalent to the tax rate of those making minimum wage. This applies to all sorts of things, from dividends, to selling property at greater value, to stock sales. The theory behind stock sales being included in this is that we want to encourage the rich to invest in the economy, pumping money in so that those who are not so wealthy have the ability to climb their way up. The problem is that it introduces instability into the market. It makes short term gains, which drive up stock prices at the cost of long term viability (see: mortgage crisis, Enron), more appealing than the steady, long term growth that is good for the economy as a whole (or even steady, profitable non-growth). To remedy this problem, I think it'd be worthwhile to tax stock sales at the regular income rate. That way those with money to invest would have more incentive to invest for the long haul, rather than just for today in a "I got mine, damn the rest of you" sort of fashion. I'd put in an exception for retirement funds, etc, up to a certain amount, with the standard penalties if you withdraw early, that sort of thing, but other than that, any stock sales would be taxed as though it were part of your normal income. ...but I'm quite certain that this idea, and the results and effects of it, are too complex for me to understand with just my own processing, so I come to you rational folks. I believe that taxing (most) stock sales as regular income would have a beneficial, stabilizing effect on the economy, CMV.
