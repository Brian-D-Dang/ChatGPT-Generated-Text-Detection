The way I see it, the bookstore is around for convenience. If I really need some course material quickly, I can buy it from the bookstore. Otherwise, I'll buy it from where I can get it cheapest. My campus bookstore want students to buy from their store instead of Amazon or half.com, and they have ads up imploring students to "buy locally" and "support the school" by buying textbooks from them, even though they cost 2-3x what you can get online. Unlike some other campus bookstores, they don't price match. Honestly, I see no reason to buy from them when I don't need to. The bookstore is not a charity. They are a business with an agreement with the university to have cheap rent over a space on campus. They don't care enough about students to implement a discount or price matching scheme. They don't negotiate with publishers and just straight up sell the books for MSRP. So I don't see any reason why I should sympathize with the bookstore to a level that I should buy a textbook from them for double cost; the bookstore is not my friend. Also, their profits are not redistributed to educate me, but instead the money just goes into paying for the student union. Again, I don't see how that justifies paying so much more for a textbook. The way I see it, their practices mean that they deserve the market niche that they belong in, like every other business. They are not my primary source of textbooks, and never will be unless you can CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
