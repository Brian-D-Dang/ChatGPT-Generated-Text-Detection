Whenever the need for lawyers come up, the complicated legal system comes up as a reference. How would you as a non-professional know all the laws that pertain to your situation? Well, why are there so many laws that a jury of your peers can't use common sense to judge you? I'd like if the conversation goes beyond "peers can only judge trivial laws like obvious revenge murder." Why is a system of thousands of laws concerning [the size of fish] and movie copyright better, when only a small lucrative class of lawyers can be the true judges? How can anyone follow tens of thousands of laws? What is the point of lawyers?
