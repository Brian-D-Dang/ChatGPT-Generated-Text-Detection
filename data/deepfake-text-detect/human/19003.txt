I am very much for absolute equality [and as a straight guy, have never felt any sort of discomfort or hatred towards LGBTs{even when I was religious}, or for that matter, towards any nationality, religion, ethic group etc] so I don't think my distrust towards feminists roots from the typical ingroup-outgroup psyche. I think a big part of my distrust roots from the Scepchicks and their severe overreactions like the one that got a couple journalists fired for a private joke at a conference. I am all for equal treatment and opportunities for women and unlike many gamers, also understand and accept that there is a rather alarming sexist streaking in the gaming industry. But I feel that radical feminists dont want equal treatment, they want to be treated better than men. Of course, I may be right but I doubt that. Ignorance breeds hatred and as far as radical feminism is concerned, all I know about it is that its a bunch of women who [allegedly] want equal rights for women but are somehow 'radical' about it. Perhaps someone can explain the difference between the two [femradfem]? Edit - I know this is a stupid view. Which is why I wish to change it. And yes, I know I am quite very ignorant on this issue. Again, its something I want to change and want help changing.
