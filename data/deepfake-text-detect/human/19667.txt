To quote Obama: "I think it's important to recognize that you can't have 100 security and also then have 100 privacy and zero inconvenience." I believe the type of security promised here is a fallacy. You'll always have "terrorists" conspiring against the state, but unless your goal is to monitor every single communication between two individuals (a la 1984), the conspirators will always be one step ahead, find ways around surveillance, and likely just become even more enraged by the oppressive lifestyle they're being forced to operate under. As Orwell puts it: "The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness." We're currently somewhere in the middle, where the government promises happiness, at the expense of some freedom, by spending billions on NSA projects which give the capability to monitor as much digital communication as possible. I think this effort is in vain, and a massive waste of taxpayer money - the only way it could be effective is if it were enacted as totally as in the dystopian future described in 1984 (where avoiding surveillance is much more than simply a minor inconvenience), which is obviously completely undesirable. Therefore we should probably just go back to the "freedom" end of the spectrum. tl;dr: Surveillance in the name of security is only worthwhile if it captures every single piece of communication. Seeing as no one would be happy with that, the government should stop wasting so much money on ineffective surveillance projects, as they aren't really making anyone safe.
