I believe that most artists who paint unrecognizable shapes and then attribute a deeper meaning to them are largely overrated and should not receive the same amount of praise as other modern artists who have climbed the ranks through technical skill alone. Take these two paintings for example. [Exhibit A,] [Exhibit B] If you told me that these had been painted by the same artist, I would have believed you. However, the first artwork was painted by world renowned artist Jackson Pollock (and sold for half a million dollars), whilst the second one was actually painted by a [gorilla] . I personally don't believe there is any difference between the two and call shenanigans and the whole sub-genre. CMV.
