Posed more precisely, I think it should be illegal for employers to fire or refuse to hire someone because of a feature that does not directly impact their ability to do their job effectively. For most (though obviously not all) jobs, this would include the following: Race, gender, age, sexual orientation, etc. Politicalreligious affiliation Physical disabilities Physical appearance, including weight, piercings, tattoos, hairsyles Healthmedical history Recreational consumption of drugsalcohol (obvious exceptions if person is intoxicatedhigh at work, or there are long-term effects of consumption) Criminal record, assuming crimes have no relation to the job being performed Hobbies, personal relationships, posts on social media Of course you don't want a quadriplegic diving instructor, or a DC lobbyist with "fuck the system" tattooed on their forehead, but those examples both involve direct impact on job performance. There's no reason either of these people should be refused work at an accounting firm on the basis of those features alone. Likewise, while it makes sense for an employer to fire someone because they have a poor performance record or their job has been made redundant, they shouldn't be fired because they smoke cannabis on the weekends or because they posted something passive-aggressive about work on their Facebook.
