I will go in to this saying that I have done very little research on the subject and take most of my views from personal experience. When I was a child, I was very hyper, and pretty much all of my elementary school teachers urged my parents to put me on Ritalin or to have me checked out by a doctor for what they assumed was ADD. I did get checked out and the doctor advised my parents to put me on medication. My father is a very successful surgeon and he and my mother decided to hold off and see if I would "grow out of it." I did and never needed medication after all. This was also the case for two of my friends. I also knew of multiple people in high school and college who had prescriptions for ADDADHD and would not even take the pills, but would sell them and would admit that they did not need them, but that a doctor had prescribed them because of poor academic performance, over-activity, etc. I am by no means stating that I do not think ADDADHD are real things. I absolutely think that they are very important disorders which make life extremely hard for a lot of people. I only think that the cases are overblown and many children are medicated when they do not need to be. I tend to think that giving children pills for ADDADHD in some cases in a remedy that parents look to in order to not have to deal with real problems that children have in school and in in social settings. Change my view.
