1) Why do you hold your view? I have watched many documentaries including Loose Change 3rd ed (2013) and 911: In Plane Site. I don't want to reduce the videos to their end conclusions because the entire point is the presentation of the evidence. However the ideas seem inescapable. There is nothing but inconsistency at every single level from the story. There is not one part of the 757 impact story that is not just a little inconsistent, but totally inconsistent. 2) Is there any evidence you can use to support your view? Debris analysis, fuel analysis, fuel BTU analysis, fuel levels and ground contamination evidence, fuselage analysis, impact analysis, simulation analysis. These are all based on a combination of photographs taken at the scene, comparable crashes of planes similar or equal to a 757 involving buildings. Every way to explain away one aspect of inconsistency (for instance, lack of fuselage parts) introduces a logical fallacy in any other part of the story. (i.e. pentagon has a hardened steel outer casing which could explain the lack of fuselage, everything melted, but then the structural impact analysis - depth of impact, number of support columns destroyed, etc... dont follow). Edit: I completely dismissed the 9-11 truth movement after I witnessed the meltdown of structural steel from gasoline on a local freeway in the Bay Area when a gasoline tanker crashed (the MacArthur 580 interchange maze). But shortly after the Snowden revelations exposing the NSA, all my concerns about what the Government could do greatly changed. Reading through all the comments thoroughly.
