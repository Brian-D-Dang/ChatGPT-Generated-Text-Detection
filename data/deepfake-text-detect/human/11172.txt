Money. More people want to watch that than actual scientific programming. Don't blame the companies, blame the consumers.,These unscripted reality shows are really, really cheap to produce, mostly because there's always some idiot willing to do pretty much anything to be on television. It's not so much "a million viewers watch Super Science Show, 10 million watch Redneck Rangers, let's make more shows like Redneck Rangers." It's "Super Science Show costs us 1 million an episode to make, Redneck Rangers costs us 50,000. Even if we're losing viewers in droves, we still make more money., "Those other shows generate money. It's actually very similar to how the news has evolved over time. Originally the government gave networks the right to broadcast but required them to provide news as well. Networks lost money on the news consistently, year after year, but it was part of the deal. At some point they realized they could make money on the news by providing content that wasn't really newsworthy. At any rate, this is the same as what has happened with those channels. True education and science doesn't make as much money.," "Turns out smart people don't actually watch a lot of TV. But stupid people? Ka-CHING!!!,As an Alaskan, those shows are hilarious. Any one of us on the hillside could do those survival shows. Hell, sometimes we do it for fun anyway.','Networks have to follow the money in order to stay financially secure. They sell ad time to companies and play their commercials. If a show does not have a large viewer base, it becomes more difficult to convince a company to buy ad time for a certain time slot, like for a hard science show that may not appeal to the masses.
