Ron sat down at his computer to write his Great American novel. When he finished the manuscript, he got a publishing deal. After the book was released, Ron marketed very hard to sell books. Unfortunately, Ron never sold many copies and was forced to retire. Ron went back to his old job and moved on with his life.
