There he lay. The man responsible for it all. Twenty years of our existence flattened by an unstable environment. A man's spirit crushed by obsession, and an inability to fix what he himself created. The withered man was connected to all sorts of monitors and cables making shrill noises, exacerbated in their annoyance by the constant buffering and lag. He knew it was the end. We all did..... As he consumed desperately his last gulp of breath, he clutched my arm..... I looked around hurriedly for a nurse.... He looked me cold in the eyes and began to speak..... The lag intensified. Like a military grade LRAD billowing in my ear. I payed careful attention to his words.... The man said "It's not too late." "Go now...." "Find the F5 key....." As he faded, so did the lag. It seemed all the universe was still. I left the hospital somehow knowing that everything would be alright...... I felt........ Refreshed.
