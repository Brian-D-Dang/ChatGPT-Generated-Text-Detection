Can't write right now, but I just felt like sharing the idea As he kills people, the Joker keeps coming back. Batman becomes more obsessed with killing the joker, to the point where he stops killing lesser criminals because they're not worth slowing his hunt for. The Joker is of course a hallucination, but batman doesn't know that. Bruce Wayne funnels all of his money into hunting the Joker and Gotham goes from a fairly decent city with a slightly above average crime rate to the hellish Gotham we know and love. Wayne enterprises fails, the people are laid off turn to organized crime. Finally, someone becomes the Joker to stop batman. Might come back to this later.
