I am British; here in the UK, we don't have a written constitution in the same way that many other countries do, the U.S. being the most obvious. Without going into too much technical detail, this essentially means that our Parliament is not beholden to any document or any other body; it can pass any law it wants. It seems obvious to me that this is preferable to a formalised constitutional system, for a number of reasons; 1. Although possibly a topic for another debate, morality and ethics are constantly changing in ways which the law already has trouble keeping up with and codifying properly. Adding a constitution into that mix makes the whole process 100 times slower, 100 times out of touch with the moral reality of the age and 100 times more ineffectual. 2. The problem of hermeneutics. Like religious texts, written documents require interpretation and an understanding of the context that they were written in and constitutions are no exception. Look how dramatically different the political, technical and social landscapes are now, compared to when the US constitution was originally written. this gun control ad is an apposite example] The debate over the 'spirit' of what was written will continue to get worse and worse as the landscape continues to change; wouldn't it be easier to just have a system where law can change along with the landscape? 3. The supreme court can't have the last word if there isn't a constitution. Democratically elected officials do (in a perfect world, I'm well aware of the house of lords) Change my view!
