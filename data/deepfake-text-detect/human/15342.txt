I wasnt particularly fond of ice monster cafe. Their interior is pretty nice and comfortable but for quality drinks and snow ice I wasnt impressed. Prices for a small flavored ice was 5 which is served in a very tiny martini glass, large is about 10. I ordered the taro slush sensation, and a friend of mine got the thai tea, green tea float, and mango slush sensation. The thai tea wasnt good at all from what he told me, first he tried it with their sea salt cream foam, but it was too light and then with regular half and half cream. It looked very watered down and he said it was bland tasting. As for his greet tea macha float, he had described as floral traditional green tea but stronger. It didnt honestly look too good, like green water and a plop of ice cream melting in it, like a water float. My snow ice sensation was very bland, the ice cream scoop in it was good but the snow had very little to no taro taste at all; very watered down, and the texture was not fluffy but more of a crushed freezer ice texture, not worth 5 bucks in my opinion. The mango sensation was good and for a large was very decently sized, that was the only redeeming order of that day. The workers were pretty nice but not very helpful or knowledgeable at all on their products, it was more like ordering from a vending machine with no personality or presence unfortunately. I dont think I will ever be back but if I do return, maybe next visit will be better.
