I often read argument Reddit or with my American friends (I am Canadian) where people reference the Founding Fathers and the constitution. These people always talk about present day politicians as scummy and untrustworthy, while talking about the Founding Fathers like they could do no wrong and have the ultimate perfect opinion. The way I see it...they're politicians too. Now, I don't have such a bleak view of politicians as some; I think politicians are people and as such they can do great things or make mistakes. I just don't think it's healthy to think that every word out of the Founding Fathers mouths is pure gospel. They can make mistakes, and a few hundred years is a long time for the world to change around their words. This has come up a lot with recent gun debates. Redditors will talk about the right to bear arms and cite the Founding Fathers etc. Well....CMV
