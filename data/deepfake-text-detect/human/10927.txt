Because they are so tiny and they are inorganic. The pollution control measures in a wastewater treatment plant focus on the things we expect to be in water - human waste, paper, things like that. There are large filters (bar screens) to pull out the big things that may get swept into storm drains, then friendly bacteria we use to eat most of the organic material, and usually finally chlorine treatment to kill off whatever is left. But tiny plastic beads are inorganic; they don't get eaten by bacteria and there is nothing to kill in the chlorine. What about super tiny filtration screens? When you treat 50 million gallons a day, if you force the water through super tiny screens designed to catch super tiny particles like this, it would take way too long to screen the water. Since the other processes do enough to meet federal water standards, that's what the plant does. It would be massively expensive to retrofit every plant to try and catch these micro-beads.,I believe we might be entering a new phase of pollutants and that would be of the nano variety. Carbon and graphene nano structures could be the next ones. They could be accidentally inhaled or ingested and stay in the body.
