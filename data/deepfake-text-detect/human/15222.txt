Was stoked to see this little coffee shop while wandering PHX during a long layover. The menu boards in the back showed Aeropress, Hario V60, Clever, and Chemex at MKT price, which was a definite surprise to se ein an airport. I ordered an Aeropress. I was way too travel logged to really care about looking over their roasts, so went with the barista recommended Providencia. Nice to see them doing an inverted brew on a gram scale, pre-moistening the paper filter, weighing out the water, and timing. I didn't see them pre-warm the Aeropress, nor did they bloom the coffee. Still, the coffee was solid, with a great nose (though maybe any coffee would have done the trick at that point in my travels), and worth the 3.25 market price. I'm a little surprised to see most of those brewing techniques in a high-traffic, speed oriented, environment like an airport. My coffee definitely took a while (as expected), but I can't imagine what this place must be like when slammed (I was the only customer at 7 PM on a Sunday evening). Rad to have this option in an airport environment, and it's a shame I didn't have the timeenergy to explore their roasts. Definitely worth the jaunt to Terminal 4 if you've got a layover in PHX..
