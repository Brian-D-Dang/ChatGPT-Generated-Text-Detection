After a long discussion revolving around one of those straight pride pictures an interesting perspective showed up to me. The entire concept of hating what is part of somebodies identity is effectively the same as hating the person. I feel like this is nothing more than a mental cop out and illogical. If somebody said something that they don't have somebody named Bob but hate that he is black that is no different then if Bob was gay. I realize this stem's out of the concept of hate the sin not the sinner. But that still rings of being morally wrong to me as it is part of who somebody is. People are born LGBT as much as they are born into their ethnic background. tl;dr: Hating the act of being gay is bigotry even if you claim to not hate gay people you are still a bigot.
