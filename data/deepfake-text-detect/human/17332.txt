To clarify, I feel like we have too many programs right now that give "gold stars for participation" or "first place trophies for everyone." Praise is also cheap, and diluted in value. In my opinion, praise should be given when actual effort, intelligence, and efficiency to a task is put in, instead of just for participation in such a task. Additionally, failure should not be cushioned with some feel-good "well, at least you tried! Here's a reward anyway" mentality. It's okay to fail, but learn what you failed at so you improve in the future. I also see kids who were brought up with this mindset crashing and burning at my college, because they're so used to getting a reward despite not working hardsmart enough. Please CMV. I would love to hear some contentions.
