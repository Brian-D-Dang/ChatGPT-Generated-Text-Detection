I'll copy what I commented on another thread. I wouldn't call him a race-baiter actually like Sharpton. I think to be a true race baiter, you have to be in it for either power or money. I don't see what Obama has left to gain at this point. He's going to lose power in congress once the Republicans take over, he's not running for re-election, and he gets paid on a fixed salary. Maybe there's something I'm overlooking, but I think he's actually just saying what he feels. What he's saying may absolutely be wrong, but I don't see the motivation. I think people are very quick to judge someone's actions, Obama's recent criticisms along with the Martin, Brown, and Garner, as specific intentions of race-baiting. I'm not saying no one or no news media has never done this, but I keep seeing "Obama is a race-baiter" in a lot of threads, so I thought I might ask.
