Although I do not oppose gay rights, include marriage equality, I can see why those who do do so. They think homosexuality is a deviant behavior that either should not be allowed or at worst not be normalized by the public at large. However, where these groups like the National Organization for Marriage stumble is that they use incorrect analogies that hurt their agenda. Beastiality is improper because it involves a practice which one party cannot consent and is considered extremely deviant behavior. Polygamy is improper because it only concerns the issue of marriage equality, not the broader gay rights acceptance movement and almost no one in modern Western society practices it openly. Nudism, while not perfect, is a better analogy because it involves a practice that while rare is not unheard of and many people can envision themselves being one of them if only because they do it every time they undress. Most people are very uncomfortable around others who were nude if they were not. Therefore, nudism today is largely confined to secluded beaches and camps. For those who practice nudism the topic itself is very hard to discuss with those who don't do it this leads to parent telling their children to kept quiet with other kids, even their friends. While many nudists aren't looking for society to celebrate their lifestyle, they want nudism to be less stigmatized and verboten among the public. This is what gays wanted at the beginning of the gay rights movement and it expanded from there. Therefore, acceptance of nudism is a more appropriate analogy to gay rights.
