I think "love" has a lot of components in it, such as the physical aspect, the social aspect and whatnot. But what's to keep love separate from being measurable and replicate-able? For example, if we are able to plant the same memory and the same chemical composition and the same physical features and whatnot, we would be able to replicate love. Ok, say that external features affect "love" as well. Then let's create a computer simulation and replicate that as well. If this is all possible, then love is replicated. Then there is the question of all the particles in the same place and whatnot. But like same model cars, although they're different, they're same enough that we can say that they're "replicated" Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
