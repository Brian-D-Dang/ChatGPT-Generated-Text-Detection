I give two stars because I usually use this location to get water before a hike. Yesterday I come in to get water and the cashier is talking with her manager about something and making me wait for like 5 minutes. Cashier acknowledged me no hi how are you and no smile. Staff needs to be trained and store needs a cleaning. Will I come back.....maybe
