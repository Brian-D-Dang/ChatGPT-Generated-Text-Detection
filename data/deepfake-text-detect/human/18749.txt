I feel as soon as you get married and have kids, your life begins to mold itself into a big ball of boring. You cant really do anything you want. On top of that, you have to deal with screaming, kids fucking up your stuff, your wife nagging. In essence it's very selfish of me to think this, but regardless, I would rather be a playboy till I can no longer breathe. Especially with divorce rates higher than ever and only climbing, it seems nowadays that your almost setting yourself up for fAilure. Of course having kids and a wife is coined as one of the best gifts in life, but the tradeoff between all the fighting and struggles does not amount to the love and passion you get when recieving a good bye kiss or hand drawn picture from your son. Once again, I know i am selfish and naive, but hanging with my friends, spending money on yourself and partying sounds way more appealing. CMV
