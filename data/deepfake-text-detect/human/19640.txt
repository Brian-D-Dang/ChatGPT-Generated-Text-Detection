I was on an aderall equivalent for ADD for many years, and it helped me immensely in overcoming attention difficulties. Once I was old enough to understand the importance of focus, I was able to apply myself with great difficulty and overcome the need for these drugs. It is my belief that anything changing the state of mind of a human should not be used except under the most exceptional circumstances, such as the inability to function normally without them. I believe this because I believe any nonprescribed mind altering substance (including alcohol) has overwhelmingly negative effects on the productiveness of the individual during which the drug is in effect. It is possible that a person may need to utilize their full mental capabilities at any time for emergencies, and allowing people to put themselves into inferior mental states intentionally is tantamount to endorsing situations where these drugs either cause or fail to prevent an emergency, whether it be medical injury or a mental issue. I hope I have been clear, and I hope you can change my mind because I am frequently at odds with friends about this.
