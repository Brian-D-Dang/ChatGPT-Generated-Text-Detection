Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia [argues] that the Constitution is only obligated to protect freedom of religion not freedom from it. "The separation of church and state doesn't mean "the government cannot favor religion over non-religion," Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia argued during a speech at Colorado Christian University on Wednesday, according to The Washington Times. " He is absolutely wrong in his assertion. Freedom of religion is freedom from religion. There is not freedom to practice religious beliefs if you are required to adhere to any of the religious beliefs or rules of other religions. Favoring Christian prayer before government meetings forces all non-Christians to adhere to a religion they do not subscribe to. Allowing Ten Commandment monuments on public land forces Christian beliefs on all non-Christians. You cannot have freedom of religion without freedom from religion and therefore, Scalia is 100 wrong.
