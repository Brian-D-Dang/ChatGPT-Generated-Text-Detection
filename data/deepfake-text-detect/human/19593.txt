I have heard many people say that they are trigender or agender or whatever else, and I don't believe this one bit. I am a gay guy, and I firmly believe that transgender is a legitimate thing. We can measure the fact that people who are transgender have brains that fit the opposite gender's makeup. But never have I once seen any legitimate proof of someone being bigender or whatever else. I have heard someone say that are agender because they want to cut their genitals off and not be a gender, but that just sounds like normal body dysphoria, which doesn't necessarily mean your gender is different. Every time I have asked for proof of being otherwise, I've only ever heard anecdotes, or links to tumblr pages of people sharing more anecdotes. If this is a legitimate thing, I want cold, hard evidence of it. Some kind of medical journal, anything really. I hate feeling bigoted because of this opinion, but I am very skeptical of anything that sounds implausible. To me, it makes sense for someone to have their brain mismatch their body. Gender is relatively rooted in sex, in that, for 99.95 percent of human beings, it matches. But being "outside of the binary" has no presence in mammalian nature. There are males and females, and.. that's basically it. There's intersex, but that's just a mutation of the body even rarer than being transgender, and it doesn't suddenly mean there are other genders. This is my take on it. If anyone's got something to prove me wrong, please lemme know. A part of me is a cynic, but part of me would like some proof so I can actually take these seemingly well-minded people seriously. EDIT: Someone linked me this: This is pretty much all I wanted to see, some kind of documented proof of this occurrence. Credit goes to MageZero for providing it!
