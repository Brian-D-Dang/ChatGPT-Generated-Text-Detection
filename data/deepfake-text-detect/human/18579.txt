I am by no means an expert on Judaism or Islam. But I was raised Christian, and I understand that all three religions have a similar creation myth. Central to this creation myth is man's special place in the universe. God created man in his image, and all of the universe is essentially created for man. One prominent religious argument is that the universe is finely tuned for human life. If life was found on another planet it would deal a serious blow to any claims that humans have a special place in the universe or that the universe is finely tuned for just human life. In addition to these arguments, it would be a huge blow to the credibility of the bible, since there is no mention of alien life (outside of the Holy Trinity,devil, angels, etc if you consider those aliens). Finding extraterrestrial life would confirm that man is somewhat insignificant in comparison to the universe, and we could move on from these ancient Semitic religions into a new age of understanding our place in the universe.
