Cardinals football merits wings in this house. We ordered 70 wings for a house full of people for the game with an estimated wait time of 45 minutes. An hour and a half later, we called this Barro's location to see why we have not gotten our food yet. The customer service was horrible. All anyone said was Oh well it is busy because of football. When we finally received our wings, we noticed that we were also missing our salads that we had ordered. Once again we called and they could not refund us for paying for the missing salad, but only give us a credit for the next time we order from here, which will be never. I understand that a pizza joint would be busy, especially on a Sunday. However, the customer service that my family and I received was not up to par. I hold a higher standard to restaurants that when my order has been messed up, there are items missing, and if I have to call in twice, some sort of action be taken. My biggest regret is not going to Papa Murphy's for this Sunday football game!
