I'm not going to say I'm poor, as my mom works three jobs and makes a solid 50k a year. I work two jobs and made a very proud 9500 last year while still being a full time college student. I save whatever I can to pay off the ever looming debt, and I'm very excited to buy a car this summer, which I'm hoping to splurge and spend about 6,000 on. Cue my friend who just graduated early from college after living in the nicest on-campus housing for her entire time (4000semester 2500semester meal plan). She just bought a brand new 2013 model which has an MSRP of about 21,000, and has posted pictures of her massive new apartment with a lake view. When we talk, I mention how I'm struggling to pay back the massive debt my room mate left behind when he ducked out, and she says, "yeah, money is so tight." I've realized that my largest prejudice is against wealthy people. I don't believe they understand what it's like to sit down and know that you can't go out with your friends at all this month, or even eat the food you want. I don't think they know the stress that comes over me when a new bill arrives in the mail. I think they are genuinely disconnected from how an average american lives (which admittedly is probably a lower quality of life than even me), and I've realized the anger I hold towards them because of that. Change my view? EDIT: Ok, anger aside, I still can't fight that people who are wealthyaccustomed to living wealthy (I realized I direct this viewpoint towards those who have never known povertytough times) cannot comprehend the challenges of life as someone making just enough to get by.
