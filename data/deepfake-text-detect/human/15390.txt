We went to see Croods today in one of the new digital theater rooms. WOW! I couldn't believe the huge improvement. I've never complained about picture quality at this theater - I figure that the low cost of the movie doesn't justify a complaint. This new system rocks! Such a great picture and the sound was really good too! Great addition to your theater Pollack! Thanks so much! OH, and they now take CREDIT CARDS!
