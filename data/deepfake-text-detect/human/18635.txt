At this point, I don't like the film because the film differs from the book so much (according to the IMDB, around 50 of the plot points are different in the film than in the book.) The film also seems to move too quickly (there wasn't any time taken to move the characters from situation to situation, they just seemed to appear there instantly. I'm aware that most of my distaste of the film comes from comparing it to the book that it was based on (I enjoyed that immensely.) Also, I haven't seen the film since its release in 2006. So please, change my view. I'll try and accommodate most of what you say.
