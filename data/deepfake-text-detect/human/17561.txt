I work in downtown LA and the homeless problem here is pretty bad. There was a guy who threw his shits in front of our building this morning. At the food court I go to, homeless guys sometimes walk around and beg for change. They're also begging and sleeping on the LA subways because our subways don't have turnstiles and rely on the honor system. They are a nuisance to everyone. Most of them look like they have mental illness. I think for any major city to develop faster, it needs to get rid of the homeless problem. I think homeless should be rounded up, put into camps, and treated for their mental health or addiction problems. That way major downtown area could be cleaner and safer and the homeless could get the treatment they need. The approach that most cities have of ignoring the problem won't work and it really hurts the local economy.
