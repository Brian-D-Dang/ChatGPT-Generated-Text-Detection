This is a hot topic in the news right now. Arizona is trying to pass SB1062 the "religious freedom bill." Here is a quote from CNN: "In short, SB1062 would amend the existing Religious Freedom Restoration Act, allowing business owners to deny service to gay and lesbian customers so long as proprietors were acting solely on their religious beliefs." I think it's a bad bill without even having read it. It's clearly discriminating against a group of people. I think it would be discriminatory if you refused to sell goods or services to someone because of his or her sexual orientation. If you were a car mechanic and refused to fix cars for same sex couples, that would be discriminatory. If you had a restaurant with a sign that said "No Gays Allowed" that would be discriminatory. But what about the wedding photographer or caterer? That's a bit more of an intimate service than say selling books or shoes, or even selling a wedding cake. I don't think it would be right to legally require a business to participate in a same sex marriage ceremony if they disagreed with it on moral or religious grounds. Change my view.
