People tell me kids are butchering the English language by saying "yolo" and "swag." They say conversation is being ruined by texting acronyms being brought into normal speech. But why is this seen as "butchering," rather than progressing? If we never wanted English to change, we'd still be speaking Elizabethan English with "thou" and "thee," or even worse, we'd be speaking Old English like in books like Beowulf. So why are so many people opposed to kids using "yolo" as a modern version of "carpe diem," and "swag" as a modern version of "jewelry," "stuff" or "class"?
