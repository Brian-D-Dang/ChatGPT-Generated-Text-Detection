Firstly, we decided to give this restaurant another try after finding our first experience a lot of bucks for little bang. Going in with an open mind, we thought that we would go with recommendations from the waiter. We ordered the arugula salad with artichokes, a mixed green salad and the chef's signature ravioli, as well as the pasta with porcini mushrooms for appetizers. The salads were acceptable, however the artichiokes were tough and had chewy skin on them. The appetizer pasta with mushrooms was good, but bland and the ravioli was exceptional. Having been in Italy many times and eaten in many authentic italian restaurants, this of course was not the same experience. Our waiter overwhelmed us with information about where everything came from in the Mediterranean and Italy and made us feel stupid even though we could tell she never has been there. She recommeded a whole fish which she claimed was sweet and firm based on its diet of crustaceans, and it was neither sweet nor firm and tasted like a large sardine. The waiter filleted the fish, and took so long it was cold when she served it. The fish was flavourless and cold, and the accompanying zuchinnis were tasteless and the fried potatoes tasted like they were the frozen variety. The sauces with the fish, one which was olive oil, sundried tomatoes, and black olives, and the other was parsley, olive oil and orgegano, were so overpowering, in the end we just asked for plain lemon. We didnt finish the meal. The waiter was cognizant that we were unhappy with the meal, and she didn't bother to even ask us if we enjoyed it, she just removed the uneaten plates and didn't say a word. So for 350 for two people with no drinks and a half bottle of wine, this was a lot of fluff. Go to any fish tavern in Montreal and you'll get a good whole grilled fish, served hot and with a smile for a 100 for two. Its a rip. Too bad. Not going back.
