The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries. According to Biraben, the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671. The Second Pandemic was particularly widespread in the following years: 1360-63; 1374; 1400; 1438-39; 1456-57; 1464-66; 1481-85; 1500-03; 1518-31; 1544-48; 1563-66; 1573-88; 1596-99; 1602-11; 1623-40; 1644-54; and 1664-67. Subsequent outbreaks, though severe, marked the retreat from most of Europe (18th century) and northern Africa (19th century). According to Geoffrey Parker, "France alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628-31."
