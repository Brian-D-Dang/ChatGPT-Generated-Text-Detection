Furthermore, the opening of Supreme Court sessions with "God save the United States and this Honorable Court" should not be allowed. My main reason is that there is a separation of church and state in this country, and these references to an Abrahamic God endorses the Abrahamic religions over non-religious peoples and other religious people. edit: sorry guys, I shouldn't have started this CMV right now, as I'm procrastinating a paper. This is a very interesting discussion and I'll respond more tomorrow when I'm done with my paper. Thanks!
