I don't think anybody says the economy isn't recovering. At least, I don't think anybody seriously says that. What some people say is that the economy isn't recovering as fast as it could. Everybody agrees that the economy is gradually climbing back out of the hole it dug for itself in the mid-late 2000s, but not everybody agrees that that recovering is going well, or that it's being brought about in the right way.,There are still no jobs. The health of the stock market means absolutely nothing to people who have no jobs.
