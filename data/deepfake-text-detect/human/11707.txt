Google's Fi VPN is a service available to subscribers of its Fi network. VPNs are services that give users a private connection while using the open internet, ensuring that traffic is encrypted. A decent VPN usually costs money, but Google is offering Fi VPN to its customers for free as a shield against attackers and tracking software. The service is moving out of beta for Android users, and it will be coming to iPhone in Spring. Google is also taking steps to protect Fi users from various mobile scams.
