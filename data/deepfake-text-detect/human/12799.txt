Georgia stared into the mirror, her fists palpitating with fear. She closed her eyes and took in a long deep breath. Her friends were sitting just outside the bathroom door, giggling and wondering whether Georgia would chicken out. The lights were off, the candles were lit, and she was ready. "Bloody Mary..." she whispered. "Bloody Mary..." she whispered again, almost crying. She hesitated for a second, scratching her red hair. "B-Bloody Mary!" she cried before opening her eyes. There was nothing but her own reflection, obscured by the darkness. She laughed uncomfortably. "I guess it was just an urban legend after all" she said with relief. She walked out the door and turned to her friends. "What did I tell you?" she said as if she wasn't completely scared shitless by what her friends dared her to do. "Just a myth!" she said confidently, crossing her arms. The next day, there was a murder next door to Georgia's house. Apparantly, somebody broke in and killed everyone in the home. The husband, the wife, and their little baby girl, all killed and torn apart limb by limb. Surprisingly, the police found that there was a surprising amount of blood for just three people, most of which was in the bathroom.
