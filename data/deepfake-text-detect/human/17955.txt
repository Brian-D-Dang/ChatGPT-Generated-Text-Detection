Old movies aren't typically my taste, but I've recently watched Gone with the Wind and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? and I think the acting in these movies (by supposedly "great" actors) is awful. There is zero subtlety and everything is over-acted. It's like watching a bunch of five-year-olds playing pretend. I've noticed it particularly with Gone with the Wind because the book is one of my all-time favorites and I was so disappointed with the movie. There are so many subtle layers of emotion in the book that could have at least partially been conveyed on-screen with facial expressions and body language, but they skipped all of that and painted things with the broadest brush possible. Even Clark Gable's famous line, "Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn" came across only as angry, instead of how it should have been - soft, pain-filled, and resigned. So, change my view. Tell me why you think these "classic" actors were great. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
