"Target hit, I repeat target hit" called our communications tech over the radio. "Do we have eyes on the target." I asked walking over to the computer screen in the middle of the room. "Yes sir, we will have satellite image in 5..4..... 3..... 2..... 1. Putting image on main screen" said the ensign. The entire room stopped what they were doing to look at the TV. No one breathed as we all waited for the smoke to clear from the blast sight. As the smoke dispersed a deafening cheer filled the room, people got up and started to hug each other. "Calm down were not done yet. In fact im pretty sure this is only the beginning." On screen was an alien world, its red sands turned to glass as its towers crumbled to the ground. It had been years of work and trial but we were finally able to fight back. Soon we would take the fight back to them, we would reclaim our world.
