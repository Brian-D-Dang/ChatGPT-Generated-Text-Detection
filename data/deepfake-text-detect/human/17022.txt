The g 2 norm of a real x m n matrix A is the minimum number t such that the column vectors of A are contained in a 0 -centered ellipsoid E R m which in turn is contained in the hypercube [ - t, t ] m. We prove that this classical quantity approximates the hereditary discrepancy herdisc A as follows: g 2 (A) O (log m) herdisc A and herdisc A O (log m) g 2 (A). Since g 2 is polynomial-time computable, this gives a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for hereditary discrepancy. Both inequalities are shown to be asymptotically tight. We then demonstrate on several examples the power of the g 2 norm as a tool for proving lower and upper bounds in discrepancy theory. Most notably, we prove a new lower bound of O (log - d 1 n) for the d -dimensional Tusnady problem, asking for the combinatorial discrepancy of an n -point set in R d with respect to axis-parallel boxes. For d 2, this improves the previous best lower bound, which was of order approximately log d 1) 2 n, and it comes close to the best known upper bound of O (log d 1 2 n), for which we also obtain a new, very simple proof.
