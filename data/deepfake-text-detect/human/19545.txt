So recently, I've started watching Dr Who on Netflix. In every episode, they use terminology that I am fairly unfamiliar with (being that I'm an American). I find these terms just plain adorable. No other country has such endearing terms. Some of my favorite examples include: Ace - If something is ace it is awesome. Arse - This is a word that doesn't seem to exist in America. It basically means the same as ass, but is much ruder. Snog - If you are out on the pull you will know you are succeeding if you end up snogging someone of the opposite sex (or same sex for that matter!). It would probably be referred to as making out in American, or serious kissing! Taking the piss - This has nothing to do with urine, but simply means making fun of someone. I don't know if I could ever get past that whole "smoking a fag" thing though.
