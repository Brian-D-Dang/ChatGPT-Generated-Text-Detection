It is my belief that personal feelings on a subject should not factor in to how you vote in the house. Since it is the job of senatorscongressmen to represent their constituents, they should therefore vote the way the people they represent decide by majority, and their only jobs should be to make the public aware of an issue going to vote, the public should then cast a vote and the senator then expresses the results to the house at large regardless of how they feel about the issue at hand. Even individual issues should not be brought up not by members of government but rather by the people as a whole making government aware of an issue they feel is important by means of contacting their congressmen or similar avenue.
