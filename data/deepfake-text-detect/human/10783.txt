Because "you" in this situation are the camera. When the speaker looks into the camera, he looks into what you would be seeing, as the viewer at that point. The cameras lens is a proxy for your eyes.', "Video is two dimensional, so as long as you are within approximately a 90 degree cone in front of that screen, you and anyone else in that cone can see every point on that screen. You can all see exactly the same thing. With an actual person, who is three dimensional, pretend you stand directly in front of them and make eye contact and then freeze them in place. As you start to move around to the side, even just the slightest bit, new parts of their face are added to your point of view, and other parts are lost, including parts of their eyes which made it seem they were looking at you. Now if you then freeze yourself in place and unfreeze the other person, and they start to look around the room, it has the same effect. Since no two people can stand in exactly the same place at exactly the same time, and even just the slightest difference in position changes what you see in 3D, it's not possible for more than one observer to be making eye contact in 3D.
