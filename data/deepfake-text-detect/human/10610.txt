Extreme accuracy and mass production are not quite compatible.', "Car industry engineer here: The main reason is profit. Our production lines are built in a way to account for error. Most of it is tolerance. Every part has a gap to the next. Think of cutting a piece of paper into stripes of 1 inch. You could use a scissor and do it by hand. You could use a machine, but every method has an error. No strip will ever be 1 inch but maybe 1.000001 inch. Machines are better at cutting but the blade will change over time and if you control every part by hand you can lower these tolerances. If your piece of paper is 1.5 inches cut it again. But why should you try to cut every part that precise, if you only want one that is between 0.9 and 1.1 inches? Produced by hand means that they check things more often not that it is actually done without machines. Lower tolerances mean more power. A typical 100PS car engine can have 90 PS or 110 PS. We only need to guarantee its close to it. The real reason why it can't be mass produced is because a huge chunk of profit is the engine and gear shaft. I won't give you a number, but its produced for a few bucks a piece.," "Saying it is made by hand is a selling point. This is the production process for the GTR engine URL1 This is the production process for a stock Ford EcoBoost Engine URL0 They both consist of guys assembling engine parts by hand. Maybe the only difference is the GTR is just one guy, rather than several. Don't be fooled, that one GTR guy is paying his bills and waiting for lunch just like everyone else. No more care, and no super secret special process is in place to make the GTR hand made. It is just a nicely designed engine in nicely designed car, using perhaps better quality components, but made in a nice factory.
