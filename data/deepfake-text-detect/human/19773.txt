I understand that musical quality is an intrinsically subjective term; different people hold different views about what makes music of high quality so I will try to give the most objective definition and attributes of musical quality (in no particular order) here: 3. Complexity and variety 2. Originality, inventiveness, and creativity 3. Coherence 4. Flow and direction I am a classically educated pianist and I enjoy a large variety of music (classic rock, classical music, folk rock and many other genres). However, I cannot help but feel that rap and hip-hop are simply terrible in terms of musical quality. When I hear a song from either of these genres, it typically seems excessively repetitive (often comprising of a short beat with little tonal variation repeated on a loop throughout the song), largely unoriginal (many songs are very stylistically similar), and require little skill or talent to actually produced (any idiot with a computer and a pattern in his head can loop a short track over and over and call it a song). I recognize that there are many songs in any genre that are unoriginal, repetitive, and of general low quality, but it seems to me that the vast, vast majority of rap and hip-hop songs are qualitatively bad. Also, please note that I am talking about the instrumental parts of songs, NOT the lyrics. I think that many rappers are brilliant lyricists, but they are simply talking in rhythm to a repetitive track in the background. EDIT: removed the last characteristic in my list skill in talent and reproduction. In hindsight, that one was just too subjective and unfair.
