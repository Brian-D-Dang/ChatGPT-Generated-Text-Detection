SuperFish is a piece of adware installed on some Lenovo computers. It is bad because they installed a digital certificate on the computer which browsers will trust. Then the adware intercept all web traffic, including HTTPs. When you visited an HTTPs site, the adware signed a certificate for the site using the installed trusted cert. Ie. instead of You encrypted Bank you have You [encrypted] superfish [encrypted] bank where the link between you and superfish is encrypted with the superfish certificate. Your browser trusts the cert, so it doesn't tell you anything is wrong. The problem is that that the private key is embedded in the software, so anyone can make a certificate that any Lenovo computer will trust. Think the communication between you and your bank is secure? Anyone with the superfish key can be listening in.," "It's malware that hijacks secure HTTP connections and serves ads. It's also been compromised so that anyone, not just Lenovo, can hijack your HTTPS connections. It's a pretty severe problem, and if you own an affected machine, you ought to already have cleaned it, if not wiped your system and reinstalled. URL0 URL1
