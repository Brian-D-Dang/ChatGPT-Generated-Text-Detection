Google is testing a new feature on their Google Maps app that will allow users to receive directions though their phone camera in real time. The feature will create an augmented reality overlay over the camera so that directions will be visible alongside real world objects. The idea is still in early testing stages, as Google is still coming up with ways to keep users from focusing too much on the screen instead of what is in the real world, as well as other practical use issues.
