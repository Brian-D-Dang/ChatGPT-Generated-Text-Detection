Basically, I believe that esports will always have a following but will never truly be understood and accepted outside of a niche part of the population of the USA. If you see any mainstream documentaries or news stories regarding video games there are just too many misconceptions for video games to be taken seriously. I'm a fan of esports and ill concede that it has a massive following in parts of Europe and Asia, but the USA has too many obstacles to overcome. This isn't a debate about whether being recognized is necessary but more a statement of fact about the current situation and culture of gaming in the USA. I believe that esports can be successful without mainstream popularity, but it will never benefit from the broad appeal of conventional sports or be even close to the popularity that gaming has in other countries (specifically Korea).
