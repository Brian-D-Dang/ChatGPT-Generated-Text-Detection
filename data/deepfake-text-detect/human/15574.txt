Tucked inside Scottsdale Fashion Square, customers can shop, eat, and enjoy a movie. I've always had a good experience at this theater. The staff are all friendly, theater is clean, and the latest flicks are playing. Nothing I can do about the price of food, so I won't harp on that. Each time I've watched a movie here, the crowd had been relative average...not too crowded.
