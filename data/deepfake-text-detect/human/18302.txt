When I look around, everything is in perfect order. Gravity, the relationship between the moon and ocean, the balance of nature, the cells in our bodies. When born, we have genetics that respond to an environment and everything that happens is a functioning of that original equation. Thus, we don't have "Free will" and are only a product of genetics:environment. This means that when we are born, our entire life is already laid out. Why, when everything else you can see is perfectly ordered, are humans suppose to be "special" and random (Free will). Osmosis in our bodies, the way we use protein, our lungs, it's all so perfect and ordered - and yet we think that our thoughts aren't part of a function? EDIT: Thank you for all your responses, when I have time I will carefully read over each of them before coming to any new conclusions. I am busy this week due to just finishing exams and having to smoke weed, go drinking, hit the gym, play games and watch the Oscar films but once I'm ready to engage my mind again - (Saturday) - I will try to learn from everything you have all said. Thanks again.
