That is often a significant argument from climate change-deniers trying to explain the beyond overwhelming scientific consensus regarding man-caused climate change. I feel like this is absurd. I believe that most climate scientists spending substantial time working are not lying and falsifying date so they can get grant money to falsify more data about climate change. I believe they are more interested in putting their years of education to proper use then intentionally lying to the rest of world. Change my view! Hello, users of CMV!
