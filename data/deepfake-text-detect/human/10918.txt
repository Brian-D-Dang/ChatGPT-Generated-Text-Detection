In the heats and semis, they are truly slowing down. The winners are trying to disguise how fast they really are.... They don't want the competition to know their true speed. If you watch the men's and women's 100m finals, they are running full speed (or diving) across the finish line.,According to the commentators, most sprinters running absolutely flat-out tend to run out of gas around 80m, and so they do indeed start slowing down in the last couple seconds. In the longer distances, even just 200m, conserving speed during the race in order to manage the race is an important part of the strategy. 100m is short enough that the best strategy for most runners (in the final, at least) is just to go as fast as possible for as long as possible, and that means most start to flag before they hit the line but not so far before that it would make sense to hold back.', "They are slowing down. The human body can only run top speed up to about 80 meters. See [this article] (URL1) which shows the 10 meter split times for Usain Bolt in 2008 and 2009. You can see that his time from 70 m to 80 m is lower than his time for 80 to 90 m or 90 to 100 m. EDIT: [This article] (URL0) compares Bolt's splits to his opponents., that particular camera angle makes it difficult to judge speed in heats, once they are sure they qualify, the leaders after do slow down they are really slowing down...100m is long enough that fatigue will start to set in and degrade performance
