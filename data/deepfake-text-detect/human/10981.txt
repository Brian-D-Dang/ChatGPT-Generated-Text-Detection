Even at the microscopic scale, there's a huge difference in the scale of magnitude between cells (bacteria etc.) and actual molecules that make up the air. The diameter of bacterium is typically 0.2-2.0 um (micrometers); a micrometer is one millionth of a meter. The diameter of the typical air molecule (let's just assume nitrogen) is about 1.5-3.0 A (Angstroms); an Angstrom is one ten-billionth of a meter. Hence the diameter of the typical bacterium is of an order of magnetude ten-thousand times larger than that of the typical air molecule. To give you a sense of scale, the Earth has a mean diameter of around 13,000 km. If Earth represents the typical bacterium, then the typical air molecule will be about the size of the span between the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge (1.28 km). As for the bacteria, think of a ping-pong ball in a huricane. The force of gravity on the ball is very small as it's so light, that the wind will easily pick it up and carry it away. If you scale it right down to the size of a bacterium, the force of gravity is unbelievably small... It doesn't take much of a breeze to pick up and carry them!
