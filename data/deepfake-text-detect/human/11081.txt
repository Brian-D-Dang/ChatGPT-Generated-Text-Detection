The thinking behind this is in the evening or at night its generally cooler. And without bright sunlight, with cooler temperatures, less of the water you spray onto your lawn will evaporate.','If you water at night the water will evaporate much slower. This allows more of it to soak into the soil and be absorbed by the plants. So you actually have to water less often to keep the plants healthy.','This is bad advice. Watering at night can promote fungus and other disease. Watering in the early morning (4 - 10am) is best. It still allows water to penetrate into the ground and not evaporate as fast as in the midday.', "There is a two pronged process behind this kind of social engineering. Yes, watering overnight can use less water but its more about spreading the load on the water infrastructure out. They don't want everyone getting home from work, slamming a load into the wash, turning on the dishwasher and having their sprinklers on...need more and larger reservoirs, more capacity at the treatment plant, etc. So they tell you its a conservation measure but the underlying reason is so they don't have to upgrade expensive infrastructure.
