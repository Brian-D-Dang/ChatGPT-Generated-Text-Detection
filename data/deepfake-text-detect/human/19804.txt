I find atheists, taken as a group, tend to be socially progressive in a lot of meaningful ways. That said, I feel like irreligion is sometimes mistaken for "objectivity" in a moral sense. I'm speaking specifically of the far right wing portion of atheism. The folks who use pseudo-science to support ideas of white supremacy, patriarchy, climate change denial and the like. The sort of folks who define themselves as "Anti-SJW" and smugly trumpet atheism as the only true path to enlightenment. I think it's important to recognize the force of humanitarianism behind great social movements- The Civil Rights Act, which abolished segregation, was argued for in both secular and religious terms and Martin Luther King Jr., by all accounts, was no atheist. I, personally, am a unitarian universalist- a church that has repeatedly spoken out on behalf of LGBT people, on behalf of people of color, on the behalf of women's rights, et cetera. Ultimately, I think humanitarianism is far more important that religious affiliation for this reason. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
