I am a Physics major, so I understand the utility of logic, mathematics, and the current paradigms of physics (at least to some extent). But logic and mathematics were built upon certain axioms that we (humans) seemed to have just made up. Why is this valid? When two balls collide, does the universe whip out its calculator and re-position the two balls? Can we truly understand the universe we live in when the only tools we have are contrived systems of made-up numbers? How can we assert logic, mathematics, and physics have any "real" meaning at all?
