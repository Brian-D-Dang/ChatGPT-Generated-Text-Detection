The purpose of health care is to prevent disease or restore normal function using the least cost effective method available. Pregnancy can be prevented using contraception or avoiding sex. While pregnancy is a medical condition the low cost, and safest treatment option is an abortion, "A first trimester abortion is 300 to 450," Nugent says. "But if the gestational age is higher you're paying for a surgical suite. That's why the insurance companies think they should be offering it. It's cheaper to terminate an unwanted pregnancy rather than taking it to term." Health Care Blue Book confirms the price difference. An abortion performed in an physician's office typically costs 397. A vaginal delivery costs 5,992, while a c-section is 8,558. (These are estimates based on the site's database of in-network charges negotiated by insurers.) Just as insurers will authorize generic medicine in preference to name brand medicine when it is available to save cost. If the patient wants the more expensive option, name brand drugs or maternity care, they can pay using their funds.
