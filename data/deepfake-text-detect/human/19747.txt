In terms of classical literature, my view is that a tragedy is better at conveying the theme than a comedy. First of all, tragedies tend to be more serious and use the flawsstruggles of the protagonist to convey the theme. These tragic events happen due to the actions (of free will) by the main character. Through the text, he or she eventually realizes the lesson, which is often the theme. This allows a more concrete description of the theme by the author without writing it out word for word. Tragedies also leave more room for the characters to reflect on themselves would could help in conveying theme. I know that there are holes in my thoughts but I would really like to hear people's opinion on this subject. Thanks! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
