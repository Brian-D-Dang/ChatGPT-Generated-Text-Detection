Facebook Gaming is launching on Android today. It is Facebook's attempt to take on the streaming community. The app will be available on iOS once it is approved on the App Store. Facebook has been investing in gaming for years, but despite its large user base, it still lags behind Twitch and YouTube when it comes to hours of gameplay watched. The app will allow users to become a streamer with only a few clicks.
