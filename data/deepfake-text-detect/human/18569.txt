I'm not a very motivated person when it comes to school work. I cruised through high school putting forth very little effort and still graduated in the top 25 of my class. I scored a 1250 on my 2 part SAT, I feel like I could have done better, but I scored the exact same score twice. I was accepted into several universities, but I could not afford most of them. I'm currently in only my second semester of college and I am contemplating dropping out to pursue some form of paying job. I don't think spending my time in college to gain a degree is of equal or greater value than the time I could spend working a full time job and beginning to save up money. I'm not paying my way through college. I have a grant that pays all of my tuition for 4 years, and other costs are handled by my parents. I don't have a job right now because my parents expect me to spend my time studying while in reality I spend maybe 2 hours per week studying and doing whatever I like the rest of the time. I wanted to go to college to be able to be in a new place, expand my knowledge, and be in a better position to get a job in the future. I now live 11 hours away and I'm almost as miserable as I was back home. I don't want to do the work for my classes as most of it is busy work. I want to learn and be challenged to learn and I'm not being challenged and I have learned next to nothing the entire time I've been here. I'd much rather spend my time working somewhere to earn money instead of working to earn credits. But at the same time I do not want to disappoint my parents by not getting a college degree. I'm more interested in experiencing life than waiting four more years to do so. I'd rather have a job. CMV.
