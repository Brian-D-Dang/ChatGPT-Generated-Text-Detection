Several different things. Firstly, eye drops generally have the same concentration of salt as your normal tears, which means they don't sting your eyes as much. Secondly, some eye drops are made differently to better help different layers of your tears. Tears are made up of 3 main layers: a mucous layer, a watery layer, and an oily layer. Different types of eye drops may have different concentrations of those layers to better help your tears work.,You should not wash your eyes with normal tap water, (unless in an emergency) as you are washing away the natural tears which are formulated to keep the cornea and the front of your eyes as healthy as possible. Also tap water can contain bacteria which is harmful to the eye, although you would be unlucky to catch an infection unless you did it regularly. Washing your face and around your eyes and wiping gently around the eyelids is good hygiene. Eyedrops, as already stated, are formulated to be more like the natural tear which help lubricate the eye better and of course are sterile. (this is why the packs are sealed and you get recalls on contact lens and other eye related products if they are found to be contaminated etc.) URL0 URL1
