I know a lot of people already accept this and simply say that "the winners write the history books," or just sweep it under the rug because we don't really like talking about it, but I think it's too big a point to ignore. One example of US propaganda is the pledge of allegiance. It's something that I never really questioned until foreign exchange students were shocked that it existed. They said it sounded just like something a authoritarian regime would require its citizens to recite. I was required to recite it in elementary school, and I wouldn't be surprised if it still is required in a large number of schools. There are also other things such as the way subjects are taught in schools. Teaching seems to shy away from putting political enemies in a favorable light, or the US itself in an unfavorable light. An example is the NanKing massacre. Yes, a lot of schools teach it, but this was a massacre that on some levels may have surpassed the cruelty of the holocaust. I think this may be less taught because we were prefer to be less friendly with China, and more friendly with Japan. The US teaches about the trail of tears, but in High School, I think we went over it for a day and then I never heard about it again. It wasn't until I took a more in depth class in college that I understood how cruel and unfair US settlers treated the native americans in our move west. We were cruel to the point of genocide, and many groups actually believe that it should have been labeled a genocide. I'm sure the list goes on for cases of subtle or not so subtle propaganda that are still widespread today. So for those reasons, I believe that we are a very propagandistic country. I know we're nowhere near countries like North Korea, but it seems silly and hypocritical for us to criticize coercive foreign leadership for "uniting" their nation and forcing obedience, when the US in a way does the same thing, but in a more subtle and less open way.
