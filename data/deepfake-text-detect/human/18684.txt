[Inspired by this article. ] I feel like every time you hear about a student who commits suicide or has a fatal accident you only hear the good. They were an angel, they were a good kid, they never deserved it etc. When someone points out that the kid was a brat, a bully or an all around bad person their death seems to absolve them off their sins. For context my younger step brother died in a traffic accident on a trip he took for his 18th. Every one was crushed, saying he had such potential and he was such a good kid. He wanted to drop or of high school to dj, he used drugs, he had run ins with the police and was an all around pain in the ass. If course I was sad to see him go under the circumstances, but suddenly it was like he was prefect because of his untimely death. Now I'm not saying that you should be balently disrespectful and hurtful. But at the end of the day a man lost his job because he called an orange an orange when everyone else was saying he was an apple. Now of course we don't know the whole story but it was just a prompt that got me thinking. From experience I know that an untimely death seems to bring out the best of you in other peoples opinions. Just because your dead does not mean you weren't an asshole. So there you go, Just because you suffer an untimely death you shouldn't automatically be considered a good person. CMV Edit; "If you can't say something nice don't say anything at all" isn't really what I'm looking for here. I'm thinking about why negative opinions of a person seem to change after an unfortunate death. Why would a kids treacher who hated him in life be expected to say something nice about them now that their gone and why would a problem child suddenly just be "misunderstood" now that they've died?
