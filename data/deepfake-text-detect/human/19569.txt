T.V glamourises drugs, violence, alcohol and sex. The youth of the world is immearsed in this and I believe it is ruining them. Children sit in front of these 'magical boxes' for hours in a single day. Before school, after school, sometimes till the wee hours of the morning. People become very anti-social when watching t.v. I remember when I was young the girls that were considered to be sluts still covered there sensitive areas more so than todays celebrities. Sex is now promoted for teens, it is portrayed as an experience you must have during your high school life. This is all because of t.v. It disgusts me.
