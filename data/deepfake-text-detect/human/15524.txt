This review is for breakfast only. Unbelievably bad breakfast. Wobbly table, bad service, had to ask for salt, pepper, napkin and silverware. Cream for coffee was old and curdled, sausage was disgusting, eggs not the way I ordered them. Coffee lousy too. I recommend you eat anywhere but here for breakfast. Seemed like cafeteria food.
