Honestly I think there needs to be something more to being a whistle-blower than just grab whatever you can and release it. There needs to be some vetting, and it needs to be done by the whistle-blower. I work in the biotech industry, where whistle-blowers are very well rewarded. Recently a company was fined 750M and the whistle-blower received 100M from the FDA. I know for a fact if he had just hacked company files and sent the FDA everything he would have gone to jail. He only handed over what was relevant to the case. I believe the military should be the same.
