This is one of those interesting gray topics. I dont think Turks should be considered Europeans because the Turkic people are their own thing. Europe for the most part is Indo-European stock, a massive and varied family of languages that Turkish is not a part of. Furthermore, Turkish people can't be considered middle eastern either. Their culture and language are distinct. Sure, the Ottomans ruled parts of Europe and the Middle East, but so to did the Mughals (a Turkic empire) rule India. This does not make them Indian. I think Turkish people are not European or Middle Eastern, but part of their own subset of humanity. Also due to Turkey's geographic location, being situated literally as a bridge between regions, Turkey is its own thing, not a part of Europe or the Middle East. In previous empires, it held parts of Europe and the Middle East, but present day Turkey is a part of neither region. CMV.
