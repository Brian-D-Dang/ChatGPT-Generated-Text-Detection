This place is a joke. The bread was cold and they only gave us one cup of butter for 4 people to share. We had to ask 3 times for extra butter. The medium rare prime rib was mostly medium in the middle and was too tough to eat. The garlic mashed potatoes were not even hot when they came out and already had a stale film on the exterior. The service was appalling. I had to beg for refills and the check. I will never come back here.
