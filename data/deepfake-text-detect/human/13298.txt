"You're a persistant bastard, aren't you?" "If by now you can't tell you surely can't be the master of the universe you claim to be." "I never claimed to be a master of anything, just a reaper of souls." "Where would you take my soul to, anyways?" "A better place, perhaps, I couldn't describe it in any terms you'd understand." "I've been through the lifespan of the entire universe multiple times, I have more knowledge than any mortal, and by now, immortal, could ever hope to achieve. Give it your best shot." "I really can't, not unless you come with me." "And you call me the persistant bastard." "Honestly, you're just trying to keep going for the sake of winning a bet, but you don't understand, you can't win, the only possible ending is me taking you." "I know, but'extending the deadline' so to speak, has yielded some interesting results." "You've been doing the same thing over and over again, a countless times the hero, villain, lover, creator, and destroyer of worlds. Do you not tire of it?" "You've asked me that, everyone's asked me that, a countless times as well. There is no way to answer that in terms you'd understand." "I suppose we are at an impasse, what say you to opening a case of beer and watching a sunset?" "That sounds splendid."
