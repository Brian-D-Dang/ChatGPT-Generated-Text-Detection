Post-game, it should be the loser's decision to initiate congratulations, handshakes, declarations of "good game," etc. The winner can then reciprocate, and should. If the winner initiates this, it can come across as rubbing it in, especially if it was a painful loss, or if the game was decided by dumb luck, or if the loser in some sense "should" have won, or if the winner won only because the loser defeated himself. If the loser does not congratulate the winner or shake hands or whatnot, it is a display of poor sportsmanship, sure, but forgivably so. It's a minor infraction, because the winner has the emotional upper hand. His feelings are not in need of sparing. He should take no offense. If anything, he should take satisfaction in having defeated such a competitive opponent, who takes losses so hard he can't bring himself to congratulate his opponent in the immediate aftermath. The proper response of a winner to a loser who offers no congratulations is to also say nothing, to respect the competitive flames which are continuing to burn in the loser's soul. A winner initiating "good game" is a worse offense to the gods of sportsmanship than a loser neglecting to initiate "good game." Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
