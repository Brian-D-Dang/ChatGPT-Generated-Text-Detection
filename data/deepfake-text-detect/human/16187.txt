For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the deterministic Turing machine is used. The time required by a deterministic Turing machine M on input x is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer yes" or "no. A Turing machine M is said to operate within time f (n), if the time required by M on each input of length n is at most f (n). A decision problem A can be solved in time f (n) if there exists a Turing machine operating in time f (n) that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time f (n) on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME (f (n.
