Because the consoles are simply too weak. So the game developer has to choose between better graphics or higher fps. Often they choose the better graphics as they want the game to look good to sell. If you want the best of both worlds, you have to move over to a PC, where you can both have higher graphics than the consoles and at the same time run the game at higher fps. Today it should be unacceptable for a game to only run at 30 fps, but it seems console players don't really care.
