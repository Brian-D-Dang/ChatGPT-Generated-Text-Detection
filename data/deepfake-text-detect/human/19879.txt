Men and women operate differently and it's a constant cause of conflict. If you don't see it in your own relationships, you'll see it in others or at least hear about it online in places like this. The truth is that there's no more justification for reading a smutty romance novel (like 50 shades of grey) than there is for a guy looking at porn. And I don't want to hear anything about masturbation because even if a woman doesn't masturbate to their novels, that doesn't mean they don't get off just as much in comparison. Men and wormen just work differently that way.
