To give things a little context: I am black and rap is the only genre of music that I actively dislike. I've tried to enjoy rap many times but have yet to find anything I like. My latest attempt was Kendrick Lamar but I couldn't listen all the way through. There's one exception, and that's cLOUDEAD (which is, of course, three white guys, and only adds to the idea that maybe I'm racist) I've come up with many excuses for myself about why I don't enjoy this genre, such as 1. I don't like the lyricssubject matter. (This one makes no sense because there are rap songs about many different topics). 2. Rap is too aggressive for me to enjoy. (Obviously untrue because I enjoy metal). 3. There aren't enough "pretty sounds" in rap songs and that's why I don't enjoy them (Not true, because I enjoy instrumental hip-hop and instrumentals of rap tracks). The truth seems to be that whenever I attempt to listen to rap I get really uncomfortable and need to turn it off. I'm not positive where the uncomfortable feeling comes from, but my first thought is that it's based on much of societies negative feelings towards rap music and the people who listen to it, and some kind of need to distance myself from that culture. Which would make me racist and a "race traitor," maybe. I don't want to be either of those, but can think of no other reason for being uncomfortable. Please CMV?
