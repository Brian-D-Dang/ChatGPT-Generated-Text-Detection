I just saw something on the frontpage about spending four years rehabilitating a turtle. Granted, this species is endangered. However, I've seen cases of people doing this before with other animals - there's a family who "rehabilitates" deer in my town, which enrages me because of how common deer are, how their overpopulation decimates other species in the area, and how many people are injured or killed in collisions with these pests every year. I get that as humans we have warm fuzzies when we help out animals, particularly mammals. But I feel like sometimes this just isn't worth it. Why sink tons of money, time, and effort into saving injured owls or squirrels? I can understand going to extraordinary measures for pets because of the emotional attachment. I can understand going out of your way to save individuals from endangered species. But I think that doing this for common species fulfills a two-fold disservice in making the species as a whole weaker by preserving the injured individuals and wasting money and time.
