I believe that if alcohol and other drugs are used in a way that does not impact the major facets of your life, the facets you want to remain untouched by them, it is harmless. When I say harmless I am not talking about harming my health, unless that harm prevents me from living the rest of my life how I want to. I mean harming things such as relationships, losing my job, getting a DUI. If I'm a heroin junky that contracted HIV because I couldn't hold off long enough to find a clean needle that's harmless. If I can't feed myself or my family properly because I just had to have one more line that's harmful. If I can't maintain my grades because I party too hard all week long that's harmful. However if I were making good grades etc, I don't see a problem. I see drugs and alcohol as a calculated risk, the same kind of risk I would take if I went skydiving or bull fighting. There are potentially harmful aspects to it, but until those aspects have become so great that they are taking away from the rest of my life, I don't see them as a problem. If I went dirt-bike riding so recklessly I injured my arm and couldn't work, I see that as an equally poor decision as drinking so much that I couldn't make it to work in the morning when the time came. Both of those examples are bad ideas and unacceptable in my mind. The only difference was one was done with a substance I used, the other was done by the situation I put myself in. Why, if done responsibly, should I hold back on using drugs and alcohol? As long as ends are being met to my satisfaction, why should I not spend my recreational time highdrunkwhatever?
