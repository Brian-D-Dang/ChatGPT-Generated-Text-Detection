I love Sweet Tomato. This place is always first choice for my mom. There salad bar is so tasty with different vegetables, fruits and salads. Often there are new combinations available. Recently, they added premium choices to the salad bar. I'm not a fan because I always get edamame when I go, and now it's 2.49 in the premium section and you only get 1 serving, so make it good. I was quite bummed. But, I love Sweet Tomato too much to stop going. The mac and cheese here is so creamy and good! I always eat more than 3 bowls of mac and cheese. The soups taste very fresh. Most of the time I get the chicken noodle and just eat the fresh egg noodles. My mom loves clam chowder and broccoli cheddar. The pizza bread is baked just right- the bread has a nice crunch while being soft. The price is not that bad if you get your money's worth. They have senior and military discounts too. The service is great too. They are always willing to help. My sister brought her baby one day and they seated us where we wouldn't be in the way of those passing by with the baby chair. The workers came around often and cleared our table, so we could indulge in even more tastiness. At one point they walk around and give everyone complimentary cookies. Although the new premium menu is a bummer, I will not turn down a trip here.
