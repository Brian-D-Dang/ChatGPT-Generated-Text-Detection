It genuinely upsets me that stores are open at all on Thanksgiving. I'm not happy with it, but if they want to open at 5AM the day after Thanksgiving, fine. Thanksgiving itself is not a religious holiday, it's an AMERICAN holiday - everyone celebrates it. We should let all Americans be home with their families, or friends, or home getting drunk watching Ghostbusters (however they want to spend their holiday). It should be a day where people appreciate what they have, and should NOT be an excuse for stores to have extra sales. Additionally, I think it's criminal to force employees to work at 5PM on Thanksgiving day, precluding them from spending time with anyone they might love. CMV. EDIT: My gripe is mostly with stores that are opening on Thanksgiving (ahem, Walmart) and will not let their employees call in sick or take the day off. Opening ON Thanksgiving is a new phenomenon (I don't remember stores doing it before a year or two ago). I think if you WANT to work on Thanksgiving and make time-and-a-half, sure, go for it. I think it's unfair to force employees to work on Thanksgiving Day when they may have other family obligations to attend to.
