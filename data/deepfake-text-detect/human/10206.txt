Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same. His views on immigration would not only alienate the countries south and north of the border, essentially saying they can't be trusted not to "send" their criminals here, but it would make us look paranoid to the rest of the world. People can come to the U.S. as tourists from several countries, not just Mexico, completely legally. They then can slip into the sea of people and stay, illegally. The problem with illegal immigration is much more complex than he seems to realize. The man has no foreign policy experience. Boardroom deals with businessmen and bureaucrats from another country does not equate to nation-to-nation diplomacy. His national defense ideas that I've heard seem to amount to, "more guns and let's tell other countries to screw off." The Democrats' stance that the rich want to influence policy to get richer does not exclude Donald Trump. Who is to say he wouldn't endorse policies that would make it easier for both him and his kids to double their fortune? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
