I think its morally evil to buy and sell property, and that its pathetic that we as a species have allowed this practice to continue. My specific view is that no one owns this land. Specifically mad at laws set in place forbidding "trespassing" etc. now if you and your neighbor wanna pretend to trade for land I don't mind that act, but you have no right to shoot me if I enter the same neck of the woods. Edit: Really disappointed its like nobody can comprehend the idea, now that may be partially my fault, I'm not perfect at explaining but I thought I wrote quite enough.
