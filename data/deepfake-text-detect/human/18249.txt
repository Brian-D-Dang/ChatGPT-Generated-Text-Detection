Karma exists. I'm not a believer in any religion, but I believe that karma exists. The definition of karma is that the past and present actions of an individual will ultimately determine their future experiencefate. It's basically what goes around comes around. If a person decides to screw you over, that person will ultimately suffer the same amount (if not more) for the things heshe did. And I'm sure we've all experienced it. We never actually consciously think about it but you know it's there when it happens. For example, if someone donated a million dollars to some homeless man and laters win the lottery, we may think that he deserved it because he did something good. On the other hand, if someone kills another, he will ultimately be in jail when caught. So karma doesn't have to be necessarily instant. It's just there and it's no coincidence. It's just waiting for the right time to strike. CMV Edit: Guys thank you very much for all your responses. I'm not trying to be a douche or anything. I just wanted to start a discussion and if anyone is offended, I sincerely apologize.
