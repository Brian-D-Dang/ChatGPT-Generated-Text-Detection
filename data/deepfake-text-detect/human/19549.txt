Most of my argument is based on observations of some of the more populated cultures (Indian, Chinese, American, etc.) I think my belief has a basis in how nearly every human society sticks to some degree of 'tradition' when it comes to social gender differentiation. Such cultural conditioning based on hard-dying traditional values has since lead to norms where women are typically much more free to express their emotions relative to men. I mean this in the sense that creating more open emotional connections is more socially accepted and widely 'conditioned' among women than men. As an arbitrary example to gauge emotional acceptance in society, I am convinced that in the aforementioned societies, a man crying in public is considered more shameful than a woman crying in public. Besides having more social allowance to express and connect emotionally with other women, I also believe that due to a woman's hormonal cycle, emotion has more of a possibility of influencing decisions. So because of this combination of natural biology and social conditioning, I believe that women (at least when it comes to cultures found in the US and such) are more reliant on emotion than men in decision making.
