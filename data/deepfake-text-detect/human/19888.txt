The US has the biggest, most integrated free-market economy in the world. I know it is not perfect but it seems like the best option at the moment. Where are all the new technological breakthroughs coming from? US Where is the largest native-English speaking populous? US Which country has the most diverse set of landscapes and cultures? US With over 300m people speaking the same language in the same geographic location, the chances of finding a niche group willing to buy your product seems to be much higher. As well as the diversity of politics and laws, you can travel from state to state and experience all this diversity without so much as a change of clothes (EU: New language, often new govt id etc...)
