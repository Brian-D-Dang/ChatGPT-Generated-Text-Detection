When you want to edit something using an online tool today, you usually have to upload the file to the tool by selecting the file or dragging it into your browser window, then when you're finished you have to download the result to get the finished copy. Google and Mozilla want to create a standard that will allow you to select files directly from your browser, edit them, then save them without any of the uploading and downloading that happens now. This sounds really nifty, but could potentially be abused by nefarious sites. This "Writable Files API" is still in the early design stages at the W3C Web Incubator Community Group (WICG), which is chaired by representatives from Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
