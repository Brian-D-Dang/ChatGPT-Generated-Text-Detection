The computation of the order of Frobenius action on the l -torsion is a part of Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm for point counting on an elliptic curve E over a finite field F q. The idea of Schoof's algorithm is to compute the trace of Frobenius t modulo primes l and restore it by the Chinese remainder theorem. Atkin's improvement consists of computing the order r of the Frobenius action on E [ l ] and of restricting the number t (mod l) to enumerate by using the formula t 2 q (z z - 1) 2 (mod l). Here z is a primitive r -th root of unity. In this paper, we generalize Atkin's formula to the general case of abelian variety of dimension g. Classically, finding of the order r involves expensive computation of modular polynomials. We study the distribution of the Frobenius orders in case of abelian surfaces and q 1 (mod l) in order to replace these expensive computations by probabilistic algorithms.
