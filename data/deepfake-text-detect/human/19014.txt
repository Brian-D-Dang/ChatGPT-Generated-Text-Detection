I fully believe that society as we know it will not last beyond the middle point of this century. The economy keeps getting worse and any and all alternatives to capitalism are impractical. People will never become more longsighted and cooperative than they are right now, which is not very. The environment is irreversibly damaged and the rich and powerful will keep on destroying it and since most of them are elderly, they will laugh themselves to the grave as everyone else is raped, eaten and starved. I have struggled with loneliness all my life and always had trouble connecting to people (a near decade of bullying severed my connection to the human race). I had very few friends and never had a relationship at the age of 33. However, that might be a blessing in disguise. If I were to pursue a relationship, that would mean I would have a family to defend. I want the freedom to be able to kill myself when the chaos erupts. If I had a family, I would be bound to a hellish world (the only alternative would be murder suicide, which I could never do). I have never mentioned this to anyone and I hope someone can convince me otherwise. Please help me. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
