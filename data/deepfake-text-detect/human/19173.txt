Players are choosing to harm their bodies, and the fans get to enjoy watching records get broken. All around, it seems that people benefit the way they want to. I'm also against the natural argument; as in, people don't like PEDs because they aren't natural. The fact is, players were cheating by using spitballs and taking other illicit drugs. If PEDs were this effective back in the day of Babe Ruth, I bet he would have used. I think that the idea of people using PEDs needs to become more widely accepted before baseball and other sports can continue on for much longer. EDIT 1: I want to clarify that I mean take away all bans against substances. So players can inject HGH and get away with it. ucoolsoundingme brought up using meth, which for the sake of this argument, I say we allow anything that can be prescribed by a doctor (and since methamphetamine is considered Schedule II, it is included in this).
