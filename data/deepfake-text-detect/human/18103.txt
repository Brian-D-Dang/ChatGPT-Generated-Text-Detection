I have been researching the GFC lately, and since it's a pretty complex topic I have only just come to understand it properly. I have heard Libertarians and conservative politicians claim that too much regulation caused the GFC, and that if there had been lower regulatory standards the market would still be standing. This sounds like absolute bull to me, given the practices of the big players in the financial markets during the 2000's and 1990's, but I'd like to hear an articulate counterpoint if anyone can give one.
