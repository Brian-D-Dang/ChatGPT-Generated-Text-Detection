I was extremely disappointed when ordering pizza from this place. The girl that rang up our order said it would be 20-25 minutes for our pizza and garlic knots to be done. We sat down to wait. After 45 minutes of waiting my husband went up to inquire about our food. They said the pizza was still in the oven. We were so irritated that we asked for a refund and then left. We never got to even try the pizza, but with customer service like that I'm sure the food isn't much better. I will never order pizza from here again.
