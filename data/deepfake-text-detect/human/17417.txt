I've seen comments advocating anarchy as being preferable to having a state government regulate things. I can understand the frustration with the bureaucracy of the state, but the alternative, I feel, would be much, much worse. Lawlessness would run rampant. Infrastructure, especially interstate highways, would be neglected and fall into disrepair. Can anybody tell me what practical benefits this political ideology has besides the rejection of a social contract? I'd say I have a libertarian slant personally, I'm a US citizen, and I strongly disagree with my government on its spending and foreign policies. However anarchy would breed chaos, apathy, and selfishness in my opinion.
