First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't change the fact that the laws exist, and are the basis of my argument. For the people who do get uncomfortable around nude breasts, a single father with his adolescent daughter, or a mother with a teenage son, or even some old stick in the mud curmudgeon, I don't think it's too much to ask to handle such things in private. Whether pumping milk, or nursing at home, there are ways of handling these things. No one else is obligated to accommodate public nudity. If it's not "convenient" for them, that's all part of the sacrifice of parenthood. Edit: Thanks for the heaps of downvotes everyone. This thread is over. Hello, users of CMV!
