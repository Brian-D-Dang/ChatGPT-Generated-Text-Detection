I get it, those memes are often only used for karma-whoring and cheap attention. Yes, they're usually racistbigotedetc and I personally think they're annoying. But I also think that the mods did the wrong thing by enforcing an artificial ban on them. CB and PUP were both incredibly popular and well-loved. I know a lot of folks complained, but these were simply a loud minority. My argument rests with one simply fact: These memes got routinely upvoted to the top, meaning more people enjoyed them than didn't. Isn't that what AdviceAnimals is for? To make easily digestible memes that are enjoyable to the greater population? So what reasonable justification was there to for the ban? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
