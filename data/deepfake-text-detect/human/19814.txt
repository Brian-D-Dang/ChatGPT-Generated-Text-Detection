There isn't an accurate definition of "spirituality" but I define it as: "of the spirit" and the spirit to me is to be separate from the body in the sense of a soul. So a spiritual feeling should be one that is deeper than emotional, and one that transcends emotional feeling which is what I understand other's refer to their "spiritual experiences" as but I regard as deeply emotional. To put it blunt, I believe it is ridiculous to define an experience as spiritual in the sense that it was felt of the spirit and not ofjust of the emotion. I will need a logical basis to change my view. I would personally like to hear other's anecdotal experiences that they define as spiritual.
