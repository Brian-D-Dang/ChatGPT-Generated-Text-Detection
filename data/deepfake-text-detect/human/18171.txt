Hunting mammals is only ethical when the person doing it needs to do it to survive or not suffer (e.g. experiencing severe although not life threatening hunger). If there are any other options than to kill, those should be pursued instead. All mammals can feel pain, and coming from a utilitarian viewpoint, any suffering is bad if the pros don't outweigh the cons. Yes, hunters do get some enjoyment out of it, but I hardly think that their happiness outweighs the pain of a gunshot wound. I do however place the life and wellbeing of humans over animals, which is why if it is ever necessary, humans can ethically kill and eat animals. Hunting should not be done as a means to merely increase food supplies either because it is very possible to live a healthy life without the consumption of meat. My view boils down to that it is only ethical to kill out of necessity, so if anyone could elaborate on some reasons why it would be ethical to kill without needing to I would genuinely like to hear them. Lastly, I don't only want reasons why hunting without necessity is ethical, but also reasons why hunting is never ethical. Edit: My view has been changed when invasive and over all harmful species are taken into account, but there's still room to change my view about non-invasive, non-harmful species.
