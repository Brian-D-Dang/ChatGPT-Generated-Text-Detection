Being the college freshmen that I am, I have very recent experience with the financial side to college. I have noticed it is very hard for upper middle class students to find ways to fund college. Schools give out little grants to them and the government gives out even less. This, however, is justified in my opinion. There is only so much to give out. On the other hand I found private scholarships to be the most frustrating. Every single one that I applied for was "based on financial need." My academic and philanthropic resume didn't matter. All that was looked at was how much my parents made. I am not suggesting that I should attend college for free. I shouldn't. However, there should be more ways for middle class students to help aid them. Many times poorer students get money from the school and government, and then from private scholarships. I believe there should be better ways for middle class students to find scholarship money to help them pay for college. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
