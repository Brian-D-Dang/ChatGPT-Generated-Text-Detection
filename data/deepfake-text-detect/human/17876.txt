I have heard both sides of the argument, and I really feel like getting vaccinated is the best thing for your health. I'll give you a personal example. Three years ago, I got mono and it was one of the worst experiences ever. Following that, I got sick multiple times. The next fall season, I got a flu shot, and I did not get sick at all that year.
