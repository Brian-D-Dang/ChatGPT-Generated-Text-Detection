We can predict earthquakes, just not with any certainty at all. Earthquakes aren't just the motion of the plates, they have friction between them, and the forces build over time until it finally slips all at once, causing an earthquake. The exact moment that that will happen is based on way too many variables. imagine putting a stack of books on your desk, and you push on the books lightly, and they don't move until they finally do. In that scenario, you can calculate the coefficient of friction pretty easily to figure out how much pressure must be applied before it moves, but to do the same with tectonic plates you would need a lot more information. All we know is that there is pressure building and at some point in this range of time (be it years or decades) it will build to the point that it moves. Over the course of millions of years, we can say that the sum of these motions averages out to a specific velocity, but since it doesn't happen smoothly, we can't say that the next building and releasing of pressure will occur at a specific time.," "We're missing a key point of information. We have no real way of measuring the pressure along a fault line, nor do we have an accurate way to predict exactly how much pressure is needed to slip. Each time it slips, there are new faces touching each other, interacting in a new way, that may bear more or less pressure before slipping.
