I see two reasons to read the newspaper: to learn what is going on in the world so they can make changes and for recreation. Since, I don't enjoy reading the newspaper and I don't believe I have the capacity to make meaningful changes, I believe that reading the news is a waste of my time. On a local level I agree that following the news is important. However, on a national and particularly international level I have a minimal impact. One example is the upcoming fight over the debt ceiling in the US. Regardless of what I want I cannot influence my representative's vote, because this is a such a polarized issue everyone is voting on party lines. Knowing about this event influences my future voting, but I don't actually need to know the details. I only need to know which representatives voted against my wishes so I can try to get them unelected. Internationally, there are events like the civil war in Syria. Knowing this war exists I can choose to send aid. However, knowing the intricate details of the event are irrelevant to my life and don't impact my ability to help Syria. Since I have a larger impact on local issues and I have limited time it is more efficient to spend my limited time on local issues. Given that my focus is on local issues, my news consumption should also be on local issues. There's also the argument from apathy. I just want to keep my head down and live my life. I don't see how understanding the debt problems Greece faces has any impact on my life. Granted, the debt crisis in Greece affects the US economy, which affects my life. However, knowing about the debt crisis doesn't. Reading the newspaper does not change how Greece's debt crisis affects my life.
