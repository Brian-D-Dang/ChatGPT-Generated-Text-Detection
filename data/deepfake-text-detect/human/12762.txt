"Karen, I'm sorry," I spoke above the sound of scraping metal against the door as we inched forward. "I had no other choice. I love you." The color was almost completely absent from her face; she'd lost too much blood. As I reached over to brush the hair out of her eyes, she glanced up one last time and whispered, "It's not your fault." The vehicle let go from the cliffs edge and began it's decent into the abyss. All I wanted for her was a chance, but I've failed again. I always fail. Why? I shouldn't have chanced the mountains in this weather. Another flash of my lives passing before me; the memories that I can never relive or forget, blinding me from what's coming. I should have tried to change this one, to break the cycle.

I've lost thousands of those that I love, but where are they now if not repeating life as I am? I see it now. The light is drawing me on. It will be some time before I can speak again, but I'll soon remember everything. For now a time of peace, love, and fear awaits me in birth. edit: changed a "he" to "I"
