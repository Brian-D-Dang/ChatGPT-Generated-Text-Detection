Taking a biologist's standpoint: The notion that both sexes are and should be equal is ridiculous. Men are typically physically superior to women and more ambitious than women. However with that responsibility, women are better nurtured and cared for while men do the dirty work. While both genders look envious towards each other regarding rights and responsibilities, it's for the best. MRA's and Feminists alike support having an equal mandatory draft for both sexes (Feminists probably to keep up the strong independent woman attitude). The idea that we could theoretically rip women from their hair salons (not stereotyping, just an example) for a equal sex draft is absurd. Men protect women, it's always been like that and it always should be.
