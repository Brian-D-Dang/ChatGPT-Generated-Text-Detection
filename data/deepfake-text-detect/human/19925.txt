As the title says. I'm just curious of what reasons there could be to not have a standard with publicly traded companies across the globe and in companies (public or not) that work internationally (excluding companies that ship internationally). To clarify: I do know there is an international standard, but the be traded on the global market you do not have to adhere to them (US for example has GAAP but doesn't use the international standard)
