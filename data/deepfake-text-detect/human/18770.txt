I know the title is horribly worded and I apologize in advance. I do not condonesupport hitting women. i just don't see why we almost glorify or completely support a woman hitting a man or any other physical violence against men. shouldn't we just try to make all forms of abuse, attacks, etc immoral, despite the victim's gender? i get the whole "women aren't as physically stronger as men" but is that always correct? not all men are 6 feet tall and capable of lifting a refrigerator. some men, such as myself, are actually quite small and relatively weak (which could be why i think this). that doesn't mean i'm going to go punch the next female i see, i just feel that instead of living this double standard, we'd be better off telling society hitting anyone is immoral. for the record, i've never hit a girl or a guy. i've never been in a fist fight. and quite honestly, i worry about the feedback for this submission because i feel like a shitty person even asking this question but it is something that has bothered me for a while.
