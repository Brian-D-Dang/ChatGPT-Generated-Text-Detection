The argument is basically this: say during a famine, in a certain area, 100 children are saved by foreign aid. Those 100 children will grow up, and have an average of 2-3 children each. This will cause a population surge and, with too many people to feed, the area will go into famine again, inciting more foreign aid. Repeat the cycle until you get a population that is dependent on foreign aid to survive. If an area can only support a population of 10,000 there should only be that many people there. Instead of feeding Developing nations, Developed nations should focus more on education and sex ed in those areas.
