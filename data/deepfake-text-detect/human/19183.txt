As it applies to the Bible, God created everything and afterward He states that He saw that it was good (implying initial order). On the other hand, modern day science offers us the theory that the big bang exploded (chaos) and it slowly developed into life (order) we see today. To put my theory into smaller terms, I think of it this way. If I just cleaned my house, I have put it into order, the same as God did in the begging, but over time, I misplace things and trash the place until it eventually becomes more and more disorderly. No matter how much time goes on my house will not clean and reorganize its self. I have to make a conscience effort to get my house back to its original order I set it in.
