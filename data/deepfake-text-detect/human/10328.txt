View changed by a combination of the comments of uceleritas365 and uQwerkss: I guess we all understand numbers differently, but ultimately I think it really is lack of empathy more than interpretation of numbers directly. I personally could empathize more, but perhaps it's not just the days but also considering the age of someone as they're getting out, how much of their lives was taken, and how different a person they might be. Inspired a little bit from responding to [this post here] , I think as a society we should really start thinking of imprisonment and announcing sentences in terms of days, not years. In terms of using sentences as a means of discouraging crime, the number 5 sounds small, but 5 years is actually 1826 days (including a leap year), which is a massive number. When you start talking about locking someone away for decades, and you realize actually the thousands and thousands of days you're taking away from person, and if that punishment really does match the severity of the crime.... I don't think people actually have the capacity to imagine being sat in a small barred room day after day for that long. They just hear 7 years and think "Oh it's only 7," and fail to recognize just how much of someone's life is actually being taken away. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
