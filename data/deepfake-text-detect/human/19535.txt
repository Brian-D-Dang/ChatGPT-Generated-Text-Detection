Attention My View has been changed. Stop Replying Anyone who takes it upon themselves and makes the decision to drink and drive or text or talk on the phone should be shot at the time of the accident. I don't mean should as in a law, more like an unwritten law that everyone follows. Also, you should be hit with heavy fines and or jail time that fits the situation. We should scare people out of doing these things and shaming them when it occurs. Im sick of seeing some asshole on their phone just texting away looking down obliviously veering into my lane then jerking away. I know this is wrong i just don't feel that a warning or even a ticket means anything when you could have killed somebody
