I came to Metro Pizza on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Las Vegas. This place is good. The service was fast and the prices were reasonable. My daughter and I split a Honolulu Pizza. My wife ordered Eggplant Parm. The food was served promptly, and even though we were seated in the back of the restaurant, we were not ignored. The next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be back.
