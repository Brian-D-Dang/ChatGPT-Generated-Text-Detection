What you first defined (2,4,6,8,23) didn't have a clear rule that determined it. If you can find a rule linking those numbers, its a pattern. Otherwise, you just said a bunch of random numbers," "A pattern is just a regular, repeatable thing. Whether it's incrementing numbers, a behaviour, changing colors, etc., the key component of a pattern is that repeating the action results in a predictable outcome. The reason we can predict the next number in a sequence is because we have enough evidence from the previous numbers in a sequence to know what the relationship between those numbers is. The only way to add a number to that sequence is by ensuring that the next number fits the relationship exactly, making it part of the pattern. What you've posted isn't a pattern precisely because it lacks predictability; there's no clearly defined relationship between the first few numbers and 23. Now, if the sequence continued 25, 27, 29, 31, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54.... now we have a pattern of repeated behaviour and we can predict the next number to be 69.," " What is happening in these cases? How does a brain look at a set of events and predict with some reliability what will happen next? Play a video of someone throwing a ball and pause it halfway through. You've seen it fly in a line halfway across the field, and you know that it will continue to fly in that line the rest of the way.,Pattern is something that repeats across space and or time. For example, in the sequence: 2, 4, 6, 8,... what is repeating there? Firstly, even numbers. And secondly, the difference between consecutive numbers. So if we want to expand the sequence while not breaking the pattern, we add a 10.','Clearly the pattern you are using is 2x 13 (x-1) (x-2) (x-3) (x-4) 24 It is not the most common pattern in the world, but it is pretty obvious.
