I have attended a Tony Robbins event, have watched YouTube videos, and have listened to recordings and I have to say, I genuinely don't understand what other people are getting out of this stuff. At the event I was attending, I had one of those "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills" moments. Lots of people feel passionately about this kind of stuff, and swear it's changed their lives, but I felt like I was at a middle school pep rally. Jumping up and down and dancing and getting into awkward situations with strangers and having someone tell me I can do it doesn't make me feel like I can do it. And there doesn't seem to be anything valuable in any of these soundbites and inspiring quotes... just buzzwords. Edit: I also feel that, at least at the Tony Robbins event, there were a lot of "absolutes," and especially in his handling of gender roles and relationships, I felt like these black and white kind of absolutes ended up making most of his conclusions sounds incredibly sexist. What am I missing here, Reddit??
