I've always know about what happened to the Hindenburg, but I never knew that it was a Nazi airship until today. If it were a different group of people on the airship then I would have more compassion for the victims of the crash but since the Nazis did such horrible things to millions of innocent people, why should I feel bad if they die? Wouldn't this be kind of good for the Allies anyways? And also, I understand that the ship was supposed to touchdown in new Jersey. Why would the US- a member of the Allies who are against the Nazis and the Axis- allow one of their blimps to land in the United States? So to summarize: The Nazis were cruel, why should we feel sorry for them? (Main Question) Why did the US allow them to land in our country anyways? Edit: Good points. I didn't realize that the nazis were just the government at the time. Thanks!
