When choosing a career path, I've heard a thousand times that you should follow your dreams instead of playing it safe. People also say that you should be yourself and that you shouldn't do things to fit in. If I followed that advice I'd quit studying computer science to become an avant-garde multimedia digital artist because that's what I want to do. I'd start wearing weird T-shirts with obscure internet subculture references on them. In conversation I'd come across as quirky, free-spirited and abhorrently nerdy because that's who I want to be. That is my personality. Here's my view: given that my personality (what I like and want) is probably weird because there is something wrong with me, I shouldn't express it. If I wanted to start eating my feces or murdering people I'd go to the doctors because there are some things that we are obviously not supposed to want. We all have to ignore the things we want sometimes, like putting the biscuits back before you eat whole pack. I think if I stop procrastinating on the internet and try harder to enjoy mainstream things I'll eventually be normal and it will be a lot less embarrassing for everyone. EDIT: SOLVED As a couple of people have mentioned now, I don't have to be myself all the time and that there is a time and a place for it. In a way, I still think I was right because you have to discern which parts of your personality you reveal in different contexts. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
