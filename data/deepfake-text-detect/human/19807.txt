Parallel parking requires an awareness of the geometry of your vehicle, its turning radius, the sensitivity of its acceleration and brakes, and the ability to combine these skills to maneuver in a precise manner. These are all skills which are integral to the general safe operation of a motor vehicle, and I feel that if you cannot demonstrate them, you shouldn't be allowed to drive regardless of whether you will ever actually have to parallel park in the real world. These skills become even more important when driving an unfamiliar vehicle, and in my state a basic drivers license allows you to drive a vehicle or vehicletrailer combination up to 13 tons. I feel it is a massive risk to public safety to allow someone to drive a 26 foot Uhaul, with significantly reduced visibility and unfamiliar geometry, who can't even parallel park their own car which they are familiar with. So, Reddit, CMV. EDIT: In my state, failing the parallel parking portion of the exam takes points off your score but does not fail the exam. EDIT 2: A lot of you are failing to see my point. The tl;dr: The ability or requirement to parallel park in normal everyday driving is completely irrelevant to this CMV. The CMV is about the fact that the skills required to parallel park are also required to safely operate a motor vehicle in situations that are not parallel parking. The CMV is that those skills are important, not parallel parking itself, it's just that parallel parking is a convenient way to demonstrate those skills on a driver's exam.
