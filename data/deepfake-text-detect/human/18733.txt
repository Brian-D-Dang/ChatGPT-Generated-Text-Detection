Here are some of my points. I don't have sources right now but I know I've heard these facts before and could provide sources upon request: 1. The cost to make a penny and nickel is over twice it's face value. 2. Pennies are a complete waste of time to deal with. Advocates for the penny may claim it will save us a couple cents from having to round to the nearest 5 cents. My time wasted messing with pennies is worth more than the couple of cents I may save by using them. 3. Pennies are literally worth nothing in today's economy. What can you buy for a penny? For this reason alone we should abolish the penny. The US government got rid of the half penny a while ago when it was worth even more than the current value of a penny (adjusted for inflation).
