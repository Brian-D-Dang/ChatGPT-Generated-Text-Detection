Hi. I believe that starting all the way since WW2, the US has been taking its responsibility as athe superpower to try to stabilize, improve and make allies with countries around the world, maybe not purely for altruistic reasons, but definitely not just monetary gains. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars were not to get cheaper oil or extract minerals, but to hunt down the origin of terrorist groups and because they genuinely (and maybe incompetently) thought that Iraq had WMDs. The drone strikes to the north african countries and the middle east were because they genuinely thought it would assist the rebels, who the US naively thought had democratic, progressive intentions in mind. The US armed the Mujahideen to defend themselves and stop the spread of the Soviet. AND so on, and so forth. Change my view about any of these, or show me that I'm being naive. Is this a commonly occurring hypothesis? I'm not from america and I don't listen to the american political right-vs-left diarrhea radio shows. Hello, users of CMV!
