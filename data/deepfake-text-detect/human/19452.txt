Thanks to the voting gender gap , the US has had a majority of female voters in general since about 1980. In a representative democracy, the voters determine legislators who decide on law and policy. The US (and many other western nations) have a first-past-the-post voting system (predominantly), so any minority voting factions literally have no say in representation. Women, being the majority, have literally ruled the US in terms of representative selection since 1980. Possible arguments I will preemptively address: 1) Representatives are still men. True, but it's women who are choosing to put them there. For instance, Obama may not have won without strong support from women. 2) Men still control most of the wealth. True, but in terms of raw political power, which is what is being discussed here, women are still in charge. 3) Men could conceivably outvote women if they organized. True. And we could conceivably live forever if we uploaded our brains into the "cloud." Please, let's deal in reality here. The voting gap is a trend that's consistent and growing. In terms of raw numbers, it has to happen. Women usually outnumber men in terms of population. There are also more men of substandard intelligence than women as intelligence research tells us. So the pool of women voters should always be larger than the pool of male voters.
