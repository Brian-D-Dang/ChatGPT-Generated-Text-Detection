While I can understand that a government has a duty to protect jobs, I don't believe they do anyone any favors by protecting business models. For example, I don't believe that the recent banning of Tesla motors from New Jersey is anything positive. Rather than taking a positive approach (ie. provide incentives for electric vehicle manufacturing to happen in New Jersey), they've attempted to protect existing auto manufacturers and squash new (and probably better) technology. This is not how innovation happens or how we've made advances to get us to our current technological world. This is not the only case, of course. There have been many other attempts at protecting business models and none of them support advancing technology or making things better in the long run for people. There are similar situations in pharmacological inventions, in power generation, etc. I can't think of a single situation when this sort of business model protection has ultimately made things better for anyone except those being protected. Is there more to this? CMV please.
