They are AWESOME! Tammie the owner and her awesome assistant walked me through buying, having and maintaining chickens. I bought my chicken coop, a couple chicks, organic feed, water food and feed containers. That was a few months ago and things are great! I am so thankful for this feed store! Never been to better!
