I disagree with much of what Heidegger wrote, but I do consider an ontological point-of-no-return (in which life could be said as "not worth living" anymore) to be worse than simple extinction, cessation of existence. This is not related to anything short-term. I'm not drawing a comparison to suicide vs. palliative care or anything like that. I just mean on a societal level, it is more important to sustain our current state of existence than to exist as beings devoid of vitality in all but the most literal sense of the word. For those who have done policy debate, this question immediately triggers a response. I've read all the cards, I understand the extreme arguments. I just want to be persuaded that this is a greater and worse impact on society.
