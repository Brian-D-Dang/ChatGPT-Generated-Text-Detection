My view is that there is no compelling reason (moral or otherwise) to have children that are genetically related to you, and that there are a lot of good reasons not to. If you're in a developed country (and probability is that you are) then every new person contributes to anthropogenic climate change. Bringing potential persons into the world is, at present, detrimental to actual persons. The environmental impact first world humans have is too negative to justify the creation of additional lives. Also, there are plenty of children who need a home and the support of a parental figure. By having a child, you are creating a resource drain and neglecting the needs of very real people that need those resources more than a non-existent person, or person in latency. The only reason I can see for having biological offspring is some sort of genetic narcissism; the belief that the world is so direly in need of your genes. Or it could be a desperate attempt to grasp some sort of immortality. Still, there is no compelling reason to have children of your own instead of adopting.
