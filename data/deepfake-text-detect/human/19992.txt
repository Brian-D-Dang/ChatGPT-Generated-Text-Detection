Bottom line, I am against deportation and for instant work visas. Police need to focus on matters involving criminal intent. Immigration is bureaucratic contract law blown completely out of proportion. In my opinion, our practice of punishing and deporting overloads our justice system in a way that harms all citizens. This is another example of legislation that creates criminals out of people not for harming someone else, but for failing to adhere to an arbitrary statute. I understand my opponents' position that, Mexican immigrants are too poor and we don't want more poor people in our cities. But I disagree with the assumptions that statement presents and think it's reckless to base law on them. If someone comes to this country there is a reason. And I'd like that reason on record. Immigrants should naturally want to announce themselves when entering America. As a taxpayer that's an office I don't mind contributing a few bucks to. However, not this institution of incarceration we have in place. America should be an open borders nation not because of what other nations have historically done. But because our system of law makes a distinction between civil and criminal which should be without exception.
