We went here for a girls night out dinner. We ordered 4 different dishes and all of us commented that all of our dishes were very salty (sea bass, duck, swordfish). The service was mediocre- the waitress lacked emotions and her voice was so quiet we could barely hear her the whole time. As for the sides, the waitress asked what would you like for your side? to all of us, and we thought they were included in the meal. Later when we got the bill, we found out that the sides were about 10 each. No complaints, they probably will say it's your fault for not looking at the prices on the menu but we felt that she should've asked instead of sounding like she's offering sides. The restaurant does have a romantic vibe though- the interior was nice. However for a 250 bill without any drinks and 4 very salty dishes, I wouldn't come back.
