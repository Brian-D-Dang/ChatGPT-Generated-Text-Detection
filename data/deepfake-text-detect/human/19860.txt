Look at the vitality of Florida's major metropolitan areas. They're at the top of technology, trade and commerce, and entertainment. I've been in this region my entre life, and even though we took a battering economy wise, it's disheartening. I know why my friends keep leaving the area, since it's nothing more than God's waiting room. To many sticks in the mud, you know? Tourism is an economic driver, bit it shouldn't be the only one. For the love of Pete, change my view before 2015! That may be my opportunity to hop off to Tampa Bay should I have the means to do so.
