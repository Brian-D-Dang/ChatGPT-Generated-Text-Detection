Thought about this for days, and I can't think of one aspect of the FPH community that made Reddit better: - They are ignorant: Proven by the overwhelming number of their threads that complained about their free speech being violated. Reddit isn't the government, free speech isn't a factor here. - They are hypocritical: The mods would ban anyone who stated things they disagreed with. And yet they get upset when they are banned themselves. - They are narrow-minded: Anyone who disagrees with them is assumed to be fat themselves. The idea that non-fat people could find what they say idiotic and lacking any value is completely foreign to them. I just can't think of any way in which my life, or Reddit was made better by FPH.
