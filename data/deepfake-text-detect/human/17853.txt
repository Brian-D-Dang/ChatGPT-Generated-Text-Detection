Coors light tastes like beer-flavored piss-water. Labatts tastes like a pond that 80-year-old canucks had sex in. Budweiser is for retards who don't know what beer is. But Yuengling is mass produced and... actually pretty good. It's not the best beer, mind you. It's good, but it's not like, king of beers or anything. Craft brews are getting a lot of attention in recent years, especially in America, and a lot of beer snobs go to parties. These guys are not easy to please, but they will settle for Yuengling. It's just good enough to not offend, and just shitty enough to please the unwashed plebs. Change my view.
