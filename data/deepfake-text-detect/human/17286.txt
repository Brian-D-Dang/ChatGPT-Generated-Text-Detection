Normally my politics are extremely left leaning, and I always give struggling people the benefit of the doubt. However, my sympathy is harshly reduced when someone takes an already limited budget and sets aside money for food, drugs, or tobacco products. Note the occasional expenditure on a vice is not a problem. A drink at the bar every once and a while or a joint to take the edge off is great; we all have to let loose every once and a while (arguably even more so with poor people, because their lives are by and large very difficult). My issue is that I see many people who struggle to pay the rent, pay for food, and other basic needs (some of whom have kids, which makes it much worse) who set aside money for outrageously priced pack of cigarettes each week. In essence, my problem lies with the people who view these luxuries as just as important as bills, rent, and food. CMV Edit [uhuadpe] brought up some good points that I should add on. I did not properly address addiction. I realize these habits can be hard to kick and I do not expect someone to go cold turkey and stop overnight. However, I think these people should be actively trying to kick these addictions if it is eating into their primary survival expenditures. If anything of what i described is used to not fall into a worse addiction, such as smoking cigarettes to avoid heroin, I see that as a necessity, and a definite exception to what I am talking about.
