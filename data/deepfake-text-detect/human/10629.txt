I don't recall the source that I've heard this from, but I've read across it a few times. The long story short on this is that humans (or animals) are disgusted by things that could be potentially harmful. If it looks, smells, or feels bad, then it probably is bad and it's better of to avoid it. This is what keeps you from eating rotten food, going around diseased animals, or swimming in bad water. Of course, like all emotions, we have some control over it and the body should adapt over time, or other emotions and physical states will over ride your natural disgust. The best example of this is when one gets into a state of arousal, it clouds the judgement and lowers inhibition and things you find disgusting. This is why people often feel shame after sex or going too far, arousal wears off and your levels of acceptable disgust returns. Do it enough times, you become in sensitized to the act. As for people with trivial things that disgust them, I recall reading into some state of modern social development or lack of exposure to particular item. Since we are rarely forced to do anything anymore, when we find something that disgusts us we do not get forced to adapt.
