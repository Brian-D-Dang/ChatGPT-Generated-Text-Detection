At all. No exceptions. Crack addicts, single mothers, elderly widows, if you fall under the poverty line and need help, by all means, take what's offered. Using the so often cited single mother with four kids example, can you really justify letting her four kids starve because their mother's kind of a slut? The crack addict, if that welfare check keeps him from stealing shit to survive, isn't that a net gain for everyone? That guy sitting on his couch doing nothing? Just opened up a spot in your line of work that led to a decent salary. Even if we did somehow dream up a system that allowed us to weed out those abusing it, and they turned out to be the majority, what then? Do we cut them off, leave them to their own devices? Seems to me the only cost-effective option.
