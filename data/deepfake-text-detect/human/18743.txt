31 states have already made english their official language, not to mention countless other countries that have adopted an official language. Also, 87 of Americans believe english should be made the official language. This would also bring the US into conformity with the various government institutions, such as the military and court systems, that operate in english for practical reasons. Also, conducting business in multiple languages has potential to cause conflict and cost tremendous amounts. The language barrier is still a barrier, and divides us as a people.
