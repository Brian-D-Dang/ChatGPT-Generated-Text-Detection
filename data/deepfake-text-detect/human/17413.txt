First off, this is not an attempt at a "gotcha" or anything of the sort aimed at people who use a privilege model. I am aiming for reasonable discourse here. You don't have to have to completely rock my world - I will award a CMV to anyone who can sufficiently "fill me in" if that makes sense. My father is a state trooper. I've learned it's no secret that some officers treat and investigate black Americans differently from white Americans. I think this is a clear, almost undeniable example of how a white person enjoys a certain, de facto privilege in America. Some people would extend this further - gays, minorities, and even women lack many of the privileges of the proverbial straight white male, they would say. However, when we look at Asian-Americans, they seem to buck the trend in some ways. Asian-Americans make more money and are more employed than whites. Are they favored in the hiring process for some reason? Asian-Americans are educated in elite, established universities more than whites, per capita. They suffer from less disease; they have children out of wedlock less. Asians own more businesses per capita and they are jailed lesscommit less crime. Reasoning backwards, it seems that Asians enjoy a supreme privilege in the USA and thus one would be justified in reminding Asians to "check their privilege." What am I missing exactly?
