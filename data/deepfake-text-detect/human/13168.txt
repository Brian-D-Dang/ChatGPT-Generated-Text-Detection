Well, this is it..... It is what you wanted, isn't it? You weren't happy with the 9 to 5, you just had to start running your mouth. You stupid fuck. What did it get you? It got you a death sentence. It got you 12 and a half years on Death Row. It got you on 24 hour a day, 7 day a week surveillance. All because you couldn't keep your fucking mouth shut. See, that's been the problem all along..... Never knowing when to shut your mouth. Got you into trouble in school, ended up contributing to your divorce, got you fired. Got you fired up too, didn't it? That last straw, getting fired. But you swore revenge. You told everyone who'd listen that you were going to get those fuckers. You were going to take them out, every last one of them that turned their back on you. Ironic though, isn't it? Everyone and their mother heard you say you were going to put a bullet in their heads, that you were going to take their teeth home as souvenirs, and that you were going to be the one laughing in the end. Ironic that it was a failed carjacking that did in your boss..... Sorry, your former boss. Doesn't matter now, does it, you dumb fuck. Nope. Not at all. Why? Because you said you were going to kill them all. And when one of them turns up dead, who do you think they're going to accuse? Doesn't matter that you were too drunk that night to get a hard-on, let alone try and steal a car. Nope. Doesn't matter at all. And now they've got you strapped in. Looks like it's the end. Oh well. We all are going to check out sometime.
