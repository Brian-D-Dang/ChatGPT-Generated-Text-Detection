People were shocked, but eventually, they learned, Bing soared a bit in popularity, but then made room for competitors like Yandex and DuckDuckGo. The OpenStreetmap Project was used instead of Google Maps, eventually, when it was clear just how much data was corrupted, Sailfish replaced Android. The advertisements were not missed by anyone at all. GMail users had to resort to using an email service which doesn't suck. The Google employees and the management were the only ones who actually suffered: the former lost their jobs, the latter their freedom after it came out that the company cooperated with foreign secret services as well as the domiestic ones. And somewhere, a black hat hacker was in his lair (it is not the parents' basement, it is a secret lair!) and crossed one name off his kill list.
