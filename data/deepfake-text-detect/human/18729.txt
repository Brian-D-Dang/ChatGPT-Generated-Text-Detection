I'm not one for blind nationalism but here is my thought. Some one from another country (using Mexico as an example from here on out) Immigrates here one way or another for a better life. Meaning that on some level you believe here to be better than where you came from. if so then why the nationalistic pride in the country that failed you? It doesn't make much sense to me hold ideals like "Viva Mexico!" when you andor your family bailed from there to get a better life here. I know this may seem quazi-racist, but I don't feel that I am. I'm one for more open borders even. Set up a check in station on the border, give your name and any records you have, finger print, and here's you're citizen ship and SS Card. Just so we can workout census crap and taxes can be made sure to be paid. For example I wouldn't move to the UK if I felt this country was horrible then decorate my house with the US flag and blast the nation anthem out the window. Doesn't seem to make sense. EDIT: This is excludes job related moves where you still are happy with your home country but wanted to move based on work or marriage (spouse wants to live in their home country) situations Hello, users of CMV!
