My view is that goal line technology has over complicated a simple fix which could be more encompassing also being used for offside handballs and fowls. My proposal is that there is a video referee similar to the ones in rugby which the referee can refer to it unlimited times theoretically while managers get 3 appeals a match so like hawk eye in tennis. This prevents poor decision making such as the 2 disallowed goals from Mexico vs Cameroon as they can be appealed but also incidents such as the chest kick on Idiesta in the last world cup final. This proposal would also help with refereeing in incidents off the ball as the referee no longer has to judge it based on the aftermath. The threat of slower play for petty things such as throw ins in unimportant locations as every one would be after a quick play and outside of that could change the game. Hello, users of CMV!
