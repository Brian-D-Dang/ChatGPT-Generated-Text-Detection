Mindset one: if you were certain you'd be tortured for a year and then executed, wouldn't you want to save yourself all that suffering and die before that? Mindset two: if you were to get terminally ill, feeling terrible pains, being unable to find happiness, see the suffering of your relatives and knowing there is no cure, wouldn't you also want to save you and your family the trouble? Is there any kind of prize at the end of life for those who hanged on for the longest, regardless of the quality of their life? Should we really encourage people not to suicide no matter what? Isn't that in some cases true cruelty hidden behind good intentions? Aren't we sometimes encouraging further suffering for no good reason? To me, life has no intrinsic value. There's no real penalty for dying, we just decided as a society that that was a really bad and sad thing to happen. But it's not. Sure, loved ones will miss you, but that's all, it's just a weird form of selfishness. I think we are somehow taught it's sad for the person that died, but that makes even less sense. The person is dead, he doesn't feel anything, he's just not there anymore, disconnected, unaware. There's nothing intrinsically bad in that. Don't get me wrong: I'm a happy and fulfilled person with goals ahead of me, not suicidal. I just think most people are making huge mistakes by thinking that the most important thing in life is... life. Which is ridiculous to me.
