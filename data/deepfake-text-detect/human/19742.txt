My main argument is that it makes no sense to be appalled by the death of an early term fetus, which is not viable or sentient, and yet be perfectly okay with killing and eating fully grown animals that are sentient and have emotions just like humans. For the record, I am both pro-choice and a vegan, and I often bring this argument up when people tell me they are pro-life. I have yet to hear a good reason why killing a non-sentient fetus is morally worse than killing full grown animals. Unless for some reason you absolutely have to eat meat to live, I don't see why someone who is pro-life shouldn't include animals on their list of things that deserve a chance at life. EDIT: I'm going to go into a little more detail on my abortion stance for clarity. I certainly do not think it is desirable and it should be avoided if at all possible. However, until the fetus is viable, a woman's right to have control over her body should trump the rights of the fetus, because in a way, it is merely an extension of her body until then. You never know what reasons a woman might have for getting one, so the choice should be up to her. EDIT 2: I've had a lot of great discussions with you guys. I can see how it isn't necessarily hypocritical, since you all have given me a variety of reasons for both being against abortion and justifying killingeating animals. But I still think it's a good point to bring up, if only to make people critically examine their ethical views.
