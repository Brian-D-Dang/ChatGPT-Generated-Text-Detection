New details about Google's new Pixel 4 have been leaked on Jon Prosser's YouTube channel. Prosser has previously leaked accurate details on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, as well as confirming the existence of the Pixel 3a before it was announced. The Pixel 4 will apparently use capacitive touch areas on the sides of the aluminum handset, suggesting that an extended version of Google's existing Active Edge technology will be used. It will also feature a punch-hole front camera, either an optical or ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor, and a new dual-lens camera setup.
