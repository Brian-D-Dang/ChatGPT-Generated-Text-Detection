I adore this place somewhat bc it brings together classy steakhouse hallmarks and modern bacchi-style twists in one setting. Despite being.... less than creative with ingredients, the menu here is logical, which lauds mucho applause from this happy camper. Being in Vegas, the atmosphere here is also fittingly silly and sheik once. Parmesan truffle fries are amazing (and I usually despise potato dishes nice places-they're cheap). The apps were the low point of the evening, hit and miss. Two friends and I had the lobster cocktail, which tasted like it'd been caught far, far away prior to a flavor-draining odyssey. But, wait... the Crab Salad saved the day and turned things around. A collective exhale henceforth graced the table. I had the filet: score. My friend had a market fish which ended a drought of good seafood experiences since leaving recent travels to CA: score Dessert was skipped for a seat at the posh bar, where cocktails are strong. All in all, this place deserves four stars for ambiance. Vegas gets old easily, but this is a great place to take guests you want to impress. And did I mention I llllove it's sexy, futuristic atmosphere. Futuresexlovesounds all the way!
