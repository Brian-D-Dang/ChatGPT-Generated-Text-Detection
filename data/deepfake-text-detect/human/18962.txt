Where I reside (America), it is illegal to have sex with someone who does not consent to it. This makes sense to me; it is easy to say "heshe did not consent to sex, you are not allowed to have sex with them." However, there is another rule involved. Someone is "not capable of consenting" if they are under 18, or under the influence of drugsalcohol. The idea as I understand it is that you cannot have sex with someone even if they say yes, if they are under 18 or if you know they are drunk. Even if you simply "should have known" (perhaps they never outright said it) they were drunk, their consent does not count. To me, this is unreasonable, because there are many people who are not smart enough to tell someone is drunk, or perhaps they have not been around alcohol enough to understand how drunk someone is. I know people who slur their words all the time; I can easily see someone who is socially awkward not picking up on the cues that someone is drunk, and thinking that they were sober enough to consent. However, they "should have known" they were drunk, generally the argument is that they were "obviously drunk." I don't think it is fair to charge someone with rape when they were unable to detect the (sometimes subtle) cues that someone was too inebriated to consent. Please try to change my view, or ask for clarification! Update-My view was changed.
