For the first part: I don't care if girls do or don't play games. From girls who game to gamer girls to girls who are discouraged from playing, its no skin off my nose whether the faceless person on the other end of the internet has a penis or a vagina, so encouraging or discouraging them really means nothing to me. Even if every girl were to go Amish right now, my gaming experience would not change in any way, as there are millions of guys playing already. Expanding the market only matters to companies, and those companies will continue to cater to my demographic anyway. For the second part: gamers are mean and vulgar. You put people who are generally impotent in real life (kids, nerds, etc) and give them an anonymous way to vent, they're going to be vicious. Its like the porch scene in fight club: if they're fat, they're fucking whales. If they're old, they're fucking loser grandparents. If they're kids, they're babies. And if they're better than you, they're cheating faggots. Also more racism than at... Some... Really racist place. The girls who complain (or actually, if you look carefully, the people who complain on behalf of those girls) just make female gamers look like a bunch of whiny brats who want special treatment. So CMV: It doesn't matter whether girls play games and people shouldn't ask the section of arbitrarily hostile gamers to censor themselves and be nice to girls because they're girls (implying they can't take it).
