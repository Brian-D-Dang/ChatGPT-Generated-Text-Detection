You know those seafood places, that smell like seafood, but not in the good way? This seems to be one of those places from my first visit here. The first impression this place left on me was...well, that fishy smell, not off to a good start........ Myself and a few co-workers stopped here for lunch. As it is a relatively new location that did not open too long ago. I figured they would have their best foot forward. Sure hope that was not the case. Cant remember the name of the server, we only saw him 3 times during the whole visit. 1) bring water and take order 2) drop off food 3) drop off check. Now let me clarify, I do not expect to be served like a king, I am not a nose up type of person. However, when we had to ask for a re-fill on drinks from a different server that happened to be walking by, then I started to question the service. This brings me to the food. Part of the drink re-fill debacle was due to the fact that all of the food we ordered was overly salty. We were all parched and need large amounts of water to wash down the food. The fried soft shell crab was not very impressive, scrawny little guys, 90 shellbreading, 5 meat, 5 greasesalt. The fries were not bad but they were nothing to write home about either. The potato salad was pretty good. I will probably give this place another shot as every place has its off days. Im just hoping that this was an off day and not the standard at Crab Corner.
