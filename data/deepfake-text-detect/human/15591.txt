While I'm starting low because my experience hasn't been that great, I'm still willing to come back and try it again. Walking in the decor is modern hip diner with wood flooring, dark cabinetry, paper fixtures, and an appeasing greenorangebrown color scheme. I didn't have to wait as I went straight to the bar to sit. The noise level is a little loud with techno type music playing. This is a little random but the silverware was bulky and hard to use. I ordered 1 scrambled egg. Side of hash browns. Soyrizo. Tortilla. Coffee. The total was 11.37. The egg was cooked well and the hash browns was a healthy portion. However, both were very bland. I didn't even eat the soyrizo as the spices gave it a horrible taste, so I didn't touch it past the first bite. I'm spoiled by the Trader Joes soyrizo I think. The coffee was also bland, but I drank it because I needed my caffeine. I was never offered a refill or top off. The bartender was prompt enough but no personality. Never asked how everything was etc. I've heard so many good things about this place, so I was disappointed. Next time I will try those pancakes everyone talks about, and partake of the bar menu.
