"Something doesn't feel right." Did I say that or think it? My words seemed stuck in the depths of my mouth. My mind confined to my body unable to escape. Am I..... dead? Death is nothing but this is something. Dreaming? Ow. No. I head outside. No sound. No movement. A windy day has become stale..... motionless. Everything has stopped. I must be gone this feels normal but nothing else is. I was trying to dream but this feels real. I was asleep but I feel awake. My watch! Everything has stopped but the seconds are ticking. The minutes not changing. Each clock the same. How can his be?
