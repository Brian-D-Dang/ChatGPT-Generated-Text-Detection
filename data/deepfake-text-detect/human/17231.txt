i think that if you are a straight able-bodied white guy you should take this opportunity to pick a cause where your voice will really matter. discussions about social issues and causes like racism, feminism, homosexuality, disability should be lead by the main people concerned; they need the empowerment and the solution must come from them. these fights are not your fights. even if you consider yourself a humanist. also, whatever you have to say about these things have already been heard so step off and take it easy! feels good! make good use of your privileged position and pick other issues where your time and efforts will actually make a positive difference. ask yourself "which community-oriented goals should I share?" , "what sort of person would I prefer to be?" and take it from there
