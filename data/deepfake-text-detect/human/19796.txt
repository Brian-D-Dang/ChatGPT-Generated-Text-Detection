Now, this only applies to text and other things, not to duplicate names. For instance, I could wright a book or make an advertisement that uses the name "Ford" with no risk of being sued for copyright infringement, but I could not make a second company called "Ford." I think this would make writing books or other works of fiction much easier as, in continuing with our example, I would not halve to wright "Fard" of "Card" or something along those lines. To be clear, slander is not part of the equation. For instance I could not say that Ford makes cars that poison people and kill babies, though I could say that they are worse for (X reasons).
