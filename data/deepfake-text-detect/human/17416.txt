You may be wondering, how is what I just described in the title not CP? It is easier to explain with examples: - Lolicon and shotacon. These are cartoon images (usually in an anime-ish style) of little kids, though technically they could be any age and just look younger. - "X-Ray" photoshops. These are pics where they take a clothed minor and then use tools to draw in what the body looks like under the clothes. [Here] is an example using actress Allison Brie. - Face-swap photoshops. This is where the face of a minor is placed on the body of someone having sex. These are usually poorly done and work more as jokes rather than actual sexual stimulation, and it is easy to image search and find the original with the real person. This is treated separately from real CP, because none of it involves real images of real minors doing illegal stuff. You have to either create an image from scratch, or take an existing image and modify it. However, since no actual minor is involved, why is it illegal at all? To me this seems like a moral-based law rather than a harm-based law, and moralistic laws serve no societal purpose. They aren't enforced because enforcing them saves or helps lives, they are enforced because people high-up in Congress feel that they are just inherently right things to do. Hello, users of CMV!
