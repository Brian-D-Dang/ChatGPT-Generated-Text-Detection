The GED program in a lot of states are a joke, they are so easy people who dropped at middle school could do it. I know some very dumb people who got their GEDs but most dumb people I know failed to graduate high school. Alternative schools are basically bullshit, if you screwed up in regular high school you get sent to fake high school where the work is easier. These programs just undermine the work of real high school graduates, makes a high school degree less meaningful. It inflates the number of high school graduates and does not address actual education. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
