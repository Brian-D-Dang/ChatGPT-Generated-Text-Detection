Allow me to clarify what I mean. I'm big into movies and literature (storytelling in general) and I'm always told that I need to understand the classics of those arts in order to really appreciate how far they've come. And while I do understand that many of the classics were huge milestones and paved the way for new advancements, I find that I really enjoy more modern works much more. Sure I enjoy many classics, but I didn't think Hitchcock's Vertigo was all that great, and I think Wilde's Dorian Gray is too hyped up. I find that modern art can offer much more than the somewhat more simplified classics and that I don't necessarily need to see where these tropes came from to really understand them
