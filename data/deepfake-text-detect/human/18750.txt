Disclaimer: I've searched the sub and none of the other posts regarding otherkin address this as I intend to. For those who aren't familiar with the term, here is [the Wikipedia article on otherkin.] I believe this identification comes from one of two possibilities. First, it might come from the person actually believing themselves to be non-human, which would be the case of having some kind of mental disorder as, differently from trans people, identification as human or not doesn't involve any kind of sexual hormones. If the person really believes they share their body with a non-human entity, it would be the case of having a multiple personality disorder. The second possibility would be that of the person pretending to have that other personality. This would be similar to a child having an imaginary friend and, although mostly harmless, it is nonetheless childish. If the person is faking it, though, it would be similar to a kid who lies about having something that doesn't even exist my cousin from japan already got me a PS5!1!! in order to try and make themselves special in a group.
