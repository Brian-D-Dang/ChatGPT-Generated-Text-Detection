We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been "thin shamed" or "skinny shamed" by another woman. I don't see how that is possible in American society, being a thin woman is a desirable quality. [edit for clarification - having an actual eating disorder is not desirable, but being thin is desirable] This alleged shaming is typically expressed with language such as "you need to eat something" or "do you even eat" or "you're so skinny" or "you need some meat on your bones" or "you need a hamburger." In all of those cases, the speaker is not criticizing the subject of the speech for being thin. Rather, the speaker is deflecting and express displeasure about the excessive size of her own body relative to the size of the subject's body. In other words, she wishes she was thin and she's just jelly.
