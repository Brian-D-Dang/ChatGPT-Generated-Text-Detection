CMV: The reason why the Middle-East is a complete mess is because of Western imperialism. Which has only further provoked terrorism from those who are apart of Islam. The reason why Korea is separated is because of US occupation. Therefore I don't believe that people should mock either of these cultures as they're both already bitter from what Westerners have done to them in the past. Rather they should reconcile their differences, instead of further spreading hatred which only begets violence which begets fear which will ultimately serve to decrease our freedom as it gives governments the excuse to take away freedom for security. With freedom of expression comes responsibility. We can use this power childishly which will only create more hatred and terrorism, or we can be more mature about it and not mock the culturesnations that we've screwed over in the past.
