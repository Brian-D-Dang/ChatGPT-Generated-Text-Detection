I was raised in a rather strict environment, my dad was more or less a dictator towards the things I could not do and always looked down on "weaker" people and it would appear that it has rubbed off on me to the point were if I see someone smoking or having any HINT of an addiction of any kind I almost always automatically lose most of my respect towards said person. Now years after he has pounded the "you will be weak if you do X" I find out he is a hypocrite. I want to not look down on people with addictions (even tho a small majority should be), I want to be able to play a game online and every time someone mentions how much weed they smoke I don't want to think "I have lost my respect towards you" I want to think whatever it is a normal person thinks. TLDR: Was raised by a hypocrite who taught me to look down on a MAJORITY of people in society for a stupid reason
