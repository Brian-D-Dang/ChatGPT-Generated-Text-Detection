I believe that somebody speaking ebonics deserves no respect until they can demonstrate an ability to speak proper english. While I understand the necessity of certain individuals to speak in ebonics for fear of ridicule in their community, the ability to speak properly is necessary if said individuals plan to move up any sort of social ladder. That being said, those individuals who do not intend to move up the social ladder to create better lives for themselves do not deserve any sort of governmental aid. If people do not demonstrate an effort to better themselves, they do not deserve the assistance if the community. If a person speaks ebonics to me, prejudice immediately presents itself. In ebonics, I see a lack of effort to progress in society, and the acceptance of the lower class status that said person finds himherself in. The very ability to speak proper english is absolutely necessary, and those who cannot demonstrate this ability deserve no respect, nor any time out of my day. CMV
