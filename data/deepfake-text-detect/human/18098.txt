There are some crimes so vile, so reprehensible, that those who choose to commit these are often, in my opinion, beyond rehabilitation. The only course of action for these criminals is capital punishment. However, even the slim possibility of accidentally killing an innocent is something which I cannot abide. What makes us better than the people we're condemning if we accept that collateral damage is a possibility? I would suggest the following requirements: - The accused must be over 25 years of age (the median age at which many neurologists say your brain stops developing). - The accused must be a repeat offender of violent crimes. - The accused must be declared sane by a neutral, respected psychologist. I feel that these requirements would all but eliminate the possibility of accidentally killing an innocent, while keeping the death penalty as a possibility for those that truly deserve it.
