Oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the Earth's biosphere, air, sea and land. Oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. About 0.9 of the Sun's mass is oxygen. Oxygen constitutes 49.2 of the Earth's crust by mass and is the major component of the world's oceans (88.8 by mass). Oxygen gas is the second most common component of the Earth's atmosphere, taking up 20.8 of its volume and 23.1 of its mass (some 1015 tonnes).[d] Earth is unusual among the planets of the Solar System in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere: Mars (with 0.1 O 2 by volume) and Venus have far lower concentrations. The O 2 surrounding these other planets is produced solely by ultraviolet radiation impacting oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide.
