Hello, My idea is simply that all developed countries where education is at a good level should offer its citizens a fair shot at organizing popular initiative referendums (after 50,000 signatures for example) at regional levels, but at the national level too, like it is going on right now in Switzerland. Aside from that, I think there should also be a number of measures to help citizens make an informed choice, such as information classes in high-school (where you would learn to inform yourself objectively on various issues by crossing sources) and strong measures to help the press stay pluralist and the most objective possible (it could be things like banning lucrative press groups, in general to separate money and press). Please keep in mind that these measures would be there, but only to offer citizens a good way to inform themselves: in that sense, only the goal matters, not what form the measure will take. Thank you by advance! Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to [read through our rules] .
