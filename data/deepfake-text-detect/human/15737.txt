Ridiculous place of business! A complete waste of time money! I did the full body package. -It was almost 12,000!!! They told me it was going to be a one year process and after the treaments were all complete I had a two year garentee. My treaments were NEVER compete! What they ment to say is you have a three year time period and if ur still hairy then ur SOL. I went to all of my appointments for three years a lot of the times I sat in the waiting room waisted 12 of MY appointment waiting on the esthetician. I was burned several times the hair never went away! I now have to shave it twice a day! If you care about your beauty money STAY AWAY from this place!!
