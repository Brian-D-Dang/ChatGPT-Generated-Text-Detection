History has shown us extinction level events happen. And they will happen again. We have the technical means to continue on even if the earth is hit with comet. To survive as a species should be our overriding goal; let us colonize the moon, mars and beyond. Or stations on asteroids. Anything other than having all our eggs in one celestial basket. Perhaps it will only take a few generations before we can return back to the planet; providing it still exists. But preparing for the worst means being prepared to go it alone without the earth. Every other human endeavor must come second place to the ability to the goal of mankind's continued existence. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
