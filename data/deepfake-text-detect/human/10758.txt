The UFC has the final say on when to strip a fighter of his title. McGregor won the featherweight belt almost a full year ago and has not defended it, despite fighting three times since then. That in itself isn't as bad, as some champions have gone over a year without a title defense. However, now he's taking several months off to focus on his family, and when he comes back he's probably going to fight the winner of Nurmagomedov vs. Ferguson at lightweight, not to mention he still has to complete his trilogy with Nate Diaz. This would leave the featherweight belt undefended for maybe up to 2 years, especially if McGregor ends up losing the lightweight belt and demanding a rematch. That's very bad for the division and the UFC as a whole, so they cut their losses and stripped him.
