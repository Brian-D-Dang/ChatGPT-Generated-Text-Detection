"So..." "Jim's dead. "I say putting down my cup of coffee. "The fuck does that mean?" "Like not alive anymore." "Yeah I'm not really following." "Ok" I put up my hands to add emphasis "Jim Is Dead" "So....No more Jim?" "No you fucking idiot." A long silence hung in the air. "I never liked Jim" I say breaking the silence "Oh good me either, what a fucking asshole." "What did they do with him?" My acquaintance asks "He's hasn't been moved, hes still stuck in his living room with the plunger up his ass." "Ahh so that's what killed him." "What?" "The Plunger in the ass killed him right?" "Ha!" I spit out coffee onto the table. "You cant die from that" "What the hell does kill people then?" After I long period of deep thought I responded "yeah I guess it was the plunger." "Fucking Jim, man" "What a wanker."
