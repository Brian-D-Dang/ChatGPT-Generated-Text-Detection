Most busses aren't on the highway; wind drag isn't a big deal when you only get up to 30 mph. For those that do get on the highway, it's all about maximizing space and seats. The biggest drag is not from wind but just from gravity and moving a mutli-ton piece of plastic and steel from point A to point B. Buses are generally limited in size by certain practicalities (beyond a certain size and they need more axles and can't fit in tight streets), and taking out several rows of seats to change the front shape of the bus makes each trip more expensive per seat.," "I would imagine it's more about the cost of space than the cost of gas. If a vehicle was a bubble, less could fit into an area, so more land is required to store, park and manufacture. When you can fit more passengers and cargo into a single vehicle per trip, that outweighs the cost of the 10 less efficiency. Just a guess.
