First, without major societal change, education will stay as is. Second, despite claims schools are overfunded, much of the funding goes to poverty measures - social works. Third, if you take a look at the classes offered by schools; from poor to rich schools one sees a gradient with rich schools having more variety. This isn't necessarily due to some unquantifiable privilege, but the fact poor kids perform worse. For instance, in CA they track classes offered. You'll see more Algebra I classes offered in poor high schools than rich schools. This is a social issue, not academic. Fourth, I first started at a Title I school (poor) and the only thing I was evaluated on was classroom management. Let me breakdown classroom management. It's 14 having academic procedures and 34 controlling your students. This is common across my district. I have since moved to a middle class school and I'd say it's more 13 academic. Essentially, a vast number of teachers are being judged by the wrong criteria (academics).
