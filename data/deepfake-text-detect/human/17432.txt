The freedom to choose is fundamental to a free society. This should include the choice to vaccinate. Whether or not vaccines do cause autism or whatever is up to the parents to decide. Scientists can advice the public and try to convince them, but they should not overrule the public. The argument for 'herd immunity' is completely invalid, because one person should not be able to compel another to do something they don't want to protect the first person. That is simply tyranny. You might think it's stupid to not vaccinate but stupid people have the rights to do stupid things. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
