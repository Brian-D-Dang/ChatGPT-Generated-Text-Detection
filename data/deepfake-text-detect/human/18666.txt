I am of the belief that appeals to authority may be incorrectly applied, but not necessarily. I think any form of inductive reasoning is ultimately an appeal to authority. What is a meaningful difference between the two? After all; inductive reasoning is making predictions of the future based on the fact that we expect a pattern to continue while an appeal to authority is a specific form of the same thing. Am I right to equate the two? After all - I recognise that inductive reasoning isn't the right tool to use all the time, and neither is useless. So what's the difference. Edit: A more accurate title would be "if one rejects every appeal to authority" - so please don't pick on the technicalities to make an argument - although you are welcome to point them out.
