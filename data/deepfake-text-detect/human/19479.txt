Humans are very easy to manipulate. Uneducated men and women are like clay, in the right hands. A couple of years back, a travesty took place in my country. Our current president is as corrupt as it gets (even tried to change our Constitution to suit his plans). Every intellectual, my teachers, my tutors, were against this particular candidate. Every single pertinent political analyst would voice their opinions until their throats bled. This candidate smacked a child over the face during a campaign. This is the man who called a journalist "tiganca imputita." The Romanian equivalent of an US president calling a citizen "filthy nigger." The exact equivalent. But this particular candidate had an overwhelming budget. Enough to give some free food and vegetable oil to the poor and uneducated. He satisfied enough of those living in the rural region (people who can't tell you what exactly a president is for) so that in the end, he won the election. The corruption runs so deep that recently, one of our financial institutions got a new logo. For 2.000.000 of taxpayer money. Pepsi's current logo only cost one million. I strongly believe that giving everyone a voice in politics is unpractical. At least some criteria like having finished high school would be a good start. Tl;dr: read the whole thing Please try to sway away from the old argument of "if we move the limits on restricting rights, how do we know we won't go too far, set an exception etc.," simply because that won't change my view in any way. Thanks.
