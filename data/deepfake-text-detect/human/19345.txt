We spend to much on people who never try to find work for themselves. If they work hard and find a job, then great. If they starve and die, then great they won't have kids and that ends the cycle of poverty. Edit: After reading massive walls of text, I have decided to change my view. While I still think the rich should not have to support the poor, because of certain issues such as crime and riots and other factors, cutting welfare would be a terrible proposition.
