I read A Brave New World by Aldous Huxley a while back and since then have been looking at the world from a different perspective ever since. I have been pondering about the meaning of life for quite a while now and have come toacross a number of conclusions ranging from, "Human beings are social animals and they live to socialise" to "Eat, Fight, Fuck" to "Pass on your genes and die" to "Simply to live it." I know that it is in human nature to want to propagate their genes to the next generation and I know that I would love to have children someday. I've reached the point in my life where every time I look at a child, I want to grab it, run away and raise it as my own, but the next moment I realise that in twenty odd years time, that kid's going to be living in a society that probably is drastically different from today and unfortunately not for the better. My grandpa, who is 81 now, keeps saying to me that the world doesn't make sense to him any more, it's gotten too complicated for him. Though I agree with the increase in complexity, being young gives me the ability to understand and hence cope with the complexity. But in my opinion, the world's getting worse by the minute, people are losing their grasp on the concept of humanity. I also know that different people look at the world from widely varying perspectives from mine, due to various physiological factors. What if the person I bring into this world is just like me? And lives every day in fear of the future? Please do change my view, and tell me that there's hop for the world. I also apologise for the sensationalist title.
