It makes sense. It's prioritization. As a limit, where a group approaches zero, but never actually reaching zero, so should your emotional investment in a group be rationed. America is 70 white- so we care more about what they think and about their feelings than Asian people (making up 5) hence why the racist caricature Han from Two Broke Girls gets a pass from the censors. Larger groups get more scrutiny, because there are more people actually being effected by whatever it is that is done or said. Why is sexism against women such a hot button issue on Reddit? Because about half of Redditors are women. Why is it okay to make fun of a brony? Because those weirdos are a very, very small fraction of Reddit (let alone the world at large) so they matter less. The smaller the group, the less we should care about that group. Not necessarily "not care at all," but certainly prioritize it accordingly. CMV
