Involved in what? Filming a crime isn't illegal, and outside of a few specific cases people have no obligation to report crimes to the police. As long as journalists do not materially assist in criminal activities they haven't done anything wrong.,It's based on an extended sense of "journalistic privilege," but it's also ethically a gray area: URL0 URL1 In short, you'll notice that journalists covering drugs and illegal weapons are not themselves using the drugs or weapons. If they're simply documenting others breaking these laws, then they themselves are not doing anything illegal and they have the right to protect the identity of those being documented. I can't precisely say what it is, but there comes a level of crime where mandatory reporting trumps journalistic privilege. You don't see documentaries where journalists film sexual abuse andor murder, right? The crimes MUST be reported and you are committing a crime if you do not report them. If anybody can actually define where that line is drawn, I'd be interested in knowing.
