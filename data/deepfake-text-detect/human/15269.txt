I was so excited to see a Pink Box Donuts coming to this location, as it is close to where I work. I'd seen them on some food show, and saw all the rave reviews. My test of a donut shop is how good their plain raised donut is. After all, if you don't have a good base, none of your donuts will be good. So, I got a plain raised and some sort of turtle cheesecake donut. I took the plain one out, turned it over and took a sniff. No, I don't have a donut fetish. What I want to smell is that nice, yeasty fresh donut smell. Nope. All I smelled was sugar. Let me backup to say that when I walked into the shop, I was surprised that it didn't have that OMG fresh baked donut smell. Now I know why. So, tasting the plain donut was an adventure only my dentist would love. It tasted like nothing but sugar. The glaze had to be the sweetest I've ever tasted. Usually glaze is powdered sugar and some sort of liquid - milk, melted butter, lemon juice, whatever. What did they do, mix their sugar with corn syrup? So, giving up on the plain after a couple bites, I went to the turtle cheesecake one. I will say the cheesecake filling was nice, but again the donut itself had no flavor. The topping was pretty good but again very sweet. I'm disappointed and expected more after everything I've seen and read. You can't cover a mediocre donut with a bunch of toppings and sugar and call it good.
