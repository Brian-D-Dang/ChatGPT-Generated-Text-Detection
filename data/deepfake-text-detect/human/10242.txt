The Earth is constantly changing and moving in predictable patterns and cycles. The water cycle and nutrient cycles (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, etc.) are Earth's metabolism. The Homo sapiens component of Earth is preparing to initiate reproduction by copying Earth's structure onto other planets like Mars; not only in terms of atmospheric composition, but Earth will also give Mars many of its species and possibly its ecosystems as well. The Earth maintains relatively constant conditions over time, like surface temperature, ocean salinity and pH, and atmospheric composition, and these relatively constant conditions are homeostasis.
