Had dinner Monday night. Had the Fillet 43.00. it was the size of a large ping pong ball. overcooked and too much salt. Way WAY overpriced. It was literally three bites. I was with a group, so did not send it back. I should have. I all most that it was a practical joke. I quess I should have ordered a simple pizza!
