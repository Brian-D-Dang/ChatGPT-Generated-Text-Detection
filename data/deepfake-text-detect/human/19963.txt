Is your Congressman lazy? Hard-working? Corrupt? Honest? Ideological? Practical? Crazy? Data-driven? Term limits ensures that an elected official who embodies any of these qualities will be prevented from continuing to serve in the public domain past a given point. Now, obviously we don't want lazy, corrupt, ideological, crazy people serving in our government. But why should we subject the hard-working, honest, practical, data-driven people to the same standards? I believe that citizens use term limits as a catch-all to guard against [a repeat of] the former at the expense of the latter, when we would be SO much better served as a citizenry if people would simply do their due diligent research on politicians and what they've been doing, and re-elect or throw them out accordingly. People use the term "career politician" in an overwhelmingly pejorative sense, but is it really such a bad thing for us to have, as our elected representatives, people who actually listen to expert opinion and analysis on a given topic, and who know how to write, debate, and pass legislation on said topic? Obviously the last part of this is a utopian ideal, but in my opinion it is one that we, in a representative democracy, must strive for. CMV.
