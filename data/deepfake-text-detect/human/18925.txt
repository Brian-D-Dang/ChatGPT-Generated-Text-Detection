While I admit I do not have a strong passion for the arts, that's not to say I don't enjoy looking at or listening to them. I also understand that historically there have long been "patrons" of the arts. However, I do not see any reason why the giving of money to the "arts" (for example, any of various local or national theaters, orchestras, the National Endowment for the Arts) should be considered giving money to those in need and grouped together with any of a slew of social services that are provided and similarly labeled charity (such as providing food, shelter, mental help, financial assistance to those who cannot provide for themselves, etc.). Rather, to me, doing something like "donating" to a theater on top of purchasing tickets seems almost the same as paying a store owner extra for a product, or a masseuse extra for a massage. It's nice, but to me just doesn't seem like "charity." I can see that culture (which art is related to) has some sort of in-definable value to societies, and in that sense, can see how it might be something undervalued by many individuals in a sort of "free-rider" way, but still am having trouble understanding why it's considered charity. Can you help me change my view, or at least begin to understand the other side of this discussion?
