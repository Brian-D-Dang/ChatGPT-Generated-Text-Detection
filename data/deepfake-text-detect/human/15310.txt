Happened to drive by said ok I'll try it. I went through the drive through because I was on lunch. I pull up to the box which had a signed taped to it saying broken pull up to the window. Also on the menu they had all the sodas crossed out except 3??? (Should have been the first sign) get to the window and no one is there waited a bit and right as I was about to leave someone finally came up. I said screw it I'm already here! I order; which for a regular cheese burger, fries, and iced tea it came to 5.60. Now here came the waiting, and waiting and waiting, I even had a guy behind me who backed out of the drive through and decided to go in to order. Well in all the waiting I was doing I finally decided to look this place up on yelp! (Should have done that 1st) ahhhh the food has finally arrived!! The burger was ok nothing special, fries were kind of bland, the tea was good! But there was nothing for me to say oh gosh that was worth the wait. I won't be back. I only gave it 2 stars because my server was Nice. But the food lacked in everything and the wait is just too long. Nice Try Burger Dogs but I'm not sure how far you'll go!
