I have to be a little vague on this, but a friend close to my family recently left her husband to start an affair with her coworker. This coworker is married with at least one kid. They have had a sexual relationship for at least the past three months. Unsurprisingly, she is now pregnant. I want to send an anonymous letter to the wife that says, "Your husband has been sleeping with his coworker for months. You can probably guess who it is." Nothing too specific, and nothing about the pregnancy. Am I wrong to think this needs to come out in the open? There is no sign that they'll be telling her. Hello, users of CMV!
