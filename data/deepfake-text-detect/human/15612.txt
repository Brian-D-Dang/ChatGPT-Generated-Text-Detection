I know better than to not read reviews before I go into a business. However, I came here out of convenience when the normal salon I go to was closed. My pedicure was mediocre at best. She was not meticulous in getting polish on the entire nail. She also did not clean up the skin where she had gotten polish on it close to the nail. I will definitely not be back. It's a nice facility with clean equipment, but the professionalism is not there for me.
