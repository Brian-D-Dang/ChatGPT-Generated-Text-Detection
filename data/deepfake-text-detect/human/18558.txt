[This] thread on rmalefashionadvice got me looking at rwatches and I just can't get it. And I do like watches. I wear one daily. I have a Timex Weekender with a handful of bands for casual wear. A formal [blacksilver one] . And a silver Citizen that looks [about like this] . I feel like I have all the bases covered and I'm having trouble understanding what the fuss is all about. EDIT: CMV to make me understand your rationale for purchasing fancy watches so that I will want one too. I'm getting a lot of "people buy expensive things because they are expensive." We all know that's dumb. But watches seem like they might actually have some substance to their extreme cost, and I want to know why.
