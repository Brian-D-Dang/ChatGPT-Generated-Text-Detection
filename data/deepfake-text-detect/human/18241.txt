People ask me if am against gay marriage and I tell them the same thing: yes I am, but am also against straight marriage, the government should play no part in love, or choosing who you want to spend your life with. The fact that we must seek the government's approval seems insane to me. I understand the different tax reasons and others like it, but marriage should not be guiding that, love is not the governments business. I believe this is just the government trying to legislate morality. The government should be involved in other business than telling people whom they can and can not marry (love). If there really is a slippery slope as to people are going to start being polygamous, so what? Who are we, and who is the government to tell anyone of us whats good or bad for us, are we not capable of making our own decisions.
