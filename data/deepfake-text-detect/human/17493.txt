Some time ago (not sure exactly, probably 1-2 years), GW pictures that made the front page were relatively tame pictures of girls exposing themselves. Then it turned into a very frequent, not really credible "am so shy, buttype posting where immediately all body parts where thrust into the viewer's screen. Now, a increasingly high share of front-page hitting submissions are moving more and more towards clear pornography with all bells and whistles (remember sharpies? It's all silicone now...), titles already encourage [direct messages] etc. It's not new news that girls there send private pics on demand for cash, but I have the strong opinion that the majority of the posts there are done clearly with the target to make money. The subreddit has turned from a "get some confirmation that there are people who think you are sexy" to a "single amateur pornhub." CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
