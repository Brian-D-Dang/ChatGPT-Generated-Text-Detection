As Context: I am an American citizen, my family is from Boston and close members of my immediate family live and were living in Boston. I do not personally know anybody who was harmed in the bombing or witnessed it, however I do know people who watched the marathon from other places along the route. My View: The worst terrorist attack since 911 on American soil consisted of a total of 3 deaths and a large number (264) of injuries (some of which are major, most of which are minor). In the context of a nation with a population of 300 million, a school shooting problem, gun crime in many inner cities, a gang problem in many inner cities, abuse of drugs like methamphetamine, etc. etc. 3 people is inconsequential. Americans (I am one) and the American media love to be outraged by terrorism and to focus on high profile bloody events. They are incapable of understanding that more people have been [murdered in New Orleans] in a single year than [terrorism has killed over a decade] . I find it difficult to keep quiet about these things - I believe that the focus on terrorism is perverting our political process and undermining society. I wish people would stop talking about terrorism all the time. I wish we would stop fighting wars to avenge ourselves on the perpetrators of terrorism. I wish we would stop wasting money on failed occupations. I wish we would give up this idiotic surveillance state. I wish we could kick the TSA to the curb. Most of all, I wish we could move past these irrelevant issues and focus on getting things that will have a positive impact for most Americans right (the economy, healthcare, education, the deficit and debt, reducing military spending, going to mars, etc.) (Edited for formatting)
