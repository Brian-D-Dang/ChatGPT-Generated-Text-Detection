I'm a grown adult, and the beer store with the best selection also happens to be a store that carriers liquor. Because I'm in a [blue law state] , I cannot go into this store past 9pm to purchase beer. The arguments I've heard to support these laws are absurd. 1: Religious arguments. Some people argue that it's to promote churchgoing activities on Sunday morning, so liquor stores should be closed. I shouldn't have to adjust my purchasing schedule for the religious beliefs of another person. That's ridiculous. 2: "Uniform Day of Rest". The idea here is that supposedly blue laws in general promote everybody taking a day off (in the case of blue laws that prevent retail activity on Sunday mornings). The regular grocery store is open anyways. If the regular grocery store were allowed to sell liquor, and they're open anyways, then nobody that wouldn't have been working normally would be required to work. The same number of people would have days off. Go ahead and CMV about restrictive state liquor laws and blue laws in general. Edit: I'm seeing a lot of responses claiming that the laws reduce drinking. Without evidence, that's not going to change my view. If you can pop out some stats proving that the laws work to reduce drunk driving or alcohol poisoning or even ER visits due to alcohol related injuries, then you can have my delta. The other response is "If one liquor store is open on Sunday, they all have to be." This is only because liquor has to be sold at specific stores anyways. Other states have no such requirement, and stores that would have been open on Sunday anyways can sell.
