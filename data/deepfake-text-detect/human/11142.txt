This infographic explains it very well. You need to know what bears youre dealing with. Black Bears or grizzlies. URL1 EDIT: also this: " Playing dead will work if you're being attacked by a mother grizzly defending her cubs. But it is the wrong thing to do if you're being attacked by a predatory bear. If a bear attacks (particularly a black bear) in an offensive manner and physical contact is made, fight for your life. Kick, punch, hit the bear with rocks or sticks or any improvised weapon you can find. A predatory bear usually stalks its prey and attacks from behind. It is often silent and the bear does not exhibit any defensive behaviors like huffing or slapping the ground. Its ears may be laid back and its head held low, with its intent focused directly on you." URL0
