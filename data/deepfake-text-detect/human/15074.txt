Very expensive 19.99 per person for week end and children 12 years old count as an adult, coffee very cold then I ask to reheat the waitress then want to charge for an other coffee.... 2 adults and 4 children it end up to 115 with cold coffees. Never go back again it is a worst buffet.... Out there lot of choices and I like Score better they have nice salad and fruits bar..... Soft drinks and coffee all you can have.... Specially healthy foods and soups all you can eat. Where as Casa Corfu the soup is hiding with the waitress you don't even know as they have soup and waitress does not even ask you anything for that at the end when I asked it was too late.... I don't feel like having soup any more.... Everything is poor in quality in the way they acts so cheap!
