I have been persuaded to believe this because of this video: The video seems bias and condescending, although I do believe its message. Additionally, I have heard from many other sources that it is bad for the environment. At my university there have been many programs and displays supporting the reduction in the consumption of bottled water. For example, there are water dispensers that provide free water. The dispensers indicated how many plastic water bottles have been saved by using it. Perhaps you are familiar with these. Also I once heard that the water inside bottles that were disposed of with their lid on them is stuck in there. If the bottle ends up in a landfill it is stuck their for a while. Over the years this has added up to many thousands of liters of water being stuck in landfills. not sure about the truth of this. My cursory research turned up nothing substantial. On the contrary I have heard that certain plastics in water bottles are necessary for the recycling system. Also Bottlers also pay for the recycling system to be sustained. Overall I have been exposed to what seems like a very one sided argument, and I am very interested to see the other side.
