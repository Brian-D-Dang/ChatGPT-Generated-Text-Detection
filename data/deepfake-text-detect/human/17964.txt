I have seen many people proclaiming that acts of suicide are done out of some sort of courage or bravery but how can some act done out of the inability to face difficulty be considered courageous on any level? Some may argue that it takes courage to kill oneself but I say if that was the case why couldn't they simply used that same courage to face life. I firmly believe that once you die than that is the end, there is absolutely no afterlife or anything whatsoever. Sure you lose the ability to feel stress and pain but at the same time you lose the ability to feel happiness, exhilaration and curiosity. Even the ability to think is lost upon death. I do not understand why do people treat death so negligibly as compared to petty stuff such as bullying and the such. When comparing the two of them together, Death makes nearly all things pale in comparison. I do not abhor suicide completely though as there are times where it is done out of true bravery and thought for others . Such an example would be a terminally ill father who is proving too much of a burden for his family to financially support him, causing his children to lack necessities such as basic education and food.
