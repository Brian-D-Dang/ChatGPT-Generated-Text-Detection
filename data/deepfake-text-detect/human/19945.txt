Premises: 1. Legitimate pride comes from the satisfaction of being really good at something. 2. One sexuality is not better than another; asexuality, homosexuality, heterosexuality, etc. are all equal. Note: "Pride" is not synonymous with "lack of shame." Conclusion: Being gay is not something to be proud of in the same way that being, say, left handed is not something to be proud of. It would be ridiculous to think being left handed is something to be proud of, and ridiculous to think that being gaystraightother is something to be proud of because in both cases, premise 1 is not satisfied. EDIT: I removed a passive-aggressive remark about submission rule 5.
