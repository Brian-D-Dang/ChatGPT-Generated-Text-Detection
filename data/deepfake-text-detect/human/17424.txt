Typically any kind of sorcerer or sorceress is limited in power. The great the thing they are trying to accomplish, the more innate powerresources they need to pull it off. They often require elaborate rituals or rare artifacts to get major things done. Samantha does have that problem. It takes the same amount of effort for her to materialize a cup of coffee out of thin air as it does to bring Ben Franklin back to life in the present day as if he never died. She doesn't even need any fancy displays, she can just make things pop into existence instantly. Effectively the only thing that separates her from God is the fact that she has to twinkle her nose.
