I've personally come to the conclusion that we humans have manufactured a word that is not meant to exist. We think that so long as there is no war, then we live in peace. How can there be peace when our own species cannot understand each other? You speak of peace yet not everyone has come to think well of homosexuals. You speak of peace yet religion is not tolerated. I'm very open to this particular subject because I've not read too much about it. However, the answer seems to be clear. Power, money, and all that brings the goods of this world will always be the determinant factor, whether or not true peace can be achieved. Nonetheless, I think it's a good idea to give you guys an idea of what I mean by true peace. I personally think true peace is the time when humans as a whole understand each other. I don't mean for them to understand how I feel when I've experienced something they haven't, but rather that not everyone's mentality is the same. When homosexuals are not hated because "they're different," or religious people are not hated because "they're dangerous," or any of the on-going stereotypes to be honest. Again, I'm very open to this subject and willing to have a proper discussion. Thanks for your time, I appreciate it. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
