Mmmm Organic food.... wait what!? Yeah I can't say I know the difference in taste. I guess my palate is not as popping as I say it is or maybe there's real no difference! I can appreciate the idea. However, the organic part just sounds better and sophisticated. I eat organic only a-har a-har a-har. Picazzo's Organic Kitchen is a great selling tool. Though I can't bash their pizza, it's actually pretty good. I love their crust is that organic? Gotta get their bacon bleu cheese wedge salad it's a must. Organic Bacon? Ambience makes you feel smarter too or maybe I'm that already:) Service was great, my server recommended a small since it's actually a large:) Do organic food appear more hmmm.... - Enjoy!
