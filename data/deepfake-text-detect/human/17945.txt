My school was a hellhole, period. The kids did what they wanted, drew all in the books, trashed the classrooms, cursed out the teachers, and fought at least once a week. The teachers were overwhelmed and on their last ropes, and it showed. They just didn't care anymore. Most of the time they just sat out and left us to our own devices and means. We didn't have any strict, no-nonsense teachers (the ones we did have left or retired) and that what we needed, I believe that what a lot of schools need. They need a teacher (or staff): A person who won't tolerate bullshit from either the staff, teachers or students, a person who is strict but fair and won't let up until everyone stop giving excuses and to finally change for the better. If we had a teacher like that than I'm pretty sure we wouldn't have had a serious problem like we did before, and I'm pretty sure the same could go to other schools as well. Cmv?
