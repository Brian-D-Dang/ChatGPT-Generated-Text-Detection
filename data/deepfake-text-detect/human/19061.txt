I am a 22 years old female virgin (well i was once abused when i was 16 by a guy who was at that time, my 'boy friend), I never had sex again again because i feel like sex isn't as pleasurable as people states and also avoid relationships of any type. I've never been in a relationship since then. (made out with some potential partners, that's it)
