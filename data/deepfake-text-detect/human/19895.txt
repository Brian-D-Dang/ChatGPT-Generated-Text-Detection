This question concerns the injustice in the manner in which the 'plastic' creditbanking system is funded. Commercial law, as written, permits the fees for the system to be charged to the retailer, who takes them as a business expense which is reflected in his retail pricing. Those fees then effectively represent a hidden surcharge on all retail transactions whether they use the system or not. They are in effect, a sales tax on the entire retail economy, levied, not by any Government, but by commercial institutions. Hidden fees such as this have always been considered 'sharp practice', unethical, at best. To make matters worse, the card issuers are now offering promotional rebates, in effect 'giving back' part of the money they get from those who use cash, to those who actually use the service. This clearly victimizes those who don't, or can't, use the system, (often those most in need). A large part of the cost of the system is due to the high level of fraud it permits and the banks have little incentive to improve that situation because they just pass on the cost in the unfair fee structure already described. Those who don't or can't use 'plastic are clearly being victimized, deprived of money for no benefit received.
