You may have seen recent viral video that aims to fight street harassment: "10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman" While there are some instances of harassment in that video, I think that calling compliments and greetings "harassment" serves nobody: 1. It is not respectful to real victims of harassment, because it trivializes the issue. 2. It disrupts normal social dynamics between people. 3. It is not in the interest of women that want to meet somebody that men are being discouraged to approach them. 4. It will not deter creepy guys from harassing women, because apparently they don't have any problem even with real harassment. [Radical feminists think that approaching a woman you don't know should automatically be characterized as harassment.] That is the most counterproductive and retarded way to deal with the problem of harassment the world has ever seen. - P.S.: Because I was so astounded by the stupidity of this video I made a parody video, featuring Pepe Le Pew . If you want to see some real harassment, watch a few Pepe Le Pew cartoons. P.P.S.: A reply I made to a girl commenting on YouTube: I have already retracted this statement; see the discussion.
