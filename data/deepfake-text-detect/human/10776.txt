I am assuming that you are referring to broadcast television. Most television networks are national, but are broadcast by a local affiliate. I.e., the national NBC network buys, produces, and plans content, which it then hands off to a local affiliate who actually broadcasts it to you. When it does so, it leaves gaps in the programming for the local affiliate to fill ineither with local programming (news) or advertising for companies without a national reach. When this happens, equipment has to anticipate these holes, and switch between the national and local sources. Sometimes this switch isn't seamless, isn't cued right, or the inserted programming is shorter or longer than desired. All these issues lead to clipped, dropped, or shifted content. FYI: it's also why some commercials are much louder than othersthe loud ones are usually local inserts with a bad level setting.
