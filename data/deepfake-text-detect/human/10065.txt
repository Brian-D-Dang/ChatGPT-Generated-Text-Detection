Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can. However, recently, many of my friends have been attempting to convince me that by my own utilitarian views, neither veganism nor vegetarianism are the most moral choice, and in fact, a gluttonous amount of meat is the best for environmental, ethical, and health reasons. So far, I've been able to counter most of the evidence offered to me either with my own evidence from trusted sources or by pointing out the lack of merit from the sources given to me (lots of comic sans blogs). This is something I do honestly believe that, given enough evidence, I would change my view on, and it seems like a lot of people seem to think they have evidence that a diet of meat is better in some way that I might consider meaningful, and of the many that do, there's bound to be some that might actually have something worth considering, so please change my view.:) EDIT: I should say that I'm posting this from an American viewpoint in which most of our factory farms typically don't treat animals very well. If you live in a country in which the animals are treated with respect and then eaten, that might be a different story, but that is not the situation that I am in. Please try to consider this in addressing my CMV and presenting your evidence however your discretion guides you. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
