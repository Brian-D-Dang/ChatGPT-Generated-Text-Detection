Pretty simple. Literally every other part of reddit (how upvotesdownvotes work, the algorithms behind what makes front pages, etc.) all stays the same. Karma totals showing on posts and comments stays as well. The only change would be removing visible karma totals on user accounts. Doing this would completely remove users reposting content solely for karma farming, and the "business" behind growing high-karama accounts for re-sale (a practice that harms reddit content) completely goes away. What would the negatives be?
