I was born into a right wing family. On the face of it, I don't really mind. I feel like the majority of views I hold I share with my parents. Even though I have always told myself when I decide to vote I would take a clean page, throw out all the bias in my head and vote for whom I think would do the best job. About a year ago I came out to my mother that I was Transgender, she's been accepting and all, but she's worried about the reaction of my father. (I won't waffle further, TL;DR I'm LGBT). The vicious voice I am trying to ward off in my head is telling me that everything that I have heard, saw and have read about Islam is that it is backward, and shows an obvious hatred of the LGBT as well as views women as second class citizens. As a transwoman, and a firm believer of total equal rights of all genders, identifications and sexual orientations, I find it ridiculous how anyone can claim to be a feminist or a member of the LGBT can sympathise with Islam. The way they treat women and LGBT (especially in Muslim Majority countries) makes me feel physically ill to the point where I feel like breaking down. It's not just a different culture that we should be accepting of, its a backwards one. Everything I've learnt either from my parents (mainly my father) or have read or seen about Islam has told me that it is oppressive and arguably insane (Such as the Saudi Cleric who claimed that driving hurts Womens ovaries). I know I'm ignorant, and I know that my intolerance for followers of Islam is disgraceful, but I am having a hard time accepting even the progressive Muslims when the leaders and public speakers of their faith hold such views. This is my first post here (I just happened to stumble across this subreddit) and out of impulse thought I'd share this, because I really feel like I need to be snapped out of this view.
