Somehow I doubt my doctor's office has time to write up detailed reports and send them to a central statistics office so where does this information come from? They actually do collect such information from doctors. Consider what has to happen in order to be treated for a disease; at the very least your insurance is going to be contacted with what you are being treated for because they need to pay for part of it. Hospitals for example will want to know what their doctors are doing all day so they collect such reports as well. And where do you think your medical history comes from? Record keeping is definitely something that happens in the medical field.
