As consumers in a free market we vote numerous times every day using our wallets. We vote on how humanely animals should be treated by paying this steak-house or that vegan restaurant. We vote on how important environmental issues are by paying this hybrid manufacturer or that truck manufacturer. We vote on cost vs quality, efficiency vs effectiveness, the importance of privacy, on and on, every day. People start companies to create supply which meets demand. That demand is power we all exercise every day. Wal-mart will disappear if we stop paying it to exist and instead buy local. Facebook will disappear if we stop giving it our personal information. Going down the list of CMV topics, a large portion of them could be solved through majority rule by us changing our actions as consumers in a free-market. And we don't need to wait until the next election cycle to do so. Of course consumer awareness is important, and can be manipulated through advertising and behavioral economics. But that's no different than voter awareness or political misinformation. I think when we want change we should look to our real-time power as consumers in a free market. Not occasional forced policies through our government institutions. CMV.
