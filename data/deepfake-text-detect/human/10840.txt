Ebola can survive outside a host only for a few days, it'll most likely be dead by the time someone receives the package. Also, it requires direct contact with infected fluids for infection, so even then, the chances are low. Ebola isn't really that dangerous when it comes to infectivity, only marginally more infectious than aids. What makes it so dangerous is the fact that it kill in a week, with a very low survival rate.
