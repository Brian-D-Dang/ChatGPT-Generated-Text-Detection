When a person gets a bunch of illegal money it could look suspicious. How did the guy who has no job suddenly buy a house with cash? So the money needs to be laundered. Laundering money is passing it through a business that looks like it's not breaking the law. It could be a simple local business like a restaurant where the crooks give the illegal money to the restaurant and the restaurant writes down that they sold more food than they actually do. They can then pay the money out back to the crook and it looks like it came from regular restaurant business. A good way to do it with lots of money, especially when the crooks need to move the money between countries is to use big banks. Put the money into the bank in one country, take it out in another. The second country doesn't know how the money got there. It might have come from a perfectly normal business. Some big banks got into a lot of trouble for this recently.
