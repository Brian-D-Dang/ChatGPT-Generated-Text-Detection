Far too often police officers murder unarmed citizens. I have two examples from my Political Science textbook: "In 1999 New York police killed Amadou Diallo, a law-abiding African immigrant, in a hail of fort-one bullets as he was standing in his own doorway. The officers were looking for a black suspect, and when Diallo reached for his wallet, they assumed it was a gun. Ultimately the officers were acquitted." A similar killing of an unarmed black man, nineteen-year-old Timothy Thomas, by police in Cincinnati in 2001 led to three days of rioting. The officer in this case was also acquitted." In both of these instances, a police officer kill an unarmed citizen. Unless they were in life-threatening conditions, which should almost never happened unless a person armed, I do not think it is just to acquit these officers for their crimes. CMV EDIT: Changed murder to kill
