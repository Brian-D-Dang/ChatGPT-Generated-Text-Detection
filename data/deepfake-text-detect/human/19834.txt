Taking the holodeck as it is displayed and presented in the Star Trek series, I believe that inventing it would potentially end the human race. Imagine going into a room where you can create anything you can think of in unlimited quantities for an unlimited time. You can, quite literally, do anything you want to do. Now Monday morning rolls around and you have to go to work...are you going to want to leave this universe you've created to stamp paperwork or deal with angry customers? Furthermore, what reason do you have to ever interact with real people ever again? From what the show has given us, the holodeck has the ability to create any type of person, living or dead, and make them be fully interactable in every way as though they were real. Why would you want to deal with an irritating coworker or a bossy neighbor when you can talk to Einstein about math or play strip poker with Marilyn Monroe? This will, I believe, create the kind of technological "zoning out" that we see today with the internet; where people wall themselves off in sanctuaries of supportive and affirming thought that they create and cannot be assailed by contradictory ideas. But even if you were someone who sought conflict, the holodeck could give you that too and you'd never have to leave. In short, there would be no incentive to continue with the business of real life once people had an experience open to them that precisely mirrored real life down to the smallest detail and was under your direct control.
