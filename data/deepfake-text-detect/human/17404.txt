Liberals say that they want as much personal freedom as possible but it seems like they just hate rules. They talk about how drugs, abortion, gay marriage etc. should all be acceptable in society, not caring about the ramifications of these actions. They never seem to know when to stop, either. Sometimes i read things like how they want women to be able to go topless in public and i think to myself "What's wrong with these people?." The mentality of a liberal is the same as what everyone goes through as a teenager, but you would think that you grow out of that mindset. Some day you have to realize that law and order is important and it's foolish to say that everyone should just "do what they want." What really pisses me off is how liberals react to law enforcement. If a police officer as much as lets out a fart, the liberals are over him like wild dogs. It's like the police can't even do their job anymore. You always hear complaints about police brutality and about how much of an asshole they all are. Because fuck them, how dare they uphold the law? How dare they keep our streets safe? Who do they think they are? Problem is that you can't compromise with a liberal either, there's no middle ground for them. You see some of them say that marijuana should be legalized as long as we tax it but then after a while, what happens? Now in Colorado, people are protesting against the taxation of weed by passing free joints around. They can't be reasoned with, if they can't get their way in the first place, they'll agree to a compromise, then wait a bit, and then push for further reform. Maybe i'm wrong, maybe the libs do have some kind of sincere cause. But i really don't see it. CMV
