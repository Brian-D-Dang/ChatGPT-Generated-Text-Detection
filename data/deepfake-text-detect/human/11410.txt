President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that targets tech companies. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for the content their users post on their platforms. The draft order asks that the FCC reinterpret the law and decide what it means for a platform not to be acting in'good faith' under the provision. Trump signed the order in reaction to Twitter fact-checking two of his tweets earlier in the week where he made false and misleading claims about mail-in voting and voter fraud. Repealing or limiting Section 230 of the Community Decency Act may result in more restricted speech online as companies will not want to be exposed to the potential liability for everything their users want to say.
