If addiction is a disease, why do most addictions end spontaneously, without treatment? Why did some 75 of heroin-addicted Vietnam vets kick the drug when they returned home? It's hard to picture a brain disease such as schizophrenia simply going away because someone decided not be schizophrenic anymore. Imagine a schizophrenic telling you about his condition and you responding by, yeah, I know what you mean, I drink a lot. It totally absolves any responsibility by calling it a disease and is offensive to anyone with a real disease that they can't fix by just doing less of something destructive.
