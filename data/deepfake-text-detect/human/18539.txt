i believe that a religion is a personal belief, a belief that a lot of people don't have, although religion is still predominant, there are more and more people who do not believe in a higher power. these people should not be forced to abide by rules because some people in the government choose to go by personal faith, not by hard real facts. i believe that if you take religion out of politics, people will be more happy as a whole. the perfect example of this is gay marriage, a lot of people are extremely happy that it is being legalized, yet it seems its not even on australias radar yet. why? because people are using religion as an excuse
