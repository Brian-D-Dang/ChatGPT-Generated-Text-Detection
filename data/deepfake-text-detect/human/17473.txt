Anecdotes from everyone I know make me believe that people spend a solid 20-30 of their work days being unproductive, and yet they are forced to work a full 8 hours. In my opinion this encourages filling time, working slowly, or looking busy rather than doing actual work, since if you finish it too fast it looks like you're doing nothing. If work was done on job by job basis, it would make workers more efficient and supervisors would be held. accountable for giving their employees a minimum workload. The company would be more efficient and the people would be happier, increasing productivity per hour, and quality of life would skyrocket since you don't need to spend 60 of your waking life working or commuting. CMV Edit: this model definitely works better for some industries than others. I wouldnt change all jobs, but some streams of employment would benefit greatly from this. I probably should have had this in the main post. Edit 2: You guys bring up some good points... Maybe a hybrid system where there is just less face time (say half) and the rest is results based?
