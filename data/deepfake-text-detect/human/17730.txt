I understand this is an emotive issue, but I am interested in why we consider apartheid morally repugnant but citizenship not so. Now - I understand that this has very practical aspects to it. For example - a country can support only a certain number of people, and people like to migrate to more prosperous countries. Perhaps you don't want them voting for officials when they have their "own" country's interest in mind. Perhaps you want to eliminate competition for "your people." But I am not convinced. Apartheid is the first readily available parallel I could think of, and I can't seem to pry the two apart. Why is it not ok to restrict the rights of people based on the colour of their skin, but ok to restrict it based on where they were born? Now - I don't want to address immigration in the US - or any other country - which is what I'm afraid this might devolve into. I'm asking about the ethics of citizenship. In the 18th century - in the US - Black people had to work as slaves and had little recourse. They could never dream of getting a job. Things got better eventually, and today the world is a much better place for it. But we still hold on to notions of citizenship. But you say - "you can become a citizen." You just have to do an arbitrary number of things to "prove" yourself. But this is no different than saying "I'll let race X do things race Y can do anyway, but they have to prove themselves first."
