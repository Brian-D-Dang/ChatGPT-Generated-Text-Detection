Before anything else, let me say that I am not, nor have ever been depressed, suicidal or abused in any way shape or form. My life so far has been somewhat sheltered. A while ago a stumbled upon the idea, that since entropy can only increase, there will be a time without humanity. A time where all you've done, and all you could have done will be gone, forgotten. The universe will be cold, homogenous and all that has ever been, will fall into oblivion. Allied to that idea, I also do not believe in free will. You see, we came from stardust, and we will go back to being stardust. I also am not religious and I'm extremely skeptical. I do not see meaning in any of it. Whatsoever. I wanna change that. I've actively trying to change that for about 2 months or so, but am yet to stumble upon an idea worth living for. So far I've: Read the book'A man's search for meaning', I meditate and work out. Can you guys give me some insight on why I should get out of bed? Edit: I fcking butchered the title. I meant make the case that life was pointless, not worthless. Sorry for that. The rest of the post still stands. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
