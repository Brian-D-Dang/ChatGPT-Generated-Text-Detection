I believe that to be an atheist requires nothing, as it means you don't believe in any religion. You don't have to read all of Richard Dawkins books, be educated, or know anything in order to be an atheist. It isn't something that requires a 'why'. You could answer "I just don't care" and it would be more than valid, you don't have to try and disprove GodAllah etc. I just can't imagine a scenario where I say nothing then someone else says something about their religion or some analogy and I say "Oh I guess you're right then, [your religion here] is real." I'm not putting that down to my stubbornness, but down to the fact that there is nothing for them to prove or disprove that ends with athiesm (no opinion) being destroyed. Hello, users of CMV!
