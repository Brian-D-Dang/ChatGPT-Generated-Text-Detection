[This] is the ad in question. What I see is a woman eating a chocolate donut, and turning chocolate. I'm about as offended at this as I am at [Violet turning violet] in Charlie and the Chocolate factory. [Blackface] was all about making blacks look bad, and putting blacks down by keeping them out of hollywood and raping their ideas. I don't see how this ad pushes either of those two ideals.
