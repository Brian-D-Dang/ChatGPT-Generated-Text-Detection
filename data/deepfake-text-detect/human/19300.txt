Okay, I believe in equal rights for everybody. I just dont think that marriage is a right. Marriage for me, a Catholic, is a commitment between a man and woman similiar to the commitment between Mary and Joseph. Given all the gay marriage lawsbills i feel as if im being inconsiderate to gays. CMV!!! -Edit- Thanks guys! I kept confusing catholic and legal marriage. Now I understand it! I never showed hate towards gays or anything and the last thing I want to do is get in the way of their rights. My view has been changed. Thanks rchangemyview!
