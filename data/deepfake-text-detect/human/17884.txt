Title basically says it. There are too many cases where parentes shouldn't shouldn't be allowed to have a child, and i believe that if we only use the best of the human genes humanity could improve greatly. I think somebody would think that it would be immoral, how so? We would be improving ourself as a species and could possibly make the world a better place. I want somebody to explain to me why this is bad. Why this would bring more harm then good. If i think about it i only see positive outcomes as a result of it.
