If I have large cuts and I go swimming in waters that I know are shark infested waters, it will be fine if you want to blame me or shame me. I should have known better. If I go walking in South Africa after midnight wearing a fancy gold watch, and I get robbed, it would be ok to call me an idiot. I am an idiot if I do such a thing. I may have a right not to get bit, that doesn't matter in this case. Sometimes it is not ok to blame me, like if I go the local swimming pool and there are barracudas in there, and no one tells me before I jump in. This doesn't seem unreasonable.
