Acids taste sour, such as the acid in vinegar (acetic acid). Sourdough bread uses both yeast and lactobacillus to leaven the bread, not just yeast. The yeast turns sugar into alcohol (which cooks away while the bread is baking) and carbon dioxide gas, which causes the bubbles that make the bread rise. Lactobacillus turns sugar into lactic acid, giving the bread that sour taste.','Sourdough starter is a colony of wild yeast and good bacteria. The bacteria releases an avoid that stops bad bacteria from growing, but the yeast is ok with it.
