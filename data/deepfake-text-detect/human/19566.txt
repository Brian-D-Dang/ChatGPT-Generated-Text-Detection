I believe that democratic socialism is the best ideology for a country to possess. It's politics and programs should be revolved around it. Capitalism doesn't work, and therefore I oppose it. Democratic Socialism frees the people from the capitalist enslavement. Socialism gives everyone an equal opportunity in live, whatever you're poor or rich. Socialism treats everyone like human beings, instead of consumers like capitalism does. Socialism's only goal and motive is the well being off the masses, instead of profits like capitalism. I have seen the horrors of capitalism. It enslaves people with low salaries and rough working conditions. By having profits as it's priority it treats people like consumers. It makes the ideology morally bankrupt. For example: Private health care will have profits as it's goal. It will therefore charge people so that they can be healthy, and doesn't care if the consumer is dying or not. Capitalism makes it right for companies to get a profit off of what people need. Capitalism therefore believes that only those with money are those that matter to society, and everyone else are mere slaves. Socialism treats people as human beings. It's main goal is the betterment of people, and not profits. Therefore health care doesn't care about how full your wallet is, it cares about treating you and making you healthy again. Therefore everyone gets a place in society. Everyone is treated as equal, and as human beings. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
