I want to first of all make myself very clear that I support gay marriage completely. My problem is with regards to a particularly unsatisfying argument often deployed in its defense: "it doesn't affect you." It seems to me that for that claim to be true requires an incredibly narrow definition of "affects." Surely there is legitimacy in claiming that what society legally condones affects all of us. Moreover, even -if- there someone isn't affected one way or the other by gay marriage, don't we usually discourage only caring about issues which personally affect you? This is my thought process behind refraining from using the argument, and cringing when others do. CMV
