Satan stroked his goatee as he looked at the two newcomers. "Well, it looks like we have a predicament here don't we?" Satan mused. Cerberus barked in agreement. "How did you die?" Satan asked, pointing at the man. "I shot myself after killing my wife," the man indicated to the woman next to him, "It was a suicide pact." "You loved her so much that you decided to follow her to hell. And you trusted him to kill himself after he killed you," Satan said looking at the woman. She nodded. "Very well. Beelzebub, cut them both in half vertically. Join their bodies together, then feed the leftovers to Cerberus. Problem solved. Next victim please."
