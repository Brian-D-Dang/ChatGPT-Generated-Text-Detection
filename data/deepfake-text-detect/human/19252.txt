Many strip clubs don't pay the girls but instead charge the girls to come to work, so all of their income is from their tips. They are also frequently called independent contractors and not employees. These factors cause many people to feel it's the duty of the customers to tip them. I disagree with this position. I think for lap dances and sitting in the front row for the stage dances, you should, but otherwise if you just want to have a drink or watch the stage from afar, you shouldn't feel obligated to tip. Paying the cover charge is all you have to pay. It is the dancers' responsibility to negotiate better pay with the strip club if they want it. That they don't isn't the fault of the patrons. In [this current court case] strippers are suing their strip club claiming they are employees and trying to get back wages. And the court agreed with them, awarding them 10 million in back pay. I agree with the courts decision and I think strippers everywhere should be paid by their club if they are not. If they have yet to sue and be paid what they are worth, it is their fault, not the fault of their patrons and their patrons shouldn't be guilted into tipping because of it.
