Tattoos are awesome, don't get me wrong. But i think it's weird to get a drawing of a person on your skin without their consent. Celebrities are people too, and i'd be creeped out if a stranger got my face permanently inked on their body without it being ok'ed by me first. I hold a separate view if the person has passed and it's in honor of them. We'll never be able to make a law against it, or ban it, but i think if you get a portrait of someone, you should get their consent first. Do you guys agree with me? Why not?
