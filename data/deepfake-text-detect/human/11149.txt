Because scientists don't take things on faith. That's religion. We may have a hypothesis that these elements will exist, but until someone actually produces evidence, we can't claim anything. Also computationally determining the properties of new elements is anything but trivial. The inner electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light, the finite size of the nucleus becomes important, the interaction with the other 100 electrons means we have to treat the problem with perturbations. It's like saying you understand psychology and biology, so therefore you'll be able to predict what grades a first grader will get in college. It just isn't happening. So the ordering of even heavier elements may not follow the trends we have seen. URL0," "Of course, you can just paper-expand the periodic table ad infinitum, if you so desire, but that's not only useless (since none of those elements have been found to exist, thus you can't do anything practical about it), it's probably inaccurate as well. The position in the periodic table only defines the number of protons in a nucleus, and we don't have any kind of complete theory that will accurately give neutron count and structure out of this. The stability of the higher elements is all determined experimentally, we have no formulae for accurately predicting that with a hypothetical element. There's no way of knowing if the island of stability really exists, or if there are other phenomena that come into play and disallow it. Tl;dr We wait until we actually see it first because that's the only way of knowing. An imaginary element that cannot form because it breaks apart much faster than you can form it, is an element of no use to us.
