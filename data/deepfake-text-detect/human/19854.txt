Most recently as I've started to do more and more errands for the holiday season, and for work. I've started to listen to the radio instead of listening to my ipod. No explanation as to why any sane person would do such a horrid thing. How ever I've been listening to quite a peculiar radio station in the lower 80's station number leading it to have a staticy tone. I prefer the static in a radio station, if said radio station plays "good" music, over a radio station that has crystal clear sound, because of the sound quality loosely sounding like a record player.
