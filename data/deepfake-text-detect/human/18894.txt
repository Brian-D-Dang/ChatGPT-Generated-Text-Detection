After discussing high-frequency trading in relation to [this article] in rpolitics, I found my view was in the minority. I feel like the quality of discussion wasn't that great there so I'd like to see what rchangemyview thinks about it! My view is that, on the whole, HFT improves market quality through decreased spreads, increased liquidity, decreased volatility and decreased transaction fees. I've reviewed a lot of the academic literature and it seems to agree with my view. However, I'd be very interested to listen to any views to the contrary which may CMV.
