Delicious food, knowledgeable staff, and a modern-chic setting. I loved the Vogue Martini and my husband enjoyed his Vogue Manhattan. The Vogue Burger was nothing short of perfection. It was prepared just as I ordered it and had a well-balanced flavor. The sweet potato fries with maple dipping sauce were a perfect pairing. We moved to the area this past spring and love living here even more now that we have a restaurant like Vogue Bistro on our block. It's perfect for a date night or even a night out with good friends!
