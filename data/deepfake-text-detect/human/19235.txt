First I am writing this from the perspective of an American. I realize we get a free legal defense if needed for a criminal case. However, but I don't feel they give their 100 all of the time. Recently I have heardseen more people I know needing legal advice or representation. However, most of them barely have the money for this and in many instances have had to give up their legal fights due to the cost. Normally I would think taking the task on yourself would be the next logical step. However, in researching how to file in small claims court I believe that it is too difficult for the average citizen to do anything beyond small claims and for some that is too difficult. I'll admit I was originally not for the idea, but with the introduction of PPACA (Obamacare) and the extensions of unemployment insurance I believe if the government is going to provide the current level of socialfinancial services that it does then this should also be included. I am not sure how it should be handled state vs. Fed, forced purchase of legal insurance vs. single payer system, or if there would be financialusage limits. I believe that as long as the systems is adequate to well designed then it would be a success.
