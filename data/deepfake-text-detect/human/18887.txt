Poked around a bit and it seems this isn't a very popular topic, so I figure I'll go for it. If you aren't familiar with the Duodecimal system, it is a way of counting which revolves around 12s instead of 10s. The duodecimal system therefore must have 2 extra symbols, usually called "dek," which is the equivalent of 10, and "el," standing for eleven. Twelve in the duodecimal system is called "do" (pronounced like "dough and notated as "10." "El" is written as a backwards upside-down 3 but I will write it as E. "Dek looks like a sort of sideways flowy X so will be written here as X. The duodecimal system takes a little getting used to; it's sort of like a new language in that you must translate numbers from decimal to duodecimal. For example, "23" in base ten is notated as "1E" in base 12. Why is base 12 better than base 10? The big one: divisibility. Not counting one and itself, 10 has two factors: 2 and 5. 12 though, has 2, 3, 4, and 6, meaning that dividing by 3s and 4s is easier while 2s remain the same. Say you want to buy a third of a pound of apples and every pound is a dollar. In decimal you now have to pay 33.3333... cents, usually rounded up to 34. In duodecimal, though? 13 is equal to exactly 0.4. This value is exactly the same as 0.3333... in decimal but oh so much easier to notate. 16 0.2 14 0.3 56 0.X and 1112 0.E Negative effects of a change base 12 Well we would have to change, to put it simply. I really do realize that it is nearly impossible to do this and so I only want my view changed on how base 12 is superior to base 10 theoretically. Kids couldn't use their fingers to count! Well this one has a simple solution. one can simply count to 12 using the segments of the 4 fingers. Look at your palm and above you will see 12 nice little fleshy boxes, each representing a digit. Very simple, and allows you to count to 20 (24 for you decimal plebs). It's harder to multiplyconvert. Weellll this one is partly true. I actually do not support a change to the metric system for the same reasons I don't like the decimal system, but that's a CMV for a different day (let me know if you'd be interested). How often do you need to convert centimeters into kilometers? Very infrequently, because people tend to use the measurements they need for a certain task. Converting in 12s really isn't that bad anyways... 100 is called a "gro," becuase it represents 144 or a gross. 144 times 144 is 20736, which looks ugly in decimal but would be a nice 10000 in duodecimal. Since the decimal system is so ingrained in our minds it feels as if it's ingrained, like our brains are wired that way, but that really isn't the case. The only reason, really, that the Imperial system sucks is because we use a decimal numeric system. I would, if all-powerful, normalize the imperial system into all-12s and it would be great for working with 3s and 4s. Multiplication is actually easier in duodecimal for 3s 4s, and 6s. (this next bit is in duodecimal) 300 313 326 339 3410 3513 3616 3719 3820 Notice how the last digit is always in a simple pattern? ... In decimal that would be 03692581470369... which is undoubtedly horrible. Duodecimal also would not change advanced mathematics at all. Everything would work the same in the fancy business and it'd be easier to do day to day tasks. Just found [This] . Pretty sick. Notice it uses the upside down 2 instead of X; that's the way brits do it. CMV
