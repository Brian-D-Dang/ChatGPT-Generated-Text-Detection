Fuddruckers is a burger place. Unfortunately you pay 30 for two people to have a combo and the burgers are flavorless. I don't understand why most burger places don't create their won meat mix of different cuts, mix their beef with ingredients or at least season their meat. The toppings on top are great but they don't add flavor to the actual hamburger patty. My wife got the Kobe burger..of course a 9 Kobe burger isn't really Kobe beef but it was flavorless as well.
