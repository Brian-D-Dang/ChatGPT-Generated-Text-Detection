It's generally a good idea to look at CPU benchmarks rather than just the clock speed, because the amount of work a CPU can do per clock cycle varies a great deal. The Pentium 4 for example had very high clock speeds, but did pretty little work in each clock cycle. The system requirements of games usually list one or two common CPUs (like a Pentium or Athlon), but that doesn't tell you much unless you happen to have that particular CPU. If you look up [performance benchmarks for the C-60] (URL0), you'll see that it's about as fast as a Pentium 4 3.6 GHz or Athlon XP 2700. Basically what you want to do is look up how the CPU listed in the system requirements of a game performs in benchmarks (for example on the site I linked to), then compare it to the performance of your own CPU. This is going to be much more useful than just looking at clock speeds, because a 1 GHz CPU can outperform a 3 GHz CPU.
