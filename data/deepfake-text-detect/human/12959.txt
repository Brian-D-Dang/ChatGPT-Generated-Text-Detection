Dr. Nick stared at a dial on his machine. The universe-selector dial on his paradoxical-stasis machine had gotten much use, over the centuries, and he was just about tired of looking at it. He was sick of the whole business, in fact, of finding a new universe to live in. "What was wrong with my old one?!" he had shouted, on many occasions, to some sort of deity that sporadically would live in his head. Dr. Nick had just gotten back from revisiting Xj29-57, a universe that had been far ahead in the running for becoming the one that he might eventually have to chose. For a while, he thought that the purple sky was the only change in that one, but he noticed too that its Earth was soon to be destroyed by a huge comet. "I could live here for the months that it has left, but I don't want to have to leave another Earth. I just want to stay on one," he had thought. With a long, random twist of the knob, Dr. Nick brought about new circumstances that he would find outside the door of his machine, then stepped out once more.
