Was just watching an episode of cops that featured police chases. It seemed in a bunch of these chases cops or the person they were chasing ended up crashing into other vehicles. This did not seem like a reasonable risk to take, especially when some of these people only had a broken tail light or warrants for minor traffic violations. I understand not every situation is the same. If this is your only shot to catch a serial killer, maybe a high speed chase is worth it, but most times it isn't. There is also a high monetary cost associated with these chases. Providing police with vehicles that can keep pursuit. Helicopters to follow vehicles. The damage done to personal property by police or the pursuant. All these costs seem to make it prohibitory to chase after these low level offenders.
