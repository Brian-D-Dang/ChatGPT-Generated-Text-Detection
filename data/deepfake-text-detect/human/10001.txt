White girls very rarely date Asian men. Even in Asia white men are much more popular than Asian men. Even though an Asian guy may have a preference for white girls he doesn't have much of a chance with one so he should instead pursue a non-White girl. Asian guys are penalized by their looks because I don't see them as being significantly less social, athletic, intelligent, wealthy, etc. Facial looks are genetic and cannot be changed easily. Having a fit body helps but not nearly as much as for white or black guys. I wish it weren't true. EDIT: Basically I'm saying Asian men are at a significant disadvantage in the dating scene especially if they are attracted to white women, and most comments so far seem to be confirming that view.
