This one seems so obvious to me but I'll provide the basic points: It is a person's right to do whatever they want with their own body so long as doing so does not infringe on the rights of others. Prostitution is, presumably, an agreement among consenting adults. I'm not trying to defend anything other than exactly this. There is virtually no immediate difference between prostitution and pornography. Simply adding a camera with the intention of creating porn somehow makes the act legal. The reason it is so alarming is that it is a blatant violation of our rights to our own bodies. It's the government tacitly saying they are the ultimate authority as to who we have sex with and under what circumstances it is permitted. Most importantly, since people will do it anyway, making it illegal forces it underground (just like drugs). In the places where it is legal it can be heavily restricted in ways that prevent disease and the rights of the workers can be protected. Since I don't think I've ever heard a single decent argument against this, I'm interested in having this deeply held belief challenged. Edit: I'm having a hard time responding to everybody but I really appreciate everyone's input. My perspective on this issue has increased immensely even if my position hasn't really changed. I no longer think it's "alarming" that the US hasn't shifted it's consensus to my way of thinking. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
