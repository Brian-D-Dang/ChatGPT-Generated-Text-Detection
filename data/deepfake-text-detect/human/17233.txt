Many times in my life, I have been helped out by a neighbor or business owner who left an unsecured or no-password WiFi network. I am aware that this practice is somewhat controversial due to hacking risks, but I have heard friends and neighbors say that if you aren't paying by the byte, there is no harm in allowing others to use your WiFi. Although there are horror stories about people being SWATted by those on their WiFi network, I don't think the risks of that are (statistically) much higher than many other technology risks, including using a guessable password (like 1234) or browsing the Internet on library or Starbucks WiFi. I'd prefer some statistics and would be more likely to award a delta for a statistically demonstrable argument. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
