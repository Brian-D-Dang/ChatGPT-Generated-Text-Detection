Abortion is fine. If you carry the child to term, everything changes. All of your past behavior has now actualized qua physicalmental harm onto another. What was potential harm is now actual harm. In this way, "my body my choice" is an irrelavent argument. Sure, as long as the baby is in your body, the adage applies. But the harm manifests after birth as well, and the past behavior is morally analogous to child abuse (at least in a Utilitarian sense of moral). Judith Jarvis Thompson's "In Defense of Abortion" is my favorite essay of all time, across all essay categories. I believe strongly that earlymid term abortions are 100-ish morally ok. But carrying the child to term means that your past behavior moves from potentially wrong to actually wrong; and the being that was not a moral agent before birth, is now a moral agent after birth. Actions have consequences, and sometimes those consequences occur much later than the actions themselves. The morally ok actions of the substance abusing pre-mother become not morally ok once she has the child. If she aborts, her hands are clean. If she gives birth, now she has committed a crime.
