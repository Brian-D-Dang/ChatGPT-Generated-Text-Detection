GlaxoSmithKline has invested 300 million into Home-DNA-test provider 23andMe. As part of the deal, the pharmaceutical giant will have access to the genetic information of 23andMe's five million customers. 23andMe charges up to 199 for DNA ancestry and health tests. Customers agree to have their DNA used for medical research when they sign up for the tests. Critics of the deal say that it is unfair that 23andMe is making money both from customers and from selling customers' data, and that the problem with customers agreeing to the Terms of Service is that nobody reads the terms before agreeing to them. The deal will last four years, and the companies will split any costs and profits related to any drugs that result from the partnership.
