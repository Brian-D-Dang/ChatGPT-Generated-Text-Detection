The Spice Market buffet was really disappointing. The shrimp, wild mushroom stew, strawberry cream cake and bread pudding were the only redeeming dishes. The crab legs had the frozen seawater taste (at least they were pre cut) and most of the fish in the seafood section were dried out, frozen fish. The grape rolls in the Middle Eastern wasn't even edible. The deserts were marginally better. It was definitely a cop out to have so many cupcakes instead of real deserts. Glad I got a groupon and didn't pay full price for it.
