A lot of people praise the souls franchise for being tough but fair. I disagree, it's tough but very far from being fair. Most enemies have way more health and hit way harder than you which is pretty much the very definition of artificial difficulty. Also most enemies, even bosses have questionable AI at times which makes them easy to exploit meaning that increasing their health pool and stats can give the illusion of difficulty. When I think of true difficulty, I think of fighting games where both parties have pretty much equal stats and both can make the same amount of mistakes before one party wins. It all comes to player skill. But in souls, one mistake from the player can have huge consequences but unfortunately not vice versa. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
