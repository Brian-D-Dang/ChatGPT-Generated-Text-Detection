"We, the jury, find the defendant not guilty." Oh, how sweet those words were. They could agree - they could all agree - that I was the sort of person who could have done it. They saw it on my face, in my eyes. They heard it in the character witnesses. I'd dare say they felt it. They could feel all they want but you can't convict a man on what you fuckin feel! No you can't. No siree. The feds had jumped at me with a handful of evidence and my lawyer, who is going to get a god damn raise, swatted it away. Circumstantial - he had argued. I don't know what that means, and I don't fuckin care! I'm a free man. And I can live. And I can party! Oh, how I'm gon na party. The cops are pissed, no man behind bars means no bonus I bet! Fuckin pigs. Fuck I want to party! I'm going to snort and smoke and drink and fuck! I'm gon na party! I might bring my razor with me again. Find a lil lady. I'll fuck and I'll party. They didn't catch me this time. Didn't even get me in court with the others. I'm gon na party.
