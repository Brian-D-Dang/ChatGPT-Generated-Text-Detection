Islamism, also known as Political Islam (Arabic: slm sysy islam siyasi), is an Islamic revival movement often characterized by moral conservatism, literalism, and the attempt "to implement Islamic values in all spheres of life." Islamism favors the reordering of government and society in accordance with the Shari'a. The different Islamist movements have been described as "oscillating between two poles": at one end is a strategy of Islamization of society through state power seized by revolution or invasion; at the other "reformist" pole Islamists work to Islamize society gradually "from the bottom up." The movements have "arguably altered the Middle East more than any trend since the modern states gained independence," redefining "politics and even borders" according to one journalist (Robin Wright).
