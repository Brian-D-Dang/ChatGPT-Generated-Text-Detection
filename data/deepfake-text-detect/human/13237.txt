I didn't read any of the other ones, so sorry if this was already used June 1, 2015: NRA lauds Markus Greenleaf as hero Earlier this Friday, Chula Vista High School senior Markus Greenleaf stopped a mass shooting nearly before it started. When another student, Jacob McCullagh, fired a semi-automatic rifle into a group of his pears during their lunch break, Mr. Greenleaf pulled out his own hand gun and fired three bullets into Mr. McCullagh's back. Mr. McCullagh is currently in the hospital in critical condition and, while Mr. Greenleaf is being hailed as a hero by his town and taken up by the NRA as a symbol against gun control, it's unknown at this time whether any charges will be filed against him for bringing a fire arm into his school. When questioned, Mr. Greenleaf had this to say: " I don't know, it was all kind of surreal. I mean, I remember pulling the gun out and shooting Jacob, but like, I don't remember deciding to. He was my friend, you know? Everyone keeps calling me and congratulating me. I went from nobody to a hero, and it's kind of strange. I guess I'm still kind of processing what happened. " Mr. Greenleaf refused to comment on why he had brought a fire arm to school, but he was heard muttering under his breath that, he was ] totally gon na get mad pussy for this."
