After watching 4-6 again with my 7yo daughter, I came to the realization that it was more likely that George Lucas was messing with the geeks who love Star Wars than he was actually serious. He's not an (apparently) idiot and he had to have known that the superfluous burp jokes, Jar-Jar Binks, horrific dialogue between Anakin and Amidala I love you more" "No, I do, alternation of Jabba (walking, his band, and more), etc....would be received in the worst possible way. Even if he had not realized this, then surely someone else would have said something if they weren't in on the "conspiracy." So, change my view please. If you can do this and show that he seriously believed these were positive additions, then I can give up Star Wars entirely in good conscience. As it is right now, I think I'll skip showing 1-3 to my kid anyway.
