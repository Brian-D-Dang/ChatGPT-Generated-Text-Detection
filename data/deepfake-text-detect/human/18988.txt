Or at least, the expected course of action for anyone in a position to do it. I have really struggled to express this, so please bear with the poor reasoning, I should be able to answer responses better. We do not elect politicians to give us our morality. We do not change our behaviour to fit into the morality of our elected representatives. The only thing politicians are elected for (in this sense, at least) is to give us laws to follow. If the law allows tax evasion as a perfectly legal thing to do, there is nothing that indicates that we should not do it. Politicians can say, 'Well, that wasn't our intention.' but that's irrelevant, we can't be reading between the lines of what is already a very complicated process. If they want higher tax rates from rich people, they need to change the law. There's no overriding morality to life which dictates a certain tax rate. My morality says, 'Pay the tax rate you are obliged to pay.' I don't consider the morality of politicians to be any more relevant than the average man on the street and their 'intentions' are irrelevant.
