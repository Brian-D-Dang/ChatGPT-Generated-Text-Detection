I'm watching the news, and every day of this past week there has been some shooting in public areas, mostly schools and universities. Every school needs people who can terminate these kinds of inhumane acts as soon as they begin. Having police that take 3 minutes to get to the attack are not helpful. By that time, the shooter has already killed his her targets and most likely shot and killed them self as well. Gun laws won't change anything. Quite a few of these shootings are done with illegally obtained fire arms. And even if we took away every single civilian owned gun, that still wouldn't stop these. People would then make bombs, carry knives, BUILD guns, etc. People who think gun laws will stop these shootings are delusional. It's time to accept the fact that brute force is sometimes needed. Having multiple armed guards at the entrances and exits of every school will help to stop these shootings. If they don't deter the shooter from continuing with his or her plan, then the shooter will still be killed quickly. CMV.
