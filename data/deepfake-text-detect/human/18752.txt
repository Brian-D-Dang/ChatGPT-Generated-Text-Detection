To be clear, I am only talking about the computer aspect of Apple. For example, the Macbook and iMac lines. I could compare spec sheets, but you can do research on your own. I feel that the innovations of the mouse and the UI were amazing, but after they were matched, they didn't have that much to offer. You can get a PC with the same specs as a Mac for half the price. Their software is interesting, but not game-changing. I feel that they have peaked, and are in a decline with the computer market. They have good products, but not good enough to constitute their respective price tags. CMV.
