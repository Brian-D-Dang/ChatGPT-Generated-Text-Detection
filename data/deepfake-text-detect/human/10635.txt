Your weight will naturally fluctuate from one day to the next, due to a number of factors. I'd chalk this up to the fact that you're actually checking your weight more consistently when starting your diet, so you notice the upswings. Weight is going to be different depending on morning or night, your personal schedule, whether you just ate a 2-pound steak.... don't sweat a few pounds increase right at the start.,Which diet are you using? Different diets have different effects on the body.
