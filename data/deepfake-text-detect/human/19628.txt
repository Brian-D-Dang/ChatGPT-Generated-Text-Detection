I'd like to point out that I don't think my fear is based on an individual level, I'm scared of their nations as a whole, and the subjugation they force onto their populace. It scares me that one day the single culturesociety that survives on Earth is one that suppresses creativity and stifles originality. It's most likely irrational but I really can't shake the feeling that there is a real danger to other cultures being 'assimilated' by China or other Asian nations. There might be one day when China says 'Screw it, I'm not manufacturing anything for anyone but myself anymore' what can we do then?. This probably stems from unpleasant encounters with mostly Chinese people. they seem to have no passion for actually creating things, they complete tasks to win. This might include the Olympics, e-sports or education. They never seem to enjoy the process of creating something simply for the sake of creation, only the end result.
