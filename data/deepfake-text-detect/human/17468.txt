Some people rant about how the internet is decreasing the amount of face to face contact that people are having and how this will ruin society or something like that. I do agree with the premise that the internet is decreasing face to face contact, but disagree with the statement that this will ruin society. For one, I am an internet citizen and so are a lot of my friends. The internet is where we converse, where we share, and basically where we live. This does not weaken our relationship. I think it makes it stronger because the barrier of distance and time is almost entirely erased. Friends that have moved away, friends that I have not seen in months, years even, are still close to me and my heart. Even friends that I can see in real life communicate with me over the internet. It opens up new channels of communication, not break them down. EDIT: What I mean by "face to face" is real life interaction.
