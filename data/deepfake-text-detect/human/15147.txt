Lunch by the pool on a beautiful day is rather enjoyable at the Four Seasons. It is secluded enough to give diners and swimmers some privacy, but still be out in the warm sunshine. The food is what surprised me. I got the salmon salad and shared the tuna three ways. My friend got the crab cake sliders and it was all delicious. The crab retained its texture and did not gum together like one which is made of all bread crumbs. The aioli is on the heavy side. The salmon was cooked to perfection. A beautiful medium with a nice warm center. It broke apart without flaking everywhere. The use of dressing was light and the flavors of the artichoke and other vegetables were present. The tuna three ways was okay. I am not a huge roll type of person, so I could do without it. The upside was that they did not skimp of the center. It was predominantly spicy tuna. The poke was decent. Nothing spectacular. The thick slices seared was the best of the offerings.
