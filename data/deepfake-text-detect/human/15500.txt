Let me preface this review with a couple of things: 1. I went on a Monday at 3pm, so probably not the most ideal time to see the freshest foods and most attentive staff, but less people to fight with to get to the food 2. I live in Manhattan so I am spoiled by knowing what good food and service are 3. I understand that a buffet, even an expensive buffet will never meet the quality of a decent restaurant With all that said, the variety and quality of food was JUST BARELY OK, after seeing several reviews I guess my expectations got a little too high. Also of note I found a HAIR in my gravy, when I mentioned it to the waitress her extremely caviler response was some thing to the effect of OK, I let them know. No I'm so sorry or I really apologize, NOTHING. All in all not a great experience, but if you want a large quantity of food you can't beat it for 20 bucks
