This is what is inspiring this post: I live a block away from my university campus. I ride my bike to school. If I'm not wearing a helmet, sure enough, a traffic cop will be waiting for me to hand me a ticket. They claim the ticket is to remind me to be safe. But I cant help but think that it's simply condoned robbery. I'm riding my bike like 20 kmph down a suburban road. Nevermind the fact that I don't need, and never asked for, someone else to make my decisions for me. I think my anger might be clouding my judgement, so I decided to make this post. CMV?
