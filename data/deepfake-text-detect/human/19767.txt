I understand the practical implications. I suppose I would support some sort of phasing out, starting with the most obvious crimes against nature, like SeaWorld, zoos, petting zoos, exotic pets. There's this truck stop about 20 minutes from where I live that keeps a live tiger in a concrete cell. About the size of a bedroom, with a hose to cool off. Day in and day out he paces up and down, listening to the sounds of the cars on the interstate and children who are brought to gawk before they go in to piss and buy an icee. I oppose any sort of animal ownership. I don't oppose sightseeing tours, like safaris and nature trails and the like, but I think that one day the ownership and use of animals will seem as barbaric as owning a human. This means using animals as house pets, for labor (as in llamas, camels, horses, dog sleds), for consumption (we could, in a generation or two, feed the world on a vegetarian diet much more efficiently than a meat-centered one) and yeah any time an animal is kept for show, whether it is pageantry like a circus or just naturalistic like a zoo. As far as animals that do actual work, like k-9 units and service dogs etc, humanity would just have to transition to using people for those skills. Sure, we can't sniff out cocaine, but I think if we put our heads together we could find an alternative. Finally, the real focus here is captivity. An animal should not be kept against their will, whether by conditioning or a real barrier of some sort. For the record, I own a cat. He is very old and I am pretty sure that after he dies I will not get another. At the very least I would never get anything other than a rescue.
