The racist lady on the tram that was arrested a while ago in London, I think it is wrong to arrest someone for their views, no matter how stupid they might be. Also with the guy on twitter who was racist against the football player and got arrested, I too think that was wrong. It might just be because I am American, and I think freedom of speech is extremely great to have (I'm not saying that Britain doesn't have freedom of speech, but it does seem limited in some aspects), even if it produces nuts like Westboro. So, CMV!
