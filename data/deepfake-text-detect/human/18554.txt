Hey, I'm from Germany and my English is not so good so ill just work with bulletpoints. This is why i think the death sentence is wrong and should be abolished: Innocent people have been convicted and executed. The death penalty is incompatible with human rights and human dignity (Even the guilty have a right to life) Killing is wrong There is a better way to help the families of murder victims (executions do not help these people heal nor do they end their pain) Capital punishment goes against almost every religion.
