Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or other easily lethal weapon, they have no place in society and have a fundamental defect in their human brain chemistry (without even touching on the trauma and psychological damage the victims must suffer). To me, this type of crime shows an extreme amount of depravity. You're brandishing a weapon, ready to kill a person you do not even know, for short term profit. This especially applies to home invasions and store robberies. The reason I added the'positively identified' caveat is that I don't want to leave any room for putting an innocent person to death, so for this case to kick in, I would need either CCTV confirming their identity, or multiple eye witnesses confirming their identity. I'm willing to admit this view may be on the extreme side, but I like to think I'm a reasonable person and I'm open to change. So reddit, please CMV. EDIT: I should have clarified, please assume LOADED weapons or a knife, and the offender is NOT a juvenile. To me, these are different cases and do not deserve the death penalty. Hello, users of CMV!
