For those not familiar, [uplift] is the term used to refer to genetic engineering of animals with the intent of endowing them with human abilities, such as speech and higher level thinking skills. My main argument for this position is the fact that humans are extremely vulnerable, as a result of our limited biodiversity. A single genetically engineered plague could bring our species to (near) extinction. Our species may very well be the only sentient species that will ever emerge spontaneously in the universe, and thus, any path that reduces potential existential threats against intelligence has to be pursued. The first candidates for uplifting would be chimpanzees, followed by gorillas, orangutans, cetaceans, elephants, and eventually including ravens, parrots, pigs, dogs, octopuses, and other species. I suspect Moore's law will come to an end earlier than we would like it to, and thus, super-human intelligence would likely have to be biological in nature. Therefore, in the final stage of the uplifting process, we will transform fungal Mycelium into functional neural networks, giving birth to practically immortal forests deities of super-human intelligence that consciously regulate the health of the biosphere.
