I brought my wife in here for a few drinks and we shared some of the tots. Amazing! our server was Kerri and she was terrific. very friendly and personable from the get go. she recommended the tots and paired me a beer with it. that was really nice, because most servers couldnt even tell you whats oj the menu let alone make a good oairing suggesstion. I've been in the industry for a while and she's what I would call a killer. I'd definitely come back with my boys to watch some football!
