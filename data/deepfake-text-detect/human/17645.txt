A lot of people on the left claim that saying "thug" is the same thing as the "N-Word," and claim that it's just offensive. I, even though am a liberal, disagree. [Article that criticises the usage of the word thug] The definition of "thug" is: a violent person, especially a criminal. With the synonyms of: ruffian, hooligan, vandal, hoodlum, gangster, villain, criminal When someone says "thug" or any of the synonyms, I don't think they are referring to a race of people. Actually, I've heard the term "thug" to describe corrupt politicians, CEOs, and other people in power. I do, however, believe that "ghetto" is pretty racist, but that's a different argument. In my opinion, whenever the media uses the word "thug," I don't think they're being racist. I think they're often talking about people who commit violent crimes, regardless of race. For those who STILL think it's bad as the N-Word; Have anyone of you ever heard the term "thug" to describe a law-abiding PoC (person of color)? I know I haven't. But I have heard racist people call Obama and other law-abiding PoC the N-Word. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
