It's Thursday. Who decides to throw a party on a Thursday? That's not what matters though. She'll be there. I'll manage to find a way to impress her. She has the prettiest eyes overpowering all logical thought. Maybe she'll talk to me tonight. I should probably start drinking, I don't want to be the only sober person. Ah. That's better. Maybe another shot, for good luck. There's my confidence, I was wondering where it had been hiding! I can't believe how well this is going. She's talking to me and I'm actually making her laugh. She even told her friend she thinks I'm cute! I shouldn't stop now, I'd hate to loose this amazing buzz. Hey! Who put that door there? She's laughing again. She has an amazing laugh. Whoa! It's getting difficult to walk without hitting things. I hope I remember this. Where did she go? Did she leave already? How did I get here? Will I remember this? I wish I knew what happened next, but to be honest, no one does. They said they found me on my back, by a road. My shoes were off and my eyes were open. I guess it's one of the better ways to go. The suffocation was painless. I don't even remember it. I guess my brain ceased to function and everything else was lost. I could have woken up on the floor like everyone else, but I didn't. The closest you'll ever come to knowing what it was like for me, is waking up after a night like that. You'll see how easily you could have slipped to the other side. Never knowing how it happened, what became of your friends and family, or her. As for what's it's like here? There's nothing here. Just emptiness.
