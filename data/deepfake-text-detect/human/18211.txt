If you put the toilet paper roll on the spindle so that the paper comes out from on top, it is easier to roll the paper out as fast or as slowly as you'd like, and it's easy to control the amount of paper you need. It's easier to see when you first want the paper. It's more convenient to grab. And after you've taken a sufficient amount of paper, having it come out from on top means it's harder for the toilet paper to hang too low and touch the floor. It is not only unwise but a grievous ethical infraction against god and man to put the toilet paper on the spindle so that it comes out from the bottom. People who do this are insensitive, unsanitary, and quite possibly minions brought to Earth from the darkest bowels of Hades to inflict pain, misery, and death upon all good men and women. Change.
