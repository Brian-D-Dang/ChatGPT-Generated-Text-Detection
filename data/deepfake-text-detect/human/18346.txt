Disclaimer: I love Pokemon, always have since it first came out. The games have been an enormous part of my life (I had to learn to read in order to play Blue) and I would never discourage someone from playing them. My opinion that I would like changed is that at its core, pokemon is about enslaving a team of creatures to destroy someone else's team of enslaved creatures. The way I see it is even if you were argue that it is about the love between master and pokemon, it boils down to the fact that I love my awesomely powerful poke-death machine of a gyrados for its ability to destroy all who stand in our way. Also pokeballs. A snorlax in a pokeball is on par with leaving your dog in the car on a hot day. Also please don't try to change my view with a mountain of text stating how awesome pokemon is. Trust me, I know. CMV!
