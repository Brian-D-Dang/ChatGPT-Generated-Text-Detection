I think that the root of all problems is not having enough resources to survive, and that is mainly because there's an absurd accumulation of wealth at the very top. If all of the world agreed on putting a cap on the accumulation of wealth of every single person, say of about 1 million dollars, that would drastically reduce the price of basic needs (since you could no longer profit from an excess margin), and would make a more even distribution of said wealth. The resources that now aren't hoarded could be funneled through the state to provide free health, education, security, etc. Edit 1: The 1 million dollars as cap was meant only to begin discussion. Some people are taking it too literally and arguing against the million dollars as opposed to arguing against the cap. If you want, make any number below M1,000 as the cap and go with it. Edit 2: You have convinced me that putting a cap is no easy fix at all, there are too many variables to take into account, however, having some kind of soft cap as uPraetorianFury suggested, equally enforced worldwide, would be the best way to go.
