Gwent Police said it was "extremely concerned" after five incidents potentially linked to heroin were reported between 23 October and Friday. They happened in Caerphilly, Newport and Blaenau Gwent. Det Insp Leigh Mears said he "cannot rule out the possibility that the deaths and the medical emergencies are linked to the same batch of heroin." He added: "The use of heroin is of course illegal, but I would urge anyone using the drug to be especially cautious and vigilant. "If they experience any unusual symptoms after taking drugs, they should seek medical attention immediately."
