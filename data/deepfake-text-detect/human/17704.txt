I hate it when people flip shit about horse meat. "That's inhumane!" "Do you know what they do to horses after their racing careers?" How is it any different from cows? If a cow had less bulk and stronger legs, wouldn't it be able to run and jump obstacles just like a horse? Looking for somebody with some background with both animals to change my perspective
