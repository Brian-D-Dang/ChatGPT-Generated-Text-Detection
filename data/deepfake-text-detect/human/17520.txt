I have always heard that NASCAR is a boring and unskilled sport. I used to think the same thing until I started to follow it and understand the dynamics of drafting, team driving, and spotters. It is the only driving sport that can consistently have 4 racers side by side during a corner. The fact that it is not open wheeled makes it much more close quarters and allows slight contact while racing. In F1, slight contact means you are more than likely out of the race and in Rally Cross, they mostly race time trials. The few times I've seen Rally in a side by side comp is very exciting but limited to 6 or fewer cars. The main complain that I see is that they just drive around in circles all day. Fine, but they drive around in circles more efficiently and faster than any other drivers on the planet possibly could in their car setup. They also have a few road courses sprinkled throughout where specialist drivers like Boris Said compete and do well, but don't always win. In fact, Jeff Gordon, a HoF worthy NASCAR driver, is an excellent road coarse driver as well as a great speedway artist. I think NASCAR gets the short end of the stick when it comes to talent evaluation and respect. These guys are incredible at what they do and even though it's somewhat boring to watch at times, it doesn't mean it's not extremely hard. Hello, users of CMV!
