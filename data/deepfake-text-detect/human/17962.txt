Hi everyone!! Ive had many hours of debates with my fellow colleagues about this matter. I believe that hydro power is a lot better than wind power, for the following reasons: 1. Cheaper. While it may cost a lot to build a dam, its a lot lot more cheaper in the long run with low service costs. 2. More efficient. Hydropower will produce a lot more electricity, for a lot lower price. It can produce electricity all year round, and it produces a lot more electricity too. 3. Doesnt have to be shut down. Wind power must be shut down if there is too much wind. 4. Not effected by extreme weather. Storms can damage wind powers. 5. Noisy and threat to wild life. They are super loud, and can kill birds. Not to mention they are ugly to look at. 6. Locational. Wind power cant be places everywhere, they have to be put in hilly areas or coastline. 7. Consistency Wind doesnt always blow consistently, while water always flows as it should. What dou you think, rchangemyview? Am I wrong? Please change my view, i am really looking forward to hear what you say. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
