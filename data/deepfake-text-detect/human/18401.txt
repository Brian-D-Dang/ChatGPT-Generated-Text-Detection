This has been bothering me for a very, very long time. I grew up in the 80s and early 90s. I have never liked Blondie. The music is mediocre, pretty much standard for the 1980s. Fender Stratocaster with some chorus, a little keyboards. It's not bad, but it's certainly not groundbreaking. Worse, the lyrics are purely awful. The rap from "Rapture" is god awful. "One way or another" is repetitive and irritating. This band isn't more than the sum of its parts, it's worse than the sum of its parts. Yet somehow I have never been able to find a single bad word written about Blondie. Am I somehow strange for thinking that they're crap? Explain to me why Blondie is worthy of being listed among bands of the 80s that were actually good.
