It has long been my opinion that our current system of 'law' should be replaced with a more simple, easy to read, and most importantly easy to access code. In a way this means common law should be replaced with civil. It's 2014 - there should be a very simple and straight forward legal .gov website that has the be all and end all to the law. What you see (read) is what you get. This would lead into the next step - getting rid of lawyers. If the legal system is simple and straight forward, the need for lawyers would be none. We live in a society where the rich benefit because of higher lawyer budgets. But no more. The law should be structured in a way where silly semantic and other dirty 'tricks' cannot be used to manipulate the law in the traditional hollywood way. (I said hollywood, but these things happen in reality quite often, especially when dealing with large corporations). Answers to some possible concerns: 1) What's if you're deaf, blind, slow, injured, etc? Obviously hand-picked provisions should be made. Public defenders could be utilized for this purpose specifically. 2) How about suing a company, who gets to represent it in the court room? I would say the CEO but that probably isn't always fair. Whoever is most responsible for the accusation. 3) Wouldn't this system favour more intelligent or more law-informed people? Given my fair and straight forward system, it should be every citizen's job to be aware of their countries laws. Of course none of this will ever happen, but I think it could be a massive improvement over the current system. With some tweaks, surely.
