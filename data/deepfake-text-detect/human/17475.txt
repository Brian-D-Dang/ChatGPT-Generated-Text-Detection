Everything we see to be of value in life, eventually ends. For example, friendships eventually end, love eventually ends, social status suddenly disappears (remember your highschool graduation?). People will eventually disappear, they will go their own paths. You will go your own path, you will take up a career, maybe start a business or undertake scientific research, but eventually we're going to all die anyway, whats the point of that research when we're dead? Our children are going to die too one day What's the use in spending your time working when in the end, what your working for, your cause, will come to an end? I believe that the pursuit of worldly joys, such has falling in love, working hard, maintaining friendships and taking care of yourself is really not worth the hassle as eventually all these things, love, friends and your job will come to an end and become meaningless.
