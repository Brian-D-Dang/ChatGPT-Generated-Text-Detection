For the sake of sounding reasonable and fair, most people say that FOX news is the right and MSNBC is the left and that all of them are terrible. I think it is a false comparison. Firstly, I'd like to point out that MSNBC doesn't do it for me for news. I watch Al Jazeera, TYT (for punditry), and NPR. Another thing is that MSNBC cannot be described as one channel. (Like fox) Some shows seem to be a mouthpiece for the DNC and some shows have the best, most honest dialogue I'd hope for in a political discussion show. MSNBC doesn't get facts wrong as much as Fox. Yes they are progressive, and their commentary on race issues (and not every race issue) can be really unbearable, but their discussions are far more valuable than the others.
