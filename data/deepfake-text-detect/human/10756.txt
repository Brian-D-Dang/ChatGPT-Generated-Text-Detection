Psychology student here to disappoint you! Because we're all unique. Simple as that. Some need more sleep, some need less. The human brain (hell, any brain) is a very complex organ and most of the time, we have no idea what's going on there and why. E: Downvotes for facts? Sorry I couldn't deliver on telling all kinds of cool lies.," "I think in 95 of the cases, the people who are claiming to sleep well with 4 hours are either lying or have no frame of reference to realize they're feeling shitty. When I was in high school I regularly functioned on 4 hours of sleep, but as an adult, I look back and have no fucking clue how I managed that. In a few cases, some people have adjusted their sleep schedules so that they fall straight into REM sleep apparently you can cut your sleep down to just a couple of hours worth of well timed naps. Not sure how well this actually works, but some people vouch for it.
