Now let me preface this by saying that you will never meet a more avid enjoyer of steak than me, but its been dawning on me for some time that I'm essentially allowing animals to die for my own selfish pleasure. There is essentially no reason for me to eat meat beyond my own selfish desires. I don't need it to survive and can easily get all nutrients that I get from meat from other sources. Regardless of how humanely the animals are killed (which we all know is often not very humanely at all) the fact of the matter is that a living, breathing and at the very least partially sentient being is being killed for our pleasure, it's simply unnecessary for our survival any longer.
