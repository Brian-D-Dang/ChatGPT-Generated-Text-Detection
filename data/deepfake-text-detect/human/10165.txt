So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view. 1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal at us there most likely nothing we could do to stop the missiles from destroying us. This essentially means we have lost at this point and there's nothing we can do about it. To launch the nukes at that point becomes an act of revenge accomplishes absolutely nothing for anyone. 2: To launch these nukes hurts innocent people in whatever country attacked us who likely had no choice in the launches and causes us to sink down to the level that the agressing country sits at. 3: Returning fire almost certainly bears the promise of environmental collapse and in doing so dooms everyone on the planet as well as billions of species of plants and animals. If we don't launch and instead let ourselves be hit we still have the possibility of saving the world entire. If I remember any of my other points I will edit them into the main post.
