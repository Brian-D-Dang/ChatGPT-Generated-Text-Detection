I will tell you why this particular question has really interested me recently. My partner is OBSESSED with those cheesy mysteryunexplained programs with lots of slow pans into old black and white photos, creepy audio recordings and other 'unexplained ghostly activity' which as my wife informs me 'undoubtedly proves' the existence of the paranormal. But in all these types of shows i've been forced to sit through over these years not one has actually produced a case, situation or REAL shown evidence that factually proves above reasonable doubt the existence of the paranormal in particular ghosts. To try and make things as clear as possible to what i'm asking, by evidence I don't mean 'take a look at this ghost caught on video on youtube' I mean anything (which could actually in theory include a video) that has been studied or scientifically verified with all other possible causes ruled out. This isn't just to prove something to the significant other, I generally would like to have my view challenged or possibly changed!
