I think that all humans deserve the same amount of respect, all else being equal. In other words, if I don't know you at all, my respect for you won't change based on your gender, orientation, race, religion, etc (If I do know you, and you give me reason to increase or decrease my respect for you, I will, of course). I think that referring to people based on their accomplishment is just fine being the First Person in Space is a grand title for Yuri Gagarin. But why is he referred to as the first man in space? To me, calling Valentina Tereshkova the First Woman in space simply emphasizes her difference she's female instead of her accomplishment. If we're all supposed to treat everyone equally regardless of race, nationality, gender, orientation, religious views, etc; wouldn't referring someone as the first whatever to do something simply remind everyone that the difference is still there, and make it that much more difficult to ignore in the future? EDIT: My V has been C'd! I see that the social impact of the accomplishment is equally important, and we need to recognize what these people had to go through in order to actually get there! I do think, though, that these types of titles will slowly become irrelevant for future accomplishments, and eventually will be relegated only to the history books. Hello, users of CMV!
