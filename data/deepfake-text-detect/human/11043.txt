There's an effect called surface tension where water molecules at the surface are attracted to each other. This surface tension causes droplets of water to stay in droplet form. As more water is added to the drop, it's mass increases and therefore the force of gravity pulling it down increases as well. The drop stays where it is until the force of gravity pulling it down is greater than the surface tension holding it together, at which point it drips off.
