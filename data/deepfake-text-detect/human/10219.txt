A political party leader has a duty to serve their country via their government or via their opposition (if they have not won election to government). Losing an election does not prevent a good leader from leading, it merely humbles them, but losing an election will cause a bad leader to give up. In the UK 3 major political party leaders gave up on Friday when they should be using their leadership skills and good vision to lead the opposition to keep the government accountable. If they had won the election I presume that they would not have retired. which makes it very evident that the leaders of the losing parties did not have leadership skills andor a good vision but merely wanted to win for the sake of power. edit: This has already been eye-opening, there are details which I did not know before coming to light and for that reason I feel compelled to pronounce multiple delta's just for the nuance points which have changed my understanding although not necessarily my wider view; I'm not even sure if that's allowed. I have to go now, but I will read all the comments and get back to this tomorrow. Thank you. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
