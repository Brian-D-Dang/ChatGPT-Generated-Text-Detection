Liberals have been going on since the trial ended about how disgusting it is that he was let free and keep posting all these stupid articles on social media sites that try to show how ridiculous it is. I am quite to the left, but I have not one ounce in me that feels that Trayvon Martin should be getting any sympathy at this point. There are facts that show he had stolen goods in his locker, had robbery tools, and the skittles and tea he was bringing home were 23 of the ingredients to a comatosing drink called "Lean," which he had been discussing with people on the internet. I find all this to be just convincing that George Zimmerman probably should have just sat his ass down and called the police, but did absolutely nothing wrong and that Trayvon was not a good person. EDIT: My post my have caused some confusing, but when referencing the stolen goods and the lean ingredients, I am making a point that liberals have made him out to be an angel, straight up, good kid. When in reality, he was a thief and experimented with drugs. I am just here to ask why liberals, whom I almost always side with, are really going on like these things don't exist.
