A team of engineers in Korea has designed a new Virtual Reality glove that can create the sensation of touch when manipulating digital objects. VR gloves are not new, but they typically focus on creating a sense of texture, rather than shape. The new VR gloves have a small air bubble encased in a thin silicone skin at the fingertips which can change shape when an electric current is applied to the silicone. In a test, the engineers used the gloves to pick up a virtual knight from a computerized chessboard. They described being able to feel the knight's shape and being able to pick up the object and hold it, demonstrating that the glove's sensors can stay'on' over periods of time.
