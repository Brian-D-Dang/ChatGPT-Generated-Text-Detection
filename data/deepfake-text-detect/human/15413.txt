Walked in here looking for a cute skirt for my birthday dinner. First thing that caught my attention was the really weird smell. It was like foul cleaner and BO. Totally gross. Sucked it up and looked around since they had some cute clothes. Nothing is really in any kind of order, so I literally circled the store 3 times and found skirts in different places each time. Kind of bothersome to me. I never spoke to anyone and none of the employees spoke to me. I wasn't in the mood to chitchat, but it didn't look like they approached ANY customers. So heads up for those who don't like to ask for help. Quality of fabric isn't spectacular on most garments, and seems like it wouldn't last too many washings - unless you hand-washed it perhaps. The dresses are pretty cute, though, and I may come back to try some on for a wedding in the future. On second thought.... I don't want my clothes to smell like the store. Scratch that. Um.... Good lighting?
