As the title says I consider myself a Scientific Skeptic. I think that Conspiracy theories, Alternative Medicine, creationism, 911 truthers, religion, power bracelets and the like are a major problem in the first world and they the world would be a much better place if people were better critical thinkers. I'm very interested by conspiracy Theorists, 911 truthers and holocaust deniers because they believe that they are doing the same thing, but they are often prone to logical fallacies, accepting poor evidence. So I'm interested in what other people think and why I shouldn't believe this and why I should believe what you believe.
