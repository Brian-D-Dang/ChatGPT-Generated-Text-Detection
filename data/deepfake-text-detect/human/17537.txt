I've spent so much time studying in college to get good grades, and learning programming that I've completely neglected any interaction with real people. I've substituted most human contact for some ghost of it via social networks such as reddit. However, I can never seem to have fun going out and being friendly with people for the same of being friendly. Every time I attempt to have intelligent conversation with another human, I realize that I'm not on the Internet, where 95 of the world's knowledge is at. So naturally I go right to my phone or laptop to look something up (back where I started). Every time I go on subs like rseduction, I get told that I have to spend years of free time reading books, working out, hangout out at bars night clubs, getting to know random people. And not for any direct benefit to myself, but just for the chance to meet a girl that I might like. I'd love to hear about folks who have found the healthy intersection between career social life, where they can truly say they are in perfect balance. But I honestly think that anyone who has a healthy social life does not actually have very much financial ambition. The only way I can see this equation balancing is if someone actually manages to "make it big" and finally set some time away for themselves. Otherwise, you're short selling yourself in one of these two areas.
