I've long struggled with this and I'd like to here some strong arguments from the other side. I know the benefits of abortion to society, but I can't justify them simply because the net gain is positive - that's opening Pandora's box to me. For me, just because a human cannot survive on it's own, doesn't mean we shouldn't protect them. Granted, I have absolutely no problem with suicide, so this isn't a religious "sanctity of life" issue. I simply believe that since there can be no informed decision made by the fetus, we have an obligation to protect it. It's an odd issue for me, I want to make abortion legal and easily accessible from a society standpoint, but I can't reach that position due to moral complications. So change my view.
