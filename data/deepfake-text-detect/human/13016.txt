'T is better to light, that candle right there Than curse in the dark, or so it was said I too was once told, the life of the dead Pitch black nothing else, by he without prayer So how can it be, that one is not more Righteous and noble, the other so vile In order for light, to shine all the while Darkness is needed, let's tally the score . But then I reflect, how the dark is come Who lit the light up, both the stars and sun I think of something, much greater than we Could ever imagine, us parts of that sum Yet't is one they share, like daughter and son A great Creator, still greater harm'ny Thanks for reading "And God Said, "Let There Be Darkness....." And It, Too, Was Good"! More of my work at rSocratesBurrito. I welcome constructive criticism and advice.
