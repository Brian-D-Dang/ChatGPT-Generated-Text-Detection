Example Context: I'm not sure where I stand on this issue, however I'm leaning towards the opinion that it's not immoral to earn money by hoarding products that are in limited supply such as the iPhone 6 as seen in the link above. The rationale being that the free market would automatically stabilize the price to a point that is fair for the buyer as well as the seller. The other side of the argument is that this kind of a business adds little to no value to the product. There is something about it that just doesn't feel right. EDIT: To clarify, hoarding of basic necessities that would endanger someone's life is not in the scope of my question.
