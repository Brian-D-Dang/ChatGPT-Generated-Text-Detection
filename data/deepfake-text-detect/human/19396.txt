It's bad if there is a big income divide between the rich and poor, but I don't see why that's always a problem. If there are adequate systems for poor people to escape poverty (such as education) then there is nothing wrong with a broad income spectrum. It's fucking awesome for a country to have lots of rich people, because they're able to pay for cool shit like good schools and good roads. People act like it's a big deal that the middle class is being split between those who are wealthy and those who aren't, but that just means there are more rich people. As most universities give huge financial aid scholarships, poor kids who are able study hard and succeed in school have amazing opportunities in tertiary education. I think income inequality is probably one of the least important big issues facing the United States. I'd rate the most important issues as: 1. Climate change 2. Corporate dominance over US politics 3. Gerrymandering 4. Rights for GSM (gender and sexuality minority) people 5. Prison system problems 6. Minority rights 7. Military action overseas 8. Increasing college tuition 9. Tax breaks and other benefits to the already-wealthy 10. Income inequality Change my view? Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
