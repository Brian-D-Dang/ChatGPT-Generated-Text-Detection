I had a difficult time coming up with a title for this...let me clarify what it is that I'd like for someone to CMV for: Opponents of welfare programs state that though many people on welfare are able to live a financially stable life wo assistance, they choose not to. Essentially that we are coddling them and that if we stopped giving them hand-outs, they would be able to carry on with their lives without it and maybe even lift themselves out of their situation. I think that welfare programs (in the US, at least) are already structured in a way that incentivizes work. Can someone convince me that cutting people from welfare may actually lead to those people, now without assistance, moving on to better financial situations? Is there any data that supports the idea that gov. welfare enables poverty? edit 1: Sorry if my word choice is poor. uDystopiamorph suggested encourages rather enabled and I feel that that word is closer to what I'm wanting to discover edit 2: (copy and pasted from a reply to ucaw81) An example of something that could change my view would be if the following study was done: Randomexample State votes to cut food stamps for X number of families. One year later, get information on those X number of families and see if they were either a) Around the same or better financial condition as a year ago or b) deeper in poverty. If the study shows that it is 'a', that wouldn't match up with what I already believe to be true and it would change my view
