Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 1000 songs in our library. Not to mention, iTunes is the only thing that will properly communicate with my Apple product that I use for music. I realize you can download pretty much as much music as you want, but to get that, you have to pay. Whereas iTunes is free. I'm not really the type of person who's into discovering brand new music all the time. Occasionally, I'll expand my horizons until I find an artist who really sticks, and then I'll play the crap out of their music until I'm pretty much sick of it. Back in the day, when I had a Zune to play music, they had a similar feature where you could pay a fixed subscription fee to download as much music as you wanted for free. Even back then, an offer like this didn't pique my interest. Knowing this, are there any standout features that evolve the listening experience so much that I'd be willing to abandon my iTunes library and start over again? Edit: I've decided that I want to experiment with Spotify and at least try it out. Thank you to all the people who replied. You all gave really helpful information. Also, a side note, this is one of my very first posts and, by miles, my most commented on one. So thank you for the good conversation as well.
