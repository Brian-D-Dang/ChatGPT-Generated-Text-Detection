The reddish-brown'scars' that form on the surface of Jupiter's moon Europa are actually etched into the layer of water ice that covers the surface of a potentially habitable subsurface ocean. It is thought that the cracks form when Jupiter tugs at Europa and breaks the ice apart. In 2000, the Galileo probe found that there were fewer than expected fast-moving protons in the vicinity of the moon. Scientists found that some of this proton depletion was due to a plume of water vapor shooting out into space. These plumes could hold information about what lies beneath Europa's icy surface. The European Space Agency is planning to launch a probe in 2022 to investigate Jupiter and its moons. It will arrive in the Jupiter system in 2029 and it will be able to collect samples to study these plumes.
