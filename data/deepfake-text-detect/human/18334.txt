In the past there was no paid work as each family was a subsistence farming family. Then paid work was created by specialization. With increased automation there is worry that there will be high unemployment. To increase employment many tasks that are are non-paid could be prohibited for a variety of health and safety reasons. Some examples include: Require parents that teach at home to have a teachers license which improves education and increase jobs at schools Prohibit washing your car at home to reduce [water pollution] and increase jobs at car washes Allow sale of auto parts and oil to only licensed mechanics for car safety and increased jobs for mechanics Prohibit sale of paint except to licensed painters which reduces grafitti and increases jobs for [licensed painters] My view would be changed if this would lower total GDP.
