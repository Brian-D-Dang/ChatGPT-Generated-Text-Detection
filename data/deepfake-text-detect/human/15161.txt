I couldn't wait to try this place yesterday, I was just craving something different. Darn, I wanted to like it so much but........................ I got one of their steak dishes which came with chimichurri sauce, white rice, spicey beans, french fries, plaintains and two fried eggs. I told them to skip the eggs and I was to get extra beans. Well I dont think I barely got one helping of beans and spicey they were not. The steak was over cooked, and couldn't taste any chimichurri. The plaintains were the only thing good, they were sweet, soft and fried just right.
