I come from a family that makes a low income, and neither of my parents have went to college, nor even finished high school (they're from Mexico, now living in the U.S.). I'm a smart kid, based on the classes I've taken from high school and the grades I've gotten. I'm convinced college is the only way to be successful, even though it's something I can't afford.
