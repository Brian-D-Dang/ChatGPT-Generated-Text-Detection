I believe that networking being the most important part of finding a job (for example "who you know is more important than what you know is terrible for people and terrible for the job market in general. Landing a job shouldn't be about who you know or the fact that you have some thin connection to a higher-up; it should be about being the most qualified or outstanding candidate for the job. The fact that networking gets many people into positions where they may not be the most qualified means that the better applicant's skills aren't being used. Today, knowing someone and using them as an entrance into a job field is more important than being more qualified. I have heard people say this in classes of mine as well as career seminars. I recognize that it is extremely important today and I have used this tactic to get a job, though I still think that it is wrong and detrimental. Merit should be the only factor in determining employment.
