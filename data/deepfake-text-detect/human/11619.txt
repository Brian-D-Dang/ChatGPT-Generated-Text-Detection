A researcher from the Swiss research institute EMPA has developed an invisible lock system that uses conductive ink on a transparent polymer film to create invisible buttons. The result is a lock mechanism with no obvious way for it to be opened. It can be integrated with existing systems. A short video about the lock mechanism is available in the article. The technology is scalable, so the lock could be used for doors and other building entrances.
