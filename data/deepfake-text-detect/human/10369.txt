When the german leaders were put on trial after WWII, They claimed they were just following orders but it was decided that this was not good enough. Hitler could have had them and their children killed for refusing to obey orders. soldiers who refused orders were killed and their families received no help from the state and suffered penalties. so why wasn't this a good defence? were they legally supposed to be martyrs? You can't legally force someone to allow themselves and their families to diesuffer badly even if it means saving others lives obligatory "obligatory wow gold?" Hello, users of CMV!
