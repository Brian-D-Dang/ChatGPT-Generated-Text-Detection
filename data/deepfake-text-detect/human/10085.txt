I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most of the reason women are given a reputation for taking ages to ready themselves, and given that I think it's unnecessary, it's actually a waste of time no matter how long it takes. 2) It's harmful. Not only physically, where it may causes skin problems, headaches, premature aging, cancer, allergies, other skin diseases, and other things, but it can be harmful to the self-image of the woman wearing makeup, making them dependent upon the makeup, feeling ugly without it, etc. 3) It's disingenuous. I think of it as false advertising. Celebrities are a big indication of this to me, many of them don't look particularly nice without makeup on, and with regular women the drop in attractiveness without makeup is generally even more noticeable. This is all that comes to mind at the moment. CMV. EDIT: Sorry, there's tons of long replies, I don't know if I'll be able to get to all of them. If I haven't addressed one of your points in my responses to other comments, I'm sorry, I'm trying my best. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
