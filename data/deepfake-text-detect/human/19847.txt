I believe that gay rights movements deter the "gay agenda" because by calling them gay rights or gay marriage that automatically and subconsciously segregates gay people from any other regular humans. I believe it would be much more efficient if people fought for the idea that: HumanCivil rights should apply and extend to any human or citizen despite race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. Basically, change my view that having and fighting for "gay rights" and "gay marriage" are necessary or more efficient than just humancivil rights.
