Cool little place I discovered while I was opening an account at PNC Bank that is across the street. Food is really good and the prices are unbeatable. The panini's are great and the wraps are not half bad either. I got way more than what I paid for and felt like it was a great value. I spoke with the owner who was behind the counter and he seems like a very nice guy. The guy in front of me in line apparently had his order messed up and the owner was kind enough to fix it and give it to him free of charge. Cool little local place and a great way to support local businesses. They have no seating. The owner told me when he bought the building, the Crazy Mocha coffee shop that is next door bought the bathrooms so because of health codes, he is not allowed to have seating. TAKE OUT ONLY!!
