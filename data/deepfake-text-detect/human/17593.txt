As stated above, I see nothing wrong with giving corporations my personal information. In fact, I enjoy it. 1. It means I'll get fitted ads presented on webpages rather than a random collection ads that I don't care about. 2. It means I'll be able to connect with people I would never meet in real life that have similar interests. 3. It means I'll receive traffic information that is relevant to me when I travel to and from work. I've seen arguments that speak of a McCarthy-esque witch hunt that will occur in the near future based on the information government intelligence agencies collect but I just do not see that happening. How will my name, location history, searches, contacts, interests... things that we give away ALREADY, be used against me in some cataclysmic event in the near future? Yes, the information gathering of government agencies may be rather extensive but in the end just leads to greater national security. This is information we willingly give away to social media sites already and I truly don't have a problem with the government having this information. CMV Hello, users of CMV!
