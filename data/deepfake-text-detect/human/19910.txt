I usually hear the main argument for adopting computer science as a compulsory subject in early school is that it teaches kids to use logic to tackle problems but isn't it already covered by learning mathematics? I see no other compelling reasons for it except that we are living in a software dominated world and learning coding in such early age may become useful for someone later in their lives. Also if you can direct me to studies regarding this matter, that would be great. Sorry about my English. Thanks
