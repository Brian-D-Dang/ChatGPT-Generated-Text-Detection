Now I am not saying people don't have real mental problems which they need help with or that it is not a serious issue. But the idea of a "chemical imbalance" I have seen no evidence of. What Chemical (s)? Do the drugs prescribed to them contain those "chemicals"? And so correct the "imbalance." Please show me the tests done to prove this. I see no reason to drug people with mental problems. They should be helped yes. But the best way I can see to help them would be through listening and talking. Helping them with their problems in life. Not giving them drugs which only seem to numb the problem. I invite you to kindly CMV Edit: I am not in this post trying to put an argument that no one has ever received any results from taking drugs. But simply the Chemical Imbalance theory. Based on the researched I have just done seems inconsistent. Science isn't inconsistent. Guessing is inconsistent. Again I ask you kindly CMV. With scientific evidence when possible
