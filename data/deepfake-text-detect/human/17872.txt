This question is really directed towards the classic long-hours high-stress high-pay jobs. The people who say they spend barely any time with family "for the sake of my family" when they have something over 7 figures saved up. Emphasis on financially successful: Some people work long hours because they can't afford not too. And there are (rare, usually involving family issues) good reasons why a rather substantial income might still be insufficient despite good financial habits. This CMV is not about those people. (Though some people claim they need the money when that's not true, or wouldn't be true if they put a modicum of effort towards saving). I also want to say that I'm not saying there's anything wrong with liking your career more than your family. You can like both! But time spent reflects priorities to a certain degree. With that out of the way, what I'm trying to say is that there's no such thing as a "gilded cage." If you work long long hours and have accrued lots of wealth, but feel stressed and unhappy it would be irrational and absurd not to re-orient your career in a much less stressful direction that allowed more free time. To change my view, you would have to give a reason why someone who found their career to be fundamentally unfulfilling would still sacrifice far more of their time and health to it than the typical person just because of the money. Without such a reason, I just cannot believe that such a person, even one who claimed their job was stressful, did not find it more satisfying than whatever else they'd be doing with their time.
