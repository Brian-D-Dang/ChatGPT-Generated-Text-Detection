Reddit is a website, a business, it is the "front page of the internet." This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these will only make reddit a more positive and progressive place to be. I think free speech can flourish without hate speech. I think we can recognize accurately the INTENTION of certain subreddits. Some can be gross, negative or downright morbid but don't have ill intentions but I think its the intention that matters and I feel from the [announcement] that those subreddits with vile intetions will be removed while other "alternative" subreddits will be just fine. I think certain viruses have an intention to spread through the body and I think some subreddits here can be likened to viruses so I can only see a positive outcome when extracting these viruses out of the community.
