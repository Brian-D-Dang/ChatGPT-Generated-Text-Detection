Alternatively, all age restrictions should be flexible and open to change for individual cases. With the exception of legal emancipation, which in the United States is hard to accomplish barring parental abandonment or death due to changes in what the best interests of a minor are. In no other case are laws involving the age of majority bent to allow a minor to legally engage in activities that you must be 18, 21 or older to do. Sure, people will turn a blind eye to things on occasion, 16 year old Grandpa joined the Army in time for WWII, the cool clerks will slip you a pack of cigs for an extra 5 bucks, but ignoring regulations will not make them go away. A 16 year old can bypass the juvenile system and be sent straight adult prison for committing a serious crime such as murder or rape, or having a long history of involvement with the juvenile court system. Why not have a 16 year old star debate team member, honor roll student has a history of being very politically active and informed, why not be waived of the age requirement to vote? Not to imply that adult prisons, or even being involved in the adult court system (which grants rights withheld in the juvenile system) could be considered a privilege, but what is the reasoning behind having age requirements be so concrete for one who abides by the law, and so blurred for one who does not?
