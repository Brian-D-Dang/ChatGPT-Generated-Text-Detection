I am about to graduate from uni with an accounting degree and have plans to travel through Asia for roughly 6 months before I start my graduate position at a Big 4 firm. My graduation ceremony would be half way through my trip and I feel I would gain more value from travelling then I will from shaking the grand chancellors hand and having my photo taken. I have had a number of people I know say that I will regret it and am making a bad decision. My arguments are that I feel the sense of accomplishment from the actual completion of the degree and landing my goal job at my goal firm. I understand that for some people the external recognition of being up in front of an audience of friends, family and strangers is a very rewarding experience, I think I am more internally motivated and the actual achievement is where I find value rather then external recognition. Of course if I was in the country I would definitely be there, its just valuing the two between each other. Edit: Thanks for reaffirming my decision guys! Appreciate it!
