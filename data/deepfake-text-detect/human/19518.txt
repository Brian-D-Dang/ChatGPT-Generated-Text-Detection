When someone is arguing for a position, and they refer to some document instead of explicitly stating what the argument is, they don't convince anyone. Reading through a thread recently, I was trying to follow the arguments of people I disagreed with. Several arguments referred to web pages that were large. It was unclear as to what specific point they were trying to make. If I have to read someone else's works for an hour or two, in order to come to my own conclusions about them, then your argument hasn't really been strengthened. Other arguments wanted me to read some particular author. Specific books (with pages) weren't referenced, so it was unclear as to why I should believe this person's position at all. It felt to me as though they couldn't really express why they felt the way they did, and so wanted me to form my emotions by going through the same process they had gone through. Edit: Thanks for the replies. Nothing here has changed my mind, but I really appreciate the discussion. Many good points and refinements have been brought up. Hello, users of CMV!
