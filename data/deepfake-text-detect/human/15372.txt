For some reason, I really thought I reviewed this already?? Any who! I just recently brought some family members here. Wife and I have been here three other occasions. The casino is fun, can get crowded during the winter! (Snowbirds in town). My only issue, they really don't have a sport book! Or an area were some of us men would like to set back, watch some games, drink some beer, and eat. They do have a small area by the Keno area, but it's not much. Overall we always have a good time here, but we will try out the other casinos just to see how it is.
