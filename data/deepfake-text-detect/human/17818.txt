Lolicon (in my definition at least) is described as sexual attraction to typically hand drawn underage girls. It is similar to CP but as it causes no harm to any child I feel it should be legalized. Before I make a few points on why I think it should be legalized nationwide I will say that it is already legal in my state and a few others. Lolicon is typically a form of hentai that involves underage girlsboys. As I stated above it is comparative to CP but since it causes no harm to a child (which is typically the largest argument against CP) it should be legalized. It is a little absurd that you could be arrested and tried as sex offender for viewing images of FAKE little girls. First off, you can't even prove the age of the girls drawn unless the author states, so beforehand so it is up to the court to decide if it's actually CP or not. This is bad news because a lot of people have a bias and think its disgusting. Nobody should be arrested because they have a harmless fetish (keyword harmless). Edit: I found a map of places in North America where it is legalillegalneutral. Edit2: To clarify, by "hentai" I meant pornographic anime. Edit3: To even further clarify, by "harmless" I mean usually does not cause harm. Loli is harmless just the way air is harmless. You can use air to cause harm but then again you can use everything to cause harm. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
