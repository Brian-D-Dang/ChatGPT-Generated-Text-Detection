Wow. I had a great lunch today at Smoke and left with a big smile on my face. I loved the pork taco with caramelized onions that seemed slow cooked and melded perfectly with the tender pulled pork. Like all the tacos, it was served with lime juice and cilantro. Also had a breakfast taco with housemade chorizo. In short, these tacos are (expletive deleted) delicious. Also tried the macaroni cheese which contains scallions and mascarpone. It was also above average but a tad too salty. My guest also enjoyed the veggie tacos and Apple jalapeno slaw which was lovely. Good service was appreciated. After reading several other reviews, I was worried about the wait but our food arrived in a perfectly feasible ten minutes. Granted, it was between meals around 3 o'clock and we were the only patrons. Once they make updates to a second restroom, they plan to expand downstairs with more tables. Highly recommended for dine in or takeout. Go for the pork tacos, stay for the rest of the very small menu.
