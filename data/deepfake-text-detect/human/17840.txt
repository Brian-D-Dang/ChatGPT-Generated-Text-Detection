There is a lot going around the internet in regards to people being comfortable with their weight. While I think judging someone based on their weight is wrong, at the same time it's a good place to start. People I know who are overweight tend to eat unhealthy and not exercise. You get bullied for being overweight? Go to the gym. Eat healthier. Put some effort in to taking care of your body. Not only will it boost your confidence, but you will feel better about yourself as a whole. I think sizeism shouldn't be a thing. Motivating people to go take care of their bodies properly should be instead. Go ahead, CMV. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
