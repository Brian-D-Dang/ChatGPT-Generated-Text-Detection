So I have been struggling with depression for a while (mostly the effects of being a repressed gay for most of my teen years), been in therapy for a while and I am trying to get over it and be "happy" with myself (I still have no idea what people mean by that sometimes) Anyway my doctor and my therapist sometimes ask me if I want to go on meds since they think they will help me but the idea terrifies me, I just don't see the difference between those drugs and the likes of MDMA and stuff since both screw with your brain chemistry don't they? I am pretty scared of how I will feel on them and if I end up being dependent on them or something. I am worrying that I am just being stubborn and coming across like I know more than the doctors etc. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
