I believe an increase in payroll taxes to cover mandatory maternity leave for all Americans hurts financially responsible people, and is also unfair to people that will never have children. The only people that will benefit from such a tax increase will be irresponsible people that want to have kids without any planning. For responsible people that save for such an event, the government acts as a middleman with no purpose. Personally, I would rather set aside a portion of my own salary, and then draw on that, if needed, when my kids are born, instead of give up a percentage of my wages for THE REST OF MY LIFE to the government. If I wasn't planning on having kids, I would be even more angry, as that tax would give me absolutely no personal benefit of any kind. Why should I subsidize some stranger's child? The argument against that is that taxpayers without children pay for education and roads. But in my opinion, those things do have a tangible benefit to society, and even benefit me personally. Giving individual mothers paid vacations is simply not on par with providing everyone with free education. People in America used to value self-reliance and independence. I shed a little tear when I see a powerful liberal like Obama call for government handholding, and everyone agrees with him! He's very generous with other people's money, isn't he? Please convince me why I should come around to his point of view. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
