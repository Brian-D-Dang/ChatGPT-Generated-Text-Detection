Zippers are made from lots of small interlocking metal or plastic pieces. The pieces allows some flexibility but will still not bend around a very sharp curve. The more durable the zipper the less flexible it will be. A piece of clothing will have to shape around your body as you move. It does this either by being elastic or by folding up in small follicles. A zipper on the other hand can not make small follicles but have to make bigger follicles.','Its because the zipper itself does not shrink, but all the fabric its sewn into does when the garment is washed... This creates a ripple in the zipper that causes the boner" to show. Buy pants with button flies, your life will be better.
