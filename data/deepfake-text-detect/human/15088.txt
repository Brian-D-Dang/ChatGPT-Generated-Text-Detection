4 stars for the price, but overall great service and close to home....and you get a ribbon (girl) or bandana (boy) for your dog! They always do a good job with my dog (Shih tzu) and they pay enough attention that they told me once that my dog had an ear infection. Petsmart always disappointed me with the Way they treated my dog and the sloppy work they do.
