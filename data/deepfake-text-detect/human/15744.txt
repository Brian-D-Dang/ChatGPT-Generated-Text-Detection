The Two Stars are for the servers that try their best. This used to be my favorite place for all special occasions. Not anymore. I went their for my birthday, as they gave a free lobster dinner. The old saying, A Free Meal Tastes Better, only applies to a cheap acquaintance, not me. The Lobster, that my wife shared, was very sad. Their special, a Bone in Filet, was Sizzler Quality, not worth the 60, not worth half the price. The Bread Basket is still one of the best in town. That's about it. It is obvious that this place has either gone corporate, or just like most Las Vegas places on the Strip, does not care about repeat business, and certainly could care less about locals. The last draw was when I wanted to have a special dinner, after my wedding ceremony. We walked in on President's Day, and were told the person in charge of Banquets was off, and only she had the schedule. Holiday, fair enough. The next day I called, and no reply. I called the manager, he couldn't help me. I did not get a call back for four days, by which time, I chose another place. The only reason I am not sending a nasty letter to Corporate is because, first, it will do no good. Second, they will still send me a free lobster dinner for my birthday, and I will give it to my son, to impress some girl. Here's what sums up my feeling; My sister gave us a 200 Palm Gift Card for a wedding gift. I told my wife to take her friends there. NO way will I ever eat there again!!!!! Try Del Frisco's. Much better quality and value, and they want your business. These folks could care less.
