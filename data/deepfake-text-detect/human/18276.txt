I have never put much thought into why I'm not straight. I enjoy being queer (I wouldn't call myself 100 gay). To me, it doesn't matter whether I was "born this way" or became this way. I love being queer. The only downsides come from society's negative view of being gay. To me, it is plausible that there is an element of biology and environmental shaping to our sexual orientation. I actually think if I grew up in a very homophobic environment with few gay people, I might experience more frequentgreater attraction to men than I do now. But I feel a sense of belonging and love for the community and culture I exist in, so my sexuality has flourished in the direction that it did. That doesn't mean it's somehow pathological. To me it's like investigating why someone's favourite colour is blue - is it biologically engrained, or were they socialized to like blue? It's of no harm or consequence for this person to like blue, so why does it matter? I know that example is somewhat reduction, but: if being gay was a choice or a product of socialization, I wouldn't see that as an argument for it's condemnation, because I don't see it as inherently wrong or abnormal. Likewise in the case of a biological origin - it could be argued as a natural, morally neutral variation of human sexuality. The flipside is that the "born this way" argument can lend itself to people condemning homosexuality as a pathological genetic defect. In that way, neither "nature" or "nurture" provide an argument for whether homosexuality is "right" or "wrong." And I don't believe something being "natural" makes it more moral than something else. Our entire lives are lived in "unnatural" fashions, so distanced from nature. Why is it so important to find the cause of homosexuality? Why would nature vs. nurture decide moral vs. amoral?
