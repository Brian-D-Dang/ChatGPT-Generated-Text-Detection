I don't think that the field of holistic medicine is credible. From what I have read and been exposed to it seems like it is a field that suggests using only what is naturally occurring in nature is the best way to deal with an illness. I also got the impression that it denounces modern medicine. Does it? If so, why? Why would holistic, or natural medicine, be the better choice? I also feel like those who are big names in the field are quacks. For example: many people I know that support holistic medicine have copies of Prescription for Natural Cures andor Prescription for Nutritional Healing by James Balch and Phyllis Balch respectively. From what I found from quick research was that James had his medical license revoked some time ago and was involved in supplement recalls that claimed cures for cancers and such. When I looked into those who were making these claims the only ones refuting them had ties to the Balch's. So, all in all, which is better? Both? One or the other? I think modern medicine trumps. Vaccinations and medicines have saved third world populations and drastically reduced the occurrence of many harmful diseases. Our population would not be what it is today without advances in medicine and modern technology, we didn't get this far by going all natural. Take AIDS, HIV and polio, without modern medicine I shudder to think of what the state of people with these ailments would be. Modern medicine is better, hands down, and has credible and proven data to back it up, holisticnatural medicine...not so much. Change my view.
