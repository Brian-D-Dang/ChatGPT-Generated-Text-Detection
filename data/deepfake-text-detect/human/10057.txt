I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that mainly talk about how the other partycandidate would be bad for this country, the ads I have a problem with are endorsed by a political party that used taxpayer money to attack another political party. I think that to use taxpayer to further your own agenda is wrong. I think that instead of using money to fund public dialogues that they can put on public networks, this would allow them to talk about what problems they have with other parties with the the other parties having the ability to respond and rebuttle if they have proof that they are wrong. I am also not that smart so I would love to hear any problems with my logic! CMV reddit Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
