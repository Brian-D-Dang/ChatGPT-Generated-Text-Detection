Being the deputy used to be such a relaxed occupation. Not many problem people around here. Well, there was one, but we- I mean, I hanged him yesterday. You see, the sheriff has been missing for a week now. Ever since he didn't show up for Scarecrow Night I've been worried. Maybe the Outsider knows something? When I asked him, he wouldn't look me in the eye. I'm certain he knows something. And he always carries his sword, I don't know why he would, there isn't any danger around here. Not for proper folks atleast..... As I was out looking for the sheriff today, I found tracks. Bootprints that might belong to the sheriff. I followed them, and they lead me to the abandoned mine just outside town. I could hear soneone yelling from inside, but I didn't dare go in there alone. Where in the heavens name have you gone sheriff? First thing I post here, Thanks for reading
