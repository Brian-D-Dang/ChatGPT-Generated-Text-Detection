Staring at the protest outside, he sighed. The soldiers he hired had refused to shoot peaceful protesters. This was not a small protest, these were many, many people who were on the streets. This Monday just as the ones before. They want things which he spent his life ensuring they were not to get. For their own sake. For the sake of the republic. He dialed a number and gave orders to put more effort into finding the people in charge so they could be given a show trial and be put into psychiatric treatment for their deviant nature. He needed to go somewhere else. Somewhere where he didn't hear the chants: "Wir sind das Volk! Wir sind das Volk!" (For those who don't get it: this is in the last days of the GDR)
