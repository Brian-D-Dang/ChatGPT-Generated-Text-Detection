Conventional wisdom since the Cold War argues that capitalism and democracy are synonymous. I believe that Marxist communism is ultimately more democratic. The public rather than private interests control the means of production. Society is classless, thereby preventing the subjugation and exploitation of one socioeconomic class over the other. Because wealth differences are meaningless in a theoretical communist society, wealthy individuals and institutions would not be able to gain unequal access to elected leaders. I am not a communist nor do I believe it is the best system, but I think the notion that capitalism and democracy are inseparably linked is seriously flawed.
