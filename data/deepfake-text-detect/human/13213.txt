I still don't know who sent me the fruit basket. It might have been Father Willard, maybe Sister Taryn. They know I don't like the usual spread, but they know a guy that grows the biggest red seedless that you've ever seen. I'm thankful they come by as often as they do, they always seem to have the strangest accompaniment. That reminds me, I should probably see if the Father knows anyone with the local animal rescue department. That's..... four times this week I've had barnyard animals strolling through the front door. Maybe it's time I tell someone I've been hearing them talk. It's been rough on me since Patricia left. I do miss the way her hair smelled of lilac when she came to bed at night. I'm still finding auburn strands strewn about my apartment. I should've known better than to say anything the day her and her blonde friend Molly and that scheming Brunette Claire waltzed in and sat at the end of the bar looking for trouble. I don't know how much longer I can deal with this grind, though. We have plenty of regulars, but they rarely seem to order anything and when they do..... well half of the time it's not even liquor. I've spent all week nailing those damn signs to the front door but I can't enforce a 2 drink minimum, maybe I should put up a promotional display instead. I think I'm out nails, though. Well, we'll see how tonight goes. I think that's a customer opening the front door now! Goddammit, it's that fucking duck.
