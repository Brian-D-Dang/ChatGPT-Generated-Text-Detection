Food was excellent. We had two salads they were both great. One was similar to a caeser. It was yummy! The second was the pollo salad. It had chicken, avocado, pine nuts and a lemon dressing. It was my favorite out of the two. We then had a couple pizzas. I must say that all the ingredients were so fresh. It was really good food. The reason for the four stars was our service. While the food came out timely, the server seemed like she disliked her job. She wasn't very friendly and she was often MIA. Took a while to get our check too. Lastly we got desserts and they were great too! I would definitely go back. Hopefully we have a better waitress next time.
