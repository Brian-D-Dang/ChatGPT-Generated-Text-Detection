In many jurisdictions running a game of chance for which money must be paid to enter constitutes running a gambling operation. Gambling tends to be much more heavily regulated and requires a license. If it's at least possible to win through no purchase that often ensures you're not running a gambling operation in the eyes of the law.,That would make it a lottery which is illegal. Sweepstakes and contests are perfectly acceptable to run.
