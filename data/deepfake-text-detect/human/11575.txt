Scientists from the University of California San Diego have developed a method to create neurons. The technique is able to convert astrocytes, the supporting cells in the brain, into neurons, the brain's information processing cells. Using the technique, which is a one-time gene therapy, the researchers were able to permanently reverse Parkinson's symptoms in mice. The mice were cured within three months after a single treatment and remained symptom-free for the rest of their lives.
