I go to the Crown Anchor whenever I'm in the mood for some chicken fingers Chickens don't have fingers! and homemade curry sauce in which to dip them. Yum. The place is dark, which I prefer. They do, indeed, have bangers'n mash on the menu, as well as a Scotch egg (a hardboiled egg wrapped in lightly spiced sausage) and a steak'n kidney pie. If you're hankerin' for the fare of the lovely UK, then this is where you should go. There's only one bit o' beef I got with this place. Due to some sort of.... something.... on their liquor license, you can not order hard likkah at the bar. You have to be seated in the dining area, you have to at least order a plate of fries, and you must have your server bring you said likkah. Kind of a bummer when you've been sitting at the bar with a group of your buddies, and someone has the grand idea of ordering a round of car bombs. Everyone has to get up, go to a table, order some food, wait for the server to bring you your shots.... kind of ruins that whole spur of the moment, Let's do a shot! thing. They do, however, also have sticky toffee pudding. So, basically, go for the food and the beer, but do your drinking elsewhere.
