Let us say a rational action is one that is optimal for achieving a given goal, while epistemic rationality is used to form beliefs that may be considered knowledge to some extent. This distinction is important to me, because I think many people simply form their beliefs rationally. Beliefs are held to achieve a goal, rather than to attain knowledge. Knowledge may be one of their goals, but beliefs formed rationally with other goals in mind are sometimes regarded the same way. To me, it is important to consider the probability that any belief is knowledge and remove the ones that don't qualify at all. Others may not do this, but I still believe they should regard epistemically rational beliefs as more useful and superior. I believe this is an epistemically rational viewpoint to have.
