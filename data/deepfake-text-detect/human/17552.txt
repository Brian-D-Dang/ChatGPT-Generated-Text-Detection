This is Mod post 23. You can read the previous Mod Post by clicking [here] , or by visiting the [Mod Post Archive] in our wiki. In [last week's mod thread] , we detailed a list of planned changes for the subreddit. Today, I would like to give a progress report on what changes have been made. 1) Cleaning up the sidebar STATUS: DONE - see the new sidebar! 2) Removalrevamp of TCMV STATUS: DONE - see "TCMV Tuesdays" 3) Tag threads where OP has not responded yet STATUS: SOON - shouldn't be hard, will come in a few days 4) Require OP to expand their postsbe more descriptiveminimum word count STATUS: DONE - check the new "Submission Rules" section. We will be enforcing this rule to increase the quality of discussion here. 5) Tag threads where OP has had their view changed STATUS: UNDECIDED 6) Alternatively: tag threads with number of awarded deltas STATUS: UNDECIDED 7) Require mod approval for meta posts STATUS: DONE - we have already been enforcing this, but now this is made into a rule. 8) Reducing repeatsimilar questions STATUS: PARTIALLY DONE - we're going to be removing submissions if a very similar post has been made within the past 24 hours. In addition, "Using the wiki page to categorize topics. Possibly add a new mod who could handle this, too." has been DONE. We would like to introduce uJoinedToday, who will be our wiki moderator. We will announce when the wiki is ready to be used, and will also link it in the sidebar. 9) Banning Neutral Posts STATUS: DONE - see the new rule in the sidebar, and an explanation for why in the FAQ section. So, that's 5 out of 9 changes done. 5 and 6 will be decided on very soon and easily done in one easy fix (stay tuned). 8 is very tricky, though, and is something we have to cautiously decide on. Finally, [here are the traffic stats] showing our bestofdepthhub link and our most recent influx of subscribers from AdviceAnimals. Regards, IAmAN00bie and the mod team at rchangemyview.
