I went to Courteney last August 2013 and inquired about a custom sub box for my car. Being that my car is a yaris, I wanted to keep the spare and have a functional trunk. He made a custom box with my specifications and haven't had any problems. He told me the job would take the entire day - that's fine. When the job was done, he gave me a call and asked if I could pick up the car. I couldn't and when he heard that, he offered to drive my car to my house! What amazing customer service. Courteney is friendly and did a great job. I would definitely recommend him to friends and for future stereo install. Thanks bud!
