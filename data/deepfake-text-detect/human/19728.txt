Lately, I've been reading up on the work of a man named [Guy McPherson] , who is of the opinion that global warming will drive humanity to extinction within a few decades. The global temperature is increasing wildly, and in a few years many heavily populated areas will exceed "wet bulb" temperature, meaning they will become so hot that it would be impossible for human life to exist there. These areas would include much of the eastern and south-eastern United States. This would lead to the collapse of much of civilization, and untold numbers of deaths would surely follow. I admittedly don't know much about climate science, and I'm hoping if I did I would be able to dismiss this, but from what I've read, it seems fairly solid. Even the US Navy has predicted an ice-free arctic by 2016, which seems to support the idea that global warming is increasing at an exponential rate. I would really, really like my view on this changed. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.
