Service was below mediocre for this caliber of restaurant. We were sat right next to a party, and ordered exactly the same time, but waited about 30 minutes past their entrees being dropped for ours. I had the meat trio and my wife had the mushroom risotto. The meats were well seasoned, but the churico was overcooked and hard like a rock. The risotto was a bit watery and needed salt badly. Had to request salt since they dont keep it on the table. The waitress must have been hired for her ability to wear a miniskirt, because she was very absent during our over 2hr long meal at this place. The best thing here that we had was the not-so-generous portion of calamari. It was flash fried to perfection and had the best breading I've had in a while. Giving two stars for the extremely slow service, and the underwhelming food. If I'm going to put down 100 per person for dinner, it should be above average in every way. This place fell way short of average.
