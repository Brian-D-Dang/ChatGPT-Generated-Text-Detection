Darkness is the absence of light so it's more like an empty space that light fills. Light exists, it's messureable. Darkness is a void. It's very similar to cold and heat; heat is energy and cold is the absence of that energy, you can build that energy to unlimited heights but there is a limit to how cold it can get," "Now, I'm not an expert, but if we suppose that darkness is the absence of light, and light is relating to electromagnetic radiation visible to the human eye then no, darkness does not exist per se, it is simply a way to describe an area lacking in visible electromagnetic radiation. There is no such need for radiation to allow us to tell if something is dark or is in darkness, we tell just by seeing the lack of light.
