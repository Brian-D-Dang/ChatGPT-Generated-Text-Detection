Over time, I have played all manner of games online. While I have had good and bad experiences from people across the world, I have consistently found myself clashing with Eastern Europeans and other Mediterranean residents, especially in browser based games. This is not limited to one country. Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia, Greece, Israel, Romania, Bulgaria, and especially Turkey have all produced quite a few gamers I simply don't care for. Typically this involves tight nationalism and disdain for outsiders. I have managed to play well with people throughout the rest of the world, so I don't get why the Eastern Europeans I get along with are a rare exception rather than the rule. Convince me that I am wrong, convince me that my experiences have simply been an unfortunate string and that there are positive communities in other games, convince me that even if these traits I see are true, they have a point and are not malicious. Take your pick, anything to dissuade me from recoiling at seeing obvious EE region guild tags when gaming. Even if all you can do is provide examples for one specific country, CMV!
