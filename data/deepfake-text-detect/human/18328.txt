When we say that the genders are equal, we are not saying that they are identical, or even alike. We mean to say that there are no fundamental differences besides the obvious and not-so-obvious physical ones. We mean that they are de jure equal; equal in every respect under the law, not de facto equal, in every possible respect. There are no fundamental psychological, spiritual or mental differences between men and women aside from those affected by differing hormonal processes and cultural gender roles. So, only physical end enforced differences, none that are more than skin deep.
