Heard alot of good things about the place so stopped by on a Saturday for lunch. Definitely one of the higher quality buffets on the strip. 35 for lunch was a bit steep but the ambiance and the presentation of food was great. They had everything from Korean BBQ, Bone marrow, Kale Salads, pizza, eggs benedict, and home cured bacon.:) The selection of food was excellent although the meats that we tried were all a bit on the salty side... The Kale salad, congi, and eggs benedict were my favorite things of the things I tried. The dessert bar had a very wide selection as well and the portions were small enough where you could grab a few different things without having to worry about not finishing. The icecream and the dark chocolate mouse were my favorite desserts. So if you have a big appetite and want to try a lot of different things, this would be a great place to try the Cosmo. The next time I go it will probably be for dinner though. Too much for lunch. Good to take coworkers, friends, customers, family, and a date.
