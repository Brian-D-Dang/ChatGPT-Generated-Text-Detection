Some people would call me an Asian Uncle Tom, but hear me out. A lot of gay people would deny that three's any "racism" in the community. I'm sorry, but practically anything to do with gay men is solely about gay white men. Everything is about beautiful, sexy white men. We're culturally programmed to love and basically find a specific set of features beautifulrelevantor worthy. Just hop onto rgaybros or any of the other gay forums on reddit. Search for "asian" and watch all of the minority complaints roll in. One of my favorites: First, most upvoted answer says it all. Now, I am Chinese looking. That's not to be derogatory in anyway, it's the truth. People call me chinky faced and whatnot. See, most of the dates I've managed to score were because of my Asianness. It's because of people who see me as "exotic" that I'm able to even relieve myself of sexual tension every once and a while. So, CMV. What's so bad about being fetishized if it makes me a little happier throughout my day? I will never look European. I will never have a mainstream face. So why not score with the fetishists? I can make the money, they can adore me. In 2013, are relationships not whatever we choose to make them?
