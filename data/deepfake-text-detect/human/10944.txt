Some berries have adaptations that select for preferential eaters. For instance, many of the fruits we consider'hot peppers' or chili peppers, are primarily dispersed by birds. Where a large mammal might grind up the seeds, or damage the plant during browsing, birds poop them out at great distances. Interestingly, the substance that makes Jalepenos spicy to us, capsaicin, targets a receptor specific to us mammals. Birds, the animals that tend to effectively spread chili peppers, are not sensitive to it, and so do not experience the discomfort. Similarly, the bittersweet, or poisonberry, while poisonous to humans, does not have the same effect on birds, who naturally spread it in its environment. Basically, the poisons aren't universal, but serve to guard the plant against damaging grazers in favor of more helpful ones.
