I don't like to have to win someone over in order to have any sort of relationship with them. I believe that relationships should happen organically, originating from natural attraction and compatibility, and that if you have to win them over now, you're going to have to continue to win them over. Then, when you are unable to win them over later, it takes away the thing that made the relationship in the first place and therefore putting the relationship as a whole in jeopardy, even if the couple is overall a very good match (socio-economic status, interests, sexually, etc.). I do believe that you should flirt and woo and do your best to make them feel desired and cared for. I think that it is a balance of both parties putting effort toward the other that makes a relationship. People need to feel cared for and important. But I think that can be different from having to win someone over. One is directed toward making them feel good, while the other is making yourself look good (selling yourself). When I need to win someone over in order to gain their interest, I am having to compete for your attention, and if I have to compete now, I'm going to have to later. Furthermore, I don't think that having to win someone over while in a relationship is a good thing. IMO, it shows lack of trust and commitment of the other person. I believe that a healthy relationship is founded on mutual trust and compatibility, and primarily commitment to the other person. If you need me to win you over, it shows me that you're not really committed or invested in the relationship. Edit: Thanks for all the opinions, guys! I don't know that I've completely changed my view, but you have definitely made me think about it a lot more in ways I was unable to myself. Sorry I haven't been able to more actively engage in discussion, because I've been at work. I'll try to reply where I can.
