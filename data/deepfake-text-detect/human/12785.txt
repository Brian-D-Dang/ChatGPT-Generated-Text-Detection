"This is what you get! Think you're better than us? Think you can just wall us up in the desert?" Gunfire echoed through Zone 200. Gunfire. How could this happen here? The only people with weapons like that should be the border guards! But here they were, running rampant through the city. Some of us fought back. 200's aren't always pacifists, we believe you can fight for a righteous cause, and some of us enjoy martial arts for their own sake. But we weren't an army. We shouldn't have needed an army, that was the point of the zones. We hardly slowed the invaders down. They rounded us up, marched us out of the zone at gunpoint. Took us to one of the Border Watchpoints. A man dressed in black greeted us as we arrived. He gloated, he told us we were now his slaves, and the other zones would soon fall under his rule. Typical 1 behavior. But I recognized him. I'd seen his face, years ago on the front page of Time Magazine. Jacob Hartford, the man who first proposed the Zones and created the Border Guard. He had planned everything out - a hand-picked force of 200's, guaranteed uncorruptible. The trusted tool that would separate the sheep from the goats and give everyone on earth the community they deserved. That was the group holding us captive. It wasn't just 1's and 2's running amok. The Guard themselves had turned against us. "How could you do this?" I screamed at him. "You had a perfect score! You were the best of us! You all were the best of us!" He looked at me, and he laughed evilly. "You idiots. I was the one giving the tests. You think I couldn't slip my friends the right answers? You fools didn't think that a 1 could be as clever as you 200s? Well, now you're going to pay for that mistake." He laughed evilly again. "After all, I promised I'd give everyone on Earth what they deserve."
