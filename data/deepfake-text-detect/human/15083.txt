We have moved around the country a bit recently, and have found ourselves utilizing Yelp reviews pretty frequently to find the good local places when we move to a new area. Auto repair is one of those categories that you pretty much end up choosing between a bunch of places with 1-3 star reviews, and hoping for the best. So imagine my delight when we needed some work done shortly after moving to Charlotte and seeing a garage with ONLY 5 star reviews. Almost too good to be true, but it ended up being true for us. We took out SUV to Neighborhood garage needing new brakes, and hoping to figure out what was causing a troublesome vibration coming from the engine. I met Andy when I dropped the car off after hours and was immediately impressed with the level of attention and genuine interest he gave to the description I gave him. He actually stopped the work he was doing and got a piece of paper and pen to take down notes about my situation. The problem ended up being a pretty tough nut to crack. Luckily I was able to leave my car with Andy long enough for him and his team (working late on my car several times) to figure it out. We were EXTREMELY relieved to learn that the problem was a tricky but inexpensive motor mount. Andy had it fixed the next day, and only charged for the part for that portion of the work. In other words, he and several of his employees worked for several hours on several different day trying to diagnose the issue, and didn't charge a dime for any of it. Andy is extremely friendly, very responsive, and engaged when dealing with you. I find myself keeping a list of little nuisance issues I have been putting off having fixed just to be able to give Andy our work. I really can't overstate how happy we are to have found such a great place to go to for the type of stuff we've always dreaded until now. Andy and Neighborhood Garage will have our business and anyone else who asks us for as long as we live in Charlotte.
