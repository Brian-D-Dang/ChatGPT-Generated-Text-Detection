I had a good dining experience here at Mesa, which makes me more confident that Bobby Flay is actually legit in those Throwdowns:) If you get the opportunity to come, the tamales (corn and shrimp) and his margaritas (if you like alcohol) are the two MUSTS. Both were really good. I usually don't like tamales (no offense, maybe I've only had bad ones) because they are always so dry, but this one was moist and full of flavor. The corn was the perfect accompaniment too. As for the margarita, you can custom-create your own from their list of tequilas or choose a concocted mix. I had the white peach margarita which was fantastic. We had the chicken with sweet potato hash and the steak and egg. The first is very unique and very Bobby. It's a little spicy, and it is basically two huge mounds of chicken and hash mixed together. Very creative. The steak and egg was more traditional; you pretty much just make your own fajitas from guacamole, sour cream, egg, peppers, etc. Also good (although not spectacular) because of the fresh ingredients. Service was slow, although our server apologized because it was really busy. I would return, but not before I try other places on the strip.
