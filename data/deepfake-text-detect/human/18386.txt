Don't get me wrong, I'm completely behind having the Paralympics as a secondary event after the Olympics. But I just get quite annoyed, especially here in the UK, when it became almost taboo to see them as anything but totally equal events, and gold medals in each as equal achievements, people calling for Knighthoods if someone had the same number of gold medals as Sir Chris Hoy or Sir Bradley Wiggins (6 5). I feel this is wrong for pretty much one reason: the level volume of competition. There are 2-4 billion able-bodied cyclist in the world, and 100's of 1000's of people who compete in cycling events. Then look at Paralympic cycling, there are quite a few disabled cyclists, but when its broken down into all the classifications, how many no-legged cyclists are there, for example? Maybe dozens, who are looking to compete, maybe 100's tops. Being the best of 100,000 is in a completely different league to being the best out of 100. If you were blinded right now, and started tandem cycling training, as opposed to if you simply started able-bodied track cycling right now, in 5 years, would it be more likely that you could win a Paralympic Gold Medal, or an Olympic Gold Medal? I know both would be unlikely, but as a comparison? A Paralympic medal is still a great achievement, and some of stories are really good, and I know its better than anything I'll ever do, I just don't think its the same as an Olympic medal, like most of the media and the public seem to think. Me and my brother actually quite upset my mum a while back with this argument, am I wrong? CMV (Edit: just some grammar, and the question about the 5 years training)
