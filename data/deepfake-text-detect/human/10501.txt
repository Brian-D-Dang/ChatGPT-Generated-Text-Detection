It's an authorization for the charge. It's how they prove they didn't just run your card without telling you, or that you actually agreed to pay for the things. It's not really an identity-verifying step, it's more like a contract-related step.,Because then they still have a record of it and if someone says "I didn't buy that" and the signatures don't match, they know it was a fraudulent charge.', "Oh, they are probably meant to check it, lol. I've been turned down before from certain organizations because it didn't match the card signature (boss would send me out with his card to buy work things often). Some banks (at least where I am) have already removed signatures as an option and now require a pin code only though, so most likely won't be dealing with signatures much longer.,Amex, Discover and MasterCard have stated that they are no longer going to require signatures for any purchases.
