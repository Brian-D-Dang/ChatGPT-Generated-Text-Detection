I really enjoyed Spiderman 3 and I don't understand why it gets so much hate. I really enjoyed the Tobey Maguire Spiderman movies, and the third one is a movie I keep coming back to. Okay the, whole dance scene was a little cringe worthy for me, but I thought the ending was awesome. When Peter killed Venom with the sound from the pipes, it had me on the edge of my seat and I thought it was sweet. And the fight between Sandman and Peter in the subway was equally as cool. Everyone likes to rip on this movie but I think it's pretty goddam good to be honest. Definitely not even coming close to one of my favorite movies, but I overall enjoyed it and have watched it over again a few times. Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.
