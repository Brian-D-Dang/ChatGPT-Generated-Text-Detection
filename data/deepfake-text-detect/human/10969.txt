Two time donor here. Each time I was back to my normal activities, ice hockey, in two weeks, at doctors direction. It has now been fourteen and twelve years since my donations and there are no lingering ill effects.', "I'm not sure where you're hearing this from, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to me. While not an expert, I've been a volunteer for OneMatch, which is Canadian Blood Service's bone marrow registry. Increasingly, people are not required to give actual bone marrow as certain treatments can get by just using stem cells. Donors in this category simply give blood and then the stem cells are extracted. Traditional bone marrow donations do still continue. Doctors take marrow out of the pelvic bone using a needle. It should not be a career killer in sports. There's about a 1-2 recovery in the hospital (mostly recovering from the General), followed by about 2-4 weeks of soreness.," "I've read about a case that I think you're talking about. There was an elite athlete who was training for a major event, when he learned he was a match for someone who needed the donation right away. So he donated, which made him miss the sporting event. In that situation, he was an athlete operating at the most elite level and having to stop training to go for testing and to have the bone marrow removed was enough to derail his training. At that level, and that close to the event, he couldn't miss the several weeks of training that he needed to miss in order to donate.
