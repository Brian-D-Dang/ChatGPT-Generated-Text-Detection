Being transgender and wanting surgeryhormonal treatment is being so uncomfortable with yourself as a person that you need invasive surgery, or completely body-altering hormonal treatment to feel comfortable. I think that the only reason we don't define it as that is political correctness, combined with the stigma around mental illness. Transgender people don't want to be lumped in with other people with mental illnesses because there is a such a stigma against it. And if society starts treating transgender people as having no mental issue, and accepting invasive surgery as the standard treatment then that will slow research towards less drastic treatments. Ideally, in the future, if someone were to come into a doctor's office and say "I feel so bad in my current body that I want hormonal treatment and invasive surgery" the doctor would be able to prescribe something that would just make the transgender person no longer feel terrible in their current body.
