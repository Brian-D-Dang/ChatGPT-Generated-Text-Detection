I recently got married. One of our wedding gifts was a [Pampered Chef can opener] . Thus, my trusty old' can opener] was kicked to the curb. This new product operates a little differently than a conventional can opener. Whereas a conventional can opener cuts on the top surface of the can, the PC one cuts on the outside surface. It's a novel approach, to be sure, but it has several critical disadvantages in my opinion: 1) Using a conventional can opener, the operator's hands are oriented in a more natural position with the thumbs up. The operation of the PC can opener requires me to twist my wrists so that one hand is over the other. This is uncomfortable. 2) With a conventional can opener, the cut is readily visible during operation. The operator can see the progress of the cut and stop at precisely the right moment; even leaving the lid barely attached like a flap. The PC can opener cuts on the side of the can, beneath the operators hands and out of view. The operator has no strong indication as to when the cut is complete. 3) Once the can is open, the lid has the same diameter as the can, so it can not be dropped into the bottom of the can for ease of disposal. In conclusion, I find my old can opener to be a far superior product. I want to embrace this new technology, but I really hate this fucking can opener! CMV.
