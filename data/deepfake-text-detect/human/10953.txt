Newtons second law. You need something outside whatever you're in to push off of (like how cars use the friction of the tires and the road) or else at the same time you are pushing the same force in the opposite direction. You could however roll something from inside to make it move. If you were in a giant ball you could use inertia of your body to make it start to roll from withing.,Because of equalopposite reactions. When you normally push an object, you also push into the floor with your feet with an equal (net) force in the opposite direction. If the floor is part of the same object, then you cancel out your forces and do nothing.', "When you push, you're putting yourself between the thing you want to move, and something you want to push against (such as the ground). Since every action has an equal and opposite reaction, you're actually pushing the two objects apart. If you are in the object and push on it, your hand is pushing it one way while your butt (or feet or whatever) are pushing it the other way. You're trying to push it apart from itself. So it doesn't go anywhere it just stretches a bit.," "You actually could. If you were in a large tube in space and pushed against one end of the tube, you would float towards the other end of the tube, and the tube would be moving through space in the opposite direction. The tube would continue moving until you hit the other end, at which isn't the forces would cancel out and you would come to a stop.
