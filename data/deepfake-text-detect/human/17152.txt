Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT) systems track targets across cameras. Due to the continuity of target trajectories, tracking systems usually restrict their data association within a local neighborhood. In single camera tracking, local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames; in multi-camera tracking, it refers to neighboring cameras that the target may appear successively. For similarity estimation, tracking systems often adopt appearance features learned from the re-identification (re-ID) perspective. Different from tracking, re-ID usually does not have access to the trajectory cues that can limit the search space to a local neighborhood. Due to its global matching property, the re-ID perspective requires to learn global appearance features. We argue that the mismatch between the local matching procedure in tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may compromise MTMCT performance. To fit the local matching procedure in MTMCT, in this work, we introduce locality aware appearance metric (LAAM). Specifically, we design an intra-camera metric for single camera tracking, and an inter-camera metric for multi-camera tracking. Both metrics are trained with data pairs sampled from their corresponding local neighborhoods, as opposed to global sampling in the re-ID perspective. We show that the locally learned metrics can be successfully applied on top of several globally learned re-ID features. With the proposed method, we report new state-of-the-art performance on the DukeMTMC dataset, and a substantial improvement on the CityFlow dataset.
