Virtually every story about a Muslim committing a crime has people claiming that Muslims should be kicked out of their countries and basically considering them subhuman. Everyone is painted by the same brush. The same tired, easy, epithets are hurled around (religion of peace lol) aimed at discouraging intelligent discourse as to why problems might exist. Look at this thread: The top comment is justifying blindly segregating part of society just to prevent any possible negative effects of multiculturalism. I fail to see how this is different than preventing non-white people moving into white neighborhoods to preserve property values. Ostracizing whole segments of people because you are afraid that they might inconvenience your little bubble of societal perfection just perpetuates more xenophobia and hatred. I am an American Muslim, and reading through rworldnews is incredibly disheartening.
