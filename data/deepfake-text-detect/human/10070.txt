Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out. Vietnam was essentially a communist state, due to influences from China and USSR, which were alliances (the former is debatable) of Vietnam during the war. After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best. I understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed. The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today. And what had the sole communist party in my country done? Nothing but left our people in the struggle of a third-world country. And China is still brazenly harassing our borders and seas to this very day, just because our army is incapable of standing up for themselves. Please tell me if I was wrong and why the North won was a good idea. Edit: My view has changed. It was not simple as I thought it was. Generally it can be summarized into those points: involvement of China, motives and war crimes committed by the US, and there was no hope in the governing system. Communism has not helped our people a bit, but no one can really advocates for America either. We as a nation should look to develop our own path. Insights are still very much appreciated. And thanks for the discussions.
