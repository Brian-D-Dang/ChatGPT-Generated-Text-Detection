This opinion came about mostly in relation to drugs, but I think it applies to nearly all walks of life. It's totally unfair to judge someone for smoking weed if you have never tried it yourself (for those who read that sentence and write me off as an rtrees idiot, I've tried it, but I don't smoke). You don't have any personal experience on which to form your opinion. For all you know, it's nothing like what you're judging. This line of reasoning can also be applied to music. It's amazing how many people judge Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus' music without really listening to it. I'm not saying they're great artists, but imagine their fans telling you the Beatles suck even though they've never heard a Beatles song. Totally unjustified. Where it's impossible to go through similar experiences (Men judging women for abortions, for example) I feel that you can form opinions about the act, but not the people doing it. I'm eager to hear your perspectives on the matter. We'll see if you can CMV. EDIT: When it comes to crimes like rape, murder, etc. What is being judged is the effect these have had on other people, which we can relate to because we are all people. I think it would be unfair to judge people for having murderous or sexual thoughts until they act on them.
