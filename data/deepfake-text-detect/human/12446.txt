Failed leadership candidate Lisa Duffy was having dinner with her staff in Bournemouth on Friday. No action was taken against the curry house, which had completed pre-employment checks. UKIP has long campaigned for tougher border controls to cut illegal immigration. Jay Beecher, a spokesman for Ms Duffy, said: "Watching our chef running away into the night, his apron flapping in the wind, was a surreal moment. "Politics can sometimes be such a stale and serous affair, so you have to see the funny side of things. "In this case too, I couldn't help [but] be tickled by the irony." The Border Agency questioned staff about their right to work and live in the UK. Diane James was elected ahead of Ms Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage as the UKIP's new leader on Friday.
