Elon Musk tweeted out the video from the camera attached to SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket as it aborted the plan to land on the landing pad and instead stabilized just in time to make a water landing. Evidently, if the rocket is not confident that it can land correctly on the pad it will go for a safer landing over the water like in this video.
