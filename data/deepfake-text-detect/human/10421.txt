From The majority of sexual assault are not reported to the police (an average of 68 of assaults in the last five years were not reported).1 Those rapists, of course, will never spend a day in prison. But even when the crime is reported, it is unlike to lead to an arrest and prosecution. Factoring in unreported rapes, only about 2 of rapists will ever serve a day in prison. I think the conviction rate of sexual assault is woeful in this country. It is so difficult to make a successful criminal case against a rapist that: - Rape culture is highly prevalent and rapists feel they can get away with it, and intimidate their victim into silence - Victims of rape have no confidence they will even be listened to, never mind getting a successful conviction For these reasons, I think the system should change: - When somebody makes an accusation of rape, it should be up to the accused to prove their innocence. Until they have done this, they should be considered guilty. The accused's details should be publicized in this time, so the public is protected from them - Rape cases should be fast tracked through the legal system, which not only streamlines the process, but shortens the time until the rapist is in prison, again this protects the public Implementing these changes will give victims so much more confidence when reporting the crime, and it will make rapists think twice before they go ahead with their actions. I have considered the possibility of a small amount innocent people going to jail for rape, but if these changes help send more real rapists to prison, then surely the benefit to society outweighs any minor problems that may arise. I have been told I'm extreme for thinking this, but nobody has presented to me a compelling reason why it's a bad idea. Please change my view! Edit: I have awarded deltas to uAftercourse and uDaKahuna. My view is certainly changed, and I realize now that a lot of injustices would come from my proposed changes.
