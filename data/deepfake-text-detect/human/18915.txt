The concept of minimum wage violates the principle of equality of rights. It only guarantees a minimum income for employees, but not for freelancers and small entrepreneurs. Why? What is so special about employees? Why do they deserve a privilege that other types of workers don't deserve? It is a common myth that the typical entrepreneur is rich and privileged, but that only applies to a small number of entrepreneurs. Most of them actually live more precariously than the typical employee. In effect, the minimum wage is subsidizing a lifestyle choice and penalizing other lifestyle choices. If it is a desirable goal to give a minimum income to workers, then it should be given to ALL workers, regardless of whether they are formally employed or not. Employers should be free to pay below minimum wage, and in those cases the government should "top up" the wages. As for freelancers, they are already required to report their income for tax purposes, so they could receive a similar "top up" in the form of a negative tax, if their income is below the minimum.
