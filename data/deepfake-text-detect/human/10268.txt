Oat blenders. Mini spooners. Coco roos. Honey Scooters. You know them. You see them in the cereal section of any grocery store. They are in giant bags in a metal bin right next to the boxed cereals. Far too often, these bagged cereals are breezed past and not rightfully regarded as the most superior way to purchase cereal. Price - Cant beat it. Per unit weight, they are far cheaper than their boxed counterparts. Freshness - Fresh to death. The bags all come with a resealable spout, much like a ziploc bag. Squeeze all the air out, reseal, and you are ready for the next day. Taste - Admittedly, they are not superior in taste to boxed counterparts. But they are indistinguishable. Environmental - Bagged cereals use less than half the packaging of boxed cereals. Quantity - Get a lot more, which prevents you from having to worry about breakfast for much longer. Hilarity - I snicker to myself every day that I pour myself a bowl of apple zings. Never once chuckled at a box of applejax. Edit - Some good points about selection and variety. Maybe I should have rephrased my title better to reflect that bagged cereals are better than their boxed counterparts. I want to reward people for their good points, but I don't know if deltas are the best way to do it as my view was not changed.
