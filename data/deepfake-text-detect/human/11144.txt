That's a misconception: what we observe is that all points are expanding from all points. From Earth it looks like everything is moving away from us, but from anywhere else it looks the same way, too. Since we haven't found an "edge" or "center" of the universe, there's no absolute way to reference any point in relation to the universe itself. The best we can do is reference a point in relation to some other point (distance from Earth, from the Sun, from our galaxy, etc.). The simple illustration I have read a lot is to draw dots on the surface of a balloon and inflate it. All the dots move apart from each other, and on the surface of the balloon itself, that expansion is uniform: it's not one part of the rubber expanding out, but rather the whole thing expanding.
